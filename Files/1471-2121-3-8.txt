                    Background        Transforming growth factor beta TGF family proteins        are multifunctional cytokines capable of regulating cell        growth extracellular matrix protein synthesis and immune        cell functions      Hyaluronidase is an extracellular        matrixdegrading enzyme Interestingly malignant and        metastatic breast and prostate cancer cells frequently        overexpress both hyaluronidase and TGF proteins                Previously we have shown that bovine testicular        hyaluronidase also known as PH increases the        susceptibility of various cancer cells to tumor necrosis        factor TNF or TNF cytotoxicity      review PH        induces the expression of proapoptotic p    and WOX        WW domaincontaining oxidoreductase also known as WWOX or        FOR     which contributes to the increased TNF        cytotoxic effect PHinduced downregulation of the        extracellular matrix interinhibitor is also associated        with the enhanced TNF cytotoxicity            TGF family proteins including  and  induce        TNFresistance and suppress the PH effect of increasing        TNF cytotoxicity in murine L fibroblasts             TGF induces a novel extracellular matrix protein that        prevents TNFmediated cell death and blocks the activation        of extracellular signalregulated kinase ERK also known        as p mitogenactivated protein kinase p MAPK in        L cells      Additionally TGF induces the        expression of TIAF TGFinduced antiapoptotic factor           and TIF TGFinduced factor     that inhibit        TNF cytotoxicity Whether these TGFinduced proteins        restrict the ability of PH to increase TNF cytotoxicity        is unknown        PH blocks TGFmediated growth suppression of        epithelial cells      Additionally PH rapidly        activates ERK in L cells and TGF reduces the        PHinduced ERK activation     In contrast TGF        synergistically increases PHmediated inhibition of        staurosporine apoptosis     Thus PH and TGF are        physiological antagonists for only certain cellular        responses        Hyaluronidases Hyal and Hyal play a critical role in        cancer invasion and metastasis       although        inactivation of         HYAL gene has been shown in head and        neck squamous cell carcinomas     Hyal also known        as Luca is a lysosomal enzyme that is secreted from        cells Hyal is a candidate tumor suppressor             although it enhances extravasation and metastasis of        prostate cancer cells     Also mutations in Hyal may        contribute to the pathogenesis of a lysosomal disorder        mucopolysaccharidosis IX     Hyal is a lysosomal        protein which is active at low pH     This protein is        also known to be a glycosylphosphatidylinositol        GPIanchored cellsurface receptor for jaagsiekte sheep        retrovirus            Testicular hyaluronidase PH counteracts        TGFinduced TNFresistance in L cells     The        goal of the present study was to examine whether lysosomal        Hyal and Hyal enhance TNF cytotoxic function and        counteract TGFmediated TNFresistance in L cells It        was determined that stable expression of murine Hyal in        L cells increased their sensitivity to TNFmediated        death whereas Hyal was somewhat less effective TGF        blocked this increased sensitivity In contrast Hyal and        Hyal did not enhance L cell death by anticancer drugs        such as daunorubicin actinomycin D staurosporine and        camptothecin Overexpressed Hyal and Hyal induced the        expression of proapoptotic WOX but not p suggesting a        role of WOX in the increased cellular susceptibility to        TNF cytotoxicity Additional mechanisms that are associated        with the increased TNF cytotoxicity were also        investigated                    Results        As summarized in Figure  PH induces the expression        of proapoptotic p and WOX     and downregulates        antiapoptotic matrix interinhibitor     thereby        enhancing TNF susceptibility in L cells Also PH        rapidly activates ERK and cJun         N terminal kinase JNK and JNK            Whether these signaling events lead to induction of        p and WOX is unknown        In contrast TGF protects L cells from TNF        cytotoxicity by upregulating the expression of        antiapoptotic TIAF TIF and a novel matrix protein               TGF blocks PHincreased TNF        susceptibility     Likewise PH inhibits        TGFinduced TNFresistance     TGF suppresses        PHmediated ERK activation     however the ERK        activation is not related with PHincreased TNF        susceptibility in L cells     Whether the        proapoptotic p and WOX block the function of        antiapoptotic TIAF and TIF is not known In this study        experiments were designed to determine whether lysosomal        Hyal and Hyal enhance TNF cytotoxic function and        counteract TGFmediated TNFresistance in L        cells        The fulllength murine hyaluronidase         Hyal and         Hyal cDNAs were found in the EST        database GenBank accession AA and BF        respectively and the determined DNA sequences have been        deposited in the GenBank          Hyal  AF         Hyal  AF The         Hyal cDNA encodes a aminoacid        protein which has  identity to a reported murine        sequence AF     Differences in the protein        sequences are Gly Gly and Cys in our Hyal        protein compared to Arg Glu and Arg in        AF Transitions in these amino acid residues are        nonconservative        The murine         Hyal cDNA AF encodes a        aminoacid protein The deduced protein sequence is        identical to a reported murine sequence AF but has        an Ile to Val transition compared to another clone        AF Variation in the protein sequence is also found        in a murine Hyal homologue NP     which        possesses three unique   and aminoacid segments        not identical to the above Hyal proteins        L cells were engineered to stably express GFPHyal        or GFPHyal fusion proteins The presence of these        proteins in these cells was demonstrated in Western        blotting using antiGFP antibody data not shown        Exogenous bovine testicular hyaluronidase PH stimulates        rapid activation of cJun         N terminal kinases JNK and JNK        in L cells     In contrast the stably expressed        Hyal and Hyal could not mediate constitutive activation        of JNK and JNK in L cells data not shown        Exposure of the Hyalexpressing L cells to TNF for         hr resulted in increased cell death by         compared to the control GFPexpressing cells Fig         These results are similar to the bovine testicular        PHincreased TNF cytotoxicity of L cells     In        contrast there were no significant differences in the        extent of cell death when GFPHyal and control        GFPexpressing cells were exposed to staurosporine        actinomycin D daunorubicin or camptothecin for  hr        Fig         There was also an increased susceptibility to TNF        cytotoxicity in the Hyalexpressing L cells        approximately  increase also see Fig  compared        to the GFP control cells However there were no        significant differences among these cells in the extent of        death caused by staurosporine actinomycin D daunorubicin        and camptothecin data not shown        In similar experiments the effect of transient        expression of Hyal and Hyal on cellular sensitivity to        anticancer drugs was examined L cells were        electroporated with the GFPHyal or GFPHyal construct        cultured for  hr and then exposed to actinomycin D        daunorubicin or camptothecin for  hr There were no        differences in cell death in these Hyal and        Hyalexpressing cells compared to control cells data        not shown These findings are consistent with the results        for stable transfectants presented above Fig         Bovine testicular PH enhances TNF sensitivity in L        cells by increasing the expression of proapoptotic p and        WOX      The ability of Hyal and Hyal to induce        the expression of p and WOX in L cells was examined        L cells were electroporated with nothing null GFP        GFPHyal or GFPHyal constructs and cultured for  hr        Transient expression of GFPHyal or GFPHyal in L        cells induced WOX expression whereas no WOX expression        was observed in nontransfected cells or control        GFPexpressing cells Fig A The kDa band is        fulllength WOX while the kDa band is a degraded WOX            No detectable p expression was observed in these        cells Fig A        In comparison the cytosolic WOX  kDa was        constitutively expressed in the L cells stably        transfected with the GFPHyal construct while TNF        reduced WOX expression in a timedependent manner Fig        B This reduction is probably due to TNFmediated WOX        nuclear translocation from the mitochondria     In        contrast WOX was not expressed in L cells stably        transfected with the GFPHyal construct and TNF induced        WOX expression in  min Fig B TNF did not induce        WOX expression in the control GFPexpressing cells Fig        B        Whether Hyal enhances the apoptosisinducing function        of WOX was determined In transient transfection        experiments L cells were electroporated with GFPHyal        andor WOX constructs GFPHyal enhanced WOXmediated        L cell death as determined  hr posttransfection        using crystal violet staining Fig C In contrast        GFPHyal did not enhance WOXmediated cell death Fig        C GFPHyal and GFPHyal alone did not mediate cell        death Fig C        Next the effect of TNFmediated IB degradation and        NFB activation was examined in both Hyal and Hyal        cells The GFPHyal and GFPHyal stable transfectants        and control cells were exposed to TNF for various times        IB degradation and NFB activation or NFB nuclear        translocation were observed at  to  min in Hyal        cells post TNF stimulation but at the  min time point in        both control and Hyal cells Fig         To further understand how Hyal participates in the        apoptosis pathway the translocation of Hyal to the        mitochondria was examined during cell death Transient        expression of GFPHyal in COS fibroblasts showed the        localization of the expressed protein in the lysosome but        not in the mitochondria as determined by staining the        cells using LysoTracker and Mitotracker Red data not        shown These observations are consistent with other        reports      COS cells are TNFresistant The        reasons for using this cell type are its large size which        provides better resolution under fluorescence microscopy        and the ease of transfection and gene expression using        liposomebased reagents such as FuGene  and GeneFector        Exposure of the GFPHyalexpressing COS cells to        staurosporine for inducing apoptosis resulted in a        timerelated increase in colocalization of GFPHyal with        the mitochondria Fig  suggesting that a portion of        GFPHyal migrates to the mitochondria during        apoptosis        Next whether TGF antagonizes the function of Hyal        and Hyal in growth regulation was examined TGF        inhibits epithelial cell growth but promotes fibroblast        growth     TGF inhibition of epithelial cell growth        is blocked by bovine testicular PH     In agreement        with our previous observations     TGF promoted        L cell growth by approximately  in  hr Fig         However TGF did not promote the growth of L cells        stably expressing Hyal or Hyal Fig         Finally the functional antagonism between TGF and        Hyal or Hyal in regulating TNF susceptibility in L        cells was examined The Hyal and Hyal stable        transfectants were pretreated with TGF for  hr and then        treated with TNF overnight Both Hyal and        Hyalincreased TNF cytotoxicity were suppressed by TGF         Fig  However TGF blocked TNF cytotoxicity        of the GFPexpressing control cells to a greater extent         Fig                     Discussion        In this study the novel function of the lysosomal        hyaluronidases Hyal and Hyal in increasing cellular        sensitivity to TNF cytotoxicity is reported TGF        counteracted Hyal and Hyalincreased TNF killing of        L fibroblasts TGF increased L growth while        Hyal and Hyal blocked this enhancement of cell growth        These observations are consistent with our previous finding        that exogenous bovine testicular hyaluronidase PH        enhances TNF cytotoxicity in various cancer cells and that        TGF blocks the increased TNF cytotoxicity      As        summarized in the Figure  the underlying mechanisms        whereby Hyal induces TNF cytotoxicity appear to be        associated with  Hyal induction of the proapoptotic        WOX  Hyal migration to the mitochondria during        apoptosis and  the prolonged period of IB degradation        and NFB activation in TNFtreated Hyalexpressing        cells        Upregulation of p and WOX contributes in part to        the PHenhanced cytotoxic function of TNF              WOX is a pbinding protein Ectopic expression of both        p and WOX cDNA constructs results in colocalization of        these proteins in the mitochondria     Increased        synthesis and complex formation between p and WOX in the        cytoplasm are observed during apoptosis     Both p        and WOX mediate apoptosis synergistically Overexpressed        WOX alone mediates apoptosis independently of p            However p apoptosis requires the participation of WOX        Blocking WOX expression with antisense mRNA abolishes        pmediated cell death suggesting that WOX is a        potential partner of p in apoptosis             Both Hyal and Hyal induced WOX expression when        transiently expressed in L cells However only Hyal        induced WOX expression following stable transfection of        L cells This correlates with the greater extent of        Hyal enhancement of TNF killing compared to Hyal WOX        expression was induced by TNF in the Hyal stable        transfectant In transient transfection experiments Hyal        enhanced WOXmediated L cell death while Hyal had no        effect Both Hyal and Hyal alone failed to induce cell        death Thus induction of WOX expression contributes in        part to Hyal and Hyalincreased TNF sensitivity in        L cells        TNF rapidly induces phosphorylation of IB which        normally peaks at  min followed by        proteasomedependent degradation  min             IB degradation and NFB activation occurred as        determined  min after exposure of control and Hyal        cells to TNF However there was an extended period of        TNFmediated IB degradation and NFB activation in        Hyal cells ranging from  min It is unclear whether        this extend ed period of IB degradation and NFB        activation directly contributes to the ability of Hyal to        enhance TNFmediated apoptosis IB is a physiological        inhibitor of NFB activation IB complexes with NFB        and prevents its translocation to the nucleus             NFB activation is believed to induce antiapoptotic        proteins to block cell death     However in several        studies activated NFB cannot protect cells from apoptosis            Also NFB appears to be essential in the        pmediated apoptosis in tested cell lines            The mitochondrion is a reservoir of proapoptotic        proteins and plays a key role in apoptosis              reviews One of the pathways that leads to the release of        proapoptotic proteins in the mitochondria has been        determined For example the TNFTNF receptorsignaling        complex activates caspase  which leads to the activation        and cleavage of Bid a proapoptotic protein of the Bcl        family Activated or truncated Bid tBid in turn activates        Bak and Bax Bak migrates to the mitochondrial outer        membrane where it generates transmembrane pores Bax        induces the opening of the mitochondrial permeability        transition pores Cytochrome c is then released from the        mitochondria into the cytosol where it interacts with        downstream proapoptotic proteins such as Apaf and caspase         Activation of these proteins further activates        nucleases such as caspaseactivated DNase CAD which        cause DNA fragmentation        During staurosporinemediated apoptosis a portion of        the lysosomal Hyal migrates to the mitochondria Whether        Hyal causes mitochondrial membrane damage is unknown        Presumably Hyal interacts with a specific protein target        on the mitochondrial surface that changes the membrane        permeability This notion is supported by our recent        screening of Hyal and Hyal interacting proteins in        yeast twohybrid interactions Chang         et al  unpublished        The functional property of Hyal in degrading        hyaluronic acid is controversial Hyal is found in the        lysosome and is active under conditions of low pH            Hyal is also found on the cell surface as a        glycosylphosphatidylinositol GPIanchored receptor for        jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus     Nonetheless the        enzymatic activity of Hyal has not been detected            Whether the increased TNF cytotoxicity in L cells caused        by Hyal and Hyal is associated with their enzymatic        activities is being studied in this laboratory        The TGF inhibition of Hyal and Hyal effects could        be abolished by cycloheximide or actinomycin D data not        shown That is inhibition of protein synthesis or gene        transcription reduced the inhibitory effect of TGF in        the prevention of Hyal or Hyalincreased TNF        cytotoxicity Whether TGFinduced antiapoptotic proteins        such as TIAF and TIF inhibit the function of Hyal and        Hyal remains to be determined                    Conclusions        Like testicular PH lysosomal Hyal and Hyal        enhanced TNF susceptibility in L cells TGF        suppressed the induced TNF sensitivity Furthermore        TGFmediated L cell proliferation was blocked by        Hyal and Hyal These data indicate that there is a        functional antagonism between TGF and Hyal or Hyal        Hyalincreased TNF susceptibility in L cells appears        to be associated with  Hyal upregulation of the        proapoptotic WOX  Hyal migration to the mitochondria        during apoptotic cell death and  the prolonged IB        degradation and NFB activation in Hyalexpressing cells        stimulated with TNF                    Materials and Methods
