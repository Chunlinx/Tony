                                 The Jesse Helms Ballet            Every year around this timethe Rite of Spring is performed in Washington Sadly this is not the greatStravinksyDiaghilev collaboration but a less distinguished balletchoreographed by Jesse Helms Heres the synopsis In the first scene aRepublican trots onto the stage and declares himself mortally offended by somebit of raunchiness connected to the National Endowment for the Arts This yearits Pete Hoekstra of Michigan who is distraught over The WatermelonWoman  a film about black lesbians As percussive storm clouds gatherdistinguished artists like Ron Silver and Whoopi Goldberg swoosh in to defendthe agency The battle rages the agency eludes destruction The curtain fallson conservatives shaking their fists and vowing to get the NEA next time likeSnoopy cursing the Red Baron            But doesthe NEA really escape Jane Alexander who has chaired the endowment since has been a formidable advocate for continued culture funding She hassuccessfully walked a tightrope in the censorship debates using heradministrative power to block grants that would have spelled trouble whilesticking up for those that came under attack after they were awarded Neitherleftwing performance artists nor rightwing senators have called for her headHer shrewdness and star appeal may have kept the endowment alive throughtroubled times But the wellintentioned Alexander may ultimately be seen asthe William Westmoreland of the NEA For the sake of preserving the agency shehas come close to destroying it            Take a look at the NEAs justannounced  grants Thechairwoman is not to blame for how few there are In  Congress cut theculture agencys budget from  million to  million and banned awardsto individual artists What is largely Alexanders doing however is that theremaining grants reflect not a serious commitment to high culture in Americabut a kind of passive middlebrow populism Alexanders survival strategy hasbeen to slosh a thin gruel of artistic mediocrity around the country Thestrategy has worked and may have been necessary and of course its easy tocarp from the outside But I think she has carried it a bit too far            Until thebudget cuts the NEA gave awards in  categories corresponding to familiardisciplines in the fine arts Alexanders forced reorganization collapsed the into four Planning  Stabilization Education  AccessHeritage  Preservation and Creation  Presentation Even thenames reflect a kind of preemptive surrenderno art here they declare Thebiggest chunk of change millionnow goes as block grants to state andregional arts agencies Most of whats left goes to arts administration andarts education The little direct support remaining is geared to soundinoffensive In fact much of it is political but in a mushyidentitydiversity way The result is that the agencys enemies and friendsalike may die of boredom before they turn up anything either offensive orinspiring

Another  goes to theConcerned Citizens for Humanity Ltd of Hartford Conn to support thecreation of STOPAIDS a statewide design project tailored to educate atriskyouth and persons with hearing disabilities on the problems of HIVAIDS            The NEAdoes still support some elitist high culture including the Metropolitan Museumand the Seattle Opera But the drift toward art as selfesteem building andaway from art for arts sake is clear In part this reflects trends in the artworld It also reflects Alexanders strategy of encouraging conservativelegislators to rethink their philosophical objections to arts spending throughthe crude but effective device of putting money in their districts In recentcongressional testimony Alexander began her litany of the NEAs good workswith important folk arts projects like the one sponsored by the AlabamaFolklife Association to publish and document primitive Baptist hymns Do Idetect a subtle jab even as Alexander outmaneuvered the Baptist primitives inCongress            The endowments supporters in the entertainment industryare less deft At a rally in Washington in early April a Broadway composernamed Richard Adler sat down at the piano and declared I dedicate this medleyof my songs to Senator Jesse Helms and to Newt Gingrichto their destructionIn the words of Alec Baldwin who heads the Creative Coalition The people whorun the Republican Party in this country are really rotten nasty horriblehuman beings Such comments can hardly make life easier for the civilizedRepublicans like Amo Houghton and Rick Lazio of New York whose dissent fromparty orthodoxy is all that is keeping the NEA alive at present            Thearguments made by movie stars in defense of the NEA are even sillier Actorslike Susan Sarandon and Whoopi Goldberg seem incapable of grasping that denyingsomeone a government grant doesnt violate the right to free speech Hardlymore persuasive is F Murray Abrahams line that if farmers can be subsidizedfor not growing things why cant artists be subsidized for producingRepublicans are quick to point out that theyre phasing out farm subsidies Buteven if they werent arts subsidies cant be justified on the basis that theyeven out the spending score for urbanites The justification for the NEA isthat we as a nation want a more robust cultural and intellectual life than themarket will otherwise provide Claiming an equal right to porkbarrelundermines that case            There is to be sure plenty of idiocy amongthe NEAbashers Sen Tim Hutchinson RArk argued at a recent pressconference that government funding for the arts is censorship Others atthe same event made the facile case that federal funding produces bad artThis is about an elite group who want the government to define what art isgood Newt Gingrich said GOP Whip Tom DeLay added that the American peoplewill get better art once the government gets out of the way            It is fun to speculate aboutTom DeLays idea of better art Maybe fewer pictures of whips in rectums andmore of rectitudinous whips Its strange that conservatives who insist thatthe government must make more forceful moral judgments take the relativisticposition that its incapable of ever making aesthetic ones And theircriticisms of the NEA are selffulfilling In the old days nobody paid muchattention and the artists on NEA panels were free to make meritoriousdecisions They supported a lot of great and good art Now in an environmentpoliticized by the right the NEA is supporting more of what Gingrich deemsbureaucratic art Whose fault is that            The NEA is alive but itson life support Knownothing attacks and a desperate defense strategy haveconspired to wreck what a decade ago stood as a wellfunctioning valuable andinexpensive agency of government Jesse Helms is still complaining but heshaving the last laugh just the same
