                                 FiftySeven Ways to Say            One of the weirdest and mostpernicious side effects of Flytrap has been the relocation of the White Houseto an alternative universe a place where up is down and down is up andeverything is the opposite of what it should be            In the Flytrap universethere is a White House counsel Charles Ruff who cant counsel a presidentialconfidant Bruce Lindsey whom the president cant confide in a presidentialwife who acts like a lawyer a president who acts like a criminal defendantand a former intern who has more power than any of them            The mostpublic manifestation of the bizarro White House is Mike McCurry He has becomea spinner who cant spin a presidential press secretary who cant talk to thepress or the president about the only issue they care about            Here as evidence are the notes I managed to scrawl duringyesterdays White House press briefing The speaker is McCurry unlessotherwise indicated and the subject is Flytrap                           The president has answeredall questions                                       Its clear there isnothing more to say                                       I am not going to addanything                                       I dont have anything toadd twice                           You played a semantic gameyesterday I am not playing that game today                                       You played a semanticgame                                       That has been asked andanswered                                       I just said I was notprepared with any information                                       The same questions wereasked yesterday                                       The answer is the sameanswer It is the same answer the president gave July                                        We dont know                                       I obviously dont have anyinformation                                       I dont have anyinformation                                       I just dont have ananswer                                       I dont have an answer tothat                                       That was asked andanswered                                       That was asked and I donthave the answer                                       I dont have anyanswers                                       The lawyers have notpassed on any answers to us We have passed on the questions and they havesaid they would take them under advisement                                       I am not making any newstoday I made that clear                                       I dont have anyinformation                                       I dont know                                       We dont have anything totalk about To which tart Helen Thomas responds We do have something totalk about but youre not talking about it                           Sam we have been throughthat                                       I have not saidanything                                       I have not talked to himabout this                                       I have not talked to thepresident about it                                       I havemade it clear I have nothing to say on that subject today                        Quizzing McCurry is like playing tennis againsta mattress In half an hour of questions reporters manage to gleannothingnot a single picayune detailexcept the obvious fact that Clintonslawyers have barred any public discussion Among the subjects McCurry has noanswers about whether the president will address the nation Aug  whetherany of the logistics of his testimony will be revealed whether he will answerall questions from Starr whether Starr is coming to the White House whetherMcCurry has talked to Clintons lawyers whether McCurry has talked to thepresident whether completely and truthfully means the same thing it did atyesterdays press briefing whether Harry Thomason is prepping the presidentwhether Thomason is staying at the White House            Throughout McCurrys litany of refusal Sam Donaldson seethes periodicallyinterrupting with shouts of Why are you denigrating us and Its not agame            Icant decide whom I feel sorrier for the reporterswithout stories or the McCurry without answers The assembled reporters have toask questions but they know he cant answer them McCurry has nothing Forfear of subpoenas and legal bills the press secretary simply cant talk to thepresident about Flytrap He is in the impossible position of interpreting andreinterpreting exactly the same two public statements Clinton has made on thesubject of Flytrap that woman in January and completely and truthfully inJuly He is otherwise a blank The result a farce a mockery of discourse anembarrassment to the press secretary and the press corps            McCurrymay be obliged by ignorance to stiffarm reporters but that doesnt mean theWhite House is inattentive to the media As the New York Times andWashington Post report this morning Clinton advisers are busy testinghow the press and public would respond to a limited mea culpa  Formore on the utter cynicism of this latest White House PR ploy see FRAME GAME WhiteFlag            When everyone eventually tires of this thrustand parry McCurry adjourns the briefing and disappears into the West WingDeputy Press Secretary Joe Lockhart who will succeed McCurry as presssecretary next month remains behind Lockhart I had noticed spent theentire briefing doodling red squares on his pad            Lockhart has learned wellfrom his departing boss I eavesdrop as Donaldson and Thomas corner the deputypress secretary I can just hear Lockharts soft patient voice We get askedthe same questions every day You know as well as I do why we cant answer Of course I havent spoken to him If I had discussed it with him I would berunning up  a day in legal fees and be in front of that grand jury            As Ileave a few minutes later I still hear Lockhart now pinned by another group ofreporters I dont know  I dont know            Flytrap Today The complete chronicles            More Flytrap
