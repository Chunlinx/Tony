                    Background        Rhinoviruses have been associated with  to  of        common colds studied by methods of virus culture             With the use of reverse transcriptase  polymerase chain        reaction RTPCR rhinovirus has been shown to be        associated with  of all colds throughout the year and up        to  of colds during the autumn outbreak period            Rhinviruses have been implicated in the exacerbation of        asthma symptoms    and may even play a role in asthma        related deaths     Due to their role in the        exacerbation of asthma symptoms rhinoviruses are a major        cause of pediatric hospitalizations            Although rhinoviruses have been thought to be        transmitted via large droplets or contact     studies        in the s demonstrated that fomites are not an        effective means of transmitting rhinovirus infections              While direct inoculation of respiratory secretions        has been shown to transmit infection this is not a likely        route of transmission in older children and adults as        survival on hands is brief     Airborne transmission of        infection was clearly demonstrated in one experimental        study on adults     However in the absence of        epidemiological studies designed to conclusively identify        modes of transmission the role of airborne transmission in        viral respiratory infection remains controversial        An impediment to future studies of airborne transmission        of respiratory infections is the lack of established        methods for the detection of airborne respiratory        microorganisms appropriate for epidemiological studies        Several laboratory studies have been conducted in which        aerosolized respiratory viruses have been collected and        quantified with culture based methods       These        studies were conducted to determine the effects of        temperature and relative humidity on the infectivity of        respiratory viruses but their methods are not suitable for        the extremely low concentrations of virus in field        experiments PCR based assays have been employed to detect        airborne respiratory viruses in a number of small studies        conducted in hospital rooms of infected patients              and in pig houses            To determine if airborne microorganisms can be        inactivated and therefore prevent infection transmission        studies during the ss used ultraviolet        germicidal irradation UVGI to inactivated airborne        microorganisms under experimental conditions              and reduced airborne infections in a number of settings        such as hospitals     military housing     and        classrooms     However UVGI was not effective against        the highly contagious measles virus when children had        extensive contact in buses and crowded tenements             Thus it fell into disfavor and has not been extensively        employed nor has it been studied using molecular methods of        detecting its efficacy        Because we anticipate future studies of UVGI will use        PCR based detection methods it is important to determine        how PCR assays react to UVGI damaged genetic material In        DNA UVGI predominately produces damage in the form of        cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers and  photoproducts These        photoproducts disrupt the replication of the genetic        material and therefore inhibit the replication There is        limited information regarding the effect of UVGI on RNA        There are conflicting studies on viruses with RNA genomes        that have attempted to determine if PCR assays are        inhibited by UVGI Two studies involving hepatitis A virus        singlestranded positive sense RNA genome and rotavirus        doublestranded RNA genome showed their PCR assays to be        inhibited by UV inactivation of the viruses             Conversely Ma et al showed no effect of UV on a PCR assay        when they irradiated poliovirus singlestranded positive        sense RNA genome     In this study we present an        extremely sensitive PCR based assay to detect airborne        rhinovirus and demonstrate the effect of ultraviolet        irradiation on the assay                    Methods                  Organism          We obtained rhinovirus  strain  from ATCC          Manassas Virginia with a titer of  particles per           ml The suspension was diluted with phosphate          buffered saline PBS to create four different          concentrations to be used in the experiment                          Aerosolization and chamber description          We generated a rhinoviral aerosol with a jet          Collison nebulizer model CN BGI Waltham MA which          generates m massmedian diameter MMD droplets when          run at  psig of air pressure     The nebulizing          solution consists of PBS diluted virus and  gl          uranine We used the uranine as a fluorescent tracer so          that some filters could be used to determine the          percentage of actual collection versus theoretical          collection The aerosol was generated in a specially          designed aerosolization chamber that had been used in          studies of UV sensitivity of           Serratia marcescens and bacilli          CalmetteGurin Figure               The chamber consists of four parts a drying jar a           mm square duct where the aerosol first enters the          chamber a UV exposure chamber and sampling ports We          attached a Collison nebulizer to the drying jar where          the aerosol is given time to dry before entering the          square duct through a port manifold which creates a          uniformly distributed aerosol The aerosol next enters          the UV exposure chamber The UV exposure chamber is          comprised of a fused quartz UV exposure window             mm on which a UV fixture containing six watt UV          lamps Lumalier Memphis Tennessee sits We inserted          two types of screens beneath the UV fixture to adjust the          level of irradiance Downstream of the exposure chamber a          slide contains three ports One port is used to collect          the aerosol sample with our sampling filters Teflo           m pore Pall Gelman Ann Arbor Michigan mounted in          filter cassettes Millipore Corp Bedford          Massachusetts while the other ports can be loaded with          two Teflo filters in series to allow a bypass while          changing sampling filters Two filters were used in the          bypass to ensure that no aerosol escaped the chamber The          multiple ports allow changing of filters without          interrupting the aerosol flow Makeup air passes through          a Teflon filter prior to entering the chamber to prevent          environmental microorganisms from entering the          chamber          Filtered air was pumped through the chamber at a rate          of  lmin monitored by a rotameter To provide          additional protection the experimental chamber was          housed within a Class II Type A biosafety cabinet          Although temperature and RH were not controlled they          were measured with continuous monitors HOBO H          four channel data loggers Onset Computer Corp Bourne          Massachusetts downstream of the sampling filters                          Aerosol procedures          Airflow through the chamber was maintained at           lmin for  minutes We then began the aerosolization of          the rhinoviral solution and allowed the aerosol to flow          through the bypass filter for  minutes Air samples          were then collected for  minutes For sampling runs          that included testing for effects of UV exposure the UV          radiation was turned on and allowed to warm up for           minutes while airflow was directed through the bypass          filter An air sample was then collected for  minutes          Three replicates of UV exposed and nonexposed particle          samples were collected during each sampling run Aerosols          were exposed to an irradiance level of  mWm for           s for a UV dose of  mJm                           Spiking experiments          Prior to the aerosol experiments we spiked filters          with progressively more dilute viral suspensions to          determine the limit of detection of our extraction and          seminested RTPCR assay For spiking  l methanol was          placed on the filter as a wetting agent followed by  l          of diluted virus Filters were and allowed to dry prior          to extraction We also spiked one filter prior to each          aerosol chamber run as a positive control To test the          stability of virus on the filters a test was conducted          in which spiked filters were used to collect air samples          for one week in our laboratory which has single pass air          and is therefore an unlikely source of rhinovirus                          Filter extraction          We placed the filters face down in a  mm petri dish          using sterile forceps We then added  l of prepared          AVL buffer containing carrier RNA Qiagen QIAamp Viral          RNA Mini Kit and  l phosphate buffered saline PBS          After placing the lids on the dishes the dishes were          secured to an orbital tabletop shaker VWR Scientific          Products Thorofare New Jersey and rotated for           minutes at  RPM After shaking we pipeted the eluted          material from the petri dish into a sterile microfuge          tube                          RNA extraction          We extracted the RNA from the filter samples with the          Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit following manufacturers          protocol The use of the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit          resulted in  l of purified viral RNA                          Seminested RTPCR amplification          Following extraction we first amplified the          picornavirus RNA using primers OL GCA CTT CTG TTT          CCC C    and OL CGG ACA CCC AAA GTA G             using the Invitrogen SuperScript OneStep RTPCR          with PLATINUM           Taq Kit Invitrogen Corp          Carlsbad California The PCR mixture contained            reaction buffer

a MJ Research Watertown Massachusetts          PTC Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed with an initial          cDNA synthesis and predenaturation step of C for           minutes and C for  minutes followed by then  cycles          of denature annealing and extension  s at C  s          at C  s at C          We then amplified the PCR products from the RTPCR          step using primers OL GCA CTT

AmpliTaq Applied Biosystems Foster City          California and  l of RTPCR product in a final volume          of  l We conducted the PCR reaction for  cycles of          denature annealing and

         analysis on  agarose gel containing  l of ethidium          bromide per  ml of gel followed by examination under          UV light                          PCR products          The OL and OL primer pair generates a  base          pair amplicon from a region of the  noncoding region of          the picornavirus genome The seminested primer pair of          OL and JWAb generates an amplicon of  base pairs          from within the original amplicon The  bp amplicon          does not differentiate between rhinovirus and enterovirus                                       Uranine analysis          Uranine was used as a fluorescent tracer which          allowed us to determine a percent yield for each sampling          run To determine the amount of aerosol collected on each          filter uranine analysis was conducted on three filters          per sampling run one each from the beginning middle and          end of each run The filters used for uranine analysis          were removed from cassette holders and placed into a           mm test tube with sterile forceps We added  ml of PBS          to each tube and sonicated for an hour with vortexing          every  minutes We also collected samples of the          nebulizing fluid before and after nebulization Filter          samples and nebulizing fluid samples were diluted with           N NaOH and analyzed with a spectrofluorometer          excitation  nm and emission  nm Tecan Corp          Spectrafluor Plus Mannedorf Switzerland We averaged          the results of the three filters to calculate an          estimated percent yield for the sampling run                          Data analysis          The amount of uranine nebulized during each sampling          run was determined by measuring the amount of fluid          consumed and by measuring the fluorescence of nebulizing          fluid before and after each sampling run Using the total          aerosolization time during the sampling run we          determined the amount of uranine that theoretically would          be on each filter if we collected  of the aerosol          generated during the minute exposure of each filter          Using the filter samples that were analyzed for uranine          we determined the actual amount of uranine collected per          sample We averaged the three filter samples per run and          divided by the total amount of uranine consumed to          determine a percent yield observedexpected for the          sampling run          We computed the expected number of TCID            on each filter sample from the          known TCID            and fluid volume added to the          nebulizer the amount of nebulizing fluid consumed per          minute and the sampling time The expected TCID            was adjusted for the yield for the          uranine samples                            Results        We were able to obtain from the dilution gradient filter        spiking experiments a positive band from a         dilution of virus which translates into a detected amount        of approximately  TCID          or  PFUs per filter The        stability tests in which filters spiked with  TCID          filter were used to collect air        samples for  hours did not display any difference in band        strength compared to control filters Figure displays the        results from the aerosol experiments with the lowest        concentration of virus detected        Table summarizes results of the aerosol experiments        including the expected TCID          captured on each filter during each        sampling run and the number of filters that produced        positive RTPCR results The limit of detection of our        seminested RTPCR assay with primers OL OL and JWAb        is in the range of  TCID          filter yielding a clearly visible         bp band No signal was detected from samples with         TCID          filter The percent yields for each        sampling run were low ranging from  to  Temperature        and relative humidity were recorded in the air downstream        of the chamber The average temperature inside the chamber        was very consistent ranging from C to C and the        RH ranged from  to         Figure shows the results from test of the effect of UV        exposure on aerosolized rhinovirus Lanes  and  contain        PCR products from filters containing UV exposed aerosol No        difference was detected between the UV exposed and        nonexposed filter samples        In order to determine if the uranine in the viral        suspension was inhibiting the extraction and detection        assay two otherwise identical runs were conducted  one        with and one without uranine Each sampling run was        conducted with nebulizing solution containing  TCID          per ml Results of the two runs were        identical demonstrating that the uranine was not        inhibitory to the extraction or RTPCR assay                    Discussion        The majority of rhinoviral transmission among adults is        thought to occur via airborne infectious droplet nuclei              This study was conducted to assess the ability to        detect airborne rhinovirus on air sampling filters and        documents the first successful attempt to detect airborne        rhinovirus using RTPCR amplificationbased techniques        These techniques allow for a highly sensitive method to        conduct air sampling for rhinovirus This assay also is        capable of detecting aerosolized enterovirus although        future studies are necessary to confirm the limit of        detection for enteroviral aerosols        Our limit of detection for the collection extraction        and amplification of aerosolized rhinovirus was  TCID           The spiking experiments we        conducted had a limit of detection of approximately         TCID          or  of what was detected when the        virus was aerosolized These results can be interpreted in        several ways One possibility is that the virus may be        damaged during the process of aerosolization in the        Collison nebulizer and that the RNA from the damaged virus        cannot be amplified This explanation would account for the        results shown in Figure where the nebulization solution        prior to aerosolization yielded a positive result while        after aerosolization we obtained a negative result Another        possible explanation is that it is easier to extract the        virus from a dried liquid droplet as was done in the        spiking experiments than from an aerosol spread uniformly        over the filter surface        We were unable to recover the majority of aerosol that        was expelled into the chamber The main reason for the low        yields appears to be the result of large droplets falling        out in the drying jar prior to entry into the exposure        chamber Because the yields were the same regardless of the        UV status the low yields should not affect our        results        Previous studies have shown that UV inhibits PCR assays        in single and double stranded RNA viruses     while        our RTPCR method did not detect a difference between UV        exposed and nonexposed rhinoviral aerosols The most likely        reason for this is a matter of dose although it is        possible that characteristics of the particular viruses and        PCR methods could also explain the results Neither of the        previous studies were conducted on aerosolized virus and        the dose of UV was several orders of magnitude greater        This study did not determine whether the rhinovirus        aerosol was capable of infection after exposure to the high        UV dose used in these experiments It is possible that the        UV irradiation damaged other regions of the viral RNA and        not the region that our primers amplified or that the        amount of damage required to prevent RTPCR amplification        is greater than the amount of damage sufficient to prevent        infection This suggests possible future studies to        investigate the relationship between UV damage        infectiousness and detection by RTPCR of various regions        of the rhinovirus genome        The limit of detection of our assay must be put into        context with the amount of virus shed by an infectious        individual A study of rhinoviral shedding detected a titer        of at least  TCID          per ml of nasopharngeal wash in         out of  infected volunteers     So it is clear that        infected people can produce a large amount of virus but it        is unknown how much of that virus becomes airborne through        coughs sneezes respiration and talking        Two studies have attempted to determine the infectious        dose  ID           of rhinovirus for humans             The ID          for microorganisms depend on at least        four criteria  the strain of the organism  the        route of transmission  the method of inoculation and         host immunity In a study published in         investigators from the US Army Biological Laboratories        and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious        Disease conducted a series of tests designed to determine        if respiratory viral agents were transmitted via the        aerosol route Using rhinovirus type  they inoculated        volunteers in the nose with both nasal drops and an aerosol        particle size  to  m The authors estimated a        human ID          of  TCID          for nasal drops and  TCID          for aerosols     In a study        conducted in  researchers inoculated volunteers with        rhinovirus type  with droplets of viral suspension in        several locations The authors determined the ID          for nasal drops was  TCID              If we assume that the        infectious dose is acquired through an aerosol the aerosol        data from  suggests that our assay can detect an amount        approximately equal to twice the ID          in humans But if the spiking        experiment is a better estimate of actual detection limit        due to the inactivation by the nebulizer then our        detection limit is approximately equal to the ID                  Caution must be taken when interpreting results from        PCRbased air samples Nucleic acid detection methods such        as the one presented here are capable of detecting very        small quantities of microorganisms but these techniques        cannot determine if the microorganism is infectious at the        time of detection                    Conclusions        The filter collection and PCRbased detection methods        developed here offers some clear advantages over the use of        more traditional methods such as impinger collection and        cell culture based detection The use of filter collection        allows for a much longer sample time while impingers        cannot be used for longer than  minutes As was        demonstrated here filters can be used to collect at least        hour samples without reduced ability to detect virus on        the filter Cell culture methods while useful in        determining the amount of infectious virus could not be        used to detect the very low levels of infectious virus        present in room air because collection of viable virus over        long sampling times is not currently feasible Therefore        the use of filter collection and PCR based detection is the        only method presently available to detect low        concentrations of respiratory virus in air However at UV        doses much higher than typically used in upper room UV        applications this method was unable to distinguish between        UV irradiated aerosols and nonexposed aerosols                    Abbreviations        PBS  Phosphate buffered saline        MMD  Massmedian diameter        RTPCR
