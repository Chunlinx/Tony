                                 Remnicks Progress            TheTimes ofLondon Monday was much impressed by Russias dash and daring in sneakilymoving into Kosovo before NATOs troops In an editorial titled Who DaresWins the motto of the British SAS commandos the paper said that theRussians have won not only Pristina and the initiative but the secretadmiration of scores of NATO officers frustrated by an enforced wait on theKosovo borders Their coup de thtre has served as a reminder thatdithering loses to derringdo the paper said This may have been amediadominated war but to halt and advance to allow the cameras to catch upis a grotesque irresponsibility            Butthis was a minority view in the British press On the Left the Guardian said the Russianmilitary seems ever closer to being out of control and that its behavior inKosovo is proof that there is no longer one government in that vast countrybut rather several held in loose often hostile connection to each otherNATO should continue to deny Russia its own sector in Kosovo but should alsosoothe its wounded pride by admitting that the West has been cavalier in itstreatment of the former superpower and that it now has to be given a seat atthe commanding table            On theRight the Daily Telegraph criticized the United States for being tooaccommodating to Russia It is hardly surprising that a cardinal aim of Russianpolicy is to counter NATOs influence in central Europe and the role ofhonest broker between the West and Belgrade gave them an ideal opportunity todo so the paper said Trusting them with that task prolonged the aircampaign and has now seriously queered KFORs pitch it added NATO cannotblame the Russians for making difficulties The fault lies in giving them suchan opportunity            InParis Sunday LeMonde ran an editorial saying that the message of Russias race toPristina was a brutal one that the Russians are not willing to submit toNATOs authority and that they want control of the northern sector of theprovince to carry out a de facto partition of Kosovo While the West had goodreasons to be considerate toward Russia by delaying preparations for a landinvasion and seeking a solution to the crisis within the unusual context of theG only because Russia was a part of it it also has the right to expectRussia to play the game Le Monde said The West was right to involveRussia it concluded but not at any price and especially not at that of apartition of Kosovo            Another Paris daily Libration  said Monday that Russias dash into Kosovoshouldnt be treated lightly because its unclear who pilots the Russian planetoday Bill Clinton might well ask this question of Boris Yeltsin when theymeet in Cologne Germany on Saturday the paper said but it isnt certainthat his answer will be very convincing In Germany Monday the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitungcalled the move Yeltsins coup but added in a frontpage comment that thenext few days would show whether Yeltsin has only been acting on whim orwhether theres a strategy behind it            Europes Monday papers were generally dominated however by the results of theweekends elections for the European Parliament in Strasbourg that on very lowvoter turnouts throughout Western Europe delivered heavy rebuffs to bothChancellor Gerhard Schrder of Germany and Prime Minister Tony Blair ofBritain Conservatives trounced the Left in Italy as well where the party ofTV magnate Silvio Berlusconi a former prime minister came in first But inFrance the Socialists triumphed Le Figaro of Paris said however that the real winners ofthe elections were the absentionists In France fewer than one elector in twovoted in Britain fewer than one in four did The Financial Times of London saidthe low turnouts threatened to undermine the effectiveness of the EuropeanParliament and most British papers said the results might set back Blairsplans to bring Britain under the European single currency the euro
