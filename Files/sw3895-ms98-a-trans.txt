              well do you go camping Glen   yes uh we live uh right to the base of the Wasatch Front so uh uh as our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the mountains different taking our children with us or deer hunting or whatever   by camping you you mean really roughing it   well well uh sometimes we did most of the time wed  wed put up tents and wed go up and stay for a week or uh weekend or go up into uh Yellowstone Park and and camp in the campgrounds up there   oh but that was   but we really had some enjoyable times as a family and uh some real good memories how about your experiences on camping uh what have you   uh well ive our children were growing up also uh we had a boat and wed go camping on the long weekends uh Memorial Day Fourth of July Labor Day   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh we went with some good friends and wed get as many you know involved as we could and so our kids really grew up all through uh you might say junior high and high school camping and uh   uhhuh well that sounds uh   weve really had a good time doing it um we went to a lake called Lake Tawakoni uh its just kind of east and south of here in Texas   uhhuh   and uh we camped outside one time we had a tornado come through our campgrounds it was kind of interesting we had snakes and armadillos and   oh wow   uhhuh all those fun things huh   all the fun things that that make memories     yes ill say well we uh when we were up in uh  by Yellowstone Park we had uh moose that went through our campground and we had a a bear once that went through uhhuh black bear and then we   a bear oh oh   uh weve seen a lot of rattle snakes uh in our camping trips   oh   and all of those creatures of the wild and like you say those really make memories of things the kids never forget but   uhhuh   i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and thats when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and     didnt didnt mind you being there a bit huh   no no no he we uh didnt bother it and uh everything was fine but uh its uh camping has really uh been a a great part of our life and now were were older all of our kids are gone and we dont uh uh fact last year was the first year i didnt go out camping on the deer hunt now we have quite a deer hunting season here in Utah and i didnt first time in uh fifty four years that i hadnt gone out in the mountains for the deer hunting so   oh first time huh well   but anyway it uh   maybe youll get a chance to go again   yeah when the grandkids uh get a little bit older then well well well do that again   take them well we kind of gave up camping about three four years ago to and we built a lake house   oh uhhuh   and so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house   uhhuh well i would uh its not like camping in a way but yet it is youre still uh on the   well were were still outside but we we we figured were getting a little too old to rough it as much as we used to   right     yes uh we got uh where we had a a camper then we got us a fifteen foot trailer house that we we took up and uh when we were going camping so we when we our kids were young we did uh pretty well rough it we were in some good snowstorms and uh speaking about tornados up in Yellowstone uh one went through there usually they dont have such things here but   i didnt know they did yeah   it took down pine trees quite a swath and uh we were there right after that happened but uh   oh   uh those tornados i guess are uh pretty scary things   i guess most you know theres probably not any part of the country that doesnt experience them every once in a while   umhum that was amazing because that was like i say right up in Yellowstone and its uh maybe once every hundred years or something we have something like that but uh and it happened and uh that was   i bet Yellowstone was a neat place to camp in we we went up we pulled a trailer out there from Illinois um   umhum   when uh probably about nineteen seventy four im trying no no no no it was before that it was must have been nineteen seventy two before we moved to Texas   umhum   and uh we had like a sixteen foot trailer that uh we pulled behind the car   uhhuh   and all the kids and the dog and everything and actually i i think i liked the camping with the tent better than pulling the trailer     umhum   but we made it out to Yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that   oh it is its its beautiful weve spent a lot of time up there and that but thats a long ways to pull a trailer   yeah it was and uh we needless to say we havent we havent done it again  pulling the trailer is not the our favorite thing to do       yeah no
