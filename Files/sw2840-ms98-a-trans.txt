                do you have any particular thoughts about the school system   well um i i think that in in uh recently with the im not sure if its more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system they seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems any problems that a child might have whether its actually a school related thing or not and i   i say agree with you a hundred percent there   yeah and and well its gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything   oh   if uh youve some kid who doesnt have uh whos from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that void its gotten way beyond teaching uh you know teaching classes and uh maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like oh were kind of traditionally the schools roles   yeah yeah its interesting because uh were just having conversation on this uh with a couple of people yesterday and i was expressing my frustrations that uh some of the so many problems i  i work in a high school are that kids dont have a a degree uh a of selfdiscipline which may be reflected in society at large uh and you cant expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract uh sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home   right   um and its seen more so because when you call parents up many parents wont even recognize that there is a problem and  will say theyll say oh well our kids my kid ive never heard anything about this before this is the first time there have been problems and and you say dont these parents know that teachers talk and you know we do check with other teachers and other teachers find the same things for this child and you know how do you tell your parents the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee   right right   but um it it is a problem and im not sure just uh how how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it whether maybe through a commitment of the PTA   yeah   uh and the parents being informed better that in fact that the problems that are nationwide     yeah   are are problems um of society and that that the school can only do so much on it   well then then again when you have uh a society where a certain percentage of the parents are uh doing drugs in the home uh either unemployed and dont care about a uh just a have their own problems   umhum yeah yeah   how how do you expect the school to um or how do you expect the you cant really expect that parent whos quite frankly a loser in life as it is to to care about the the situation with their child and   thats right umhum   you know what scares me too is that we have yet to see uh the biggest effect of the crack children   right   uh in the school system these are children that are born with low deficit attention deficit and gosh whats going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system that thats really scary   right yeah   but there are i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve and this is something that i see too many times students get diagnosed as  slow learners and in fact theyre not theyre behavior problems   right   and so they get put in in in our school system in a class thats limited for skills children that have really have to master skills and thats not their problem   umhum   um at the same time ive seen we we have a uh an international population theres no bridge area for students coming out of the ESOL which is English for Speakers of Other Languages program the once theyre past ESOL they get out they got thrown right into the total mainstream   uhhuh right   and uh there really needs to be a bridge some sort of transition   right   for that so the school systems can improve both in standing up for splitting classes you know having learning disabled learning slow slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems   right   and then you know the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated   right   and then you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but theyre discipline problems and you sometimes the average classes really are problems because youve got such a mixed bag there   umhum right   you know the gifted and talented are fast classes theres really not that much of a problem with but its   well i ive seen more uh incredibly intelligent intelligent underachievers than than uh   umhum   i personally i will i would take a person whos motivated and a little uh less intelligent than the person who uh is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of   thats yeah   isnt motivated to do anything   i remember i had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration   yeah well i i not to toot my own horn here or anything but i i was graduated from my high school i was the valedictorian and i know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me   umhum   and they proved out like when it came time to take the SATs mine were good but they werent great and uh   umhum umhum   when i got into college i struggled i struggled just to uh get my degree in the in the field that i was in whereas i knew people that   yeah   in high school were kind of lazy and all but they got motivated in college and they did a lot better than i did and when it   yeah i guess kids do mature at different ages too thats and you know as a teacher you you try to make be understanding that you know there are different ages kids are is   right   that a kid thats just a question of maturity or is he problem child but teachers are asked to diagnose so much   hum   um there i mean i mean were have to be were alerted theres all sorts of systems where suicide   right   uh predisposition i mean were alerted to what the moment we see something if we see a child that we have any reason thats on drugs such as if hes got a beeper or if theyre if theyre flashing lots of money around weve there are certain things to do i mean so teachers the school systems asked to do so much but you cant operate in a vacuum   you actually have students with with beepers   this is a were in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington   uhhuh   and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the uh principal   i mean where what are the what could they possibly be thinking i mean how   its for drug use they cant imagine for anything else   yeah   you you know its its amazing but uh you get all sorts you get all all sorts of things uh in the schools uh uh and its and you know as a teacher youre alert youre alert for the kid whos very drowsy youre alert to the kid who suddenly has a um behavioral change and you refer them to the nurse and   right   and so i mean you have to find out whether theres a legitimate reason  or whether this is a warning signal   yeah can you how can you  how can you expect to   and parents frequently resent when you ask them is there a problem that we should be aware of   oh yeah i i was uh sitting in the barber shop im im an officer in the Air Force and i was having my hair cut   umhum   and the barber uh got a call while i was there uh from his sons school his sons in high school and his son was failing gym and uh and having trouble with a few other things but       you know its like uh this guy was like why now theres no problem with my kid my kids a great kid and all this the kid had missed all these classes and basically he his answer was oh i gave him permission to to miss   umhum yeah the denial mechanism is really strong and so many parents are facilitators i mean theyre manipulated by their children ive been fortunate i have uh   yeah right   a son whos a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts at uh Amherst and my other son is a senior in high school and hes going on to Williams and i mean theyre really super theyre both national level swimmers   uhhuh sure   and where weve been very fortunate but you know they had to be held accountable too i mean you know at some point a parent does help their kid but in in some ways but but you have to say at what point isnt the help becoming negative   right sure   and i think this is where the school system uh is suffering and not through any fault of the effort of the school system   right   but gee it was good talking with you   it was good talking to you too   yeah so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do and and are connected with the schools   yeah yeah ive had interesting conversations on several subjects not uh not just this but different the different things its amazing how the you know people you talk to have some interesting conversations and uh its too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base and that none of the ideas or thoughts are   umhum   being used at all   well we are both  listen good luck take care byebye   yeah thats true all right yep byebye
