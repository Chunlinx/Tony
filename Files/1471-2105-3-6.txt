                    Background        For over a decade the idea of representing biological        sequences in a continuous coordinate space has maintained        its appeal but not been fully realized       The        basic idea is that sequences of symbols such as        nucleotides in genomes aminoacids in proteomes repeated        sequences in MLST Multi Locus Sequence Typing  words        in languages or letters in words would define trajectories        in this continuous space conserving the statistical        properties of the original sequences                 Accordingly the coordinate position of each unit would        uniquely encode for both its identity and its context ie        the identity of its neighbors     Ideally the        position should be scaleindependent such that the        extraction of the encompassing sequence can be performed        with any resolution leading to an oligomer of arbitrary        length The pioneer work by Jeffrey published in            achieved this for genomic sequences by using the Chaos Game        Representation technique CGR defining a unitsquare        where each corner corresponds to one of the  possible        nucleotides Subsequent work further explored the        properties of CGR of biological sequences but two main        obstacles prevented the realization of its early promise         lack of scalability with regard to the number of possible        unique units and inability to represent succession schemes        Meanwhile Markov Chain theory already offered a solid        foundation for the identification of discrete spaces to        represent sequences as crosstabulated conditional        probabilities  Markov transition tables This Bayesian        technique is widely explored in bioinformatic applications        seeking to measure homology and align sequences     In        a recent report    we have shown that for genomic        sequences Markov tables are in fact a special case of CGR        contrary to what had been suggested previously            This raised the prospect of an advantageous use of        iterative maps as state spaces not only for representation        of sequences but also to identify scale independent        stochastic models of the succession scheme That work           is hereby extended and further generalized to be        applicable to sequences with arbitrary numbers of unique        component units without sacrificing the inverse        correlation between distance in the map and sequence        similarity independent of position Accordingly the        technique is named Universal Sequence Map USM                    Results                  Conceptual foundations          The USM generalization proposed here is achieved by          observing two stipulations Aalternative units in the          iterative map are positioned in distinct corners of           unit block structures and B           sequence processing is bidirectional          Basis for USM generalization          A Each unique unit is referenced in the map for          positions that are at equal           ndistances from each other and          possibly but not necessarily defining a complete           block structure               ndistances are defined as the          maximum distance along any dimension eg           ndistance between            a                       a                        a                       n             and            b                       b                        b                       n             is           maxb                       a                        b                       a                         b                       n                       a                       n             see also Equation  It will be shown that this          stipulation leads to the definition of spaces where          distance is inversely proportional to sequence          similarity independent of position In this respect USM          departs from previous attempts to generalize Chaos Game          Representation that conserve the bidimensionality of the          original CGR representation                 B The iterative positioning is performed in both          directions Therefore there will be two sets of          coordinates the result of forward and backward iterative          operations It will be shown that by adding backward and          forward map distances between two positions the number          of identical units in the encompassing sequences can be          extracted directly from the USM coordinates As a          consequence two arbitrary positions can be compared and          the number of contiguous similar units is extracted by an          algebraic operation that relies solely on the USM          coordinates of those very two positions                          Implementation of USM algorithm          The algorithm will be first illustrated for the first          and last stanzas of Wendy Copes poem The Uncertainty of          the Poet  respectively I am a poet I am very          fond of bananas and I am of very fond bananas Am I a          poet The procedure includes four steps           Identification of unique sequence units  eg          these two stanzas have  unique characters table           ie           uu              Replacement of each unique unit in this case units          are alphabetic characters by a unique binary number           eg in table each of the  unique units is replaced by          its rank order minus one represented as a binary number          Other arrangements are possible leading to the same final          result as discussed below The minimum number of          dimensions necessary to accommodate           uu unique units           n is the upper integer of the          length of its binary representation           n  ceillog                      uu For W Copes stanzas           n  ceillog                         The binary reference          coordinates for the unique units are defined by the          numerals of the binary code  for example           a will be assigned to the position           U                      a              Each symbol is          represented as a corner in a ndimensional cube Table           The purpose of these first two steps is to guarantee          that the reference positions for each unique sequence          unit component are equidistant stipulation A in the           nmetric defined above Any other          procedure resulting in equidistant unique positions will          lead to the same final results independently of the          actual binary numbers used or the number of dimensions          used to contain them           The CGR procedure    Eq  is applied          independently to each coordinate           j   n for each unit           i in the sequence of length           k u                       j                      i with           i   k and starting with a          random map position taken from a uniform distribution in                     n  ie           Unif           n  The random seed is not          fundamentally different from using the middle position in          the map as is conventional in CGR and it has the added          feature that it prevents the invalidation of the inverse          logarithmic proportionality of           ndistance to sequence similarity             for sequences that start or end with the same          motif          For a sequence with           k units the USM positions           i   k for the           j   n dimensions are          determined as follows                     The previous step generated           k positions in a           n dimension space by processing          the sequence forward Eq  This subsequent step adds          an additional set of           n dimensions by implementing the          same procedure backward Eq  again starting at random          positions for each coordinate Consequently the first           n dimensions of USM will be          referred as defining           a forward map and the second set of                    n dimensions will define a           backward map Put together the          bidirectional USM map defines a           nunit block structure           The           n additional backward coordinates          are determined as follows                    The forward USM map for genomic sequences where           uu   and consequently           n   is the same as the result          generated by CGR However by freeing the iterative map          from the dualdimensional constraint of conventional CGR          the USM forward map alone achieved the goal of producing          a scale independent representation of sequences of          arbitrary number of unique units These properties will          be briefly illustrated with W Copes example The           thunit of the first stanza I am a poet I am very fond          of bananas has USM coordinates           USM                       n                                                     The first           n   coordinates the position in          the forward map can now be used by reversing equation                not only to extract the identity the unit           i   but also the identity of the          preceding units           using forward coordinates alone                                             The same procedure can be applied to the remaining           n   coordinates the position in          the backward map to extract the identity of the          succeeding units now ordered backwards           using backward coordinates alone                                             The length of the sequence that can be recovered from          a position in the CGR or USM space is only as long as the          resolution in bits of the coordinates themselves In          addition the relevance of these iterative techniques is          not associated with the property of recovering sequences          as much as with the ability to recover the succession          schemes eg the Markov probability tables It has been          recognized for almost a decade that the density of          positions in unidirectional bidimensional iterated CGR          maps eg of genomic sequences           uu              n    defines a Markov table               The complete accommodation of Markov chains in          unidirectional USM ie either forward or backward          which is an equivalent to a multidimensional solution for          CGR can be quickly established by noting that the          identity of a quadrant is set by its middle coordinates              In order to extract the Markov format for an          arbitrary integer order           ord each of the two nunit          hypercubes the set of           n forward or backward coordinates          would be divided in           q             nord equal quadrants and the          quadrant frequencies rearranged     The use of           quadrant to designate what is in          fact a subunit hypercube is a consonance with the          preceding work on bidimensional CGR maps     where          it was shown that since any number of subdivisions can be          considered in a continuous domain the density          distribution becomes an orderfree Markov Table that          accommodates both integer and fractal memory lengths The          extraction of Markov chain transition tables from USM          representations both forward and backward is included          in the accompanying webbased application see          Abstract          Above the USM procedure was shown to allow for the          representation of sequences as multidimensional objects          without loss of identity or context These objects can          now be analyzed to characterize the sequences for          quantities such as similarity between segments or entropy              within the sequence In figure the          dimensional object defined by the USM positions of the          two stanzas was projected in dimensions by principal          component analysis The dimensionality reduction by          principal factor extraction has visualization purposes          only As established above the minimum necessary          dimensionality of the USM state space is set by the          binary logarithm of the number of unique units          Nevertheless the sequence variance associated with each          component is provided in the figure legend In figure a          the segments            very fond of in the two stanzas          are linked by solid lines to highlight the fact that          sequence similarity is reflected by spatial proximity of          USM coordinates The representation is repeated in Figure          bwith solid lining of the segment            bananas  The matching of the two          segments of the second stanza light to the similar          segments of the first stanza dark is again visually          apparent          The USM algorithm determines that similar sequences          or segments of sequences will have converging iterated          trajectories the distance will be cut in half for every          consecutive similar unit This property was notice before          for CGR of genomic sequences     and will be further          explored here for USM generalization In that preceding          work it was shown that the number of similar consecutive          units can be approximated by a symmetrical logarithmic          transformation of the maximum distance between two          positions in either of the dimensions            ndistance            d                     d  log            Max           USM                       undirectional              Eq           Since the USM coordinates include two CGR iterations          per dimension one forward and another backward two          distances can be extracted The first            n coordinates define a forward          similarity estimate           d                       f             and the second           n n coordinates can be used          to estimate backward similarity           d                       b             The former measures similarity with regard to the          units preceding the one being compared and the latter          does the same for those the succeeding that same units          Therefore the forward and backward distances between the          positions           i and           j of two sequences           a and           b with a length of           k                       a            and           k                       b             respectively would be calculated as described by          equation  defining two rectangular matrices           d                       f            and           d                       b             of size           k

preceding            d                       f             illustration for stanza comparison in Fig a or          succeeding            d                       b             illustration for stanza comparison in Fig b the          positions being compared The value of           d would be the exact number of          contiguous similar units           h if the starting positions for          the similar segments where at a           ndistance of  eg if they were          in different corners of the unit hyperdimensional USM          cube Since the initial distance is always somewhat          smaller the homology           h measured as the number of          consecutive similar units will be smaller than           d Eq                     The contribution of  to the similarity distance           d can be estimated from the          distribution of positions in the USM map of a random          sequence A uniformly random sequence      will          occupy the USM space uniformly and for that matter so          will the random seed of forward and backward iterative          mapping respectively equations  and  Therefore a          uniform distribution is an appropriated starting point to          estimate the effect of            p the overdetermination of           h by           d Eq Accordingly for a given           x  the probability           P                       o             that any two coordinates           x            and           x             are located within a radius           r   is given by Equation                              Since           P                       o                       r  is the probability of two          points chosen randomly from a uniform distribution           Unif being at a distance          less than           r from each other for any set of           n coordinates in the USM the          likelihood of finding another position within a block          distance of           r would be described by raising          equation  to the           n exponent Finally recalling from          equation  that sequence similarity can be obtained by a          logarithmic transformation of r the probability that the          unidirectional coordinates of two random sequences are at          a similar length           d   is described by equation           The simplicity of the expansion for higher dimensions          highlights the orderstatistics properties    of the           nmetric introduced above Eq           It is noteworthy that the model for the likelihood of          overdetermination is the nullmodel eg the comparison          of actual sequences is evaluated against the hypothesis          that the similarity observed happened by chance          alone                    Finally it is also relevant to recall that the null          model for           d Eq for unidirectional          comparisons bidirectional null models are derived          below allows the generalization for noninteger          dimensions For example the  unique unites found in          the two stanzas Table  define forward and backward          USM maps in  dimensions each However the  thdimension          is not fully utilized as that would require                        unique units Therefore if          there is no requirement for an integer result the          effective value of           n for the two stanzas can be          refined as being           n  log                                   An estimation of bidirectional similarity will now be          introduced that adds the forward and backward distance          measures           d                       f            and           d                       b             The motivation for this new estimate is the the          determination of the similar length of the entire similar          segment between two sequences solely by comparing any two          homologous units Accordingly since           d                       f            is an estimate of preceding similarity and           d                       b            provides the succeeding similarity equivalent the          sum of the two similar distances           D Eq  will estimate of the          bidirectional similarity eg the length of the similar          segment           H                     As illustrated later in the implementation for          pairwise comparisons of homologous units of similar          segments all values of           D and consequently of  are          exactly the same This result could possibly have been          anticipated from the preceding work    by noting that          the value of           d between two adjacent homologous          units differs exactly by one unit However this result          was in fact a surprise and one with far reaching          fundamental and practical implications          Similarly to unidirectional similarity estimation           d the bidirectional estimate           D being the sum of two          overestimates is also overestimated by a quantity to be          defined  Eq  The derivation of an expression for          the bidirectional overestimation will require the          decomposition of           P            Eq  for two cases comparison          between unidirectional coordinates of similar quadrants           P                      a   and of opposite quadrants                    P                      b   as described in equation           Recalling from equation  positions in the same          quadrant correspond to sequence units with the same          identity and positions in opposite quadrants correspond          to comparison between coordinates of units with a          different identity                    The need for the distinction between same and opposite          quadrant comparison which is to say between similar and          between dissimilar sequence units is caused by the fact          that same quadrant comparisons are more likely to lead to          higher values of           d As illustrated above for the           thunit of the first stanza the forward and backward          coordinates must fall in the same quadrant Consequently          the similar pattern of same and opposite quadrant          comparisons for each dimension will be reflected as a          bias in the bidirectional overestimation The          determination of probability           P             of overdetermination between sums          of independent unidirectional similarity estimates is          derived in equation                     The probability of bidirectional overdetermination          can now be established by using the same and opposite          unidirectional comparison expressions presented in          Equation  The resulting expression for similarity          overdetermination by the distance between bidirectional          USM coordinates           P             is presented in equation                     In figure  the probability distribution for both          unidirectional            P             in gray and bidirectional            P             in black comparisons is          represented for different dimensions           n It is clearly apparent that the          overdetermination becomes much less significant as          dimensionality increases From a practical point of view          the overdetermination is of little consequence because          the computational load of comparing sequences corresponds          mostly to the identification of candidate pairing          combinations The fact that the nmetric unidirectional          distances           d                       f            and           d                       b             defined in Equation  and bidirectional           D defined in Eq  are          overdetermined implies that the identification of          similar segments between two sequences will include false          positives but will not generate false negatives The          false positive identifications can be readily recognized          by comparing the sequences extracted from the          coordinates as demonstrated above for the  thunit of          the first stanza Nevertheless since overdetermination          will necessarily occur its probability distribution was          identified Eq  Fig  This can also be achieved          for individual values by solving Eq  for the value of           observed For example for the conditions of the two          stanzas the value of                      p              n   is  sequence units          which is the expected median unidirectional          overdetermination           P             of           d                       f            and           d                       b            Eqs   The corresponding probability of          bidirectional overdetermination           P             should be somewhat above twice          that value Using equation  the value obtained is           similar units Finally it is worthy to stress that the          expressions for calculation of likelihood of arbitrary          levels of overdetermination Eq  can be inverted          to anticipate the level of overdetermination for          arbitrary probability levels This use of the null random          model is also included in the accompanying online tool          see Abstract for URL                            Discussion                  USM of biological sequences          The representation of biological information as          discrete sequences is dominated by the fact that genomes          are sequences of discrete units and so are the products          of its transcription and translation However not all          biological sequences are composed of units that are          functionally equally distinct from each other as is the          case of proteomic data and Multilocus sequence typing          MLST  To avoid the issue of unit inequality and          highlight the general applicability of the USM procedure          stanzas of a poem were used to illustrate the          implementation instead Nevertheless the original          motivation of analyzing biological sequences is now          recalled          In the preceding report the authors have illustrated          the properties of unidirectional           nmetric estimation of similarity          for the threonine operon of           E coli     The same two two          regions of           thrA and           thrB sequences of           E coli K MG are compared in          Figure to highlight the advancement achieved by USM It          should be recalled that the particular dimensionality of          DNA sequences           n   allows a very convenient          unidirectional bidimensional representation which is in          fact the Chaos Game Representation procedure CGR              Consequently CGR is a particular case of USM obtained          when           n   and only the forward          coordinates are determined This can also be verified by          comparing Figure awith a similar representation reported          before     obtained with the same data using CGR          Fig  of that report The advantageous properties of          full bidirectional USM become apparent when Fig ais          compared with Fig b It is clearly apparent for          bidirectional USM Fig b that all pairwise          comparisons of units of identical segments now have the          same           D values This coverts any          individual homologous pairwise comparison into an          estimation of the length of the entire similar segment          The conservation of statistical properties by the          distances obtained           D can also be confirmed by          comparing observed values with the corresponding null          models Fig  For the analysis of this figure it is          noteworthy to recall that the statistical properties of          prokaryote DNA are often undistinguishable from uniform          randomness       The genomic sequence of the          first gene of the threonine operon of           E coli thrA is compared with          that of the second           thrB The distribution of the          resulting           D values is represented in figure          solid black line alongside with the null model for          that dimensionality Eq  with           n  log                          gray dotted line The          genomic sequences of           thrA and           thrB were translated into proteomic          sequences using SwissProts on line translator applied          to the  first frame          httpwwwexpasychtoolsdnahtml Similarly the          distribution of           D values for the comparison of the          proteomic           thrA and           thrB sequences is also represented          in Figure  alongside with the null model Eq  for          its dimensionality            n  log                       uu   possible aminoacids             which is graphically nearly undistiguishable          from that of the comparison between the stanzas with           n  log                       uu   possible letters            dotted gray line for the rounded value           n   Both the genomic and the          proteomic distribution of           D values is observed to be          contained by the null model unlike the comparison          between the stanzas discussed above where the existence          of structure is clearly reflected by its distribution          The genomic and proteomic of           thrA and           thraB used to illustrate this          discussion are provided with the webbased          implementation of USM see Methods for URL                            Conclusions        The mounting quantity and complexity of biological        sequence data being produced    commands the        investigation of new approaches to sequence analysis In        particular the need for scale independent methodologies        becomes even more necessary as the limitations of        conventional Markov chains are increasingly noted            These limitations are bound to become overwhelming when        signals such as succession schemes of the expression of        over  human genes    become available This        particular signal would be conveniently packaged within a         dimension USM unit block          n  ceillog                               In addition the advances in statistical mechanics for        the study of complex systems particularly in nonlinear        dynamics have not been fully utilizable for the analysis        of sequences due to the missing formal link between        discrete sequences and trajectories in continuous spaces        The properties of USM reported above suggest that this may        indeed be such a bridge For example the embedding of        dimensions a technique at the foundations of many        timeseries analysis techniques offers a good example of        the completeness of USM representation of sequences By        embedding the forward and backward coordinates separately        at the relevant memory length the resulting embedded USM        is exactly what would be obtained by applying USM technique        to the embedded dimeric sequence itself                    Methods
