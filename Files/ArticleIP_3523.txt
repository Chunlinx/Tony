                                 Plain Folk            Harry Smith  wasa selfcreated character deserving of a novel no one has yet written Smallgnomelike with an acerbic highpitched voice he was a tramp scholar who ina peripatetic life on the fringes became a recognized authority on Seminolefabrics Ukrainian Easter eggs and the ubiquity of string figures in theworlds cultures He was a record producer an adept of black magic and anavantgarde filmmaker who pioneered among other things the kind of collageanimation later made famous by Monty Pythons Terry Gilliam He begancollecting rpm recordings in the early s acquiring thousands of raceand hillbilly works from the junk shops of the Pacific Northwest before theycould be melted down their shellac recuperated for the war effort            In  he assembled  ofthese songs in an anthology that was at once systematic and intuitive In threevolumes Ballads  Social Music  and Songs he gatheredblues gospel hymns murder narratives reels and jigs Cajun tunes sermonsand ancient Child ballads transmuted from their British origins by centuries inthe mountains and valleys of America He laid down a few ground rules Thematerial had to have been recorded commercially between  when electronicrecording made possible accurate music reproduction and  when theDepression halted folk music sales otherwise he was guided only byserendipity and his own ears Yet he succeeded in making a collection that wasdefinitive in its selections and mysteriously cohesive the diverse offeringsfalling together like strands of a single design You have to remember that atthe time no one had an overview on this stuff Few people knew any of itbesides some oldtimers and a scattering of enthusiasts folk music meanteither the topical work of Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly or the kind of artsongtaxidermy practiced by the likes of the baritone John Jacob Niles            Slowlyand invisibly the Anthology captivated and influenced a generation Itwas the urtext for the folk music boom of the early s It was plundered byeverybody especially Bob Dylan who swiped alluded and rewrote so much inthe spirit of the original works among which lines and verses migrate freelythat he forcefully inserted himself into the tradition After that though thecollections fame returned underground Few people born after  had heard ofit despite its remaining in print until Folkways Records dissolved when itsowner Moe Asch died in the mids            It has finally been reissued in a lavish package fulldisclosure I contributed a small reminiscence of Smith to the liner notesThis took some doing because the Anthology was in effect a bootlegtheoriginal recordings had been imperfectly documented if at all the artists werepaid small flat fees and sent in most cases back to obscurity but thecopyrights had accrued to large publishing consortiums The packaging whilesplendid and including helpful and sometimes inspiring essays completedocumentation and an enhanced CD containing films and recordings of and bySmith is maybe too lavish by half since its price tag will put it far beyondthe means of young people It is to be hoped that its volumes will be issuedindividually            Nevertheless it is available again and its importance cannot be overstatedReviewing it in the New York Times  Tom Piazza was reminded of EdmundWilsons The Shock of Recognition  Bruce Shapiro in The Nationcompared it to the reprinting of Moby Dick in the s Such assertionsmight make you suspicious but they are not hyperbole Consider that Smith whosaid he searched for records that sounded odd or exotic managed to includean array of composers and performers who rather than being typical orrepresentativethe goal of most makers of field recordingswere singularartists Some were truly weird others major innovators whose stature wouldonly be recognized later Blues radical Charley Patton was forgotten DockBoggs and Frank Hutchinson have barely been given their due even now Click tohear Boggs menacing combination of blues and highlonesome mountain stylingConsider also that Smith deliberately avoided identifying the performers byraceIt took years before anybody discovered that Mississippi John Hurtwasnt a hillbilly he said and it is just as surprising to find out thatsuch bluesmen as Hutchinson and Richard Rabbit Brown were white            The Anthology is a picture of whatindigenous American music was like before the age of mass media at a time whensongs and ideas could only be transmitted by live performance and by rumor andyet circulated far and fast among musicians isolated by race or poverty orlost in rural backwaters The migratory quality of lyricsthe fact that linesand whole verses traveled from this song to that one from blues to mountainballad or vice versa regardless of origin or even sensemade for a sort ofnative Surrealism a collage by accretion It also shows how profoundly linkedblack and white cultures were African and Anglo traditions twined around andthrough each other like closely planted trees Tradition for that mattercoexisted with experimentation so that it is not always immediately obviouswhich is whichyou might not realize from listening that Blind Lemon Jeffersonwas an innovator who transformed the blues and influenced every subsequentartist in the genre or that the shapenote singing of the Sacred Harp choirsrepresents a late vestige of a style that may have reached its acme ofprevalence around the time of the American Revolution All of it in any casesounds new and fresh and enduringly
