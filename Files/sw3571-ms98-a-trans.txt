        okay well you wanna tell me about the weather     Lori i think we know about the weather had a lot of rain this year though     thats right yeah thats true lot of records i think   yeah i know it i just dont know what winters gonna be like     uh hasnt been bad so far   no it hadnt but i mean were due for a a big one here we hadnt had a big         big winter in a long time   well yeah i guess not well  how about somewhere else you been somewhere else lately   somewhere else where was i i was in Florida here recently     and what was the weather like there   great  it was fantastic     you wanna go back right   yeah sure i wouldnt mind going back   did it rain every day it usually rains every day there   no it didnt really didnt they got maybe sprinkled maybe once i remember thats about it   really huh uhhuh did you go to uh what is it Disney World   no i was down there on business but we were right across the street from it   oh oh really and you didnt get to go huh have you been there before   no never went no never have   oh my gosh have you been to the one in California   my no my kids were the one to the one in uh out in California     gosh we have to go  its just one of those things you have to see you know   i know thats what i heard think were straying off the weather though   yeah thats true yeah hum boy we cant go very far with this subject   i dont know i what kind of winter winter are we gonna have this year   oh i dont know hopefully not too bad well bad enough so it kills all the fleas and bugs and whatever see we have to have our freeze for probably a week   right   but aside from that i hope its still warm not too cold maybe maybe maybe well maybe a little snow on Christmas Eve or something would be nice but it doesnt look good   yeah they were saying that the freeze last winter did you see i dont know if you saw on TV about the uh the migration uh not the migration but all the crickets that they had this year   oh yeah   did you see it they were saying they were saying that was caused from a very mild winter   oh it was amazing   that that the winter didnt that the winter did not kill all of the eggs like it normally does   umhum   oh yeah   but i was out  i work out in Plano at a restaurant out there and they just uh i mean the my whole building was covered with them   umhum oh what restaurant is it   i hope   oh okay all right i work out in Plano too i was just wondering if it was near where i am     but i mean it it was it was i couldnt i couldnt believe all of them   yeah i remember going to work one day and just crunching on the stairs it was terrible   oh it was unbelievable we couldnt see our parking we couldnt see our parking lot hey im not im not kidding we got pictures of it we could not see our parking lot     thats pretty bad for a restaurant i guess probably doesnt help your business   yeah it is well it didnt it well it didnt hurt it though thats the bad thing       didnt hurt it they werent on the inside they were just on the outside of the building just hanging around   yeah huh well its in here we started to get some in the house now i i wonder if its because its getting cool out  and they want to come in   yeah they want to they go towards the heat thats why thats why they were coming out of the ground when it first started getting cool they came out of the ground because it was warmer   yeah yes and into the house   yeah well yeah they like coming into the house but they were going crawling crawling up our building up into the eave where it was warm     oh huh   where the lights were and everything   uhhuh huh   but hopefully uh well have a nice hard winter and itll kill them all this year because i dont wanna put up with that again   yeah i know i know i mean it sounds cool to say but yeah it was pretty   uh a bugs a bug who cares   and i ended up spraying for them anyway after a while i think   oh we spent a couple of thousand dollars on getting the getting the restaurant sprayed and everything   yeah i bet you do huh you probably have to do that a lot of times during the year dont you   oh yeah well we get we spray monthly just as just as a maintenance but uh i mean this was like every other day he was coming out there with his truck he normally doesnt spray with a truck   oh oh hum uhhuh   but he was having to come out there with a big truck and uh just douse the douse the grass and everything else     wow yeah i guess youd have to you dont want bugs in there thats for sure um   oh i know it but im im ready for a little snow though got to have a little bit couple of days anyway  maybe shut shut down shut down work but i doubt it maybe where i can stay home a few days and and play in the snow with the kids   umhum yeah it would be nice   yeah that would be nice   yeah im looking forward to it i dont know about anybody else   hm yeah well as long as i dont have to drive in it   oh i know   thats thats the lousy part   yeah i know and Texans dont know how to drive in it anyway   oh well im not from here but yeah i never really did learn  so     yeah well i dont know what else we can talk about the weathe r   well i dont um probably nothing   yeah its getting cool now i got a fire going so im enjoying it yeah   oh sounds good well listen i enjoyed talking to you   enjoyed talking to you too   and uh i hope we get a better subject next time or or at least someone on the other side of the country so that you really can ask   i i i know it well the maybe if theyre listening to this maybe if they when they listen to this maybe they can set that up a little better   yeah well its probably just whoever is around or has the right hours on their sheet so they can call because its getting hard to find people now   yeah oh i know it thats true   takes a long time and this was good i mean you were only the second one they called   oh really   but sometimes ive had to wait
