          so what is your latest experience with painting   well  i dont i havent done any painting since i was a child and my father would be painting and id ask him if i could  you know take a turn or something but uh when we bought our home it was recently   uhhuh   updated they did that maybe improvements so they could sell it and things so we didnt have to do any painting   right   and the condominium we moved in before my husband went over and painted but i the experience that ive had is that um   whatever time he gave said oh it would take me about just about four hours because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there       and he said oh its going to be just about four hours well  he was gone the whole day and he said well all i got done was the taping around   isnt that amazing it it looks so easy just slapping paint on i had an addition put on     uhhuh   and um we and i decided because my inner room looked so dingy because i put these beautiful French doors in   uhhuh   and so i decided okay ill just you know have them paint this little room you know a little ten by ten dining area it took four days   uhhuh     and even the painter couldnt give me a good estimate he said well ill be done this afternoon you know   uhhuh   and pretty soon before you know it you know hes run into so many problems and its just theres nothing there to be a problem i thought but um it just took him so much longer and   uhhuh   and he was there to paint the French doors also um and if youve ever painted French doors which my husband just finally said he wasnt going to do       because it looked so formidable um then then just   yeah     we we got this painter and i just called him because i got a little ad out of the you know the adcose or whatever in the mail and uh you know just got this painter person over here and he said yeah i can finish it in a day oh right  so the whole project basically took a week   oh i know its just awful     funny and i go what makes you a professional you know       how much you know more do you know than i know about this whole situation but he just kept painting on those French doors you know and each little um paint stroke you know the paint wasnt going on right is what it was   pane uhhuh   so he had to redo them like three times before i was happy with them before he was happy you know that they even looked halfway decent and   um   so its just been painting yeah i mean hire a professional but that doesnt guarantee anything   no and it really like you said always takes way longer than anyone um is able to guess because i know my husband he he painted when he it was just the preparation time was so long that when he actually got down to the painting part   right     he it was like  ten times longer than he already thought he would be done and and uh he did part of the in the at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in and um and he didnt notice until the next morning that the shades of paint between the two paint cans he had finished one can off and started another one   oh no   and then when we went in there you know one was blue they were white but one had more blue to it   oh and that can make a difference too i mean   uhhuh   and they bring the uh you know little samples and youve got like maybe five hundred well thats an exaggeration   uhhuh   but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints and you dont know what you to want to put up there and by the time its on i i selected a what i thought was white and it was like you said you know it was blue blue cast to it and it looked awful on   uhhuh uhhuh     so that was the next problem he had to redo that too i   yeah   this was a and it was a major project getting the money together  to do it too by the end of the whole project but   right   you know we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long he really came over here to paint i think because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house  i dont think he did the interiors very well     oh boy   and yeah   well i dont recall my parents having that much trouble  with theirs i mean you know they painted our rooms all the time and we had a a wooden we hardly we just had brick on like as accent   no uhhuh   on a certain area of our home  growing up and so he had to paint the outside all the time  and um i just dont think you know that there was that big problem   it wasnt a big deal for them i dont know   no but to us you know were going oh were so glad we have a brick home all we have is like trim around the windows or something and   i think my husbands really glad about that   no uh no painting to have to do i i dont know that we   for sure   like uh say were freshly graduated from school and things so we havent gotten to the point where were hiring professionals to do too much of our needs do   you you just you just get in there and do it yourself   weve been trying to you know weve done that the whole time we were in school like trying to repair our own cars and things and   yeah uhhuh yeah   so i i want to get to the point where i could feel like i could just hire someone   well its its not that easy its like its uh i dont even know if i you know i would not even recommend this person again to anybody i dont know   uhhuh   a i guess you get i i dont know if you get into the mind set where you just say well ill accept something or you just really have to get on their back i mean about things and and working with what they say are professional painters i mean   uhhuh   i tell you what the fumes that the the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do anyway   thats true      i mean the fumes are amazing and i i dont think i could stay sane you know and   no   working with all that so i mean i know its not lead based any more paints but my goodness   but still its harmful and they have to live with that every day   i well yeah i  think so   in in their clothes and everything   oh it does   the only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the um association that manages it they have to take care of like the structural damage there was a roof leak and that was not something that we had to pay for so they sent their painters in to to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then you know repaint the whole ceiling in a certain room but they came in and um   oh yeah   they came in and did it and left in just no time at all and i think its because they you know they were accustomed to working in that  environment in those particular condominiums and i dont i didnt watch them but i couldnt imagine that they came in and painted it the whole ceiling you know just within a couple of hours   ri ght   and uh   well maybe there are some professionals out there  it makes you wonder     uhhuh   really it does uh for all that well um i hope you have a nice day today   um well you too i guess its getting getting to be lunch time i need to go take care of the kids but you have a good day   and you take care okay okay bye Kay   bye
