                            In this issue of         PLoS Biology Hebert et al  have set out to test the resolution        and performance of DNA barcoding using a single mtDNA gene cytochrome         c oxidase I COI for a sample of North American birds Before turning        to details of this study it is useful as context to consider the following questions What        is DNA barcoding and what does it promise What is new about it Why is it controversial        What are the potential pitfalls        Put simply the intent of DNA barcoding is to use largescale screening of one or a few        reference genes in order to i assign unknown individuals to species and ii enhance        discovery of new species Hebert et al  Stoeckle  Proponents envisage        development of a comprehensive database of sequences preferably associated with voucher        specimens representing described species against which sequences from sampled individuals        can be compared Given the long history of use of molecular markers eg allozymes rDNA        and mtDNA for these purposes Avise  there is nothing fundamentally new in the DNA        barcoding concept except increased scale and proposed standardization The former is        inevitable Standardization ie the selection of one or more reference genes is of        proven value in the microbial community and in stimulating largescale phylogenetic        analyses but whether one gene fits all is open to debate        Why then all the fuss Initial reactions to the DNA barcoding concept have ranged from        unbridled enthusiasm especially from ecologists Janzen  to outright condemnation        largely from taxonomists eg see the February  issue of         Trends in Ecology and Evolution  The former view reflects a real need        to connect different life history stages and to increase the precision and efficiency of        field studies involving diverse and difficulttoidentify taxa The criticisms are mainly        in response to the view that singlegene sequences should be the primary identifier for        species DNA taxonomy Tautz et al  see also Blaxter  At least for the        macrobiota the DNA barcoding community has moved away from this to emphasize the        importance of embedding any largescale sequence database within the existing framework and        practice of systematics including the importance of voucher specimens and of integrating        molecular with morphological characters Another point of contentionthat DNA barcodes have        limited phylogenetic resolutionarises from confusion about the scope of inference At        best singlegene assays can hope to identify an individual to species or reveal        inconsistencies between molecular variation and current perceptions of species boundaries        DNA barcoding should not be confused with efforts to resolve the tree of life It should        connect with and benefit from such projects but resolving phylogeny at scales from species        to major eukaryotic clades requires a very different strategy for selecting genes Indeed        the very characteristic that makes the COI gene a candidate for highthroughput DNA        barcodinghighly constrained amino acid sequence and thus broad applicability of primers        Hebert et al also limits its information content at deeper phylogenetic levels        eg Russo et al  Zardoya and Meyer  Naylor and Brown  Finally while        superficially appealing the very term DNA barcoding is unfortunate as it implies that        each species has a fixed and invariant characteristiclike a barcode on a supermarket        product As evolutionary biologists we should question this analogy        In evaluating the promise and pitfalls of DNA barcoding we need to separate the two        areas of application molecular diagnostics of individuals relative to described taxa and        DNAled discovery of new species Both are inherently phylogenetic and rely on a solid        taxonomic foundation including adequate sampling of variation within species and inclusion        of all previously described extant species within a given genus Accurate diagnosis depends        on low intraspecific variation compared with that between species such that a short DNA        sequence will allow precise allocation of an individual to a described taxon The extensive        literature on mtDNA phylogeography Avise  indicates that this condition often holds        although there are exceptions Furthermore within many species there is sufficient        structure that it will be possible to allocate an individual to a particular geographic        population Such identifications should be accompanied by a statement of confidenceeg        node support in a phylogenetic analysis and caveats in relation to the breath of sampling        in the reference database eg whale forensics Palumbi and Cipriano         DNAled species discovery is more contentious but again is not new In animals        inclusion of mtDNA evidence in biogeographic and systematic analyses often reveals        unexpected diversity or discordance with morphology which then prompts reevaluation of        morphological and ecological characteristics and if warranted taxonomic revision But        despite recent proposals Wiens and Penkrot  Hebert et al  it does not follow        that mtDNA divergence should be a primary criterion for recognizing species boundaries see        also Sites and Marshall  Potential limitations of using mtDNA to infer species        boundaries include retention of ancestral polymorphism malebiased gene flow selection on        any mtDNA nucleotide as the whole genome is one linkage group introgression following        hybridization and paralogy resulting from transfer of mtDNA gene copies to the nucleus        These are acknowledged by Hebert et al  and well documented in the literature        Bensasson et al  Ballard and Whitlock  including that on birds Degnan         Quinn and White  Lovette and Bermingham  Weckstein et al  More        specifically using some level of mtDNA divergence as a yardstick for species boundaries        ignores the low precision with which coalescence of mtDNA predicts phylogenetic divergence        at nuclear genes Hudson and Turelli  An additional problem with focusing on mtDNA        or any other molecular divergence as a primary criterion for recognizing species is that        it will lead us to overlook new or rapidly diverged species such as might arise through        divergent selection or polyploidy and thus to conclude that speciation requires longterm        isolation For example a recent mtDNA analysis of North American birds Johnson and Cicero         showed that numerous avian species have low divergences and that speciation can occur        relatively rapidly under certain circumstances We contend therefore that whereas        divergent or discordant mtDNA sequences might stimulate taxonomic reassessment based on        nuclear genes as well as morphology ecology or behavior mtDNA divergence is neither        necessary nor sufficient as a criterion for delineating species This view accords with        existing practice taxonomic splits in North American birds typically are based on multiple        lines of biological evidence eg morphological and vocal differences as well as genetic        data American Ornithologists Union         We turn now to the core of Hebert et als paperCOI sequencing of a substantial sample        of North American birds  of  species and its validity as a test of the barcoding        concept Their aim is to test the correspondence between species boundaries signaled by        COI barcodes and those established by prior taxonomic research North American birds are        an interesting choice because their specieslevel taxonomy is relatively well resolved and        there has been extensive previous analysis of levels of mtDNA sequence divergence within        and among described species Klicka and Zink  Avise and Walker  Johnson and        Cicero  Herbert et al  found differences in COI sequences between closely        related species that were  times greater in magnitude than the differences within        species  versus  respectively From these data they conclude that        most North American bird species can be discriminated via molecular diagnosis of        individuals and propose a standard sequence threshold of ten times the mean intraspecific        variation yielding a  threshold in birds to flag genetically divergent taxa as        provisional species Thus their analysis seeks to address both potential applications of        DNA barcoding        Although Herbert et al sampled a large number of species a true test of the precision        of mtDNA barcodes to assign individuals to species would include comparisons with sister        speciesthe most closely related extant relatives This would require that all members of a        genus be examined rather than a random sample of imprecisely defined close relatives and        that taxa be included from more than one geographic region Johnson and Cicero         showed the importance of comparing sister species when examining genetic divergence values        in North American birds with results that contrast strongly with those of Hebert et al as        well as previous studies eg Klicka and Zink  For  pairs of avian sister        species mtDNA sequence divergences ranged from  to  with an average of  cf         to  among closely related species in Hebert et al Of these  pairs  are at        or below the  threshold proposed by Herbert et al and thus would not be recognized as        species despite biological differences Moreover although only a few of these  pairs        see Table  in Johnson and Cicero  had sufficient sampling to assess intraspecific        variation in mtDNA sequences these typically showed paraphyly in mtDNA haplotypes        Therefore there are still too few cases with adequate sampling of intraspecific diversity        for sister species pairs to know how common paraphyly is although a recent metaanalysis        found that  of bird species deviated from mtDNA monophyly Funk and Omland         Collectively these observations cast doubt on the precision of DNA barcoding for        allocating individuals to previously described avian species                Empidonax flycatchers which are renowned for their        morphological similarity and could thereby benefit from DNAbased identification tools        provide an example of the importance of a more detailed analysis A complete molecular        phylogeny for this group Johnson and Cicero  yielded distances between four pairs of        sister species that ranged from          E difficilis versus         E occidentalis  to          E traillii versus         E alnorum  notably the genetic distance between mainland and        island populations of         E difficilis         E d difficilis and         E d insulicola   was greater than that between sister        species Johnson and Cicero  Herbert et als analysis included only two species of         Empidonax         E traillii and         E virescens  which are not sisters but members of divergent        clades Because         E virescens is genetically distant from all other species of         Empidonax  to  uncorrected distance Johnson and        Cicero  its comparison with         E trailli therefore inflates estimates of interspecific        distances within the genus        Another key point of Hebert et als analysis was to estimate levels of intraspecific        diversity For  species of the  examined more than two individuals were sequenced         n   to  individuals per species mean   and pooled pairwise        genetic distances were found to be uncorrelated with geographic distances leading Hebert        et al to conclude that high levels of intraspecific divergence in COI in North American        birds appear uncommon However this makes the assumption that there is a common        underlying pattern of phylogeographic structure which is unlikely for North American birds        Zink  Zink et al  If there is significant variation assessment of        intraspecific diversity can be based on a small sample of individuals only if individuals        are sampled across existing population subdivisions for which geography and phenotypic        variation are reasonable initial surrogates        The analyses presented by Hebert et al will certainly stimulate further debate a reply        by Hebert et al to the present letter is posted at httpwwwbarcodinglifecom but for        the reasons outlined here they are not yet a definitive test of the utility of DNA        barcoding for either diagnosis of individuals or discovery of species We also question        whether the results for North American birds can be extrapolated to the tropics where DNA        barcoding could have maximum value In general amongpopulation sequence divergence        increases with decreasing latitude even excluding previously glaciated regions Martin and        MacKay  and studies of intraspecific genetic diversity in Neotropical birds have        revealed a higher level of phylogeographic subdivision compared to temperate species        Remsen  Lovette and Bermingham  Thus the general utility of mtDNA barcoding        across different biogeographic regionsand between resident versus migratory taxarequires        further scrutiny        There is little doubt that largescale and standardized sequencing when integrated with        existing taxonomic practice can contribute significantly to the challenges of identifying        individuals and increasing the rate of discovering biological diversity But to determine        when and where this approach is applicable we now need to discover the boundary        conditions The real challenge lies with tropical taxa and those with limited dispersal and        thus substantial phylogeographic structure Such analyses need to be taxonomically broad        and need to extend beyond the focal geographic region to ensure that potential sister taxa        are evaluated and can be discriminated There is also the need to examine groups with        frequent possibly cryptic hybridization recent radiations and high rates of gene        transfer from mtDNA to the nucleus Only then will the skeptics be satisfied
