                    Background        Injuries to nerve or tissue cause an immediate sensation        of pain or acute pain which resolves with the resolution        of the injury Less commonly these injuries produce a        heterogeneous group of pathological states that produce        chronic pain that is unresponsive to the analgesics used to        treat acute pain It would be therefore of great interest        to map the characteristic features of gene expression        following nerve injuries as they may reveal mechanisms of        chronic pain and genetic targets for the design of novel        therapies In this study we apply the powerful microarray        technology to study the injuries of the brachial plexus a        typical form of nerve injury from motorcycle or workplace        incidences     Since this is largely a paper focusing        on methodology we refer the readers to our website           for details of the brachial plexus injuries        The goal of this study detection of condition or        statedependent differentially expressed genes is an        important problem in the context of microarrays Fold        changes and         t tests have been applied to        microarray datasets to yield lists of genes that have        undergone altered expression under a certain significance        threshold Although these methods are useful in identifying        potential gene targets they are best applied to small sets        of hypothesis tests In the context of microarray        experiments where thousands of genes are commonly evaluated        simultaneously the probability of detecting false        positives rises sharply Two recently proposed algorithms        seeking to address this multiple testing problem        Significance Analysis of Microarray SAM and Westfall and        Young stepdown adjusted         p values will be investigated in our        study We note at the outset that our investigation of        methods for detection of such differentially expressed        genes has several limitations Firstly it is based solely        on the brachial plexus injury data which in turn is        limited by small sample sizes  injured patients and         controls However such small sample sizes are        characteristic of many current microarray studies in view        of technologic expense so that exploration in this setting        is purposeful Secondly our investigation is largely        empiric there being no overarching theory by which to        arbitrate competing approaches Nonetheless it is the        frequently observed heteroskedasticity of gene expression        measurements that motivates our extension of the SAM        methodology see below to Welch statistics        SAM was designed to evaluate the significance of changes        in gene expression between different biological states            SAM assigns a score to each gene here and below what        we refer to as genes are actually probe sets on the chip        that target full length cDNAs or ESTs as an index of the        relative difference between groups A gene is labeled as        significant if its score surpasses a threshold SAM terms        the percentage of genes identified by chance the false        discovery rate FDR and estimates this quantity by        recourse to permutation The threshold can be adjusted to        identify different sizes of sets of putatively significant        genes and FDRs are modified accordingly We note here that        this differs from the formulation and sequential control of        FDRs as originally proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg            see Storey    and Storey and Tibshirani    for        discussion of the distinctions and considerations pertinent        to microarray data analysis Throughout we will use FDR in        the sense of SAM Tusher         et al used SAM to study the        transcriptional response of lymphoblastoid cells to        ionizing radiation and they were successful in identifying         biologically meaningful genes A different algorithm        proposed by Westfall and Young and adapted by Dudoit         et al    for microarrays tackles        the multiple testing problem from a different angle It        controls the familywise Type I error rate FWER which is        the probability of having at least one false positive among        all hypotheses tested It provides less conservative        control than the traditional Bonferroni idk and Holm        corrections and is able to handle the dependence eg        coregulation among gene expression profiles In a study        that tested whether alterations in the expression of genes        related to highdensity lipoprotein metabolism affects the        expression of other genes multipletesting methods        identified  genes that showed significant altered        expression levels in scavenger receptor BI transgenic mice        and  genes in apolipoprotein AIknockout mice            Further discussions additional approaches and comparisons        can be found at            In the comparison of expression levels of more than         probe sets between normal subjects and brachial plexus        injury patients we adopt both SAM and Westfall  Young        algorithms using regular         t statistics assuming equal variances        and         t statistics assuming unequal        variances hereafter called Welch statistics The        application of Welch statistics is motivated by the work of        Thomas         et al     In their paper they        applied Welch tests on a leukemia dataset    and        demonstrated the importance of allowing for unequal        variances Following a similar approach we have identified        a set of known and novel genes that largely fall into six        categories cytokines  neurotrophine myelin function        signal transduction cytoskeleton transcription         translation and others Some genes are confirmed by        literature others still require explanation and future        research We also compared the performance of SAM and        Westfall  Young algorithms as well as         t statistics and Welch statistics In        this study we hope to provide a framework for future        experimental research in avulsion injuries and pain In        addition we illustrated the use of appropriate multiple        testing methods for microarrays in monitoring differential        gene expression between different biological states                    Results                  Data displays for test statistics          Figure is a scatter plot of the intensity readings          for a patient P and the corresponding readings of a          control C The considerable deviation from the          identity line indicates that gene expression is          substantially disturbed as a consequence of the avulsion          injury For comparison the scatter plots for a pair of          control and a pair of patient data sets clearly show less          deviation          The frequency distribution of           t statistics and the normal QQ          plot for           t statistics are provided in          Figure  Both the histogram and the QQ plot show that          the distribution of           t statistics is not normal          However in our study we are more interested in          identifying genes with substantial           t statistics than in testing the          distribution of           t statistics The genes having           t statistics that deviate markedly          from the bulk of the observations were labeled as          potentially having biological significance and may          deserve further investigation     Plots of           t statistics against average          intensities and different components of           t statistics against each other          Figure  are especially useful in identifying genes          with substantial statistics and in studying the features          of these genes     The average intensity for each          gene is the average of the mean expression level for the          patient and the control groups In Figure  large           t statistics were easily          visualized and labeled in red They correspond to the          same genes identified as outliers in the QQ plot Figure           The six genes that have the largest           t statistics do so by virtue of          having denominators close to zero implying near constant          expression levels Further their expression levels are          observed to be very low Consequently these genes might          be of little biological interest In order to more          systematically evaluate differential expression and          complement these graphical approaches we next apply          SAM                          Application of SAM tSAM and WelchSAM                      tSAM                          Experimental outline              We used the SAM methodology to identify genes with              statistically significant changes in expression For              the               i thgene a modified               t statistic               di  was used to quantitate              differential expression                            All quantities here and below are defined in the              Methods section The               s                factor was added to help ensure              that the variance of               di is independent of gene              expression level and to mitigate problems caused by              small denominators A similar strategy derived from a              Bayesian approach is detailed in     In order to              select an appropriate               s                value for this dataset we              plotted  against FDR using different values of               s                 Figure shows that calculating                            s                according to the Tusher               et al prescription yields a              value equal to the minimum of the pooled standard              deviations over all the genes which fails to reduce              FDRs We therefore elected to set               s                at the  thpercentile of the              pooled standard deviations                s                  this choice does reduce              FDR              As  increases the number of significant genes              decreases but at the same time the percentage of              falsely called genes also decreases The curve of FDR              vs  in Figure shows that FDR generally decreases              monotonically as  increases but from some  on the              decrease flattens markedly see also Table  The              choice of  is somewhat arbitrary but is driven by              choosing an acceptable FDR and an appropriate number              of significant genes We choose    corresponding              to an FDR at  This yields a set of  significant              genes that are described next Not surprisingly the              concordance between genes identified via graphical              methods and those selected by SAM is high                                      Genes identified by tSAM                              Cytokines  Neurotrophines                Mild tissue damage nerve damage and infection                produce inflammation and associated pain This                results in the migration of immune cells to the                site of injury which is followed by release of                cytokines     Five genes identified as                significant by                 t SAM have been reported in                the literature as relevant to the inflammation and                pain pathways Interleukine  inhibits                inflammatory cytokine production Midkine is                associated with neurite growth and was recently                discovered to have potent neuroprotective activity                in vivo     IGFBP plays a significant role in                the differentiation maintenance and regeneration                of the central cholinergic neurons                    Cysteinerich fibroblast growth factor receptor is                also implicated in neuronal growth and                differentiation TrkA plays a crucial role in the                development and function of the nociceptive                reception system                                            Myelin function                Three genes were identified that are involved in                myelin structure and myelination MPZ myelin                protein zero PLP myelin proteolipid protein                 and MBP myelin basic protein Defects in these                genes are the cause of demyelinating                neuropathies                                            Signal transduction                PKC and Frizzled play roles in apoptosis The                down regulation of both might represent a cellular                response to prevent neurons from death                                            Cytoskeleton                Three genes Myosin light chain Myosin heavy                chain and MLCK Myosin lightchain kinase are                notable in this category The altered expression of                them together suggests a probable link between                calcium signaling and rearrangement of the                cytoskeleton possibly leading to longterm changes                in neuronal morphology                                            Others                MTIII has been recently implicated as being                involved in sensory and nociceptive transmission                    Its down regulation might also lead to                promotion of neurite extension to promote recovery                in the patients                                                          WelchSAM            Thomas             et al    showed that in the            twogroup microarray study setting the             t statistic assumption of equal            variances between the two groups could result in poor            performance We therefore extended the SAM framework to            include Welch statistics Under the assumption of            unequal variances the associated degrees of freedom            are variable and the strict monotonic decreasing            relationship between             p values and test statistic            values no longer holds Accordingly it is misplaced to            use the values of the statistics under permutation            Rather for each data permutation we standardized the            Welch statistic using an appropriate             t referent distribution and used            the resultant              p values as described in the            Method section see also Westfall and Young     By            so taking into account betweengroup heterogeneity            WelchSAM identified a set of up regulated genes that            were not detected by             t SAM Several of these up            regulated genes are engaged in transcription and            translation regulation transcription factor AP            transcriptional coactivator Pc Nrf EIF Eukaryotic            translation initiation factor  and PABPL            polyadenylatebinding protein  In addition two            genes are involved in cell cycle regulation            Autoantigen pericentriol material and CDClike kinase            Their identification suggests a secondary mechanism to            repair the damaged cells The entire list of genes            identified by             t SAM and WelchSAM can be found            at                                    tSAM vs WelchSAM            The relationship between FDR and  for Welch is also            included in Figure  The unpooled variance in the            denominator of Welch statistic is highly unstable under            permutation in this small sample setting Consequently            FDR for WelchSAM is not a smooth function of  as is            the case of             t SAM FDR values for selected            s for both             t SAM and WelchSAM when             s              was chosen at the  thpercentile            of standard deviations are listed in Table along with            corresponding numbers of significant genes and false            positives                                    Application of Westfall and Young stepdown          adjusted pvalues          Westfall and Youngs stepdown adjusted           p values were calculated using both                    t statistics and Welch statistics          As before the Welch statistics and           p values are not monotonely related          because of the variation in degrees of freedom So we          again calibrated the Welch statistic against the          appropriate           t referent distribution and          determined unadjusted            p values for each permutation The          smallest Westfall and Young adjusted           p values for           t and Welch statistics were            respectively Figure illustrates the relationship          between adjusted           p values and the number of genes          being tested A small simulation shows that this          relationship is governed by the number of true null          hypotheses in the tests unpublished data Profiles for          nine selected genes are displayed           t statistics are presented in          Figure Aand Welchstatistics in Figure B For each          gene the adjusted           p value increased with the increase          of the number of null genes being tested Genes with          smaller statistics had greater adjusted           p values and their adjusted           p values increased at a greater          rate when the number of null genes being tested was          larger                            Discussion                  FWER vs FDR          In a single hypothesis test a Type I error occurs          when a true hypothesis is rejected In multiple testing          FWER refers to the probability of rejection of any true          hypothesis When many hypotheses are tested such as          expression data of thousands of genes being compared          between different groups FWER increases dramatically          and is typically much larger than the significance level          at which the individual hypotheses are tested          As defined by Shaffer given any test procedure an          adjusted           p value corresponding to the test          of a single hypothesis H           j is the level of the entire test          procedure at which H           j would just be rejected given the          values of all test statistics involved     Several          approaches have been proposed to calculate adjusted           p values for the purpose of          providing control of FWER Among these the method          developed by Westfall and Young is best suited for          microarray data analysis It is superior to the          singlestep methods proposed by Bonferroni and idk by          allowing different           p values to be adjusted          differently therefore the power of the procedure is          improved It is also able to take into account the          dependence structure between variables In a biological          system expression levels of groups of genes may          correlate with each other for various reasons such as          coregulation          However when the Westfall and Youngs permutation          algorithm was applied to calculate stepdown adjusted           p values in our dataset only one          of the adjusted           p values from Welch statistics          reached a conventional significance level of  A few          factors might contribute to the absence of adjusted           p values at that significance          level First and foremost the small sample sizes are          limiting Furthermore the unbalanced allocation of           patients and  controls limits the precision of the          adjusted           p values The number of          permutations we can do is only  A more balanced          experimental design will increase the number to            choose  then minus  Second the vast majority of          genes are expressed at low levels as depicted in Figure           where biological signals may become indistinguishable          from noise For those cases where the difference in mean          expression levels is small a pooled standard deviation          that is also small can give rise to a significant          statistic where in fact no difference exists Third          Figure shows that adjusted           p values are sensitive to the          number of null genes being tested Given that many genes          are likely to be irrelevant to the biological processes          underlying the brachial plexus injuries and hence are          expected to show little difference in their expression          levels between injured patients and control subjects it          is not surprising that no significant result was obtained          for           t SAM when applying the complete          data set In Figure we also try to illustrate the          potential abuse of using filtered gene subsets based on          statistics measuring differential expression to achieve          significant results given that such filtering is          commonplace in microarray literature Last although          Westfall and Youngs algorithm is more powerful than          Bonferroni idk and Holm adjustments by taking into          account the joint distribution of the test statistics it          may still be too stringent The same result also occurred          for Tusher           et al    when applying this          algorithm to study the transcriptional response of          lymphoblastoid cells to ionizing radiation A less          stringent method may therefore be needed to analyze          microaray data          The FDR provides a different point of view on how the          errors in multiple testing should be controlled Having          many hypotheses rejected signals clearly that many          hypotheses are not true It is therefore more crucial to          control the rate of false positives among all rejected          hypotheses than the probability of one single erroneous          rejection It might thus be argued that the control of          FDR is a more appropriate approach to dealing with the          multiplicity concern That argument is especially true in          the setting of microarray data analysis where one is          more interested in studying as many relevant genes as          possible and less interested in sacrificing possible          targets for the concern of making one mistake     The          algorithm of SAM proposed by Tusher           et al    provides an estimate          of the FDR for each value of the parameter  in the          application of microarray settings The estimated FDR is          computed from permutation of the data and allows for the          possibility of dependent tests     We derived a set          of  significant genes using SAM out of which  were          false positives giving rise to a FDR of  Although          SAM is not able to disclose the identities of these false          positives it does provide biologists a reasonable set of          potential target genes and a sense of the trustworthiness          of the outcome By estimating FDR by permutations of the          data SAM assumes that all null hypotheses are true          hence the estimated FDR is biased upward Storey and          Tibshirani tackled this problem by multiplying FDR by an          estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses              A detailed description of the          algorithm can be found in Storey and Tibshirani              Following their approach the  false discovery rate is          lowered to about  by assuming that not all hypotheses          are null Further recent comparisons of multiple testing          procedures are provided by Holland and Cheung                                       tstatistics vs Welch statistics          We applied both           t statistics and Welch statistics          The Welch statistics identified a set of genes having          increased expression in the patient group that were not          detected by           t statistics under the same          stringency One can argue that the active genes have          greater variability in gene expression than inactive ones          have     Such a difference will be reflected in          larger variances in the patient group relative to the          control group a scenario more appropriate for Welch          statistics than           t statistics In addition          subjects patients in our analysis might be in different          conditions Some patients might have more tissue damage          andor more severe pain than others Further the patient          group is likely to be inherently more heterogeneous with          respect to the extent of tissue damage and other relevant          yet unmeasured attributes These considerations also          argue for the appropriateness of Welch statistics          Thomas           et al also found that Welch          statistics conformed better than           t statistics to their regression          modeling approach used to discover differentially          expressed genes in a microarray setting where          betweengroup heterogeneity was evident     There          are drawbacks however to using the Welch statistics          Firstly they need to be calibrated introducing          distributional assumptions Secondly and more          importantly there are stability and power concerns that          pertain in small sample settings                                Conclusion        The use of highdensity microarray technology to        identify specific genes that are expressed differently        under one or more biological conditions is particularly        relevant to drug discovery and development However in the        context of microarray data analysis multiple testing        concerns are forefront In this study we attacked the very        important problem of application of appropriate multiple        testing methods in identifying differential gene        expression and in addition we have provided a framework        for future experimental research in brachial plexus        injuries and pain pathways Simple statistical summaries        such as fold change         t statistics and Welch statistics        have been applied To further investigate some recently        proposed multiple testing schemes we compared the        performance of two approaches SAM and Westfall and Young        step down adjusted         p values as applied to a microarray        study of gene expression in a brachial plexus injury Our        results show that using SAM and controlling FDR leads to        identification of a set of potentially interesting genes        consistent with prior knowledge of their function In        addition SAM readily quantitates the tradeoffs between        false discovery rates and numbers of selected genes On the        other hand the Westfall and Young algorithm by        controlling FWER is highly conservative in this small        sample setting To the extent that FWER provides        appreciably more stringent selection attendant findings of        significant differential gene expression are more likely to        be validated by followup experiment than those deriving        from FDRcontrolling methods However there has been        recent recognition      and our study also shows that        FWERcontrol can be unnecessarily stringent since falsely        selecting a few genes will not be a serious problem if the        majority of differentially expressed genes are chosen        correctly In addition to comparing multiple testing        algorithms we also compared the performance of         t statistics and Welch statistics        By taking into account the heterogeneous nature of the        patient group Welch statistics identified a set of genes        having increased expression in the patient group whereas        these genes were not selected by the         t statistics under the same        criteria                    Methods                  Materials          Briefly cervical avulsed human DRG tissues n            were removed in the setting of a dorsal rhizotomy of          lower cervical and upper thoracic in one case nerve          roots in patients with persistent pain syndromes after          accidental avulsion injuries Details on obtaining          processing and measuring the expression of total RNA in          the human DRG and control tissue samples are located          elsewhere httpitsaucsfeduyxiaoAvulsion The          control human DRG sample was pooled from total RNA n            prepared by Clontech obtained from postmortem          tissues The pool of n was then run in triplicate          n Total RNA was extracted from the tissue by Trizol          LifeTechnologies extraction and polyA RNA was          recovered by Oligotex mRNA Spin Columns Qiagen          Biotinylated cRNA targets were prepared and hybridized to          Affymetrix HU oligonucleotide arrays according to the          manufacturers protocol Affymetrix Santa Clara          California                          Data analysis methods                      Normalization            All data from patient and control samples were            preprocessed background subtraction differential            intensities using Affymetrix GeneChip software and            average differential intensity ADI was used for            analysis The average of all ADI values of each chip            was calculated and the mean of average values of all            chips was used as the target intensity The ADI value            of each chip was normalized to be equal to the target            intensity Since negative zero and very small            positive values  of ADI most likely represent            noise instead of actual gene expression all such            values were truncated at  resulting in  probe            sets for analysis                                Graphical display            A QuantileQuantile plot QQ plot was generated by            plotting the quantiles of             t statistics of all genes against            the quantiles of a standard normal distribution In            addition to examining the distribution of             t statistics we used this plot            to observe points that deviate markedly from the bulk            of the observations since they may represent difference            in means of the patient and control groups Four            scatter plots were generated to study the features of            large             t statistics             t

denominators                                Significance Analysis of Microarrays SAM            The SAM procedure described by Tusher             et al     based on the             t statistic under the            assumption of equal variances between the two groups            and the Welch statistic under the assumption of            unequal variances between the two groups was modified            as follows             The relative difference in the expression             di for the             i thof             k   probe sets was defined            as              i                 k             where and are means of expression levels of probe            set             i in the patient and control            groups respectively            For statistics and for Welch statistics  where            and are the variances of expression levels for probe            set             i in the patient and control            groups The determination of             s              is discussed in the Results            section For all             di values corresponding             p values were calculated with             di referenced to an appropriate            t distribution             All             p values were ordered             p                           p                             p                           k                           An exhaustive set of   minus the original            configuration  being  choose  permutations were            conducted For each permutation             b              p values were calculated and            ordered in the way of             Expected             p values for all probe sets were            calculated as  where             i                 k              For a fixed threshold  a probe set was called            significant if its             p value satisfied the criterion             The total number of significant probe sets was            counted The             p                           i              largest among the significant probe set was            defined as the cutoff value             For each permutation all probe sets whose             p values were smaller than the            cutoff value were found and were called falsely            significant The total number of these probe sets was            counted The estimated number of falsely significant            probe sets was defined as the average of the number of            falsely significant probe sets from all permutations            The false discovery rate FDR was computed as the            ratio of the estimated number of falsely significant            probe sets to the total number of significant probe            sets             FDR was computed with different values of            threshold                                 Westfall and Young stepdown adjusted            pvalues            Both             t statistics and Welch            statistics were used to compare gene expression between            the patient and control groups Our data were organized            in a matrix in which each row represents the expression            of one gene for all subjects and each column represents            the expression of all genes for one subject The            permutation algorithm developed by Westfall and Young            to obtain stepdown adjusted             p values was then applied as            follows Note that the procedures were modified when            using Welch statistics Instead of using the Welch            statistic to compute adjusted             p values we used unadjusted             p values derived from Welch            statistics and the appropriate degrees of freedom An            exhaustive set of  permutations were conducted             Compute the             t
