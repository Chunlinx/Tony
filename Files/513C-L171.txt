              March        Dear IDDS Members      Very few dentists will deny that Indiana is lacking in qualified      welltrained dental assistants Indiana University School of Dentistrys      program for Dental Assisting is one of the most outstanding in the state      Yet a few years ago it almost closed its doors due to a lack of      applicants In the same period programs like PCI and Aristotle have had      no problems filling their classrooms      A recent survey of dental assistants showed many of them would have      chosen IUs program if they had known it existed Unfortunately IUs      Dental Assisting program is not listed in the Yellow Pages due to a lack      of funds IUs program is also less expensive than competing programs      Who knows how many people dropped their interest in Dental Assisting when      they heard the tuition costs at other schools Hopefully all of us can      do more internal marketing with our young patients to encourage them to      consider the field of Dental Assisting      We can also offer scholarships to young people interested in attending      IUs program Dont overlook your patients as potential students      Lastly Mr Danny Dean can be contacted about establishing a special      endowment fund to help the Dental Assisting Program conduct more public      relations and advertising and hopefully even list its phone number in the      Yellow Pages Checks should be made out to Indiana University Foundation      and sent directly to the Development Office at IUSD  West Michigan      Street Indianapolis Indiana  Attention Danny Dean A pledge card      and return envelope are enclosed      Each of us needs to be ambassadors for Dentistry within our own      practices and at church athletic and social events Lets do our best      to keep IU s programs fully enrolled and funded Lets head off an      auxiliary crisis before it happens Remember all donations are tax      deductible      Sincerely yours      Virginia W Crose DDS Consultant to IUSD Dental Assisting      Advisory Committee
