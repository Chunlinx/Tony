                                 The BackSlapping Media Elite                        ELLEN            We are on opposite schedules While you were writing yesterdays lastdispatch I was eating noodles and steamed vegetables from a palatable takeoutjoint in Tribeca watching Hardball  and preparing to tuck myalmostyearold son into bed His birthday is next week ironically on thesame date as my mother who passed away  years ago and thats all he cantalk about            You didnt respond to my take on Columbine            On hate crimes I see your point but I think the media andattentionstarved politicians have trivialized the issue The most publicizedhate crime in recent memory was the sad death of Matthew Shepard the gay manin Wyoming I dont believe that was a hate crime designed to send a messageto a whole class of people It was the case of a couple of losers who weredrunk homophobic and out of control It doesnt compare to abortionclinicbombings In any case my point remains Whats the point of hate crimelegislation other than to assuage liberals For example I hope Shepardskillers are fried but they cant be killed twice right            In todays Times  Maureen Dowd comes close perhaps subconsciouslyto endorsing George W Bush She writes about the cocaine question as everypundit is these days and chastises Bush for not answering that query when hesstated that hes been faithful to his wife Yet she closes the piece He seemsto have good instincts and he knows how to get good advice But does thatqualify him to lead the country Thats the substance abuse we should worryabout Dowd is an odd duck Most often she writes about Hollywood fashioneverything trivial while wrapping it up in some political context LastSundays column about Warren Beattys running for president which would be alot of fun no was typical She said he wont because as Carly Simon sang solong ago Hes So Vain She certainly didnt deserve the Pulitzer eventhough its a bogus award an example of the media elite slapping each other onthe back especially when Nat Hentoff now one of the few reasons to read theVoice  was her competitor            But Im behind in my work The classified director from the Voice hasjust moved over to NYPress and she starts today Shell need a quickprimer in NYPress inhouse culture which I guarantee you is fardifferent from our rivals            BestRUSS
