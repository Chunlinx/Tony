                    Background        Cryptosporidiosis is caused by a coccidian parasite         Cryptosporidium  which is        transmitted in its infective form the oocyst by the        fecaloral route     It causes selflimited watery        diarrhea in immunocompetent individuals but can be severe        and life threatening in people with immunosuppressive        conditions     Because of the severe nature of the        disease in the immunocompromised most epidemiologic        studies have focussed on people with HIVAIDS and other        immunosuppressed states           What is known        about transmission patterns in the general US population is        based on studies undertaken during outbreaks of the        disease usually waterborne           Even        though cryptosporidiosis is a reportable disease limited        data are available on the routes of endemic transmission        and on accurate incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis        especially in the immunocompetent population The few        studies that have utilized information on cases detected        via surveillance      have presented only a partial        picture of the risk of cryptosporidiosis because of        incomplete case ascertainment The principal reason for        this is that the disease is underreported by physicians        and laboratories and it is frequently underdiagnosed            Even when people seek care for diarrhea fecal specimen        tests for         Cryptosporidium are not part of the        routine ova and parasites testing protocols In our study        area only two of the  laboratories reporting to the        active surveillance system conduct         Cryptosporidium analysis along with        routine ova and parasite exams on stool specimens        It is possible that sporadic cryptosporidiosis in the        community is transmitted in a different manner from what is        observed in outbreak settings Large outbreaks have been        associated primarily with water including drinking water        from a variety of sources          and from        recreational water contact        Other routes        of transmission have also been identified Foodborne        outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in which the vehicle of        transmission was identified are few and only one outbreak        in Maine was definitively associated with contaminated        freshpressed apple cider     Other foodborne        outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis have implicated food        handlers    and social events             Persontoperson outbreaks have been better documented        such as those in hospitals         and day        care centers      It is becoming increasingly        evident that cryptosporidiosis is one of the multitude of        enteric pathogens that is endemic in hospital and day care        settings        Other routes of exposure to         Cryptosporidium may be responsible        for sporadic disease in the general population such as        specific sexual contact with an infected individual              travel to endemic countries        and        contact with animals both domestic and livestock               Recent studies in Australia have demonstrated that        exposure to persons with diarrhea and swimming in public        pools rather than consumption of untreated tap water are        the sources of communityacquired cryptosporidiosis in that        country     The relative contribution for each of        these modes of transmission to the total burden of sporadic        cryptosporidiosis among immunocompetent persons continues        to be unknown in the US Better definition of the        importance of the factors associated with endemic        cryptosporidiosis would assist public health and regulatory        authorities in making decisions regarding policies and        programs for the control and prevention of        cryptosporidiosis        Cases of cryptosporidiosis are identified through the        California Emerging Infections Program CEIP active        surveillance system which covers selected Northern        California counties During the first year of active        surveillance between June  and May   cases        were identified During the subsequent years through May         the number of cases of cryptosporidiosis detected        were    and  The source of infection remains        unconfirmed for sporadic communityacquired disease in this        region We therefore undertook an incidence density        casecontrol study using prospectively enrolled        immunocompetent cases of cryptosporidiosis identified        through the populationbased active surveillance system        and controls recruited from the general population to        determine the major endemic routes of transmission of        cryptosporidiosis in the San Francisco Bay Area The        primary research question was whether municipal drinking        water was the major source of cryptosporidiosis or whether        there were other exposures more strongly associated with        this disease                    Methods                  Study population          In  the Centers for Disease Control and          Prevention CDC established an active surveillance          system in seven sites around the country as part of the          Emerging Infections Program EIP The California EIP          CEIP surveillance for cryptosporidiosis covers eight          Northern California counties in the San Francisco Bay          Area San Francisco Alameda Contra Costa San Mateo          Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Marin serving an estimated          population of over six million people The California          active surveillance program jointly funded by CDC and          the local water utilities identifies cases by contacting          hospitals and other testing laboratories It is known          that passive reporting is incomplete because these          testing sites often do not report all positive test          results Moreover the active surveillance team asks for          additional patient information which is not present on          routine passive reporting forms Case ascertainment is          therefore more complete for diagnosed cases because of          active detection          Informed consent was obtained from all human adult          participants and from parents or legal guardians of          minors This study received full human subjects approval          for each year during the study period from four          institutional review boards the University of          California Berkeley the California Department of Health          Services the CDC and Public Health Foundation          Enterprises Inc                          Selection of cases and controls          Cases were recruited from those individuals identified          through surveillance who had a stool test that was          positive for           Cryptosporidium  Cases who were          reported to the CEIP from July  through July           were invited to participate in the casecontrol study and          were screened for eligibility before administration of          verbal consent and the questionnaire over the telephone          Of a total of  new cryptosporidiosis cases reported to          the surveillance system   were eligible and          recruited for the study along with  agematched          controls Major reasons for exclusion of cases included          the presence of an immunocompromising condition           participants who were not reachable after  telephone          attempts  and participants who refused interview           All cases and controls were remunerated for their          participation  for a completed interview and an          additional  for controls who provided a stool specimen          used to rule out asymptomatic cryptosporidiosis          Controls were category agematched to cases in all          instances The study attempted to recruit an average of          two to three controls for each case out of six possible          types sexualhousehold nonsexualhousehold          sexualneighborhood nonsexual neighborhood          sexualdifferent water district and nonsexual different          water district These represent all possible combinations          of sexual contact YesNo and location household          neighborhooddifferent water district For all the          nonsexual contacts recruitment was done using sequential          random digit dialing described below For sexual          contacts we asked the case to refer their sexual partners          to us if they wished to participate For household          controls of either type sexual or nonsexual contact was          asked at the end of the interview We were unable to          study each control group separately except for          nonsexualneighborhood controls because of very small          numbers The results are presented for all controls          together as well as for the largest single group          nonsexualneighborhood controls          Progressive and sequential random digit dialing          anchored on the telephone number of the case is a          CDCdesigned sampling scheme that we were required to use          as part of the national study for the enrollment of          neighborhood and different water district agematched          controls When searching for an eligible control for the          first  calls the number to call was determined by          progressively adding  to the last digit of the telephone          number of the case followed by subtracting  from the          last digit of the telephone number of the case for the          second  telephone calls Household controls were          recruited via the case after the case interview was          completed If an agematched household control was          available and willing to participate we also determined          whether they were sexual contacts of cases A random          number generating algorithm was used to identify controls          who lived in other water districts than the cases          Sequential random digit dialing using the random number          was then used to identify controls in the selected water          district          Participation rates for controls could not be          calculated because the recruitment procedure involved          populationbased random digit dialing for which we did          not have a roster for the population controls and          therefore no denominator data                          Exposures          Our questionnaire was based on a standard CDC          foodborne pathogen questionnaire that was adapted          specifically for cryptosporidiosis Most exposure          questions referred to the twoweek period prior to the          onset date for the case The following exposures known          to be transmission routes and risk factors for other          similar enteric pathogens were studied drinking water          quality ie sources and posttap treatment methods          and quantity measured in glasses per day at home and          outside the home travel recreational water exposure          including types of swimming locations and entering hot          tubs persontoperson fecal exposures specifically          contact with childcare centers diapered and ill          individuals consumption of risky food items risky          foods refers to a list of standard food items asked in          the CDC foodborne questionnaires eg salads cold          cutsmeats raw vegetablesfruits raw oystersshellfish          ciderjuice consumption of unpasteurized foods and          handling of raw foods zoonotic contact including farm          animals and pets and for adults over  years of age          details on specific sexual practices Sexual contact was          retained as a separate category apart from other          persontoperson fecal exposures since unlike exposure          to diapers and individuals in diapers it may or may not          involve exposure to feces Additional information          gathered included demographic characteristics and health          status indicators          Although all questions asked of the subjects refer to          the two weeks prior to development of cryptosporidiosis          and the statement is reiterated at several points during          the questionnaire it is likely that people do not recall          exact consumption but tend to describe their usual          patterns when asked about routine habits such as          consumption of drinking water For those who were          traveling during the risk period this may or may not be          the case          For analytic purposes composite variables for the          exposure classification of cases and controls were          created based on the biologic construct for each major          mode of transmission For drinking water the potential          of consuming oocystcontaminated water was considered          Three categories were identified those who drank          exclusively boiled water those who drank bottled or          filtered water and those who drank any amount of tap          water without further treatment There were three sources          of foodborne cryptosporidiosis consumption of risky          foods consumption of unpasteurized food products and          handling of raw or uncooked items All three          subcategories were evaluated in the analysis          Recreational water exposure included swimming entering          hot tubs or hot springs The three persontoperson fecal          exposures were contact with childcare settings contact          with individuals with diarrhea and exposure to diapers          or diapered individuals Animal contact referred to any          type of contact with any animal There were two travel          questions which were not combined because they represent          different levels of potential exposure to           Cryptosporidium  traveling more          than  miles from home and traveling to another          country Of the detailed sexual practices questions only          two were asked of all adults whether they had had any          sexual relations in the twoweek risk period prior to the          onset date of the index case and the number of sexual          partners in the last six months The remaining questions          on specific sexual practices were contingent on the          respondent answering yes to the first question there          were insufficient data to address the role of these          behaviors A dichotomous sexual activity variable was          constructed based on any sexual relations in the twoweek          risk period and more than one sexual partner in the last          six months                          Analyses          Because of the large number of specific exposure          variables and the small sample size we realized that we          did not have the power to study each specific exposure          for which we had collected data Therefore after a          preliminary conditional logistic regression analysis of          the univariate odds ratios we decided to create one          composite variable for each of the major transmission          route categories to allow a more meaningful analysis For          univariate analyses  variables were evaluated For the          multivariate analyses  composite variables were          created           a priori based on transmission          route and then evaluated The collapsed variables          described in the Exposures section were based on the          clinical relevance of the exposures as routes of          transmission for           Cryptosporidium oocysts The          reduction of analytic variables by combining several          subcategories was determined prior to conducting further          multivariate analyses Because drinking water is known to          be the major epidemic route of transmission of           Cryptosporidium  this study aimed          at understanding its importance in nonoutbreak          situations Therefore in all multivariate models the          drinking water variable was retained regardless of its          statistical significance Multivariate conditional          logistic regression models were constructed using          variables that were significant in the composite          univariate analyses All analyses were performed using          Stata  Stata Corporation College Station TX                            Results                  Univariate analyses          The study was only able to enroll nonsexual contacts          for each category of controls Two household sexual          contact controls were enrolled but the numbers were too          small to be useful in subanalyses All  of the          controls who agreed to have their stool tested for           Cryptosporidium had negative test          results The baseline and demographic characteristics of          cases and controls are presented in Table  The          distribution of gender race Hispanic ethnicity and          chronic medical conditions for controls was similar to          that of cases Because controls were matched across          counties for different water district controls it is not          possible to compare the distribution of county of          residence between cases and controls this is shown for          descriptive purposes only Since chronic medical          condition was not found to be a significant factor in the          univariate analysis we did not pursue this further in          multivariate modeling          We compared demographic data obtained through routine          surveillance of nonenrolled immunocompetent          cryptosporidiosis cases to the cases enrolled in the          study Nonenrolled cases were mostly male  and           were between the ages of  and  years The race          and ethnicity distributions of those enrolled and not          enrolled were very similar specifically nonenrolled          cases were  white and  Hispanic Of the           immunocompetent cases who did not participate in the          casecontrol study and for whom we had data broad risk          factor information was only available for  Therefore          no risk factor comparisons were made with the enrolled          cases          Univariate odds ratios were determined for each of the          individual questions on the questionnaire using          conditional logistic regression data not shown          Protective factors included filtering drinking water at          home OR  CI    drinking three or          more glasses of water at home OR  CI             handling raw or uncooked meat OR  CI             and raw or uncooked vegetables OR           CI    and suburban as opposed to urban          area of residence OR  CI    The          adverse risk factors in the univariate analyses were          consuming ice outside the home OR  CI             or meals outside the home OR  CI             per meal consumed living in an urban area          OR CI    and traveling over           miles from home OR CI    or to          another country OR CI    Of          borderline significance was increased sexual activity          measured as number of sexual partners in the last           months OR CI    increase per sexual          partner          Frequencies and univariate odds ratios with           confidence intervals and           p values for the association with          cryptosporidiosis of the composite variables were          calculated for each major transmission category and are          presented in Table  Handling raw or uncooked foods          ie meat fruit or vegetables was significantly          protective OR  CI    whereas          travel displayed a significantly higher risk either over           miles from home OR  CI    or          to another country OR  CI             The association of cryptosporidiosis with drinking          water was studied by comparing those who only drank          boiled water to those who drank tap water with no further          treatment The univariate odds ratio for drinking tap          water with no further treatment was not significant OR           CI    Unfortunately this pure          ie drinking only boiled water subgroup consists of          just over half of the total study population            of the total cases and   of the total controls          In a more complete analysis the remaining intermediate          risk group was also compared This consisted of those who          either filter their drinking water or drink bottled          water The results were similar to the previous analysis          for filtered or bottled water OR  CI             and for untreated tap water OR  CI             The test for linear trend was not          significant                          Multivariate analyses          Multivariate conditional logistic regression models          were constructed using the composite covariates that were          significant in the univariate analysis Specifically we          constructed models for handling raw or uncooked food          items and travel either to another country or more than           miles from home The drinking water variable was          included in these analyses since the association of          drinking water with cryptosporidiosis was the primary          hypothesis under examination in this study Separate          models were analyzed for both the entire study population          and for the subset with neighborhood controls only The          neighborhood controls provide a comparison to the cases          that is unbiased by the source of drinking water since          neighborhoods are supplied by the same water utility The          results of the initial models are shown in Table  The          magnitude of the adjusted odds ratio for potential          exposure to           Cryptosporidium oocysts via          unboiled drinking water ranged from  to  for          neighborhood controls and from  to  for all          controls Travel to another country was significantly          associated with cryptosporidiosis in the analysis using          all controls OR  CI    and          borderline significant for the subset with neighborhood          controls OR  CI    Multivariate          models were also built with the pure drinking water          exposure which compared boiled to tap water drinkers          data not shown but the only exposure associated with          cryptosporidiosis was travel to another country OR           CI    for all controls          Final multivariate models evaluating the association          of drinking water and travel to another country with          cryptosporidiosis are presented in Table for all          controls and for the subset using only neighborhood          controls The odds ratios estimated for drinking water          were not significant among those who drank filtered or          bottled water the point estimates were  all          controls and  neighborhood controls only that          among boiled water drinkers and this estimate was           all controls and  neighborhood controls among          those who drank tap water without further treatment or          processing There was no evidence suggesting that local          drinking water is an important source of          cryptosporidiosis in this population The risk of          cryptosporidiosis for those who undertook foreign travel          was significant with a point estimate of   CI            for neighborhood controls and   CI            for all controls There were insufficient data          with which to study interactions between drinking water          risk and foreign travel The only subgroup that could be          analyzed was tap water yes versus filter or bottle          no among the subset who did not travel out of the          country which demonstrated a nonsignificant odds ratio          of   CI                              Discussion        In the US the potential for drinking water to be        associated with cryptosporidiosis among immunocompetent        persons is relevant since most major known outbreaks of        cryptosporidiosis involved transmission through        contaminated water                      Additionally other modes of transmission are of interest        because of published reports implicating them such as        food travel institutionassociated sexual behavior        etc                                      This study was undertaken as        the first populationbased study in the United States of        risk factors for endemic cryptosporidiosis in        immunocompetent persons        The major finding in this study was that travel to        another country is a very strong and significant risk        factor for cryptosporidiosis transmitted in nonoutbreak        settings in the San Francisco Bay Area This is consistent        with studies of other enteric pathogens      In        fact intestinal protozoa are the most common infecting        organisms identified in travelers with chronic diarrhea        the precise etiology of travelers diarrhea is unclear but        it is believed that duration of stay hygiene and level of        socioeconomic development in the host country are        associated with acquisition of infection     The        current study was unable to evaluate any of these factors        because of limited sample size but it was observed that         of the  cases  who traveled outside the United        States traveled to Central America or Mexico compared to        one out of three controls  This finding is very        similar to a laboratorybased survey conducted in the        mids in Canada where  of the cases of        cryptosporidiosis had traveled to Mexico     There is        however a possibility that ascertainment bias could be the        reason that foreign travel was found to be a significant        risk factor in our study If patients presenting with        diarrhea who have traveled recently are more likely to have        a fecal sample taken then this will appear as a risk        factor Since we have no information on the likelihood of        diagnosis given travel history in the clinical setting in        the Bay Area we were unable to evaluate whether this was        indeed the case        Another important finding of this study is that        consumption of tap water without further treatment or        processing was not associated with cryptosporidiosis when        compared to drinking boiled water Our data were too few to        allow further evaluation of the fact that there was a        consistent finding of an increased point estimate for tap        water in the adjusted analyses The adjusted analyses        involved the composite variables described in the Methods        section with the purpose of constructing the most        parsimonious model The reversion of the odds ratio for        water from a protective effect in the univariate analysis        to an elevated risk in the multivariate is probably        associated with its interaction with travel Because of the        small numbers in this study this interaction could not be        addressed  either by looking at interactions in the model        or via a stratified analysis We do however feel that the        results in this paper will greatly benefit the design and        planning of future studies of cryptosporidiosis        particularly with respect to understanding the relationship        between water consumption and travel        A study conducted in South Australia in  using a        similar approach found that only waterrelated risks ie        rain and spring water consumption were significantly        associated with cryptosporidiosis     But more        powerful recent studies in the same country found no        elevated risk for plain tap water consumption            Given our difficulties in recruitment and sometimes        conflicting data such studies must be done in multiple        communities simultaneously to obtain an accurate picture of        the local situation The larger CDC study which will pool        data from all seven EIP sites around the country may be        able to better address the issue of drinking waterrelated        risk factors because of the resulting larger sample size        However even with a larger dataset the multisite study        will not be able to clarify the risk of cryptosporidiosis        from drinking water specifically for residents of the San        Francisco Bay Area        Our planned sample size determined by available        funding was for  cases and  controls Such a sample        size would allow the detection of a difference of  in        exposure to tap water between cases and controls with         power and a  level of statistical significance We        assumed based on consumer survey data from the Water        Quality Association httpwwwwqaorg that  of the        controls used tap water without further treatment Based on        the difference in exposure to tap water that we actually        observed  a study would require approximately         cases and  controls to detect a statistically        significant difference in the use of tap water Wide        confidence intervals for some of the other point estimates        indicate that clinically important findings cannot be        conclusively ruled out for residents of the San Francisco        Bay Area        An intriguing observation in this study is that        exposures that would generally be considered to increase        the risk of cryptosporidiosis such as contact with fecal        matter exposure to raw or uncooked food items and animal        contact did not have elevated risks One theoretical        explanation for this was offered by Casemore    who        expressed the opinion that longterm lowlevel exposures        to oocysts in raw vegetables and in unpasteurized products        may confer protection by boosting the immune system The        recent Australian studies also found significant protective        effects of contact with pets and consumption of uncooked        vegetables     Indeed it is likely that acquisition        of specific antibodies and an effective protective cellular        immune response requires repeated exposure             Although the exposures in this study were assessed for the        twoweek risk period prior to the onset date of the case        it is probable that some of these exposures are no        different in the long and the short term which may account        for the protective effect Serologic evaluation of cases        and controls for immunity to cryptosporidiosis prior to        enrollment may be a worthwhile addition to such        casecontrol studies Serologic definitions of         Cryptosporidium exposure were        considered as a potential outcome for the current study        especially for controls but were not feasible due to        resource and logistic constraints Because symptomatic        cryptosporidiosis cases represent only a small fraction of        those who may be infected with         Cryptosporidium  the conclusions        drawn from a study such as ours may not apply to those        asymptomatically infected                    Conclusions        Future studies that aim to address the drinking water        issue in greater detail must bear in mind the appropriate        metric for measuring individual exposure to potentially        oocystcontaminated drinking water A continuous measure        that explicitly differentiates between the amount of tap        and of other types of water consumed would more likely        suitably address the issue In addition studies that aim        to assess the impact of travel to endemic countries will        also need to conceptualize the myriad causal pathways and        the possible role of each route of transmission eg        waterborne foodborne persontoperson comprising the        complex web of factors that are responsible for travelers        diarrhea More detailed studies will be required to        elucidate the specific behaviors and practices that expose        travelers to         Cryptosporidium in endemic countries        and possibly the determinants of protective immunity in        these individuals Studies are required that stratify        subjects on the basis of their travel history prior to        analyzing other cryptosporidiosis exposures so that it is        possible to distinguish between the specific travel and        nontravel associated risk factors In particular the        differentiation must be made between the quantity of        different types of water consumed in the United States and        that consumed in other less developed countries                    Competing interests        None
