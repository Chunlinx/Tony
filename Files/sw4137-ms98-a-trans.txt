        lets see mines pretty easy actually uh i just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new Saturns     uhhuh   um and although i cant afford it right now i would just like love to have one   oh really you like uh so youre an American you want to buy American   well no regardless of that fact its the best car in the class for the best cheapest amount of money im interested in having it for uh doing a little auto cross racing uh closed circuit racing and uh it seems to just blow the competition competition competition away   um in terms of handling uh acceleration   handling power everything yeah it just got like the top rating it was compared up against uh lets see there was like the Mazda M X three uh Nissans whatever their two N X two thousand the Civic S I and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it   what about Mustang GTs   Mustang GTs uh cant afford it   those so youre talking about ones in a lower lower end price price range   right yeah im a graduate student lets face it i dont make any money so   right       well you can wait till you graduate and youll have plenty of money you can buy whatever you want   yeah       yeah well see then yeah right now im stuck i ive got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that its fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing but its it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the go Saturn   right would you use that for city driving and racing   oh yeah id do it id use it for both the nice thing about auto crossing is you can you can do both   auto crossing is what kind of track is that   uh just like a um um set up a lot of times and its like really large uh parking lots   okay and you put up set up the track pylons okay   and pylons and things tight turns hard acceleration ive seen a lot of Mustangs uh compete and its interesting they get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class   oh really yeah i would guess so   yeah uh what are you thinking about buying   uh i think id like to get uh BMW or if i go the German route which im kind of leaning towards right now but uh or maybe a Honda i mean a a Acura Legend   the Legend   uh a Lexus   uh   uh S C three hundred maybe   uhhuh   something on that order i havent really determined if i like the the Japanese or the if i like them enough to purchase one     yeah   you know because your BMWs your German cars have good reputations i think   yeah well i was i was actually in uh a lot of the BMWs are produced in uh  uh Stuttgart and uh and Munich and i was i was there this uh summer   yes   i i was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for BMW   the yeah they their they have the whole philosophy i mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking theyre better       which is kind of hard to take   yeah uh   i mean as youre walking through that little tour in uh Munich its kind of  theyre trying to brainwash you too   oh of course of course they are they want you to buy their car yeah there it was it was interesting i was at i i also went to uh the Porsche and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed   oh really   yeah the uh yeah the uh the BMW is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and and then you go to Porsche and its like well uh these cars are completely handmade and no two of them are alike   um         yeah thats   and so its like completely opposed i dont know which do i like better i think i like the Porsches philosophy a little bit better although its not really practical   no its not realistic   unless its its a toy   yeah if you can afford that kind of a toy then i guess so   lets face it yeah yeah but it it BMWs good for that what kind of driving just like commuting youd want to do it use it for     yeah just work short trips no mileage no heavy mileage im putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year   wow yeah   so its pretty minimal   thats cool   lasts a long time thats mainly what im looking for   yeah thats good i also i was impressed by uh by the Mercedes too   oh yeah   i really i really like the Mercedes the factory was nice and   but but if if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop theyre going to theyre going to hit you up for just all kinds of things   and is it different for the for the BMW   uh i think well something on the order of a three series its probably different once you get up in the five series and higher then   probably   all your repair costs go up significantly   right  i  can imagine that   so im kind yeah im not sure if i really want
