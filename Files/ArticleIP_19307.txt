                                 Free Willy            The Financial Times of London whichnever tires of publishing judicious editorials about Flytrap drew itsconclusions about the impeachment trial Wednesday While the trial wastechnically legal it had failed the crucial test set by the founding fathersthat such a process must inspire public confidence This is because thevehemence with which Kenneth Starr pursued the president is now seen by manyas an unacceptable constraint on executive power The obvious lesson was thatthe independent counsel law should be redesigned when it comes up for reviewby Congress at the end of June so that the choice of counsel be made in a wayboth independent of party politics and yet seen to be democratic TheFT said Selection by a panel appointed by the judiciary would be anoption            Another lesson of the impeachment was that thelimit to partisanship implied by the US Constitution was breached in thiscase when the House of Representatives sent Mr Clinton to trial in the Senateat the same time as some of its members suggested that censure rather thanimpeachment was the aim  It is incumbent on the House to recognise that animpeachment trial should be a way of protecting the office of president notpunishing the man The paper added Mr Clinton has certainly been shamed bythe process But the ultimate victims could be the pursuers not the pursuedThat surely was not the founding fathers aim An oped article in theTimes of London by its Washington correspondent Bronwen Maddox saidWednesday that the waste and misery generated by Flytrap left a sour tastebut it may have prompted a neat political reversal helping to put Democratsback in control of the House of Representativesand a Republican in the WhiteHouse            In the Daily Telegraph Ambrose EvansPritchard the most determined antiClinton journalist inBritain said in an oped that it was time to admit defeat He blamed theRepublicans for letting the president off the hook by the btise  ofindicting him on Monica Lewinsky charges instead of on the politicisation ofthe Justice Department and the FBI that forms the core scandal pervading theabuses of this administration He concluded So the man caught redhanded inperjury obstruction of justice and ungallantly smearing his lover as ademented stalker is hailed as the winner The world knows that he is guiltybut he is the one enjoying a victory cigar What a way to end the th century            The stories dominating the European press Wednesday werein France the opening of the manslaughter trial of

Italian governments sudden immigrationdecree which it said could generate xenophobia and racism Such a crucialproblem as immigration can only be confronted in a spirit of bipartisanship inwhich the
