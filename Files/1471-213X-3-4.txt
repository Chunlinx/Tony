                    Background        Endochondral ossification is the process by which        mesenchymal cells condense at specific sites and        differentiate into chondrocytes forming the cartilage        anlagen that are the model for the future bone The cells        in the center of the anlagen which are initially immature        undergo an ordered differentiation program    also        called chondrocyte maturation     the chondrocytes        proliferate become prehypertrophic and then undergo        hypertrophy and matrix calcification The calcified        cartilage is then invaded by blood vessels that bring        osteoblasts and osteoclasts and bone is formed Each step        of cartilage maturation occurs in a precise and tightly        regulated manner     Disruptions of this process cause        abnormalities in cartilage and bone formation             Endochondral ossification occurs in embryonic skeletal        formation in skeletal growth and fracture healing        Homeobox genes of the Hox class are required for proper        patterning of skeletal elements     The functional role        of Hox genes in skeletal growth and development has been        clearly demonstrated but how they control the        differentiation of specific tissues is not well understood        Hox genes encode transcription factors that regulate the        expression of yet unidentified target genes     In        order to identify such target genes and to better        understand the role of Hox genes in cartilage        differentiation and maturation we established         in vitro culture systems for primary        mouse rib chondrocytes        Previously we generated transgenic mice that        overexpress the homeobox transcription factor Hoxc in the        thoracic region where Hoxc is normally expressed            and unpublished results The transgenic mice exhibit        profound cartilage defects predominantly in ribs and        vertebral column and severity of defects depends on        transgene dosage The abnormal cartilage is characterized        by an accumulation of proliferating chondrocytes and        reduced cartilage maturation The structural rigidity of        rib cartilage is greatly compromised fatally interfering        with pulmonary function and vertebral cartilage is so weak        that the skeleton often disassembles during skeletal        preparation     These results suggest that Hoxc        continues to regulate skeletal development well beyond        pattern formation in a tissuespecific manner presumably        by controlling the progression of cells along the        chondrocyte differentiation pathway We found a similar        phenotype upon overexpression of Hoxd in our transgenic        system Kappen manuscript in preparation whereas        overexpression of the LIMhomeodomain transcription factor        Isl did not cause abnormalities in cartilage but other        developmental defects      The observation that        cartilage is affected by misregulation of Hoxc and        Hoxd but not by a divergent homeobox gene indicates        that the capacity to regulate cartilage differentiation is        specific to homeobox genes of the Hox subclass It also        suggests that Hox genes could be involved in human        chondrodysplasias and other cartilage disorders We        envisioned that welldefined         in vitro culture systems would allow        us to further characterize the cellular and molecular basis        of abnormal chondrocyte differentiation in Hox transgenic        mice Detailed knowledge of regulatory mechanisms in        endochondral ossification will be essential for strategies        to manipulate chondrocyte proliferation differentiation        and maturation in skeletal growth and development        osteochondrodysplasias and fracture healing        The         in vitro chondrocyte culture systems        we utilized here consisted of highdensity cultures of        primary rib chondrocytes from neonatal mice The micromass        culture system    provides the threedimensional        environment needed for chondrogenesis cartilage maturation        and hypertrophy The system also allows the investigation        of the continuous program of differentiation maturation        and hypertrophy in the same culture The cellular phenotype        in culture was characterized by morphology and        extracellular matrix ECM production Chondrocyte        maturation was assessed on the basis of cell proliferation        cellular hypertrophy alkaline phosphase activity and        expression of Collagen type II and type X Apoptosis was        investigated by TUNEL terminal deoxynucleotidyl        transferasemediated deoxyuridine triposphate nick end        labeling High density bulk cultures were used to assess        the capacity of chondrocytes from Hoxc transgenic mice        for cell proliferation and differentiation Proliferation        of chondrocytes         in vivo was assayed by BrdU        incorporation and gene expression was analyzed by        realtime quantitative PCR                    Results        We previously reported    that Hoxc transgenic mice        exhibit profound defects in cartilage particularly in the        rib cage and vertebral column The cartilage is        structurally insufficient and weak contains fewer        hypertrophic chondrocytes displays much reduced staining        for sulfated proteoglycans and consists predominantly of        immature chondrocytes with a high fraction of        proliferating cells These results point to a role of        Hoxc in regulation of cartilage maturation and        chondrocyte differentiation A similar phenotype is found        in Hoxd transgenic mice     and Kappen manuscript in        preparation indicating that Hox transcription factors        regulate chondrocyte development To examine this function        in more detail we employed a culture system that        facilitates chondrocyte maturation and cartilage formation        and closely recapitulates the         in vivo situation     The        micromass system has been used extensively for studies of        cartilage formation from limb mesenchyme              and also for culture of chondrocytes in high density            Here we have adapted the system to neonatal mouse rib        chondrocytes to study the role of Hoxc in chondrocyte        maturation        As established previously chondrocytes in micromass        culture are able to progress along their differentiation        pathway to hypertrophy     In cultures of neonatal rib        chondrocytes we find essentially the same results As        shown in Figure  histology Panels A and E and        immunohistochemistry for Collagens II and X Figure         Panels C D and G H revealed appropriate cellular        morphology as well as increase in cell size towards        hypertrophy Figure  Panels E G H and extracellular        matrix production Figure  Panel F BrdU incorporation        identified proliferating cells early in the culture Figure         Panels J K while virtually no dividing cells were        detected by day  Figure  Panel L The proportion of        proliferating cells was lower at the beginning of the        culture Figure  Panel A reflecting our observation        that cells may need about  days to adapt to the culture        conditions Maximal proliferation was found on days  and         consistent with the presence of predominantly        proliferating cells in the culture compare Figure  Panel        A and Figure  Panel I Manifesting their progression to        hypertrophy the size of cells increased Figure  Panel        B with the majority of cells progressed to hypertrophy by        day  see also Figure  Concommittant with cartilage        ECM deposition there was an increase in Alkaline        Phosphotase activity Figure  Panel C As cells matured        towards hypertrophy there was also increased cell death in        our micromass cultures Figure  Panel D Apoptosis as        assessed by TUNEL was present from day  on and the        percentage of positive cells increased with time in        culture Similar results were reported by other authors              These results demonstrate that the cultured        rib chondrocytes behaved in a similar manner as        chondrocytes         in vivo  Taken together primary rib        chondrocytes from mouse neonates grown in micromass culture        display cellular differentiation proliferation maturation        and hypertrophy recapitulating the chondrocyte maturation        program         in vivo  These results establish the        utility of this         in vitro system to investigate the        role of Hox genes and other transcription factors in        endochondral ossification        Rib chondrocytes from neonatal Hoxc transgenic mice        were cultured in the micromass system and the cultures        were examined for the same parameters described above        Figure shows that Hoxc transgenic chondrocytes        morphologically appeared normal and were able to produce        Collagens II and X and sulfated proteoglycans Panels C        G I D H J and B F respectively There was no        discernable difference in the ability of Hoxc transgenic        chondrocytes to grow or mature in this system compare to        Figure  Panels AH These data indicate that        chondrocytes from Hoxc transgenic mice have the capacity        to differentiate and mature normally under the culture        conditions described here This finding was unexpected in        light of the severe cartilage defects in Hoxc transgenic        mice     However the possibility remained that        despite apparently normal maturation proliferation of        chondrocytes could be affected by the Hoxc        overexpression Such an effect would be consistent with the        accumulation of immature proliferating chondrocytes in        Hoxc transgenetic mice     We therefore characterized        cell proliferation in Hoxc transgenic chondrocytes                In vivo labeling with BrdU was        performed to investigate the proliferative status of        chondrocytes in Hoxc transgenic mice Previously we           found that upon overexpression of Hoxc the vertebral        cartilages accumulate immature chondrocytes and we showed        that these cells are proliferating cells by virtue of        staining for Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen PCNA The        accumulation of proliferating chondrocytes could be        explained in four different scenarios          i  There is a block in differentiation        that prevents cells from entering hypertrophy The        proportion of hypertrophic cells was indeed reduced in        Hoxc transgenic mice but progression to hypertrophy was        not completely inhibited          ii  There is increased recruitment of        precursor cells into the chondrocyte cell lineage This        proposition is difficult to investigate and no evidence is        available at this stage          iii  The rate of cell division is        increased Then the cell cycle duration of proliferating        chondrocytes should be shorter          iv  The cell cycle time of        proliferating chondrocytes is lengthened resulting in a        greater number of cells in the steadystate pool of        proliferating cells To distinguish these latter two        possibilities we analyzed BrdU incorporation into        chondrocytes in Hoxc transgenic mice         in vivo  Multiple sections were        examined from each embryo and showed incorporation of BrdU        four hours after labeling Figure shows representative        results for the immunohistochemical detection of BrdU        incorporation in cartilage structures Panels A D To        directly compare cell proliferation between embryos of        different genotype sections of vertebral centers were        assessed for BrdU incorporation Figure  Panel E shows        results from embryos isolated at day  post coitum The        differences in cell numbersection of vertebral center        indicate that individual embryos were more progressed in        overall growth than others and thus had larger vertebral        centers with more cells overall Maturation was consistent        within a given litter compare samples   to   and          to   respectively The fraction of cells positive        for BrdU incorporation was between  and  with a        trend towards lower rates of incorporation in        developmentally older embryos with higher Hoxc transgene        expression levels TATA TR Figure  Panel F While        additional measurements at later stages of development        would be needed to confirm whether this is a continuous        trend for cartilage development in late pregnancy in Hoxc        overexpressing animals these results were initially        unexpected The phenotype of Hoxc transgenic animals at         days approximately  days later than assayed here is        characterized by accumulation of proliferating cells        Intuitively the expectation would be that greater rates of        BrdU incorporation should be found However accumulation        of proliferating cells can also result from a slowdown of        the cell cycle in form of a lower rate of BrdU        incorporation It is intriguing to note that reduced BrdU        incorporation is particularly detected in developmentally        older animals where the vertebral centers are made up of a        larger number of cells reflecting a longer duration since        commitment of the precursors to chondrocyte fate It should        also be noted that both genotypes assayed here develop        cartilage defects which may explain the relatively        moderate differences A prediction from these data is that        on subsequent days or upon longer labeling intervals even        lower rates of BrdU incorporation should be detected        Quantification of such findings and         in vivo measurements of cell cycle        duration however require pulsechase experiments             which involve large numbers of animals and are very        timeconsuming        Instead we sought to investigate the proliferative        capacity of chondrocytes from Hoxc transgenic mice by        using         in vitro assays We performed cell        cycle assays on primary chondrocytes isolated from rib        cages of transgenic and control neonates Chondrocytes were        placed into high density bulk cultures     where they        initially continued to proliferate and later        differentiated with cartilage nodules present by  days        after plating Figure shows representative cultures        Figure  Panels AC and the growth curve for rib        chondrocytes in high density bulk cultures Figure  Panel        D From this we were able to estimate a mean doubling        time of  hours This conforms well to previous        published measurements for chick limb chondrocytes           and rat chondrocytes         in vitro     The linear phase of        growth was observed between days  and  and therefore the         hour time point was chosen for analysis of cell cycle        kinetics of Hoxc transgenic chondrocytes         in vitro  First we established the        Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting FACS assay using        mouse embryonic fibroblasts and then we assayed rib        chondrocytes from Hoxc transgenic and control mice in        high density bulk cultures From these cultures cells were        removed at various timepoints after BrdU incorporation and        subjected to Flow cytometry Figure Panels AE shows a        typical result for fibroblasts The same readout was used        for cultures of primary rib chondrocytes Figure  Panels        FO As cells go through the cell cycle DNA content        increases and this is reflected in a concomitant increase        in BrdU incorporation Upon division the signal for DNA        content is reduced by half while overall BrdU        incorporation increases with every subsequent cell cycle        These assays allowed us to determine the fraction of cells        in each stage of the cell cycle Figure  Panel A and        established FACS analysis as a valuable tool for the        analysis of chondrocyte proliferation        Interestingly when primary chondrocytes from Hoxc        transgenic mice were assayed they showed the same cell        cycle kinetics as chondrocytes from control animals        Essentially similar proportions of cells in S phase were        found in all cultures Figure  Panel B This was        regardless of levels of expression of the Hoxc transgene        Figure  Panel B which increases with increasing        transgene dosage      These data indicate that after        appropriate time in culture transgenic chondrocytes were        able to proliferate normally at least over the  hours        duration of the assay        Given our inability to distinguish Hoxc transgenic        cells from controls by parameters for either cell        differentiation or proliferation we sought to determine        which molecular differences exist in our transgenic mice        associated with the documented deficiencies in cartilage        maturation     To this end we analyzed gene expression        in freshly isolated primary rib chondrocytes from Hoxc        transgenic animals     Realtime quantitative PCR was        performed As shown in Figure  Hoxc expression is        elevated in Hoxc transgenic mice as expected            Differences also exist between controls and transgenics in        expression levels for several genes involved in cartilage        development For example Collagen II expression splice        form A is increased as is Ihh mRNA and Bmp and p        expression are decreased Taken together these results        establish alterations in gene expression upon        overexpression of the Hoxc transgene in the developing        skeleton        The biological corollaries of changes in gene expression        profiles are noteworthy in that they may provide evidence        on the molecular targets of Hox genes in cartilage as well        as on the consequences of Hox gene overexpression In        Hoxc transgenic chondrocytes we found increased        expression of Collagen II splice form A mRNA     This        is consistent with our earlier finding of at least fold        increased Collagen II mRNA expression by in situ        hybridization and increased numbers of immature        chondrocytes in Hoxc transgenic mice     Sox which        is normally expressed in proliferating chondrocytes             is elevated in Hoxc transgenic cells again        consistent with accumulation of immature chondrocytes        Unexpected was the elevated expression of Collagen X mRNA        a marker for hypertrophic cells As fewer hypertrophic        cells are present in Hoxc transgenics and cartilage        maturation is delayed in Hoxctransgenic animals            one would expect to see decreased Collagen X mRNA levels            Yet the data clearly indicate that mRNA expression        is elevated in transgenic rib chondrocytes This could be        either from increased Collagen X mRNA transcription within        prehypertrophic and hypertrophic cells or from ectopic        activation of Collagen X transcription in proliferating        chondrocytes Whether either of these possibilities would        also increase Collagen X expression at the protein level        remains to be investigated Interestingly Collagen X        expression has been shown to be induced by Bmp            which is overexpressed in our transgenic mice Bmp        signaling has a positive effect on chondrocyte        proliferation     and can induce Indian hedgehog Ihh        expression in responsive cells     We find Ihh mRNA        elevated in Hoxc transgenic chondrocytes see Figure         Ihh can induce Bmp expression in proliferating cells        further increasing positive effects on chondrocyte        proliferation     At the same time Ihh decreases the        rate of progression to hypertrophy      again        consistent with an accumulation of proliferating cells in        our transgenic animals Whether the elevated Ihh mRNA        levels originate from increased expression in cells that        make Ihh normally prehypertrophic and hypertrophic        chondrocytes or from ectopic activation by the Hox        transcription factors in proliferating cells remains to be        investigated Greater numbers of prehypertrophic cells are        unlikely to account for elevated expression of        prehypertrophic cell markers histological sections from        Hoxc transgenic animals show no increase in        prehypertrophic cells     and PTHrP receptor mRNA        levels are unchanged in cells from transgenic animals see        Figure  These data also suggest that PTHrP signaling             is only moderately affected by overexpression of        Hoxc We found the expression of p mRNA and Bmp mRNA        to be decreased which if reflected in reduced protein        levels would be consistent with the phenotype of delayed        cartilage maturation in Hox transgenic animals As Bmp        was shown to have a positive effect on hypertrophy and        inhibitory effect on proliferation      decreased        Bmp expression would be expected to promote chondrocyte        proliferation p has been shown to be required for exit        from the cell cycle      and reduced p expression        is associated with deregulated proliferation Also        chondrocytes without p expression fail to respond to        inhibitory signals from FGFs     The relationship to        elevated Fgf receptor  mRNA levels in Hoxc transgenic        cells however remains to be clarified The same caveat        applies to elevated expression in Hoxc transgenic cells        of p which is also known to be linked to cell cycle        exit and FGF response     While the profile of gene        expression changes in Hoxc transgenic mice is suggestive        of interactions between the various gene products further        studies will be required to mechanistically link the gene        expression differences to the maturational delay in the        Hoxc transgenic cartilage        In summary the gene expression profiles of primary        chondrocytes from Hoxc transgenic animals display notable        differences in the expression of regulators of chondrocyte        maturation in a pattern largely consistent with delayed        chondrocyte maturation         in vivo  These results now allow us        to investigate whether any of these molecules is directly        regulated by Hox transcription factors in chondrocytes It        is also remarkable as apparent from our cell culture        results that cells with obvious molecular differences        downstream of Hoxc expression can be modulated to        resemble a normal chondrocyte phenotype after a few days in        culture                    Discussion        Our studies of chondrocytes from Hoxc transgenic mice        reveal several interesting results         in vivo  chondrocytes remain        relatively immature with few progressing to hypertrophy in        Hoxc transgenic mice Combined with the fact that some        albeit fewer hypertrophic cells are present the        accumulation of proliferating chondrocytes suggests that        Hoxc regulates the rate of progression of chondrocytes to        maturity     In line with this interpretation the         in vivo BrdU incorporation assays        suggested that cell cycle progression of chondrocytes may        be decreased in transgenic animals with higher Hoxc        transgene expression levels If fewer immature cells enter        the cell cycle in a given time interval this is consistent        with and would explain the increased steadystate numbers        of chondrocytes upon Hoxc overexpression This could        occur through two different mechanisms          i  Hoxc actively recruits cells into        the chondrocyte lineage and maintains them in the        proliferating state or          ii  Hoxc inhibits a specific step in        chondrocyte maturation In order to distinguish between        these possibilities we sought to employ cell culture        assays with wellestablished parameters for chondrocyte        differentiation and maturation Interestingly chondrocytes        from Hoxc tansgenic animals behaved undistinguishable        from control cells under all conditions tested No        differences were found in capacity to differentiate in        micromass see Figure  or in high density cultures not        shown and proliferative indices are comparable see        Figure  irrespective of transgene dosage The latter        could be explained by the fact that the FACS analyses were        done at the time of greatest proliferation three days        after culture initiation which may allow transgenic cells        to recover to a normal phenotype However we did not        detect any differences in the first few days of culture by        microscopy or histology Cellular differences must exist at        the time the cells are taken from the animal which would        be expected to die as a Hoxc transgenic and indeed        molecular differences exist see Figure  Yet the cell        culture conditions either quickly reverse cellular        phenotype or support normal chondrocyte maturation        Alternatively it is conceivable that the Hoxc transgene        could be silenced as cells are isolated from the animal        returning cells to their normal phenotype There is little        evidence to support this possibility as Hoxc is expressed        normally in our chondrocyte cultures data not shown and        the promoter used to drive the transgene contains a        cartilagespecific element Cormier and Kappen unpublished        results that is active in chondrocytes Yet even if        transgene expression was reduced in culture the important        implication of our results is that the downstream        biological effects of at least  days of Hoxc        overexpression         in vivo are reversible From these        results we postulate that the cartilage defect in Hoxc        transgenic mice is mediated by absence of factorssignals        that are present in the culture medium Serumfree        conditions and supplementation with candidate molecules        would be one strategy to investigate this further An        interesting albeit preliminary finding from our gene        expression studies is that chondrocytes from Hoxc        transgenic animals display gene expression profiles that        are indicative for immature chondrocytes but not totally        identical This suggests that both Hox transcription        factors may in addition to the delay in chondrocyte        maturation induce specific changes in gene expression By        extending the collection of candidate genes or screening        on microarrays it may thus be possible to identify        specific targets for Hox transcription factors in        chondrocytes                    Conclusions        Our results support the conclusion that factors in        serumcontaining medium provide the environment in which        Hoxc transgenic chondrocytes are capable of reverting to        a normal cellular phenotype Thus Hoxc induced changes        in chondrocytes are reversible under certain conditions        This has important implications for the identification of        the transcriptional targets of Hox transcription factors        In our system the biological effects of Hox genes in        chondrocytes can be modulated by external factors and this        finding points to the importance of geneenvironment        interactions as modulators of Hox gene function                    Methods                  Preparation of mouse rib chondrocytes          The preparation of primary rib chondrocytes from          neonatal mice is a modification of the method used by          Lefebvre et al     Briefly newborn FVB mice were          sacrificed and the ventral regions of rib cages were          dissected in sterile conditions to release soft tissues          Rib cages were transferred to phosphate buffered saline          PBS and washed extensively Cells were dissociated in           ml tubes by enzymatic digestion with  Collagenase          Worthington Biochemical Collagenase Type   CLS  and           TrypsinEDTA InvitrogenGibco BRL for  hour at          C or until the soft tissues were floating in the          solution The solution was aspirated leaving the rib          cages on the bottom of the tube The ribcages were washed          with PBS and fresh  Collagenase in PBS was added          for  hour at C or until the rib cages were          dissociated The enzymatic reaction was stopped with an          equal volume of tissue culture medium containing  FCS          The cells were filtered through a  m cell strainer          Becton Dickinson and pelleted by centrifugation in           ml conical tubes maximum volume  ml at  rpm for           minutes The pellet was washed with PBS cells were          counted and adjusted for desired cell density                          Primary chondrocyte high density bulk          cultures          For analysis of cell cycle parameters we kept primary          chondrocytes in high density bulk cultures as this          allows for recovery of cells for flow cytometry These          cultures undergo chondrocyte maturation with          differentiation to hypertrophy and formation of cartilage          modules Briefly cells were plated on  mm dishes          coated with  gelatin at a final concentration of             dish in DMEM high glucose  FCS and  gml          Lascorbic acid Removal of cells was done by          trypsinization For Alcian Blue staining cells were          fixed in  Ethanol for  minutes and then incubated          for one hour with the Alcian Blue staining solution          which consisted of  mg Alcian Blue GX Sigma in  ml          of  Ethanol and  ml Glacial acetic acid Cells were          rinsed again with  Ethanol and dehydrated through an          Ethanol series before coverslipping on the dish                          Primary high density micromass cultures          For micromass cultures     cell density was          adjusted to    cellsml  l of cell suspension          was plated in the center of a culture well well          plate Midwest Scientific The cultures were incubated          at C in a humidified incubator with  CO            for   to  hours to allow for          cell adhesion and attachment Medium was added very          slowly and consisted of a  mixture of DMEM and F          Life TechnologiesGibco BRL

Glycerophosphate Sigma Medium was replaced with          fresh medium every other day                                Assessment of morphological and histological          parameters of micromass cultured cells          During the first  or  days micromass cultures were          observed directly by phase contrast light microscopy          After that cultures were harvested washed in PBS fixed          in  Paraformaldehyde for  minutes dehydrated in          graded series of Ethanol and paraffinembedded for          subsequent analysis We used histochemical staining with          Hematoxylin and Eosin to ascertain cell morphology and          Alcian Blue at pH     to detect cartilage matrix          sulfated glucosaminoglycans as described before              The production of Collagen type II was assessed by          immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against          mouse type II Collagen Chemicon and secondary antibody          and colorimetric reaction kit Histostain Plus Zymed          Cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU incorporation          Cells were incubated with  mM of BrdU Sigma harvested          after  hrs and paraffinembedded Cells with BrdU          incorporation were detected by immunohistochemistry with          a monoclonal antibody against BrdU BrdU staining kit          Zymed Cell size was determined by measuring cell          diameter microscopically and mean cell size was          calculated Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured as          follows Cells were rinsed in cold TBS Trisbuffered          Saline scrapped from the plate homogenized in           Triton X in TrisHCl pH  on ice and the sample          was centrifuged at  rpm for  minutes at C Protein          concentration in the supernatant was

Transgenic mice          The generation of Hoxc transgenic mice and the          characterization of their phenotype have been published              Briefly Hoxc expressing mice are generated in a          binary transgenic mouse system    by crossing a          transactivator strain harboring a transgene in which          expression of the transcriptional transactivator VP is          under control of the Hoxc promoter     to a          transresponder strain that carries as a transgene the          Hoxc cDNA linked to the ICP immediate early gene          promoter which is silent in mice in the absence of VP               Upon combination of both transgenes the          Hoxc transresponder transgene is activated and Hoxc          becomes overexpressed     This system also allows          the generation of transgenic mice with increased gene          dosage by superimposition of transgene loci to          homozygosity      For the studies reported here          we used the T transactivator and the IEc          transresponder strains All procedures involving animals          were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal          Care and Use Committee at UNMC          Hoxd transgenic mice were generated using the same          transactivator strain crossed to the IEd          transresponder strain     Maintenance and genotyping          of transgenic mice was done as described before               Unless otherwise noted cells and samples were obtained          from animals hemizygous for both transgenes          All transgenes were maintained on a homogenous FVB          inbred genetic background and normal FVB mice were used          as controls unless mentioned otherwise                          In vivo BrdU incorporation          To assess chondrocyte proliferation in Hoxc          transgenic mice we performed           in vivo BrdU labeling experiments          BrdU labeling reagent Amersham RPN in PBS was          injected into pregnant females at  mlgr body weight          Four hours later dams were sacrificed embryos were          isolated and fixed in  paraformaldehyde overnight at          C They were then dehydrated through an alcohol series          and embedded in paraffin for histological sectioning          Sections of  m thickness were rehydrated and incubated          for  minutes with one part  H

incorporation was done using the Zymed          BrdU staining kit with Horseradish Peroxidase and          development with DAB for  minutes Counterstaining was          done with Hematoxylin for one minute Sections of          vertebral structures were matched between pairs of          embryos from the same litter according to anatomical          landmarks of other tissues on the same section Cells in          skeletal structures were counted from at least  samples           and more than  all other samples consecutive          slides for each animal and cell counting was done          independently by two technologists without knowledge of          sample genotype Data were collected from three          independent experiments and were averaged to          cellssection to normalize
