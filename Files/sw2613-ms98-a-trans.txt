                so what do you think about it   well uh ive noticed some changes over the past uh thirty years   um for the worst i would assume   that that its gotten worse   yeah   i can remember uh back in the early sixties when i first started flying a light plane it was quite common for me to take off from uh local airport here and see the uh Appalachian mountains and the Chesapeake Bay at the same time   uhhuh   and in the you know fifteen years later it was a rare occasion that i could see both at the same time   uhhuh youre probably lucky to see the end of the runway by now   yeah i know uh lot of times when i was coming back home i would uh file instrument flight plan just to get into the Washington area   um   but i counted on North Carolina having some good weather for me   well ill tell you i dont know i i dont know whether i i i count the stink as part of air pollution and it stinks down here     well down there you get uh uh some more aromatic aromas like the uh the smell of the pine forest and uh     it depends on where you are now if youre over   then you get down wind of a paper mill once in a while   yeah if you if youre over by Asheville youre pretty good because youre up there in the mountains and youve got some nice ozone and all that over here in Raleigh its kind of flat and stagnant and just yucky   um   its fine over on the coast because youve got the youve got the breezes off the off the water there   yeah   but uh seems like its just dull and uninspiring here   well im not sure that were going to be able to uh solve much of the problem   no i dont know theyre they keep doing things and it doesnt seem to be doing any good i was i was really amazed because i never would have expected you know this problem somewhere like in Atlanta     uhhuh   and i drove through Atlanta uh couple of weeks ago and it was unseasonably warm and you could see the smog just sitting on top of the city   yeah   and when i drove through i it it was terrible i i had to keep the windows up   uhhuh   it was just so thick and uh heavy uh i couldnt believe it i because i mean i used to live in Atlanta years ago and it was always fairly clean i mean you you always you didnt have problem with stagnant air like like LA does   uhhuh   but boy it was really bad that day and it   well one of the reactions i have is that uh they put so much emphasis on the private automobile   yeah   uh as being a major source of pollution and theyve uh ignored the trucks entirely   yeah right   so i i get to going down the expressway in the morning and uh i dont see very many cars smoking   but you see all these all these trucks belching out this black smoke   but then i i get surrounded by twenty or forty trucks and theyre just laying out a pall of black smoke   yeah i know its i i i i dont understand where the priority is its uh like in Atlanta they have um they have mandatory catalytic converter inspections   yeah   theres only three places in Georgia that requires that and uh even with that it hasnt done any good   yeah   i mean obviously its gotten a lot worse but you know just like you say you go through there and you watch all these trucks and theyre just coughing out all kinds of stuff some of them spitting it out so thick you cant even see past it   uhhuh yeah   you know i dont know   yeah i know along route sixty six the uh people who have residences there uh they cant paint their houses without cleaning them first   uhhuh yeah because of the stuff settles on it   uh if theyre within a block of a major expressway the houses get coated with oil   yeah yeah   i dont know things like you know well like acid rain and all these sulphur dioxides being dumped out there i im more worried about that than i am just about anything else   yeah   because uh uh its its all i mean its just like its just like a big avalanche you know you start putting sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and you end up with acid rain acid rain kills the trees trees dont scrub the air and there you are   uhhuh   and then of course youve got all these folks cutting down on the rain forest as quick as they can   yeah im not sure that were not seeing some of the effects of that already   i wonder too you know they keep talking about ozone depletion and all this it it seems funny that its coming around at the time when were losing the most most of the forests   uhhuh   because i i i think that a lot of the pollutants and stuff are being taken out of the air uh you know by the plants and the trees and all that good stuff and here we are losing it and now the now it doesnt have any where to go   yeah   but ozone   well weve sort of been seeing a little climatic shift here on the East Coast or at least it seems that way that uh the winters have been milder for the last five years and uh   uhhuh yeah well its like our winter here i mean it was the winter that wasnt you know we were having having hot days in December and January   yeah   and got in   yeah the first the first winter i moved out here i had a big snow plow on the tractor and i had to use it we had three uh fourteen inch uh snows   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and i havent used it since   yeah you might you might as well sell it for scrap or something because you probably never will use it its a shame too because i miss all the cold weather i i enjoy winter   and at the same time i i see some colder winters in the Midwest i think theyve gotten more snow in the past five years than were having here on the East Coast   yeah yeah well it was an interesting day the other day uh i think it was um yeah it was last not not this past Friday but Friday a week ago   yeah   we had i dont know i think you had some bad weather up there too we had tornadoes and everything down here   uhhuh   um that was the most historic weather day in recorded history for severe weather in the country   oh i didnt know that   on that one day i mean you know of course you always have severe weather somewhere but there was more of it on that one day than ever recorded before over four hundred reports of tornadoes hail and heavy winds   huh   amazing its a little bit scary   well it may have been uh the fact we had this early season warm spell   yeah   that did that because i know that the the preceding the preceding day Thursday i got my first sunburn for the season out on uh Ocean City Beach   um i read an article a couple weeks ago they were talking about uh talking again about the ozone layer they said that the uh the ozone deteriorate is greater than they had originally thought over some of the major metropolitan areas thats a little bit scary to think about because thats certainly not going to improve things around there   yes i didnt notice that uh know that theyd discovered any thinness or over metro metro areas id only heard about the uh North and South Pole   yeah well thats thats yeah that had that had been the thing that had always i mean i i i have always thought about the ozone layer as sort of like a layer and it would move around i didnt know that the hole just stayed there you know i guess i i dont im not that much of a meteorologist but uh yeah i was a little surprised at that too because up to that point all id heard about was the one over the pole   yeah   and i said well im not too awfully concerned about that if its going to start melting the ice cap its not going to be for a long time yet but opening opening up over major metropolitan areas now thats uh thats   yeah that that doesnt uh fit my picture of uh of uh meteorology i can understand the Poles because theyre uh a permanent high pressure area   yeah yeah   and uh you know there isnt that much uh circulation but uh the temperate zone is uh a constant moving uh wind system   yeah course the ozone is up there so   and its im surprised that the ozone doesnt have its own wind pattern   yeah i i mean didnt i dont even know i dont even know if the ozone layer does move i mean apparently it doesnt but of course it it might be just a couple of scientists trying to get their name in the paper sort of like cold fusion   yeah cold fusion right       the same thought flashed in my mind   yeah ill tell you i i was real excited when i first heard that i said hot dog they finally did it you know   yeah i uh i may have put out an exclamation here at home when i heard that news   um i too   and uh everybody wanted to know why i was so excited and i tried to explain to them   i mean im yeah i mean im an old science fiction buff from way back when i was a little boy and this is the kind of stuff that science fiction was made out of   yeah uhhuh   and its the days that i keep looking for that arent going to happen in my lifetime       but you know were supposed to have moon colonies by now but uh yeah cold fusion would have been great   yeah   could have gone might have started making a little inroads on air pollution with that   i think so   but who knows   except we might have uh bad case of paladium poisoning now   yeah       yeah theres theres always a drawback to everything i mean i dont know well   i know there was uh a pipeline going in up in uh southern Pennsylvania and there was a group in uh Bucks county that was fighting it and uh one of the women that was leading the group said well they say theyre going to pump uh oil through there but before long theyll be pumping radioactivity through it   okay
