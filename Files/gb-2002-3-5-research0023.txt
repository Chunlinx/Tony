                    Background        The Golgi complex is the central secretory organelle of        most eukaryotic cells and consists of membranous stacks        called cisternae    Secreted proteins like all other        proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum ER        and are specifically packaged into vesicles that bud off        from the ER in a GTPdependent process    These lipid        vesicles are coated with the COPII coat proteincomplex and        are equipped with the ATPdependent vesiclefusion        apparatus They carry the secretory cargo to the         cis surface of the Golgi complex        with which they fuse delivering the cargo A second type        of vesicle coated by the COPI coatprotein complex is        part of a retrograde pathway that buds off the Golgi        membrane and returns proteins that are not targeted for        secretion back to the endoplasm           Studies on the secretory system in crowngroup        eukaryotes plants animals and fungi have uncovered a        family of proteins the p pgpLempErp family        that have an important role in cargo selection and        packaging into COPIIcoated vesicles             Additionally they might also function in excluding        secreted proteins from COPIcoated retrograde vesicles           Members of the p family are type I membrane        proteins with a small carboxyterminal cytoplasmic tail        that interacts with the vesicle coat proteins and a        globular lumenal region that probably interacts with the        cargo    They are abundantly distributed on the        membranes of the vesicles budding off the ER and the         cis Golgi membranes The p proteins        belong to at least four distinct subfamilies    and        form heterooligomeric complexes that contain at least one        member from each subfamily This heteromerization of the        p proteins has been shown to require a coiledcoil        stretch at the extreme carboxyl terminus of their lumenal        regions          Improved understanding of the p family may throw light        on evolution and function of the Golgi apparatus in        eukaryotes With this objective we conducted a        computational sequence analysis of the p proteins and        show that they contain a conserved globular domain that is        also present in several other Golgi and lipidtraffic        proteins We present evidence that this module is likely to        serve as a common denominator in proteinprotein        interactions in several distinct contexts such as in        secretory vesicles and on the Golgi peripheral membrane        The proliferation of this superfamily appears to have been        central to the diversification of the eukaryotic secretory        apparatus                    Results and discussion                  Identification of a conserved domain in p and          other Golgi proteins          The           bona fide p proteins contain a          short carboxyterminal tail that interacts with the          COPcomplex proteins through specific short peptide          motifs The aminoterminal region that faces the lumen is          much larger and is predicted to form a compact globular          unit As this region of the protein is likely to contain          a conserved globular domain that mediates other          functional interactions of these proteins we sought to          investigate its complete diversity and potential          evolutionary connections We carried out a profile search          of the NonRedundant protein database of the National          Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI using the          PSIBLAST program   seeded with lumenal region of          the           Caenorhabditis elegans p family          member KE the profileinclusion threshold was set          at  and the search iterated until convergence This          search readily detected the classical p family members          that are found in six to nine copies in the proteomes of          most organisms belonging to the eukaryotic crown group          In addition this search retrieved several other proteins          that do not belong to the p family with statistically          significant expectation            E values            E   see Figure legend          These proteins include yeast Oshp a cytoplasmic          oxysterolbinding protein animal Seclike proteins          that are involved in secretion human GCP also called          PAP a peripheraltype benzodiazepine          receptorassociated protein   which interacts with          the Golgi integral membrane protein Giantin and several          other uncharacterized eukaryotic proteins with different          lipidbinding domains Figure  Reciprocal searches          initiated with this region from the newly detected          proteins showed that they were more closely related to          each other but in subsequent iterations they recovered          the classic p family members at significant           E values suggesting that all          these conserved regions define a novel superfamily of          protein domains Separate prediction of the secondary          structure of this domain from the p family and the          newly detected proteins showed that the two groups had          essentially the same core structural elements further          reinforcing their relationship As this conserved domain          is present in at least three distinct classes of proteins          related to Golgi dynamics animal Sec proteins the p          family and GCPlike proteins we name this conserved          region the GOLD domain          The presence of the GOLD domain at the extreme amino          or carboxyl terminus of the Oshp and animal Sec          proteins respectively allowed us to establish accurate          boundaries for it The domain is typically between  and           amino acids long and in the p family it comprises          almost the entire lumenal region with the exception of          an helical extension of approximately  amino acids          that precedes the transmembrane segment Most of the size          difference observed in the GOLDdomain superfamily is          traceable to a single large lowcomplexity insert that is          seen in some versions of the domain A          secondarystructure prediction for the domain using the          PHD   program reveals that it is likely to adopt a          compact allfold structure with six to seven strands          Most of the sequence conservation is centered on the          hydrophobic cores that support these predicted strands          The predicted secondarystructure elements and the size          of the conserved core of the domain suggests that it may          form a sandwich fold with the strands arranged in two           sheets stacked on each other          Experimental studies so far on diverse proteins          containing GOLD domains point to a role for it in          proteinprotein interactions A region of the GPC          molecule that rather precisely encompasses the GOLD          domain has been shown to bind to the cytoplasmic region          of the Golgi membrane protein Giantin            Crosslinking experiments have suggested that the p          proteins interact directly with the cargo molecules that          are present in the lumen of the COPIIcoated vesicles and          that they are accordingly cargo receptors            However yeast deletion mutants lacking all the p          proteins grow similarly to wild type although they show          delays in translocation of a subset of cargo molecules          such as invertase and Gasp from the ER to the Golgi and          increased secretion of resident ER proteins            Certain members of the p family from vertebrates have          also been shown to bind to specific ligands such as the          interleukin receptorlike molecule TST and might aid          its proper expression on the cell surface   These          observations suggest that the p subset of the GOLD          domains probably function as discriminators that          selectively interact with particular proteins to          influence their loading into vesicles The GOLD domains          show considerable variability in some of the loops that          are predicted to extrude from the core sandwichlike          structure Figure  These loops might form exposed          surfaces that provide the GOLD domains with the          discriminatory capacity necessary for their interactions          with diverse ligands                          The domain architecture and evolutionary history of          GOLDdomain proteins functional implications          With the exception of the p proteins which have a          simple architecture with the GOLD domain as their only          globular domain all other GOLDdomain proteins contain          additional conserved globular domains Figure  In          these proteins the GOLD domain cooccurs with lipid          sterol or fatty acidbinding domains such as PH             Secp   FYVE   oxysterol binding and          acyl CoAbinding domains suggesting that these proteins          may interact with membranes The FYCO protein that          combines a GOLD domain with a FYVE domain also contains          a RUN domain   an uncharacterized helical domain          that may have a role in the interaction of various          proteins with cytoskeletal filaments    An          orthologous group of proteins typified by human SecL          which is conserved in all animals has in addition to          the carboxyterminal fusion of the Secp and GOLD          domains a previously unrecognized conserved          aminoterminal domain Figures   This domain has so          far been found only in eukaryotes and occurs in          standalone form in several proteins including the human          PRELI protein   and the yeast MSFp protein The          PRELIMSFp domain is approximately  residues long          and is predicted to assume a globular    fold with six           strands and four  helices Figure  MSFp is          proposed to be involved in mitochondrial protein sorting            suggesting that the PRELIMSFp domain may also          have a function associated with cellular membranes          Thus all GOLDdomain proteins can be divided into two          architectural categories the plike category in which          the GOLD domains project into the lumen anchored in the          membrane by the membranespanning helix category  and          proteins in which the GOLD domain occurs at the extreme          amino or carboxyl terminus with additional domains that          are known to interact with lipid membranes category           Figure  GCP which is peripherally associated with          the Golgi membrane is one of the proteins in the second          category that has been experimentally characterized It          has been shown that overexpression of a region of this          protein encompassing the GOLD domain caused disassembly          of the Golgi structure and abrogated protein transport          from the ER to the Golgi            These observations can be accommodated by two not          mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding the functions of          these proteins The GOLD proteins belonging to the second          architectural category could function as doubleheaded          adaptors that interact with both a specific protein via          the GOLD domain and different cellular lipid membranes          Thus GCP and GOLD proteins with analogous          architectures could help in the assembly of vesicular or          Golgimembraneassociated protein complexes by tethering          specific proteins to the membranes with the GOLD domain          binding the protein targets and the lipidbinding protein          to the membrane Alternatively at least some of the          category proteins could function as a previously          unrecognized class of vesicular cargoloading molecules          that associate with the membrane via their lipidbinding          domains and deliver their protein ligands via the GOLD          domain The observation that deletion mutants lacking all          the p proteins still show normal trafficking of certain          proteins such as carboxypeptidase Y suggests that there          are some proteintrafficking pathways that are unaffected          by their absence Thus the GOLDdomain proteins of          category  may have a specific role in regulating the          secretion of molecules that are not affected by the p          proteins The heterooligomerization of the p proteins          via the coiledcoil regions carboxyterminal to the GOLD          domain seems to help in generating combinatorial          diversity for their interactions with multiple ligands          The presence of extensive coiledcoil segments in some of          the category GOLDdomain proteins such as FYCO          suggests that they might also form oligomers like the          p proteins          Similaritybased clustering and phylogenetic analysis          divides the GOLD domains into two primary divisions that          precisely mirror the two categories established on the          basis of domain architectures Figure  This division          was also supported by a synapomorphic shared derived          feature in the form of two conserved cysteines which is          restricted to the p family category proteins          Likewise the presence of a specific insert between          strand  and  with a characteristic conserved tryptophan          serves as a synapomorphic feature for category GOLD          domains Figure  An analysis of the phyletic patterns          suggests that the p family had already differentiated          into at least four distinct subfamilies in the common          ancestor of plants animals and fungi The detection of          multiple members of the p family in the early branching          eukaryotes such as           Cryptosporidium parvum and          kinetoplastids suggests that some of this diversification          was probably already under way early in eukaryotic          evolution Within the eukaryotic crown group we obtained          evidence of specific instances of duplications and gene          losses that are restricted to particular lineages The          most striking case is seen in           Arabidopsis thaliana  which          appears to have proliferated the Erv subfamily five to          six members but lacks the Erpp and Erpp subfamilies          The second major family of GOLD domains category  is          so far only attested in the crown group In fungi this          group is typified by           Saccharomyces cerevisiae Oshp          which combines an aminoterminal GOLD domain with PH and          oxysterolbinding domains The greatest architectural          diversity of this group is seen in animals Figure           suggesting that there was increased proliferation and          domain shuffling among these proteins concomitant with          the evolutionary emergence of the animals This might          correlate with the increased complexity of          animalspecific secretory functions                            Conclusions        A novel strandrich domain was identified in numerous        eukaryotic proteins including the p proteins which        appear to have a function related to the Golgi complex        secretion or protein sorting These GOLD domains are        predicted to be involved in specific proteinprotein        interactions Other than the p proteins GOLD domains are        present in several proteins where they occur at the extreme        termini and are combined with diverse membrane or        lipidbinding domains These proteins are predicted to be        doubleheaded adaptors that may help in the assembly of        protein complexes on membranes or in the packaging of        specific cargo molecules in membranous vesicles The        identification to the GOLD domain may help in a directed        dissection of pfamily function and provide novel        candidate molecules for experimental studies on secretion        and sorting                    Materials and methods        The NonRedundant NR database of protein sequences        National Center for Biotechnology Information NIH        Bethesda was searched using the BLASTP program          Profile searches were conducted using the PSIBLAST program        with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the        query with a profileinclusion expectation          E value threshold of  and were        iterated until convergence    Previously known        conserved protein domains were detected using the        corresponding PSIBLASTderived positionspecific scoring        matrices PSSMs   The PSSMs were prepared by choosing        one or more starting queries seeds for a set of most        frequently encountered domains see reference   for        details and run against the NR database until convergence        with the C option of PSIBLAST to save the PSSM We        ensured that at convergence no false positives were        included in the profiles This profile database can be        downloaded from   or used on the internet via the        RPSBLAST program   All globular segments of proteins        that did not map to domains with previously constructed        PSSMs were searched individually using PSIBLAST to detect        any additional domains that may have been overlooked        Multiple alignments were constructed using the TCoffee        program   followed by manual correction based on the        PSIBLAST results Protein secondary structure was        predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the        PHD program   Signal peptides were predicted using the        SIGNALP program    and the transmembrane regions        were predicted using the TOPRED program   Phylogenetic        analysis was carried out using the maximum likelihood

NEIGHBOR program both from        the Phylip package   followed by local rearrangement        using the Protml program of the Molphy package   to        arrive at the maximum likelihood ML tree The
