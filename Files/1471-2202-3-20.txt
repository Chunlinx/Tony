                    Background        Sleep is regulated by both circadian and homeostatic        mechanisms As a consequence of a signal from the circadian        clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei SCN of the        anterior hypothalamus in mammals     sleep is more        likely to occur at certain times of the h day than        others thereby determining the daily sleepwake        distribution     Sleep is homeostatically regulated in        the sense that sleep drive accumulates in the absence of        sleep and decreases during sleep Changes in sleep drive        are thus driven by the sleepwake history Homeostatic and        circadian mechanisms interact to determine the duration and        quality of sleep and wakefulness       Homeostatic        regulation of sleep can still be observed in animals that        lack circadian rhythms after lesioning of the SCN               suggesting that circadian rhythms and sleep homeostasis        are independent processes        Homeostatic regulation of sleep can be quantified        objectively after a period of enforced wakefulness ie        sleep deprivation although a similar relationship between        sleep parameters and spontaneous wakefulness can be        quantified under baseline conditions as well             The compensatory responses in time spent asleep sleep        consolidation ie sleep bout duration     andor        sleep intensity observed after an extended period of        wakefulness are all taken as evidence that sleep drive is        increased during wakefulness and thus that sleep is        homeostatically regulated NonREM sleep NREMS intensity        quantified as EEG power in the delta frequency range         Hz and NREMS consolidation are in a quantitative and        predictive relationship with sleep history both variables        increase with the duration of prior wakefulness and        subsequently decline during NREMS         These        variables are thus quantitative markers of NREMS        homeostasis and are presumed to reflect an underlying        physiological drive for sleep            The time constants describing the dynamics of the        increasing NREMS drive during wakefulness and decreasing        NREMS drive during NREMS     are compatible with a        role for changes in gene expression in their regulation        Although past studies have shown that extended periods of        wakefulness cause changes in gene expression for review        see     no causal relationship between changes in        gene expression and sleep homeostasis has been identified        A recent study in         Drosophila melanogaster implicates        transcriptional regulation by the circadian gene         cycle  a homolog of the mammalian         bmal gene in the homeostatic        regulation of rest     While rest in flies shares        several features with sleep in mammals      it        remains to be determined whether a similar role for BMAL        or related transcriptional regulators is necessary for the        homeostatic regulation of sleep        In both flies and mammals circadian rhythms are thought        to be generated by transcriptionaltranslational feedback        loops comprising a network of transcriptional regulators              The core of this selfsustained molecular        oscillation consists of positive and negative elements In        mammals the positive elements are two basic        helixloophelix bHLH PASdomaincontaining transcription        factors CLOCK and BMAL that form heterodimers that can        drive the transcription of three         period          per  genes         per and two         cryptochromes          cry  PER and CRY proteins        suppress CLOCKBMALmediated transcription thereby forming        the negative elements in the feedback loop Consistent with        their central role in circadian rhythm generation genetic        inactivation of both         cryptochromes          cry  results in circadian        arrhythmicity in mice      Given the widespread        expression of the elements of the molecular clock in the        brain and elsewhere and the large number of genes        regulated by bHLHPAS transcription factors eg            the role of         cryptochromes may extend beyond        circadian clock function To determine whether        transcriptional regulation by CRY influences the        homeostatic regulation of sleep we studied sleep in         cry mice under baseline        conditions under conditions of constant darkness and        after sleep deprivation SD The expression of circadian        genes that are regulated by         cryptochromes were evaluated in the        brain of         cry mice and in sleep deprived        wild type mice and rats                    Results                  Sleep regulation in cry mice          In baseline conditions wild type mice showed the          sleepwake distribution typical for this nocturnal          species with high values of sleep in the light period and          low values in the dark period Figure  Table  The          sleepwake distribution in           cry mice was distinct from          that of wild type controls Figure  in that sleep          variables did not differ between the h light L and          dark D periods Table  Nevertheless as in wild type          controls the lighttodark transition was accompanied by          a pronounced decrease in sleep time in           cry mice Figure           During baseline total daily NREMS time was          significantly greater in           cry mice than in wild type          mice    vs    min P   unpaired          ttest whereas the daily time spent in REM sleep did          not differ    vs    min The difference          between genotypes in NREMS time was present only in the          dark period and not in the light Table  Figure           Average NREMS bout duration a measure of NREMS          consolidation that is positively correlated with a high          homeostatic sleep pressure     was greater by  in                    cry mice relative to wild          type mice during the light period and by  during the          dark period Table  Consistent with this increase in          sleep consolidation NREMS delta power was significantly          higher in           cry than in           cry mice during most of          baseline Figure  This difference in EEG delta power          was specific for NREMS and did not extend to other EEG          frequencies Figure A indicating that the increase in          delta power is not due to a difference in EEG          amplification This statespecific EEG difference in          delta power was especially evident at the waketoNREMS          transition           cry mice exhibited higher          delta power values than           cry immediately after the          onset of NREMS Figure B          The same genotypic differences in sleep were observed          in constant dark DD conditions Figure  Mice lacking                    cry spent more time in NREMS             vs    min P   unpaired ttest          NREMS bouts were longer    vs    min P            unpaired ttest and EEG delta power in          NREMS was higher in           cry compared to           cry controls    vs             V  Hz P   unpaired ttest          Figure  The decrease in sleep time prior to the onset          of the dark period Figure  was still present in DD in           cry mice sleep time          decreased in the latter half of the subjective day and          minimum average sleep time was reached immediately after          the onset of the subjective night Figure  The          anticipatory decrease in sleep time that occurred prior          to the onset of dark in           cry mice in LD did not occur          under DD conditions Figure  Under DD conditions less          REMS was present in           cry mice than in           cry mice    vs             min P   unpaired ttest due to an increase in          REMS in           cry mice in DD    min          relative to LD    min P   paired          ttest          To further investigate the homeostatic regulation of          sleep in           cry mice we assayed the          compensatory response to a  h SD see Figure  After          SD wild type mice displayed the typical increase in REMS          and NREMS time NREMS bout duration and EEG delta power          above baseline levels      Table  Figure  In          contrast           cry mice did not exhibit          significant increases in REMS NREMS time or NREMS bout          duration after SD only a brief increase in NREMS delta          power was observed lasting  h in           cry vs  h in wild type          mice Figure  The initial increase in delta power          relative to baseline measured over the first recovery          hour was significantly smaller in           cry than the increase          observed in wild type mice Table  Delta power Figure           Table  and NREMS bout duration Tables   in           cry mice is maintained at a          level only attained by the wild type mice when their          sleep pressure was highest ie at the end of the          active or dark period and after SD          In wild type mice EEG delta power still varied as a          function of the sleepwake history with high values at          the end of the baseline dark period and after the SD and          low values at the end of the light or major rest period          Figure  Presumably due to the altered sleepwake          distribution the daily range of EEG delta power values          was smaller in           cry             mice than in wild type mice          Table  Figure  We tested the assumption of a          relationship between delta power and the sleepwake          history by using a mathematical method that predicts the          level of EEG delta power occurring in individual NREMS          bouts based on the  h sequence of sec behavioral          state scores for individual animals     With this          analytical tool the time constants of the increasing          delta power during wakefulness and its decrease during          NREMS are estimated For both genotypes delta power in          both baseline and recovery from SD could be reliably          predicted on the basis of sleepwake history Figure           which is underscored by the highly significant          correlations between empirical and simulated data r            and  for           cry and           cry  respectively P            for both genotypes Thus in the absence of           cryptochromes  NREMS delta power          varied as a function of the prior sleepwake history          However in           cry mice a significantly          shorter time constant for the increase ie a faster          buildup of delta power was obtained            increase     h in           cry vs    h in           cry  P   unpaired          ttest whereas the time constant describing the decline          of delta power during NREMS did not differ            decrease     h in           cry vs    h in           cry                           Circadian gene expression in the brain of cry          mice          Deletion of the           cryptochromes disinhibits the          transcriptional activation of CLOCKBMAL and NPASBMAL          target genes resulting in increased levels of their          transcripts in the SCN liver and retina                We assayed the expression in the brain of three genes          that are known targets of           cryptochrome mediated          transcriptional inhibition           albumin Dbinding protein            dbp               period per  and           per       in the middle          of the daily light period Confirming the earlier studies          in other tissues mRNA levels for all three genes were          higher in the brains of           cry mice compared to wild          type mice Figure  This relative increase was highly          significant for all three genes            dbp per  fold           per  fold P            unpaired ttests n  genotype

were quantified by RTPCR in          three brain areas cerebral cortex basal forebrain and          hypothalamus from CBL mice that were sacrificed          immediately after  h of SD or after  h of recovery          sleep ZT Significant differences in expression were          observed only in the cortex Figure A and not in          hypothalamus or basal forebrain data not shown Both           per and           per mRNA levels were higher          immediately after SD compared to controls           cry expression did not change          and           dbp mRNA decreased significantly          Figure A After  h of recovery sleep           per             and           dbp expression returned to the          normal levels for that time of day ZT Figure A We          also measured the expression of five other circadian          genes           bmal            clock            npas            per  and           casein kinase             csnke  in the cortex the levels          of these five mRNAs were not affected by SD data not          shown          As confirmation of our results in the mouse we          determined the expression of           per and           per in the rat by RTPCR and          Northern analysis respectively In a similar          experimental paradigm rats were sleep deprived for  h          and then either sacrificed immediately after the SD          ZT or after  h of recovery sleep ZT n  group          The cortexspecific increase in           per mRNA was confirmed by the          RTPCR analysis and as in the mouse           per expression returned to basal          levels after a period of recovery sleep data not shown          Northern analysis confirmed that recovery sleep was          associated with a decline in           per mRNA relative to the level of          expression reached at the end of the SD Figure B                            Discussion        Upon release into constant darkness         cry mice immediately become        arrhythmic at the behavioral level      at the level        of SCN electrophysiology     and at the        cellularmolecular level     Of the available mouse        models for circadian dysfunction only         per double mutant mice             bmal knockout mice     and mice        with an ablation of the SCN    show a similarly        dramatic phenotype Thus         cry mice appear to be a        suitable model for studies of the regulation of sleep in        the absence of an intact circadian clock        Under light  dark LD conditions running wheel        activity patterns and as we show here the distribution of        sleep in         cry mice still exhibit diurnal        variation LD cycles can influence the expression of sleep        by entraining the circadian pacemaker that drives the        diurnal rhythm of sleep andor by directly affecting the        expression of sleep thereby masking the influence of the        pacemaker on sleep Masking seems to be the mechanism by        which light drives these rhythms under LD conditions in         cry mice     since the        daily modulation of NREMS that occurs in         cry mice under a lightdark        cycle immediately disappears upon placement in constant        darkness      Figure  At the molecular level         per expression but not that of         per  is rhythmic in the SCN of         cry mice under LD conditions        Upon release into constant dark conditions         per rhythmicity disappears        concomitant with the immediate loss of behavioral        rhythmicity suggesting a role for lightdriven         per expression in generating        behavioral rhythms            The most striking and unexpected finding of the current        study is that under baseline conditions         cry mice exhibit all the        hallmarks of high NREMS pressure including more        consolidated NREMS increased NREMS time and higher levels        of EEG delta power relative to wild type mice that were        attained immediately after NREMS onset The failure of         cry mice to exhibit a robust        increase in any of these measures after  h SD is        consistent with the interpretation that these mice are        already under high NREMS pressure during baseline        conditions Determination of the time constants that most        accurately describe the dynamics of NREMS delta power        revealed that during wake the propensity for high NREMS        delta power increases during wake in         cry mice at a faster rate than        in wild type mice This could help explain why NREMS delta        power is chronically high in         cry mice The coincidence of        high NREMS time and chronically high delta power in         cry mice is all the more        striking when one considers that during NREMS the drive        for NREMS should dissipate and result in lower delta power                    These findings in         cry mice contrast with the        findings of sleep studies in animals that are rendered        arrhythmic by lesioning of the SCN In nocturnal rodents        lesioning the SCN results in more fragmented sleep with        lower EEG delta power but leaving the daily sleep time        unchanged        Lesioning the SCN in a diurnal        primate the squirrel monkey did result in an increase in        NREMS time but sleep was more fragmented with a higher        proportion of light NREMS     ie with lower        overall levels of EEG delta power Furthermore the        homeostatic response to sleep deprivation does not seem to        be altered in SCNlesioned rodents       Thus the        sleep characteristics of         cry mice do not support the        concept of         cry mice as simply a genetic        model for ablation of the circadian clock in the SCN        Together these unexpected results are compatible with a        role for         cryptochromes in the homeostatic        regulation of sleep in addition to their role in generating        circadian rhythms        Recent observations including the current report        suggest a complex interrelationship between homeostatic and        circadian influences on sleep at the molecular level        Deletion of the         cycle gene in         Drosophila produces flies that have        an exaggerated homeostatic response to rest deprivation in        addition to their lack of circadian rhythmicity     In        a striking parallel to our current results flies with a        mutation in the         cryptochrome gene also exhibit        increased rest time as well as a reduced compensatory        response to rest deprivation P Shaw personal        communication The         clock mutation in mice which has a        profound effect on circadian rhythmicity     decreases        NREMS time and consolidation under baseline conditions            The         clock sleep phenotype is the inverse        of the sleep characteristics we report here for the         cry mice and is thus consistent        with CLOCK and CRY being positive and negative        transcriptional regulators respectively         Albumin Dbinding protein          Dbp  is a transcription factor whose        expression is under the direct transcriptional control of        CLOCKBMAL     Deletion of the         dbp gene which results in a        shortening of the circadian period     also results in        decreased sleep consolidation and NREMS delta power                   We assume that the effects on sleep we observed in         cry           mice are a result of a lack of         cryptochrome dependent inhibition of        the transcriptional activation provided by the bHLHPAS        heterodimers CLOCKBMAL and NPASBMAL              although         cryptochromes also play a role in        stabilizing and nuclear sequestration of PER proteins            and in photoreception     Lack of         cryptochromes results in increased        mRNA levels of CLOCKNPASBMAL target genes including        the circadian genes         per and         per      The expression of        these two genes is viewed as a state variable of the        molecular circadian clock or a marker of        CLOCKNPASBMALinduced transcription although at least         per transcription can also be        rapidly induced by light      through a        CREBdependent signaling pathway       The        observation of high brain levels of         per transcripts under baseline        conditions in         cry mice raises the possibility        that these or other CLOCKNPASBMAL target genes are        involved in the homeostatic regulation of sleep The        observation of elevated         per gene expression in the cortex of        sleepdeprived rats and mice Figure  supports this        hypothesis        The increase in         per expression after the sleep        deprivation was specific to the cerebral cortex although        it cannot be ruled out based on the present study that        circadian gene expression changes with sleepwake history        in specific nuclei within the other two regions examined        ie the hypothalamus and basal forebrain A surprisingly        small number  of the  genes screened by mRNA        differential display and cDNA microarrays in the cortex to        date change their expression with sleep deprivation            It is intriguing and encouraging that of the initial        genes we assayed three changed their expression with sleep        deprivation          per          per          dbp  none of which were identified        in the aforementioned screens         cry expression at the mRNA level        did not change with sleep deprivation in wild type mice        This observation does not necessarily obviate a direct role        for CRY proteins in mediating a response to sleep        deprivation CRY poteins may play a role at steady state        levels or there may be posttranslational changes in the        functioning of CRY proteins in association with sleep        deprivation such as phosphorylation state ubiquitination            or intracellular localization    of the        protein all of which are regulated dynamically at least         in vitro  In the liver CRY protein        oscillations are not necessary for circadian oscillations        of target transcripts as CRY proteins are present in        excess of PER and oscillations in the latter produce        rhythmicity     A similar situation might exist in the        cortex        The high         per levels in         cry mice and the low         per levels in         clock mutant mice     correlate        with their contrasting sleep phenotype see above            In this context the sleep abnormalities in         dbp mice might also be related to        a reduction in         per expression since at least         in vitro  DBP can amplify the        CLOCKBMALinduced transcription of         per     but it is not known        whether         per transcript levels are altered in         dbp mice Apart from the present        observations in sleepdeprived rats and mice several other        reports confirm that cortical levels of         per expression in wild type animals        are high at times when sleep drive is high irrespective of        the phase at which the circadian expression of         per peaks in the SCN Thus in both        nocturnal and diurnal species         per expression in the cortex is        maximal in conjunction with the major waking episode              Under conditions where the phase methamphetamine        administration restricted feeding or distribution        circadian splitting of locomotor activity is altered         per expression in the cortex        parallels the overt rhythm of wakefulness whereas the        circadian oscillation of         per gene expression in the SCN        remains unaffected       Thus in contrast to its        role in the SCN PER protein in the cortex is not a        component of a selfsustaining circadian oscillator            Instead         per expression in the cortex seems to        the follow sleepwake history consistent with the        hypothesis that it is related to homeostatic regulation of        sleep However in the current study and those cited above        the expression of         per genes was studied at the mRNA        level PER protein level may be affected differentially        from that of         per mRNA and levels of the PER        protein are reduced in         cry mice due to reduced        stability of PER proteins in the absence of        heterodimerizing CRY partners                          Conclusions        In the discussion we have focused on         per mRNAs as transcriptional        targets of         cry because the expression        patterns of these circadian genes have been widely        described and because their transcriptional control by CRY        proteins and by CLOCKNPASBMAL has been well        established At least  genes are regulated in a similar        fashion by NPASBMAL    and the identity of the        target genes critical for the NREMS phenotype in         cry  mice remains to be        determined In the absence of         cry  the stability and overall        level of PER proteins particularly in the nucleus of the        cell is reduced       It would therefore be        interesting to observe sleep in         per single and double mutant mice        the latter of which have been subjected to behavioral        observation    but not to sleep EEG studies         per single knockout mice and mice        expressing a nonfunctional PER protein both exhibit        subtle differences from wild type in the homeostatic        rebound after SD     an observation compatible with        the hypothesis that these genes are correlates of sleep        homeostasis In addition measurement of the effects of        sleep deprivation on the expression of         cry and         per genes at the protein level        will provide critical information Finally from a        functional perspective it is interesting that        CLOCKNPASBMAL transcriptional activity is sensitive to        redox state     This transcriptional activity might        thus provide a link between neuronal activity and an energy        regulatory function for NREMS as has been suggested        previously                        Methods                  Sleep studies          Mice were generated by mating           cry and           cry single knockout mice both of          mixed background ca  CBL   Sv              to generate double heterozygotes that were interbred to          generate double knockouts            cry  and wild type controls                     cry  Eight wild type and            cry male mice were surgically          prepared for EEG and electromyographic EMG recordings          as described previously     Following two weeks of          postsurgical recovery mice were isolated for recordings          in soundattenuated chambers The experiments were          conducted under an LD cycle lightson ie          Zeitgeber Time ZT at  h Twentyfour hour baseline          recordings starting at ZT were followed by a  h sleep          deprivation SD starting at ZT The sleep deprivations          in this experiment and the other two experiments see          below were performed by the introduction of novel          objects into the cage or by gentle handling In addition          to the SD experiment animals were subjected to one day          of baseline recording in constant darkness separated from          the SD experiment by  hours All experimental          procedures complied with institutional and NIH          guidelines          Digitized EEG and integrated EMG were stored in s          epochs and classified as NREMS REM sleep REMS or          wakefulness by visual inspection The EEG was subjected          to a FastFourierTransformation yielding power spectra          between  Hz Delta power was calculated as the          average EEG power in the delta  Hz frequencies for          epochs scored as NREMS For visual representation hourly          deltapower values Figure  were expressed relative to          an individual mean ie h baseline mean before          transforming back to absolute values to capture both the          highly reproducible individual time course of delta power          and the genotype differences in absolute values              Statistical evaluation of genotype differences were          based however on the absolute EEG values PostSD delta          power was compared to baseline during the first hour of          spontaneous sleep subsequent to SD while NREMS amount          and bout duration Table  were compared over  hours          ZTZT in accordance with the distinct dynamics of          the compensatory responses of these variables to SD              NREMS bouts were defined as periods of NREMS          initiated by three consecutive second epochs of NREMS          and terminated by three consecutive epochs not classified          as NREMS EEG delta power changes at transitions between          wakefulness and NREMS were measured during those          transitions characterized by at least  consecutive s          epochs of wake followed by at least  consecutive          epochs of NREMS          A mathematical algorithm was used to quantify the          sleepwake dependent dynamics of delta power during both          baseline and recovery from SD     In this algorithm          delta power decreases during NREMS and increases during          wakefulness according to saturating exponential          functions the time constants of which are estimated by          minimizing the square of the differences between          empirical delta power data and the values produced by          the mathematical functions The two time constants for          the increase and decrease of delta power that resulted          in the smallest deviation from empirical values within          each individual were used to statistically assess          genotype effect on the dynamics of delta power                                       Northern analysis          Five           cry mice and  wild type          controls were sacrificed in the middle of the light          period ZT Brains were rapidly removed and frozen on          dry ice Total RNA was extracted and Northern analysis          was performed with  g whole brain total RNA as          previously described              Ten Wistar rats were sleep deprived for  h beginning          at lightonset ZT Five rats were sacrificed at ZT at          the end of the SD and five were allowed to recover for           h following the SD and were sacrificed at ZT Rats were          monitored by EEGEMG throughout this period as described              Brains were rapidly removed dissected and          frozen and Northern analysis performed                          Quantitative realtime

Brains were rapidly          removed and the cerebral cortex basal forebrain and          hypothalamus were dissected After a midsagittal cut          the entire cortical tissue was peeled off and separated          from the hippocampus and underlying diencephalon          Striatal tissue was also removed From each animal          quantitative realtime PCR determinations of  target

the cortex only To confirm the specificity of the          nucleotide sequences chosen for the primers and probes          and the absence of DNA polymorphisms BLASTN searches          were conducted
