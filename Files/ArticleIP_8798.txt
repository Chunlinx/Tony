                                 The SemiConductor            In many fields growing oldmeans cutting back on your professional responsibilities But for orchestraconductors figures of mythic virility and longevity advancing age seems onlyto entail taking on more obligations Consider Kurt Masur the yearoldmusic director of the New York Philharmonic Last week it was announced thatbeginning in  Masur would become the principal conductor of the LondonPhilharmonic In London the Guardian reported that the German maestrowould naturally be resigning his New York position which pays him million a year But the paper was forced to print a correction Masur is notleaving New York He will be conducting in both cities until at least when his New York contract expires            With justtwo big jobs Masur is far from the busiest of the big guns The title probablybelongs to Plcido Domingo the globetrotting tenor Anticipating the declineof his prolific singing careerhes  and most voices dont last past theearly sDomingo has pursued a sideline in opera conducting In  he wasappointed artistic director of the Washington Opera Nov  it was announcedthat he would also be replacing the retiring director of the Los Angeles OperaDomingo intends to run both institutions without cutting back on hisperformance schedule at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere his ThreeTenors concerts with Luciano Pavarotti and Jos Carreras his recordingcalendar or his bookings as a guest symphony conductor Perhaps thepaella will suffer at Domingo a Spanish restaurant he owns in midtownManhattan            Domingos helicoptertorehearsal lifestyle is now themodel for conductors whose salaries often match those of star athletes andCEOs Norman Lebrecht of the London Daily Telegraph  perhaps the onlymusic critic with much of an instinct for sleuthing has unearthed some of theclosely guarded salaries In  the conductor Lorin Maazel earned million including  million as the chief conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphonyand an additional  million from the Bavarian State Radio Orchestra Thepianistconductor Daniel Barenboim earns  million or more as music directorin Chicago artistic director and general music director of the DeutscheStaatsoper Berlin and as a touring conductor with both the Berlin and theVienna philharmonics Perhaps most amazing is Charles Dutoit who serves asartistic director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra musical director of theOrchestra National de France and the artistic director and principal conductorof the Philadelphia Orchestras summer season in Saratoga In his spare timeDutoit likes to  guest conduct            Such hallhopping undeniably adds to the wealth and fame of the worlds top conductorsBut is it good for music The era of the ludicrously prodigious maestro hascoincided with a sense of unease about the state of the symphony especially inthe United States Many orchestras are in poor financial shape faced withrising costs declining box office revenues and a cutback in public subsidiesAt the New York Philharmonic and elsewhere labor and administrative conflictseems perpetual And among people with long musical memories there is ageneral feeling that while this may be a period of high competence it is not agreat moment for orchestras or conductors A common complaint is that the soundof the big five American symphoniesNew York Philadelphia Boston Clevelandand Chicagowhile still of extremely high quality is more and morehomogenized Might these phenomenathe lackluster symphonic scene and theoverbooked conductorbe related            The great American orchestras were built byconductors who by todays standards would be hopeless homebodies The BostonSymphony was honed and polished by the Russian exile Serge Koussevitsky whoconducted  concerts a year for  years until  and was midwife to thecreation of great works by Stravinsky Schoenberg and Copland ThePhiladelphia Orchestra was led by Leopold Stokowski who reigned supreme for years until  when Eugene Ormandy succeeded himand stayed for  GeorgeSzell had a similar role in shaping Cleveland into a great musical city as didFritz Reiner in Chicago These men might travel to Europe for the summerfestival season but they lived in the cities in which they played Theyauditioned musicians personally and knew them well If a guest conductorvisited Philadelphia you would probably find Ormandy backstage or in theaudience Today by contrast conductors tend to have a much more tenuousrelationship with their home cities Rather than live in some backwater theyjet in and out for rehearsals and conduct  performances a year there insteadof  For nine months at a stretch they are somewhere else            Themusician who first set this pace was the exNazi Herbert von Karajan who inthe late s was simultaneously principal conductor of the BerlinPhilharmonic the Vienna State Opera and the Salzburg festival Von Karajansricocheting around Europe stoked an epic recording career and helped build anestate that was worth  million when he died in  There is no one sodominant now but Karajan remains the model for the hyperactive batons ofMaazel Barenboim Zubin Mehta Riccardo Muti Seji Ozawa and Claudio AbbadoThese conductors compete in a kind of orchestral arms race The advent of jettraveland supersonic jet travelhas made it possible for them to workvirtually simultaneously not just in several cities but on several continentsThe ambition of the conductor is abetted by the avarice of the agent whoreceives a commission of up to  percent on the fees and salaries henegotiates The most powerful of these is the reclusive Ronald Wilford ofColumbia Artists Management International who manages the worlds leadingconductors and uses his market power to drive fees ever higher            There are a few honorable exceptions to theorchestracollecting trend Perhaps the most admirable is Simon Rattle whotook the insignificant Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and over a period of years developed it into a distinguished ensemble Despite many lucrativeoffers Rattle has been loath to even spend much time visiting elsewhereRattle has now stepped down from the podium at Birmingham and is weighingoffers It is expected that he will again choose to work with one orchestrarather than several Michael Tilson Thomas who in  became the musicdirector of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra draws praise for doing morethan hanging his hat there Finlandborn EsaPekka Salonen gets high marks forhis commitment to the Los Angeles Philharmonic as does Leonard Slatkin atWashingtons National Symphony            Why would an orchestra preferan overpaid absentee landlord like Muti or Abbado to a dedicated residentespecially given that the latter is likely to come much cheaper Partly itsthe battle for prestige A provincial orchestra with an offbrand conductorseems doubly provincial But the bigger issue is finance Orchestra boardsbelieve that a star like Muti sells tickets even to the majority of concertshe doesnt conduct And even the occasional presence of a musical superstarmakes it much easier to raise money At a recent fundraiser the WashingtonOpera took in an extraordinary  million thanks to the charming presence ofDomingo            There are many moreorchestras than there used to be and arguably fewer great conductors Theresult has been a bidding war for top talent and an opportunity to make moneythat few can resist The recent transformation of the conductors careerparallels what has happened elsewhere in the economy As the income of topperformers of all kinds has risen exponentially the old patterns of indenturehave fallen away The ability of a Zubin Mehta  million plus per year or aCharles Barkley  million to make really big money has led to a system offree agency In basketball where teams are constituted by the season eachplayer looking out for his own career doesnt appear to harm the overallquality of the game But in symphonic music where great achievement comes fromteamwork over a much longer time frame the moonlighting maestro is playing toofast
