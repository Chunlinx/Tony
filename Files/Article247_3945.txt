                                 The iLA Timesi Baffling Economics            Yet another staff petition is circulating at the Los Angeles Timesconcerning publisher Kathryn Downings idiotic decision to share advertisingrevenue from the special issue of the Times Sunday magazine about LosAngeles new Staples Center arena with  the Staples Center This novelarrangement was made known a couple of weeks ago by New Times LA  An earlier staff petition protested thearrangement as a violation of journalistic ethics and last week prompted fromDowning  a bizarre apology in which she admitted she didnt know much abouthow newspapers work and  a refusal to resign            The new petition dated Nov  and addressed to LA Times editorMichael Parks who has said he didnt know of the financial relationship anddoes not approve of it urges Parks to publish a lengthy investigation in thepaper of how the Staples fiasco occurred                                             One of the most important steps the Times can take is to publishin its own pages a thorough examination of the events that led to the Staplesdeal The Times owes nothing less to its readers and to itsstaff                              Others have written about the Staples controversy and will continue to doso We need to do the definitive piece and do it firstnot have it dribble outin other places                        The petition cites as the main precedent for such an investigation DonaldBarlett and James Steeles Philadelphia Inquirer investigation of LauraForeman in the late s Foreman was a political writer at theInquirer who had an affair with a local pol while covering localpolitics for the paper The Times petition is signed by many importantpeople at the paper including city editor Bill Boyarsky Washington bureauchief Doyle McManus and such prominent LA Times writers and reportersas Kenneth Turan Howard Rosenberg Bob Drogin and Sam Fulwood Chatterboxsuspects other names have been added to the list since he acquired a copy            The petitioners have a good idea and not just because it might cost Downingand maybe even Mark Captain Crunch Willes the Times Mirror chief whose talkof more cooperation between the business and news departments of the newspaperprobably led to this fiasco their jobs There remain many unanswered questionsabout the Staples deal of which the journalism ethics question is onlyoneand perhaps the least interesting Why did the LA Times think itsStaples deal was smart from a business perspective According to thesketchy information available some of it from the LA Times  ownlimited coverage click here for the best piece the deal was as follows The LATimes  which for all practical purposes enjoys monopoly status in LosAngeles is paying the Staples Center which desperately needs publicity fromthe LA Times  somewhere between  million and  million annuallyThe ad revenue from the special issue of the LA Times magazine thatthe Times handed over to the Staples Center apparently was a downpayment on these dues In exchange the LA Times is getting a bunchof ad signs posted inside and outside the Staples Center the right to sellcopies of its newspaper inside the arena and its own luxury suite ieskybox The right to sell copies of the LA Times in the StaplesCenter is surely of negligible value Chatterbox suspects the same is true ofthe ad signs but even if theres stupendous value in the TV exposure thatresults its hard to see how the ads could be worth more than  InPhiladelphias Veterans Stadium a foot ad over the centerfield seatscurrently costs at most  per season The skybox is probably necessaryto pamper advertisers but if the Times had simply rented its own likemost corporations the annual cost would apparently have been at most a year according to the LA Times  RoyRivenburg This suggests that instead of paying  million to  millionper year to the Staples Center Downing should be paying something under million            An irony in all this is that the real way to make money off theStaples Center would have been to pander to advertisers with a special issue ofthe LA Times magazine which the Times did and notshare the stupendous proceedsreportedly  millionwith the Staples Centerbut rather to keep it all Chatterbox doesnt expect Captain Crunch andhis minions to understand journalism but dont they understand how to make abuck
