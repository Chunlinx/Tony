                                 Teachers Pet            If there is one region wherePresident Clintons popularity has probably not been affected by the recentwave of scandals it is the Hispanicdominated south Texas  thCongressional District which just held a special election for the seat of RepFrank Tejeda A Vietnam hero who died in January of cancer Tejeda receivedspecial mention in the presidents State of the Union address Clinton himselfhas carried this district twicehis focus on education jibes perfectly withthe workdriven ethic of a place to which so many come precisely because theybelieve in the American dream            In Texas special electionspit all comers against one another on one ballot In the  thDistrict  Democrats and four Republicans vied for Tejedas seat The top twofinishers in this especially acrimonious campaign the laborendorsed stateRep Ciro Rodriguez and the conservative prolife exSan Antonio CityCouncilman Juan Solis will face each other in an April runoff                           Ciro Rodriguez forCongress  which ran during the special election responds to Solischallenge to his niche appeal in a district that is also home to two Air Forcebases with presumably more conservative and fewer Hispanic voters by playingto Rodriguezs strengtheducation The year Texas House veteran has astrong track record on the issue Not only did he make it his priority duringhis tenure in the Legislature and through  years as a schoolboard memberbefore that but he has also identified it as a key issue in the second roundof campaigning ahead of the runoff            Rodriguez was the only oneof the  candidates able to afford television advertising his successful fundraising has been the subject of much invective This spot opens in the schoollibrary with him making a direct grab for Clintons coattails thatsimultaneously showcases his own focus on education it then moves to closeupsof three students two Hispanic and one AfricanAmerican Tejedas district isonly  percent AfricanAmerican but the spot makes this politically correctnod to diversity and to the blacks enlisted at the Air Force bases that are thelifeblood of the area            A wider shot of the studentaudience reinforces the overwhelmingly Hispanic character of this class and thedistrict at large Rodriguezs pledge to meet the presidents challenge tomake our schools the envy of the world is followed by a question that impliesfar more than it says Are you with me The call for solidarity reachesbeyond the issue at hand to tap a deeper sense of ethnic and culturalidentification Rodriguez like Solis and Tejeda before him is considered aMexicanAmerican success story a local who overcame cultural class andlinguistic barriers to rise to positions of leadership in the area His appealaims to strike the balance of people politics community and patriotism thatwas Tejedas hallmark through his years in office            The students affirm theirsupport in a scene doubleexposed over an offcenter shot of Rodriguez walkingdown a school hallway Overlapping frames are one of several gimmicks the admaker uses to get around the fact that the spot was shot not on film but onvideotape which tends to look flat metallic too much like the local ads fordiscount stores and usedcar lots Clever edits angles andas well seeaseries of quick cuts give this spot some depth and visual interest            As Rodriguez walks down thehall he is identified first by name then as the person who led the fight toimprove south Texas colleges and universities Repeating visuals flow fast andfuriousa shot of an empty classroom of someone donning graduation robes ofthe empty classroom of the faces in the library of the robes A bigger budgetmight have brought us visuals of a college campus of our children actuallycompeting of the better jobs they might get But this political shootsaved money not only by using tape but by finding all its education visuals inone high school The visuals arent particularly narrative but they work Sodoes the plain almost nonpolitical language The narrator draws a direct linkbetween education and jobsno Clintonian rhetoric about the new economythe  st century or that bridge here            The next scene of Rodriguezdeep in thought by the window recalls the blackandwhite photos of John FKennedy in a virtually identical pose in the Oval Office What could seem atfirst glance selfimportant strikes a chord nonethelessand in this Hispanicdistrict this kind of visual cue cant hurt            Ciro is taking a standnow we are told He is working to bring the cost of college into reach forworking people for the kid in the robes and the young woman whose photographin another cutrate scene that works is doubleexposed over a hallway ofempty lockers As the smiling graduate finally puts on his mortarboard we knowwhere the students from the empty classroom and hallway have goneto collegeWe hear the most political language yet a near clich about the Americandream The spots directness thus far papers over the tired languageand thecamera moves swiftly to Rodriguez facing his student audience again askingonce more Are you with me            Its astraightforward empowering conclusion to an argument that is as much aboutpride and shared experiences as it is about the more tangible issues Politicalconsultants have given the edge in this race to the candidate who bestaddresses concerns about education economic development and the security ofthose who depend on San Antonios military bases But an increasingly ugly raceto the tape suggests the intangibles might make the difference Each candidatehas sought to outdo his competitors in claiming closeness to Frank Tejeda andhis family This spot doesnt overtly link Rodriguez with the man whose mantlehe is trying to win But by focusing on the populism that made the th District Tejedas own it hopes those watching will make theconnection
