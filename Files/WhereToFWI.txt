                      Where to Go        Guadeloupe        Proudly styling itself the Caribbeans emerald isle        Guadeloupe is actually two islands linked by two drawbridges across the        narrow saltwater Sale River Guadeloupe from the air or on a map        resembles a butterfly        This largest of the FWI spreads its wings midway along the        Lesser Antilles chain Its major neighbors are volcanodevastated        Montserrat and Antigua to the north and Dominica to the south the        latter separating it from Martinique        Columbus named it after his favorite Spanish monastery Our        Lady of Guadaloupe in Estremadura To the Carib Indians then living        here it was Karukera island of beautiful waters Youll see why        Between the two world wars President Theodore Roosevelt        stopped by was entranced by the beautiful countryside and friendly        people of Guadeloupe and predicted that thousands of American        tourists would soon be visiting each winter It took the advent of        jetliners and cruise ships for that to happen        Less conservative than Martinique Guadeloupe of late seems        to be bidding to become the nudist playground of the Caribbean Several        of its beaches are officially designated for nudism known locally as        naturismethe most popular being Pointe Tarareand a functionary        who is a Chevalier de la Lgion dHonneur has been appointed to        supervise all aspects of sunning in the buff        Guadeloupes two component islands are notably dissimilar        and confusingly named GrandeTerre Great Land is smaller  sq        km sq miles drier flatter and more important because it has        PointePitre Guadeloupes commercial center and largest city        BasseTerre Low Land is higher bigger  sq km sq miles        greener and has the political capital also called BasseTerre which        is near the famous willitorwontit Soufrire volcano The islands        names refer to the different force winds hitting them not their        topography        About  people live on Guadeloupe with some  on        its administrative dependencies SaintMartin SaintBarthlemy        MarieGalante Les Saintes and Dsirade Twothirds are classified as        mulattoes including some  Asian Indians Blacks form  percent        of the population and Creole whites born here  percent About  of        the population is still under  years of age The high population        density constitutes a real problem        Scattered around Guadeloupe are some  stately        Creolestyle plantation homes of wood and stone recalling the distant        days of sugar prosperity Youre also likely to see modest modern        houses being transported from place to place on flat trucks        Guadeloupeans who dont always own land like to move around        Sightseeing for tourists is most rewarding by rental car        boat or both Otherwise hotels offer guided tours to scenic points        Small local buses or collective taxis are inexpensive and useful for        pointtopoint travel complete with transistor music and an abundance        of happy humanity but not for general touring Guadeloupes ordinary        taxis may also be hired but are extremely expensive        PointePitre        When this city was only a tiny fishing village three        centuries ago a Dutchman named Pieter is said to have been the most        popular fish peddler at a jetty on the waterfront Even though he        wasnt French from Pieter the name PointeaPitre was eventually        derived        Today weathered banana schooners chug past yachts and        gargantuan passenger liners to dock in this curious tropical port        which is Guadeloupes principal city and gateway to the world A        formless amalgam of wooden shacks and modern apartment buildings        Orientalstyle bazaars and shoppingcenter supermarkets PointePitre        betrays little of its turbulent past The traffic jams seem        incongruous but theyre authentic Half a day should allow the tourist        ample time for city sightseeing and shopping        Dont miss the openair market close by the wharves This        is the West Indies at their most colorful Aside from exotic fruits        strange roots land crabs dried fish spices and nuts you can pick        up spiritual spray for your house ointments designed to bring you        money lotions and powders for your ailments or a baby pig Some of        the stands under the bright umbrellas are real herbalists heavens but        even if you can understand the patois its difficult to learn the        precise uses for certain mysteriouslooking items        Close by nothing that matters in PointePitre is far        away is the center of youthful social actionthe Place de la        Victoire sprawling in the shade of sandbox trees During one phase of        the French Revolution a guillotine shortened many lives here though        the fact is deliberately forgotten by the boys eyeing the girls        pretending to ignore the boys Just off this pleasant main square of        the city youll find the useful state tourist office Office du        Tourisme        PointePitres cathedral the Basilique SaintPierre et        SaintPaul features unusual metal columns and balconies It was the        creation in  of a certain Monsieur Trouille Mr Jitters        Destroyed by three hurricanes in this century and rebuilt each time        the church is now said to be almost entirely constructed of pieces of        iron Its simple beauty is enhanced by locally designed stainedglass        windows in red blue orange and yellow The church is on Place        Gourbeyre opposite the modest Palais de Justice and just a few steps        from the citys main shopping district which embraces rues Nozires        Frbault and Schoelcher        Wandering in these fascinating little streets is best in        the early morning or late afternoon when the crowds and heat are        reduced Youll see dozens of irongrilled buildings reminiscent of        that other former French colonial port New Orleans Louisiana        The almost midtown Massabielle quarter faubourg de        Massabielle is sometimes described as the most picturesque in the        city Its a warren of wooden and corrugatediron cabins housing a        remarkable number of people Discretion when using your camera is        advisable here        Around GrandeTerre        Three formidable cannon greet you at the wooden drawbridge        entrance to Fort Fleur dEpe which commands access to        PointePitres harbor Its a minute drive from the city        Late in the th century British and French forces fought        bloody handtohand battles for this strategic hill considered the key        to the defense of all Guadeloupe Today birds chirp in the trees at        this totally tranquil spot In the dungeonlike chambers of the forts        lower reaches relics and documents relating to the war were kept in a        decorated room until the humidity destroyed them and it was then        closed to the public Now it is reopened to visitors        A little past the small theater built for local dramatic        performances theres a fine view across the bay to BasseTerre        A few miles down the coast at Gosier although its        difficult to imagine contingents of fierce invaders used to put        ashore Today this is Guadeloupes Riviera with resort hotels strung        along the beaches and tennis courts laid out among the coconut        trees        To reach Gosiers attractive offshore islet requires a        challenging swim or an easy boat ride Beneath the small lighthouse on        this uninhabited speck of sand and trees picnicking and nude bathing        are popular pastimes Windsurfers and sailboats on the aquamarine        waters make a memorable Caribbean snapshot best from the hillside        village of Gosier itself Here in the heart of the islands tourist        area youll find a number of small Creole French and Asian        restaurants and a few discotheques        Near the pleasant seaside village of SainteAnne farther        east is what is generally considered to be Guadeloupes best beach If        you land by boat Caravelle beach is yours for the using otherwise        youll have to pay a nominal charge to the vacation club that owns the        acreage A sizable segment of this long curving beach of white sand is        devoted to naturisme almost everywhere else on the entire strand        toplessness holds sway in the current French fashion but nobody        insists on it        SainteAnne itself has a long broad beach used not only by        fishermen in vividly painted boats but also by families with small        children The village was named after the wife of King Louis XIII        Queen Anne of Austria        Inland from both Gosier and SainteAnne is a peaceful        region of green hills or mornes as theyre known in the West Indies        Few of the tiny settlements identify themselves with signs roads are        generally unmarked and it can therefore be somewhat bewildering But        you cant get lost for long and in perhaps half an hour of driving        around this area of Grands Fonds youll get a real feeling for the        pastoral simplicity thats typical of Guadeloupe On the narrow roads        that tend to twist without warning youll encounter cows sheep        sugarcane wagons and little children        Back on the coast SaintFranois is a delightful fishing        village At any hour of the day youll see lobster traps being put        together and nets being mended along the shore An even more        picturesque scene occurs when the boats come in and jostling housewives        buy the days catch direct from the fishermen More recently        SaintFranois has grown to be a major tourist center        From SaintFranois an excessively narrow road heads        straight to the easternmost point of Guadeloupe  km miles from        PointePitre and one of the scenic highlights of the entire        Caribbean This is the Pointe des Chteaux a wildly beautiful cliff        formation with rocks shaped like castles lashed and eroded by the        Atlantics waves You may well get sprinkled by sea spray as you walk        along the rocky bluff to the large cement cross erected between         and  at the summit Dont fail to go all the way From this        spectacular point the view is outstanding The large island in the        distance is La Dsirade the small PetiteTerre islets are much        closer        A short distance away from the road on the way to Pointe        des Chteaux the long Tarare beach is another favorite with        nudists        A precolumbian Arawak Indian village has been unearthed        near the onceflourishing sugar town of Le Moule Resort hotels in the        area take advantage of several sandy beaches protected by breakwaters        from the heavy Atlantic surf that pounds most of GrandeTerres east        coast Most dramatic is the northern Porte dEnfer Gate of Hell        where the waves have sliced a huge chasm into the limestone shoreline        At the innermost point where the oceans force is completely spent but        the booming waves can still be heard is a small beach with shaded        picnic area adjoining it        The sparsely inhabited northern part of GrandeTerre is        sugarcane and cattle country Notice the windmills mostly in ruins        that once ground cane        At the end of a bumpy dirt road as far north as you can go        in Guadeloupe is the magnificent Pointe de la Grande Vigie This spot        is unbeatable for a picnic or simply to contemplate natures wonders        Follow the signs to the sightseeing point where on the predictably        clear day you can see across km  miles of blue ocean to La        Dsirade km  miles to Antigua and even km  miles to the        ashcovered peaks of Montserrat Below youll hear the waves crashing        into caves worn into the cliffsides This is a place where youll        exult in being alive        On a spurroad just a little north of the sleepy village of        AnseBertrand is the Anse Laborde a public beach of tan sand with        gorgeous turquoise waters and good snorkeling off rocky promontories        Farther south at the fishing village of Port Louis you can drive right        to one of the islands best beaches Anse du Souffleur        From PortLouis all the way down Grande Terres west coast        to PointePitre there extend vast mangrove swamps Theyre almost        unreachable except by boat but rewarding for fishermen and        birdwatchers The main highway south passes through the towns of Petit        Canal and MornelEau both characteristic of rural agricultural        Guadeloupe and through PointePitres heavily populated satellite        district of Les Abymes        Around BasseTerre        An undulating coastal highway completely encircles this        mountainous and densely forested island but its much too long a trip        to make comfortably in one day Among the best excursions is one over        another good road D  directly through the National Park which        covers more than  acres of BasseTerres interior This        crosscountry highway La Traverse continues west just beyond the        breezy hilltop village of Vernou Here overlooking the Lzarde river        valley with its swaying sugarcane are elaborate secluded villas which        seem a universe apart from the small sheds in which most Guadeloupeans        live As you drive along the winding road up to Vernou notice the        trees with huge strange roots        In Guadeloupes tropical rain forest its worth stopping        each time a wooden sign announces a particular attraction The rustic        BrasDavid picnic area for example is set alongside a burbling        stream At the House of the Forest La Maison de la Fort theres an        audiovisual exhibit in French only and you can take any of three        guided walks along discovery trails sentiers de la dcouverte        lasting   or  minutes For serious hikers there are other        major trails in the park        Its only a few hundred yards from the highway along a        fernlined path to the Crayfish Falls Cascade aux Ecrevisses a        paradisiacal swimming hole to splash around in If youre lucky        nobody else will be there to enjoy the waterfall the rocks and ferns        and the picnic site Youll see a sign announcing that there are         types of flora in Guadeloupe and just off the road youll find a        nursery that sells specimens        Reassuring note Unlike Martinique Guadeloupe has no        poisonous snakes or other harmful animals        On this road the highest point comes at the Pass of the        Two Breasts LeCol des Mamelles altitude  m  ft where its        worth stopping for the view For more sweeping panoramas you can hike        for less than an hour to either summitPetitBourg  m ft        or Pigeon  m ft        For those not spending the entire day in the park its        possible to return to PointePitre by circling the northern section        of BasseTerre along the coast road On the leeward coast underwater        sportsmen can head for the simple fishing village of Pigeon to pick up        a boat to the tiny let de Pigeon Otherwise you drive north through        PointeNoire named for its black volcanic hillsides and Deshaies an        unexceptional town on a very beautiful bay Continuing on youll reach        the muchadmired surfing beach at Grande Anse where fine brown sand        slopes away from palm trees to greenblue water If youve brought        lunch Grande Anse has pleasant shoreside picnic spots        Farther on you come to SainteRose Here in the th        century the first French landing party under Duplessis ran into violent        and unfriendly Caribs Today its a drowsily peaceful fishing village        On its outskirts the road crosses a river where you may see children        fishing or swimming off flat rocks and women and girls washing clothes        as they do in all  of BasseTerres major rivers        While traveling on your way back through Lamentin to the        PointePitre expressway youll pass seemingly endless fields of        unusually tall sugarcane        South to Soufrire        From PointePitre thick groves of banana trees with the        fruit protected from insects by transparent bags and fields of        sugarcane stretch away from the southbound coastal highway through        PetitBourg and Goyave Youre now approaching the spot where Europeans        first encountered Guadeloupe late in the th century But if youre        not watching close ly you may miss the unprepossessing bust of        Christopher Columbus perched atop a column in a little roadside square        The village is SainteMarie named by the explorer when he landed on        November  attracted by the waterfalls and river he could see        flowing down the green inland mountains On the base of the white bust        erected in  theres a declaration in French that it was here that        Karukera became Guadeloupe        Those curious enough to walk down the rural road to the        seacoast will find pigs goats chickens and children but no likely        looking landing place for a boat Locals shrug and suggest that the        shorelines topography must have changed in the  years since        Columbus        Just past the attractive farming town of Capesterre the        highway becomes for about  km  miles the socalled Alle        Dumanoir Twin rows of majestic royal palm trees line the road Behind        them are vast groves of banana trees        A bit farther along youll certainly want to turn off the        coast road and head up to the Carbet falls First you wind through        dense banana plantations then ferns and tree vines and then as the        road narrows to a cement track the tropical foliage closes in        Civilization here seems very distant To reach any of the three Carbet        falls you must continue walking after the roads come to an end for         minutes  minutes or two hours respectively Signs direct you to        these great waterfalls which are among Guadeloupes finest if least        visited scenic attractions        Just off the road D to the falls is the GrandEtang a        placid lake surrounded by forest with silence broken only by birds        insects and fish that occasionally flip out of the water It takes        less than an hour to stroll all the way round the pleasant path        surrounding the water        Back on the coastal highway you wont wonder why the        village of Bananier has its name From here to TroisRivires is one of        the loveliest drives in the FWI At the lookout point pull over for an        inviting panorama of the offshore islands of Les Saintes        At TroisRivires stop to see fascinating rock engravings        believed carved  years ago by the Arawak Indians A delightful        archaeological park has been created on the hillside around these huge        mysterious rocks The inscriptions seem to be more than casual        etchings but their significance isnt known Three rocks have been        removed to museums in Berlin New York and Paris others in the        TroisRivires area outside the park have not yet been classified as        historical monuments by the French government Local residents will        tell you where to find them Brochures in English available without        charge describe the rocks and vegetation        Down the road from the archaeological park is a lively        covered fish and vegetable market From the cement jetty here boats        leave early every morning for Les Saintes        Guadeloupes political capital BasseTerre is much        smaller and sleepier than PointePitre Just passing through you may        be reminded of a minor town in the French provinces except for its        magnificent seaside setting at the foot of Mount Soufrires green        slopes The mighty Fort SaintCharles dates back to  since renamed        Fort Louis Delgrs If you do stop in BasseTerre you might like to        spend some time at the large market just off the capitals broad        shoreline drive        From here its all up through the charming hillside        village of SaintClaude with its upperincome homes and on toward the        summitor as far as the gendarmes are allowing traffic to proceed        that day The higher you go the more sulphur youll smell it emanates        from bubbling fissures in the eerily beautiful landscape A scenic but        rather narrow road skirts Soufrires cone and the Carbet falls on the        other side of the volcano You can drive almost to the crater but you        have to climb the final  m  ft to the top dont forget to        bring along a sweater On cloudless days a spectacular panorama        awaits you But wherever you are on the mountains upper reaches the        views are glorious To appreciate the hiking trails here an excellent        National Park booklet available in English can be obtained from the        Tourist Office in PointePitre        Vacillating Volcano        It huffs puffs and occasionally even blows a bit No one        gets hurt Practically all of Guadeloupes tourist hotels are far out        of range La Soufrire temperamental and magnificent even if its peak        is almost always shrouded in clouds is a semiactive volcano At         m  ft it dominates the lush and rugged south of Basse        Terre When it began acting up with lowgrade vapor explosions in the        summer of  alarming headlines appeared in papers worldwide Some         volcanozone residents were evacuated at great cost to the        French government But nothing more happened and people gradually        returned home Soufrire is a splendid and perfectly safe place to        visit otherwise the monitoring experts wouldnt let you go        From BasseTerre north the leeward coast cte sous le        vent has a few small beaches of black volcanic sand and some        picturesque paraphernalia of the fishermen who favor these waters        Outside Baillif is the best preserved of the sugarmill watchtowers        erected by the famous militant priest Pre Labat see page  It saw        bloody fighting between the French and English at the beginning of the        th century One of Guadeloupes prettiest bays is Anse  la Barque        Boat Cove sonamed because fishing boats have long ridden out storms        in its protected anchorage        Les Saintes        You might pack a toothbrush as well as your bathing suit if        you decide on a oneday excursion to this cluster of little        islandstheyre hard to leave Only two of the eight islands of des        Saintes are inhabited and one TerredeBas just barely Youll land        at the main island TerredeHaut after a minute smallplane flight        from PointePitre Ferries also go to TerredeBas leaving from        PointePitre StFranois TroisRivires and BasseTerre        The harbor here dotted with yachts and fishing boats is        reminiscent of a miniRio de Janeiro or various Aegean and        Mediterranean ports Redroofed houses nestle on the surrounding hills        Under a trim white beacon a sign says TerredeHaut est heureuse de        vous accueillir et vous souhaite un agrable sjour TerredeHaut is        happy to welcome you and wishes you a pleasant stay They mean it        Little children

lobster traps gutting knives rods and lines        are everywhere its no surprise to learn that the inhabitants mostly        descendants of Bretons who settled here  years ago are considered        the best fishermen in the Antilles Both they and their long bright        boats are called Saintois The islanders often wear a distinctively        flat hat known as a salako and dont mind being photographed by polite        visitors        To begin with you can take a guided minibus tour local        drivers generally speak French only that covers all  km  miles of        road on the island It includes hilltop Fort Napolon unscathed since        it was built after the days of AngloFrench warfare in the region        Some modern art work is displayed inside  On the Cabrit islet across        the way youll see a thcentury fort named inevitably after the        Empress Josephine        After strolling for the five minutes it takes to examine        the little village wise tourists head directly for Pompierre beach        This might be your idea of paradise a semicircular sandy strip backed        by sea grapes and tropical shrubs gentle aquamarine surf a coral reef        close to

       PointePitre        MarieGalante and La Dsirade        Most tourists wont want to take time on a limited vacation        to visit these island dependencies of Guadeloupe There are however

anthurium poinsettia and more all compete to make Martinique one of        the most colorful tropical gardens on earth When Columbus discovered        the island late in his career he called it the best the most        fertile the sweetest the most charming country in the world and        named it Matinino probably after Saint Martin or some say as an        approximation of Madinina a name

helps But as in Guadeloupe the economic outlook rarely inspires        complacency even with increasing tourism        The visitor will most appreciate Martinique by exploring in        a rented car or if three or four people share the cost a tour by        regular taxi becomes a reasonable proposition For tourists at hotels        and for cruise ship passengers there are also guided group excursions        to mayor attractions by minibus or boat        FortdeFrance        Clinging to its superb harbor Martiniques capital is        sometimes bustling sometimes drowsy but always captivating Awesome        green mountains form the backdrop while strikingly tall palm trees        dwarf all but a very few buildings        In the great bay where flying fish rise at dusk sloops and        ketches ferry boats and freighters cruise ships and fishing boats        never have a parking problem Ashore its another matter with        peakhour traffic jams and midtown parking woes        This is a city to savor on foot Best is the teeming        shopping area centered on the rue Isambert market In this cavernous        emporium youll have your pick of fresh Martinique pineapples coconut        slices or the pungent baby limes so loved in the West Indies Among        the bananas and Caribbean sweet potatoes youll find bottles of        oldtime patent medicines for sale This delightful marketplace has its        own snack bar featuring a fresh vegetable repas meal for a relatively        modest amount by French West Indies standards        The streets nearby are filled with shops selling bright        material including the madras prints so typical of the FWI readymade        clothing shoes and jewelry Bargaining here could well be        worthwhile        When you reach the canal technically the Levassor River        the propeller or hlice was invented by a Martiniquais Gilbert        Canque and tested for the first time in this rather murky stream        youll want to cross over the stone footbridge Small boats tie up here        with batches of crayfish fresh fish and eel and housewives clamor        for the fishermen to weigh their choices on rudimentary scales The        formal fish market is farther along the fascinating canalside Boulevard        Allgre In this enclosed but airy building youll find ladies with        large machetes expertly chopping off hunks of kingfish tuna or shark        for eager buyers        Tourists and Martiniquais alike tend to gravitate toward        the landscaped park called La Savane near the waters edge in the heart        of the city Beyond the outdoor shopping pavilions here youll come        across a white marble statue of Napoleons Josephine holding a rose        and facing the direction of her birthplace across the bay The statue        was beheaded several years ago by islanders who blame Josephine for        her role in the slavery in Martinique        Pierre Belain dEsnambuc the Norman adventurer who first        claimed Martinique for France also has a statue here but cast in less        regal bronze Though youd never guess it the French fought bloody        battles on La Savane against the English and Dutch Near the park note        the New Orleansstyle iron grillwork on the buildings        Alongside La Savane runs rue de la Libert and at No  is        Martiniques excellent Muse dpartemental In the three stories of        this little airconditioned museum you can see displays of prehistoric        Indian artifacts skeletal bones found locally and a wealth of items        chosen to evoke a feeling for the islands history over the past three        centuries Napoleon and Josephine get top billing of course as does        the eruption of Mount Pele see page  There are slave irons        traditional island costumes and an interesting French map of         showing the thtre de la guerre theater of war between the Americans        and the British The museum is open from am to pm and  to pm Monday        to Friday with audiovisual shows in the afternoon and on Saturday        mornings        Farther along rue de la Libert is the startling Schoelcher        Library bibliothque This odd but attractive townhouse with its        collection of Arawak and Carib relics was on display at the  Paris        Exposition then dismantled brought to Martinique and reconstructed        Victor Schoelcher the philanthropist who donated most of the librarys        books is credited with abolishing slavery here Another midtown        landmark in FortdeFrance is the imposing SaintLouis Cathedral which        dates from         Youll have to confine your viewing to the outside of the        old citadel in the harbor Fort SaintLouis unless youre able to        obtain special visitors permission from the French military true of        all Martiniques forts or happen by during recently authorizedbut        infrequentvisiting hours  In the th century this fort was all        there was to the town but dwellings were gradually built up around it        on reclaimed marshland The fort which held off a savage Dutch attack        in  was known as FortRoyal later corrupted in Creole to Foyal        Napoleon named it FortdeFrance and that name was taken over for the        town Fires and hurricanes during the last century subsequently reduced        its importance Had it not been for the volcanic disaster that all but        wiped SaintPierre off the map in  FortdeFrance would never have        become Martiniques leading city        Venture Into the Interior        If you have time for only one road trip on the island be        sure it includes the Route de la Trace more prosaically known as Route        Nationale  La Trace is one of the Caribbeans great roads with        gorgeous views down into ravines and up at the deep green Carbet peaks        that dominate northcentral Martinique Along the way near the hamlet        of La Donis there are two thriving nurseries which sell local foliage        species but note that these are closed on Sundays        Caution Unlike other islands of the French West Indies        Martinique has poisonous snakes and walking off a marked forest trail        is not recommended        For that outofthisworld feeling and superior tropical        mountain scenery try first gear on the road to Fond SaintDenis        Precipitous turns lead to the observatory of the University of Paris        strategically perched to monitor the Pele volcano To visit this        establishment which resembles a private residence you must make        arrangements three days in advance Up here gazing out at strikingly        lush mountains you may find yourself higher than the clouds which        adds to the extraordinarily eerie atmosphere of the place        SaintPierre and the Volcano        It was a lovely seaside town the first French settlement        on Martinique and by early  so culturally and economically        thriving that it was nicknamed the Paris of the West Indies  When        m ft Mount Pele began belching smoke and cinders far        above SaintPierre in late April which it had done harmlessly before        authorities professed no concern Evacuation was unthinkable since an        election was coming up        On  May a mass of mud and rocks was swept down by        Peles White River Rivire Blanche over a factory killing         people At the same time a tidal wave lashed the shores near        SaintPierre Flames began spouting from the mountains peak On  May        the governor of Martinique arrived with his wife to calm the        residentsSaintPierres total population was about         At am on  May Pele erupted titanically A vast        burning cloud of gas and steam bearing rocks and ashes roared down the        mountainside onto the town In just three minutes SaintPierre was        totally wiped out The only survivor was a prisoner in a thickwalled        dungeon who for years afterwards was displayed abroad as a circus        attraction He didnt die until         The eruption of the volcano is documented in the excellent        Franck Perret museum Perret lived in SaintPierre from  to         Perched near the crater during the  eruption he studied the        composition of Peles volcanic gases then founded the museum that he        donated to the municipality He died in New York shortly after leaving        the island        French English and Spanishspeaking guides at the        oneroom museum help explain the sobering display of relics of the once        lively city Particularly graphic are blownup old photographs a        burned and twisted sewing machine and a mass of scissors soldered        together by the intense heat One curiosity is a charred electric light        fixture and bulb that somehow continued to work for  years until it        suddenly stopped one day in  The museum is open every day        including Christmas and Carnival from am to noon and  to pm        Just outside glance over the cannon parapet for a view of        the remains of devastated beachside buildings About  m  yards        up the street youll see the ruins of what was SaintPierres        glittering theater and nearby the rubble of the old prison        Today SaintPierre is a little town of some  people        If you ask natives will probably concede that they always worry a        little about that mountain up there but since the minor eruption in         there has been no smoke and only occasional earth rumblings        The Far North        History buffs will have to ask along the road north of        SaintPierre for the unmarked location of the socalled Caribs        Grave where Indians pursued by French colonists hurled themselves        from a cliff in the th century vowing that Mount Pele would avenge        their deaths Farther on is the unassuming village of Le Prcheur        where another island girl who made good spent her childhood        yearsMadame de Maintenon second wife of Louis XIV Beyond Le        Prcheur youll go through the fishing hamlet of Anse Belleville with a        remarkably tall vinelike fig tree and a nice little beach        The coast here is all but uninhabited Normally youll        find no one at all on the delightful volcanic sand beach at Anse Cron        This idyllic spot is as far as you should attempt to drivethe        tropical track ahead will defeat most vehicles        Instead to reach Martiniques northernmost villages of        GrandRivire and Macouba drive inland from SaintPierre skirting        Mount Pele This route takes you through Morne Rouge and Ajoupa        Bouillon Driving in this region as elsewhere you may be surprised to        see brightly painted tires hanging outside houses These are only for        decoration and not intended to ward off evil spiritsvolcanic or        otherwise For such purposes some Martiniquais resort to different        means        As you reach the Atlantic coast youll become almost        engulfed in vast groves of banana trees with bunches hanging        temptingly close to the road But its best to steer clear of these        groves because they harbor a poisonous snake called the fer de        lance        At Macouba its worth stopping at the simple cliffside        church where Pre Labat spent some time to examine its cemetery        jutting out over the ocean The lively little fishing settlement far        below on the waters edge is an easy walk down but very tiring coming        back up on a hot day If you do descend youll see some rather curious        caverns in the limestone cliffs where on occasion local people sing        and dance to stringed instruments        Persevering along the bumpy cobblestone road with its        hairpin bends youll cross two green modern metal bridges Then you        arrive at GrandRivire This endoftheroad village is famed for its        skilled and dauntless fishermen Youll probably see boys surfing the        high somewhat dangerous Atlantic waves on the smooth trunks of balsa        langue de buf trees This lightweight wood cut to the size of the        boy intending to use it makes unexpectedly good surfboards        SaintPierre to FortdeFrance        Just off the gray sand Anse Turin beach near Le Carbet a        roadside sign reports that Paul Gauguin sojourned here in l The        sign points through an arched aqueduct of crumbling stone to the Muse        Gauguin displaying some original works by the great French painter        though only copies of his paintings Also in Le Carbet the Amazona        Zoological Garden with alligatorlike caimans snakes armadillos and        other delights        Farther down the coast road youll come to Martiniques        mostphotographed fishing village Bellefontaine with a beach        cluttered with nets and the distinctive gommier fishing boats invented        by the Carib Indians Schoelcher formerly a small fishing village just        north of FortdeFrance has expanded to become an extension of the        capital city Named after the abolitionist Schoelcher is proud of its        reconstructed Benedictine monastery        From FortdeFrance the inland road through the        agricultural towns of SaintJoseph and Gros Morne meanders over hills        thickly planted with bananas pineapple and sugarcane You wont envy        the men and women you see working in the fields under the blazing sun        but theyre never too tired to return your wave with a smile At        SaintJoseph ask to be shown a travelers tree arbre du voyageur        from Madagascar which has a reserve supply of water within its        trunk        South Along the Caribbean        By any standards TroisIlets seems an unlikely hometown        for an empress The village is named after the three small islands it        overlooks in a corner of FortdeFrances huge bay Dont miss the        neatly whitewashed church with a pale blue ceiling above its cool        interior Here Josephines parents were married and she was baptized        though the plaque notes merely that the village celebrated the th        anniversary of Napoleons death on  May         About five minutes away in the unspoiled countryside        youll jolt over the  rockiest yards of road in Martinique to get to        the Muse de la Pagerie Contained in the restored kitchen and prayer        room of Josephines family estate the tidy little museum is a shrine        to the onetime empress Youll see period furniture slave chains and        old paintings but the greatest attractions are a photocopy of Napoleon        and Josephines wedding certificate and an emotional love letter he        wrote her in  from Italy an English translation is displayed        Guides will shyly tell you that visitors to this outoftheway        memorial have included Queen Margrethe of Denmark King Leopold of        Belgium Lady Clementine Churchill and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis        Also in TroisIlets the Sugarcane Museum         Just down the road from the museum lie the rolling        fairways of Martiniques hole golf course and a little farther on        the PointeduBout resort with its cluster of hotels beaches and a        marina If you continue by boat around this most attractive peninsula        youll notice several secluded little coves scooped out of the often        steep coastline By car or ferry from FortdeFrance you can reach        Anse  lAne which has a pleasant brownsand beach with sea grapes        providing shade plus picnic tables childrens slides and        restaurants        Even better is Les AnsesdArlet as delightful a village        as there is anywhere in the French West Indies You may have to share        the three fine little beaches with a few cheerful fishermen The        Caribbean here is usually placid and always inviting and the        atmosphere is utterly relaxed the tiny village quiet and clean        Motorboats from the capital will bring you out here in record time        After a stop to contemplate Diamond Rock see box below        most tourists continue south over winding roads through SainteLuce        RivirePilote and Le Marin without stopping until they reach        SainteAnne The best beach one of the best on the entire island is        nearby fronting a private vacation club The beach is public property        but anyone can simply walk there from SainteAnne The neighboring        public beach perfectly acceptable has unfortunately very little        shade Though the equator is only a mite closer here in the rather        arid south of Martinique the sun does seem hotter         Having reached SainteAnne you should certainly drive        south for perhaps ten minutes as far as the road permits to the        string of beautiful deserted beaches known as Les Salines Take your        lunch this is wild farout Caribbean beach territory with no        facilities of any kind although some islanders keep tents here        permanently for weekend camping The area is named after the large salt        pond youll see        This is also the site of a strangebut a little        disappointingpetrified savanna forest la savanne des        ptrifications rather difficult to reach over rutted automobile        trails of rock and sand Here as far south as you can go on        Martinique the landscape is desolate Only cacti seem able to grow        amid bleak rocks that on inspection turn out to be petrified wood Its        speculated that aeons ago this may have been a forest extinguished by        the eruption of some volcano now deep under the sea        The Atlantic Coast        Much of the rugged windward coast is accessible only by        boat The only worthwhile beach area is near Tartane on the midisland        Caravelle peninsula where theres also a park with walking trails        Youll enjoy visiting Le Vauclin a consummate fishing        village with more than its share of friendly weatherbeaten people        Much evidence of a major Carib Indian settlement has been unearthed in        this region        The views of the whole of southern Martinique from Mount        Vauclin are spectacular        Up the coast Le Franois is a curious blend of typical        wooden homes and modern apartment buildings spreading down toward a        pretty bay and a lazy marina The nearby historic Rhum Clment        distillery offers tours and tastings        SainteMarie houses a Rum Museum with documents and        equipment going back to  as well as a fascinating new Banana        Museum         SaintMartin        Its an island with a dual personality each side trying        to outsmile the other Whatever you call it SaintMartin as the French        do or Sint Maarten with the Dutch it is part of both the French West        Indies and the Netherlands Antilles        Columbus named the island after St Martin on that saints        feast day in  or did he Given the inexact state of the geography        along the confusing Antilles chain some experts suggest that he        actually gave the name to Nevis an island to the south and that        subsequent cartographers somehow awarded it to SaintMartin The        similarity to MatininoMartiniqueonly confuses things more        Certainly this island can qualify as having one of the        worlds longestrunning governmental love affairs since  the        French and the Dutch have shared sovereignty in almost total harmony        When the two nations divided it up France got  sq km  sq miles        and Holland agreed to take just  sq km  sq miles but that        included the important salt pond near the Dutch capital of        Philipsburg        Legend has it that the division was accomplished by        having a Frenchman and a Dutchman start back to back pacing off        territory some say the Frenchman got more of the island because he had        a longer stride or that the Dutchman stopped too often for a snort of        gin         Another thing those early French and Dutch settlers agreed        upon was that their island should be free of levies on any imported        goods That still means completely dutyfree shopping today and        therefore together with nearby SaintBarthlemy the Caribbeans        lowest prices for many items see page         Theoretically there should be a frontier hut but there        isnt a single customs official and the border has been unguarded for        over  years On the main highway youll know youve passed crossed        over by a stone monument commemorating the partition and signs reading        Bienvenue Partie Franaise in one direction Welcome to Sint Maarten        in the otherthats all Before the islands telephone service was        boldly upgraded it used to be easier to drive across the border than        to put through a call to the other side  So near yet worlds apart        the two sides maintain their separate identities the Dutch side        despite such holdouts as thin cigars gin and Indonesian rijstafel        has begun to resemble an American beachhead after years of landings by        hordes of cruiseship shoppers        On the French side of the island a subprefecture of        Guadeloupe every schoolchild learns the mother tongue There is a        Creole patois heavily influenced by immigrants from Haiti but its        essentially based on French Here on the northernmost of the FWI        youll find such familiar trappings as boulangeries restaurants        featuring delicate wine sauces and gendarmes if only a mere handful        Around  people live on the French side the same amount on the        Dutch        Marigot        Whereas Dutch Sint Maarten is one of the more upbeat        places in the Caribbean much of the French sides charm is that it        seems content to slumber in the sun Marigot the modest capital on its        wide bay is so quiet that very large fish venture in surprisingly        close to shore Youll also see plenty of yachts but cruise ships        rarely enter Philipsburg gets nearly all of them        When Marigot livens up early in the day at the quayside        youll want to be there Like their Guadeloupean and Martiniquais        counterparts SaintMartins fishermen invariably chug home with their        catches to a clamorous welcome Nearby ladies with broad smiles sit on        little stools selling breadfruit and cinnamon Things become almost        chaotic by Marigot standards when an interisland cargo scow arrives        with haphazardly tethered livestock and strawhatted voyagers        The Dutch hav e a fort so the French have a fort For the        view over Marigot Bay its worth the fourminute climb up to deserted        old Fort SaintLouis This thcentury bastion looks its age and then        some Sheep graze alongside a rusty disused cannon standard armament        of FWI forts        A few minutes up and over the hill by car is Grand Case a        delightful village strung unpretentiously along a long curving beach        Much smaller than Marigot and even lowerkey it has numerous        restaurants and places to stay At salt flats nearby is tiny Esprance        airport a onestrip oneshed affair used for flights to and from        PointePitre and SaintBarthlemy        The Beaches and the Sea        Counting little coves youll reach only by boat        SaintMartin has  beaches of fine sometimes dazzling white sand with        hotels located on some of the best Following the avantgarde lead of        big sister Guadeloupe SaintMartin has introduced a nudist beach        Elsewhere on the French side of the island toplessness is        optional        Churning or serene deep blue or aquamarine the water is        clear and clean Snorkeling and skin diving are particularly rewarding        at a number of isolated inlets and nearby islets and boats to take you        there are readily available The  wreck of a British warship on a        reef  km  miles offshore is a divers dream for the nonscuba set        theres a glassbottomed boat you can take to see big groupers and        perhaps sea turtles swimming around the sunken ships cannon        Sailboats of various sizes are offered for rent around the        island Beginners appreciate the calm waters of Simson Bay the largest        lagoon in the West Indies Old salts may want to skipper their charter        craft across open sea to the smaller Dutch islands of Sint Eustatius or        Saba or to French SaintBarthlemy If you dont doityourself        theres a choice of oneday group excursions by motor launch or        sailboat Hotels will be able to arrange for deepsea fishing and        waterskiing        Touring the Island        Without seriously disrupting the leisurely pace of your        vacation you can see the highlights of SaintMartin in one day        breaking for a swim and a relaxed lunch Theres a great deal of        pastureland with stone walls Traffic can be heavy though count on         minutes between Marigot and Philipsburg Rental car firms offer        descriptive tape cassettes for your own guided tour otherwise        agencies run bus tours and taxi drivers are pleased to drive you        around        Probably the most exciting things to see on the island are        other islands Outside Philipsburg from a roadside lookout point youll        make out four islands rising out of the sea in the distance Nevis St        Kitts Sint Eustatius and Saba More dramatically from the high        serpentine road to Oyster Pond from Philipsburg youll be stunned by        the beauty of SaintBarthlemy across a royal blue swath of the        Atlantic        SaintBarthlemy        This just might be the best piece of France anywhere        Known fondly as St Barts Columbus bestowed his brothers name        Bartholomew on the island when he sailed past in  Its an        absolutely peaceful absolutely beautiful little island of roller        coaster

handful of black        families that have also lived here for generations strike visitors as        extremely kind open and simple Among themselves they speak a nasal        oldfashioned French accented in a way that reminds visiting Parisians        of FrenchCanadian speech Sprinkled through it are bits of English and        Swedish For nearly a century until  St Barts was the only        possession Sweden ever had in the Caribbean see page   The result        is a patois baffling to anyone not brought up on St Barts        Now that the island has a modern international airport        people are making their way to St Barts in everincreasing numbers        Swelling the ranks of American vacationers are trendy young Frenchmen        from the mtropole They like the relaxed lowkey

harbor Some new hotels have opened but so far St        Barts has lost little of its former charm        The most popular way to get there is by scheduled flight        from SaintMartin or Guadeloupe

SaintMartin see page         Liquor and tobacco are good buys There are also several French        boutiques that stock merchandise from the Continent though the        selection of items for sale is rather limited        When sightseeing youll find the two thriving churches        somewhat more interesting than the three ruined forts overlooking        Gustavia St Barts of course is completely undefended But then this        very particular island is hardly in danger of being invaded except of        course by tourism        Around the Island        Sightseers have their choice of taxi or rental vehicles        including the ubiquitous Minimoke and beach buggy ideal for local        conditions To spend more than four hours covering every paved and        unpaved road most of which terminate in unannounced dead ends would        be a difficult task If youre stranded anywhere hitchhiking is        accepted behavior and youll surely get a ride In recent years the        number of motor vehicles on St Barts has escalated to something like        two per inhabitant        The seascapes and panoramas on this island are enough to        tempt any driver to glance away from the serviceable but        neverwideenough roads From the highest point on the Vitet road        youll want to stop to take in the sweeping view over a bay called        GrandCuldeSac which is favored by windsurfers and out to Tortue        islet in the Atlantic Not far away is Pointe Milou a wild        breathtaking headland from which on a clear day you can count nine        isles or rocks in the sea The strange cactuslike plants growing here        in great profusion are called TtelAnglais They have prominent red        protuberances and may have been named after the British redcoats        The French West Indies may be matriarchal but on St        Barts the father runs the family Practically everyone goes to church        the Catholic majority either on Saturday evening or Sunday when mass        is celebrated at different churches Its worth going to church or        visiting the fishing hamlet of Corossol just to see the ladies wearing        the starched white bonnets called quichenottes a St Barts trademark        that dates back to the time of the original Huguenot settlers        Beaches        The very best are difficult to get to as is often the        case with superior beaches in the Caribbean Coconut trees and sloping        cliffs ring the tranquil waters of Le Grand Colombier This northern        beach of magnificent tan sand is most agreeably reached by boat        Otherwise if the road gives out youll have to walk for about half an        hour to this paradise bay which a noted American banker David        Rockefeller chose as the site of his Caribbean vacation home Members        of the Rothschild and Ford families also took up residence nearby        Very bumpy roads will take you almost as far as the        second and thirdbest beaches Gouverneur and Grande Saline in        neighboring coves on the south coast Sea grapes and shrubs provide        little shade here but otherwise you should find no fault with either        of these shores Legend has it that treasure lies buried hereabouts        hidden away by a French buccaneer called Montbars the Exterminator        Access to La Baie de SaintJean the mostphotographed of        SaintBarthlemys  beaches is quite easy There are actually two        shimmering crescents of pale sand here separated by a small rocky        promontory        At Corossol Anse des Cayes and Anse de Lorient youll        share the shore with fishermen who set out to sea in gaily painted        boats        Currents can be surprisingly strong at the attractive        Flamands beachnot recommended for children or poor swimmers At many        points around St Barts and its small rocky offshore islets there is        fine reef snorkeling
