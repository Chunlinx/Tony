                    Background        Pelvic floor disorders PFD are highly prevalent among        elderly women Many surgical reports attempt to determine        the best surgical treatment for PFD yet do not address the        pathophysiology The etiology of PFD is probably        multifactorial including a genetic predisposition to        connective tissue abnormalities vaginal childbirth with        damage to the innervation of the pelvic floor muscles        estrogen deficiency and aging effects     The pelvic        floor situated at the bottom of the abdominal cavity        forms a supporting shelf for the abdominal and pelvic        viscera It has three layers the endopelvic fascia the        levator fasciae and muscles and the perineal        membraneexternal anal sphincter        The primary support for the pelvic organs comes from the        pelvic floor muscles      This suggests that an        alteration to the levator ani supportive function may        significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of PFD            which affect  of younger and nearly  of elderly women            In women the levator muscles form a horizontal        shelf with an anterior midline cleft the urogenital        hiatus through which the urethra vagina and rectum pass        Anatomically the levator muscle is subdivided into the        iliococcygeal and the pubococcygeal muscles     Fig                The levator ani muscles play an important role in        bladder neck fixation provided by the suspensory sling and        hiatal ligament     The urethra is supported by the        action of the levator ani muscles through their connection        to the endopelvic fascia of the anterior vaginal wall            and the muscles of the levator ani contract during a        cough to assist continence     The fast twitch type II        fibers in the levator ani muscles play an important role in        continence and their loss accompanies the development of        urinary incontinence     Clinically women with        recurrent urinary incontinence after Burch colposuspension        have a more pronounced pelvic floor weakness than women        with primary stress urinary incontinence     This        suggests that the recurrent urinary incontinence is caused        by a progression of pelvic floor dysfunction Severe        alteration in the levator ani integrity is associated also        with fecal incontinence              Histologic and histochemical analysis of pubococcygeal        muscle obtained from asymptomatic women and from women with        PFD has shown that both age and parity vaginal delivery        appeared to be related to the morphological features of the        samples In the symptomatic women there was a significant        increase in the number of muscle fibers showing        pathological damage The range of diameters of both type I        and II fibers was significantly different between        symptomatic and asymptomatic women A significant        proportion  of muscle fibers in symptomatic women        were type I fibers showed centrally located nuclei and        exhibited significantly greater diameter than type I fibers        in asymptomatic women            However the cellular and molecular aspects of        regression of type II fibers are poorly understood Though        apoptosis in adult muscles has been described and may        result from changes within bclbax system alteration in        pathways that regulate differentiation of muscle cells        changes in the myonuclei and the nature of pathways        inducing senescence of skeletal muscles are still far from        being clear            Among cell cycle related proteins an important role in        the regulation of skeletal muscle differentiation belongs        to p kipp protein     a cyclindependent kinase        inhibitor required for cell cycle arrest Additionally        since the identification and cloning of the p gene in             the p protein has been shown to be involved        in various other aspects of cell physiology and pathology            Our previous study has shown that differentiation        of cells in tissue culture is associated with an increase        in p expression     Although a regular p        expression protects normal cells from apoptosis        overexpression of p induces apoptosis of cells through        elevation of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax             These observations indicate that changes in p expression        can determine the fate of muscle cells        Aims of the present study were to investigate p        expression in levator ani muscle of symptomatic women        determine changes with age and compare the p expression        with histochemical detection of fast and slow twitch        muscle fibers in parallel sections                    Materials and Methods                  Patients          Biopsy samples      mm were collected from           symptomatic patients with PFD stress urinary          incontinence pelvic organ prolapse fecal incontinence          and overlaps age range  without hormone          replacement therapy Besides hormone replacement also          excluded from the study were patients with a history of          malignancy endometriosis and pelvic infections          Tissue sampling from levator ani muscles and fascia          illustrated in Fig  was based on the work of Bernstein             biopsy size and site with some modifications          approved by the Institutional Review Board We used          similar approaches to obtain the biopsy during          reconstructive surgery symptomatic patients and          abdominal hysterectomy asymptomatic controls The          biopsy sample was always obtained from the right          pubococcygeal muscle The biopsy was lateral  mm          to the urethrovesical junction and was performed midway          between the urethra and arcus tendinus white line It          was lateral enough from the urethra to avoid any          alteration of nerves to the urethra and bladder          In reconstructive surgery on entering the space of          Retzius the fat was pushed aside to expose the superior          fascia of the levator ani After incision the fascia          biopsy specimen    mm was collected Next the Allis          clamp was used to expose a small part of the          pubococcygeal muscle and collect a      mm muscle          biopsy specimen          For comparison biopsies were obtained from nine          asymptomatic women age  who were having a          hysterectomy for benign conditions such as abnormal          uterine bleeding fibroids or pelvic pain and no hormone          replacement therapy They did not have any demonstrable          pelvic relaxation by examination or history of stress          urinary incontinence We were unable during a two year          period collect biopsies from asymptomatic women of age           or older The apparent reason for this is that except          for urogynecological indications and cancer there is          virtually no reason for abdominal gynecologic surgery in          postmenopausal women To ensure the compatibility of          biopsy samples the space of Retzius was opened in all          patients          During abdominal hysterectomy the urinary bladder was          pushed down to reach the space of Retzius by incision          right behind the pubic bone The fat was pushed aside          with the assistance of a hand in the vagina and biopsy          was performed as described After biopsy a single          figureofeight stitch suture was placed in all patients          which corrected any potential loss of support that might          be caused by the biopsy This was bloodless and did not          create any lasting difficulties None of the control          patients developed urinary incontinence or evidence of          loss of support or voiding difficulties          In younger asymptomatic women we also collected          biopsy samples of ectocervix and endometrium from          hysterectomy specimens These samples were utilized to          determine p expression in other tissues for comparison          with expression in the skeletal muscle Fig  In          addition we utilized our collection of frozen human          corpora lutea CL from which some observations have          been reported previously       in order to          determine a relationship of p expression with some          other cell cycle related proteins under specific          circumstances Fig  All parts of the study were          approved by the Institutional Review Board at our          University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine All

   Microsoft Corporation Redmont WA software labeled          and saved in Portable Network Graphics format          The immunohistochemical staining was quantified as an          area in square micrometers maximum area for whole screen          was  sq micrometers at  magnification          occupied by the densities of peroxidase staining above          the sample background as described previously               Briefly the illumination of empty field image          background was first adjusted to  in  to  scale          Measurement of an area of peroxidase staining was          performed using the density slice method The upper limit          of the density slice was set at the  maximum density          value and the lower limit at  sufficiently high          above the hematoxylin staining of the nuclei which does          not exceed a density value  Under these conditions          the measured area represented a crude value in square          micrometers eg  To obtain net values each          crude value was subtracted with the value of tissue          background obtained from the same sample stained with a          control staining eg  m  net value   m           Six measurements were performed on each biopsy          sample These six values represented a dataset for a          single biopsy patient stained for a particular marker          Data in Fig represent means of  measurements from          asymptomatic patients A           n   and  measurements from          symptomatic patients S           n            To evaluate the density of p staining in western          blots we used a different approach Scanned blot was          transferred into the Scion Image enlarged  two times           and each lane was processed as follows Small square          area    pixels was used to obtain six background          measurements above the p band Subsequently six          measurements of staining within the p band crude          values were obtained Each crude value was subtracted          with corresponding background value giving the six net          values of p density The net values were used for          statistical calculations

produces a single band at  kDa in all investigated          tissues and no nonspecific staining is apparent with          secondary antibody alone This indicates that all          immunohistochemical observations should be ascribed to          the specific expression of p protein In western blot          the most prominent p expression was in the late          trophoblast culture  h as expected from our          previous study     When compared to trophoblast          culture the p expression in levator ani muscles was          lower but higher then weak expression in whole placenta          and rectus fascia          Fig Bshows quantitative evaluation materials and          methods of the blot in panel A The statistical          evaluation showed no significant difference between two          cases included symptomatic and asymptomatic female in          density of p expression in levator ani muscles                          Immunohistochemistry          Expression of p in levator ani muscle fibers of          control asymptomatic women was restricted to the plasma          membrane and adjacent nuclei Fig A and inset Some          muscle fibers close to the levator fascia often showed          weak cytoplasmic staining but no change in the cell size          Fig B Pre and perimenopausal symptomatic patients          showed hypertrophy of muscle fibers and this was          associated with variable cytoplasmic p expression          ranging from none to moderate Fig C Biopsy samples          obtained from symptomatic women in advanced postmenopause          showed diminution of size in some fibers accompanied by          strong cytoplasmic p expression Fig D and inset          This was accompanied by appearance of cytoplasmic          vacuoles in regressing muscle fibers Fig E and inset          and by an increase in the stromal component s Fig          Eand F Control procedure showed no nonspecific          staining inset Fig F          These data indicate that hypertrophy of muscle fibers          may be accompanied by moderate p cytoplasmic          expression Further increase in cytoplasmic staining p          overexpression accompanies shrinking and fragmentation          of muscle fibers This was characteristic for symptomatic          women in advanced postmenopause suggesting that hormonal          changes accompanying postmenopause such as diminution of          ovarian sex steroid production might contribute to the          degenerative changes in the levator ani muscle          From the ovarian sex steroids the role of diminishing          estrogen levels is questionable since the levator ani          muscle fibers do not express estrogen receptor alpha               It is not known if estrogen receptor beta is          expressed but levator ani muscle fibers show nuclear          expression of progesterone and androgen receptors              Altered ovarian function in the premenopause can be          observed as early as age  years and includes          hyperestrogenism and hypergonadotropism accompanied by          decreased progesterone secretion     During the          transition from pre to postmenopause both estrogen and          androgen levels also decline     These hormonal          alterations may well be responsible for the increased          gynecological morbidity that characterizes this period of          life including structural and molecular changes in          levator ani muscle and increasing incidence of pelvic          floor disorders                          Diminution of fast twitch fibers          We also studied histochemical staining type II and          type I fibers along with protein p expression Fig           ABC is a biopsy from an asymptomatic women age           exhibiting a proportional number of fast f Fig A          and slow twitch fibers s Fig B and strong surface          and nuclear but no cytoplasmic p expression Fig          C          Fig is from a symptomatic female age  Some          muscle fibers exhibited both type I and type II staining          representing the transitory t and t types This was          accompanied by p cytoplasmic expression in t fibers          In addition some fibers showed type I staining          accompanied by p cytoplasmic expression t fibers          This contrasted with a quiescent genuine fast f and          slow twitch s fibers which showed either type I or          type II staining and no p cytoplasmic expression The          transitory fibers often exhibited hypertrophy          Occurrence of both type II and type I staining in the          same striated muscle fiber has not been described When          using the term transitory fibers we are aware that a          static picture can not explain the dynamic process          However the transitory fibers show both type II and          type I staining cytoplasmic p expression suggestive of          ongoing differentiation      and marked          hypertrophy The occurrence of transitory fibers was          also associated with a decline in the number of fibers          exhibiting the type II staining only which suggests a          type II into type I transition Also a lack of muscle          cell shrinking and fragmentation during this process          indicates that type II fibers do not degenerate but are          transformed into the type I fibers                          Shrinking and fragmentation of muscle fibers          Fig Ashows a lack of type II fibers in          postmenopausal patient age  Type I staining was          characteristic for all fibers present including those          exhibiting a diminution in size Fig B Staining for          p revealed appearance of weak a to moderate          cytoplasmic expression a in some otherwise normal          fibers Very strong p expression was characteristic for          the fibers exhibiting cytoplasmic vacuolization a see          also inset Fig E and fragmentation a arrow ie          morphologic features characteristic for the cells          undergoing apoptotic cell death                              Quantitative evaluation of p expression          Fig Ashows cumulative data on p expression in          levator ani muscle from asymptomatic and symptomatic          patients The mean p expression in symptomatic patients          age range  years was much higher            P   when compared to          controls age range  years The power for number of          cases was  for number of measurements  However          there was also a highly significant difference in mean          age between the groups Fig B P   power           At present we are not able to determine if in          asymptomatic postmenopausal women the p expression in          levator ani muscles also increases with age since          nonurogynecological surgery except cancer excluded          is exceptional in such cases                          p cytoplasmic expression and muscle          abnormality          An important question is whether the increase in          cytoplasmic p expression correlates with the age of the          patients and the severity of the muscle abnormality Fig          shows a lack of cytoplasmic p staining of levator ani          muscle in another control female age  panel A          exhibiting normal size of muscle fibers n and high          proportion of type II fibers panel B Panels C and D          show a situation in the youngest patient from symptomatic          group age  pelvic organ prolapse The muscle fibers          show marked hypertrophy h and cytoplasmic p          expression panel C associated with a lack of type II          staining panel D On the other hand panels E and F          show a situation in the oldest female in asymptomatic          group The size of fibers is normal but moderate p          cytoplasmic staining is evident panel E This is          however accompanied by a lack of fast twitch fibers          panel F          Hence even in the presence of moderate cytoplasmic          p expression in muscle fibers of normal size Fig E          which accompanies depletion of fast twitch fibers panel          F the woman may remain continent without an actual          evidence of pelvic floor disorder On the other hand          cytoplasmic p expression accompanying hypertrophy of          muscle cells panel C was accompanied by PFD These          observations indicate that an increase in cytoplasmic p          staining may accompany normal female aging age           along with the diminution of fast twitch fibers in          otherwise normal muscles and without manifestation of          PFD Conversely levator ani from younger symptomatic          patient age  exhibited hypertrophy of muscle cells          accompanied by increased cytoplasmic p expression and          manifestation of PFD Altogether the cytoplasmic p          expression is indicative of fast to slow twitch          transition of levator ani myotubes but not necessarily          indicative of manifestation of PFD assuming normal          muscle morphology          Table summarizes our observations and suggests          possible pathways for the transition of type II to type I          fibers and progression of degeneration of levator ani          muscle cells Note that a lack of type I staining is          characteristic for fast twitch fibers only row  and a          lack of p cytoplasmic expression is characteristic for          the resting fast and slow twitch fibers and fibers in          early transition rows   and  Only fibers in row           show type II type I and p cytoplasmic staining and          a lack of type II staining is apparent from row  on          During transition the fast twitch fibers may increase in          size and gradually change into the slow twitch fibers          exhibiting regular size Fibers in advanced transition          rows  and  and those undergoing degeneration rows           and  are associated with cytoplasmic p expression          Although rows  and  are similar the latter is          associated with the regression of many accompanying          myotubes see Fig  DF and Fig                           How unique is the unusual p expression for the          skeletal muscle          p is a cyclindependent kinase cdk inhibitor and          is normally expected to be localized to the cell nucleus          In normal cells p is sequestered and its activity          gradually decreases as cells reach S phase p          preferentially binds cyclin Dcdk but lower levels of          cdk in TGF treated cells allow p to be available          for binding to the cyclin Ecdk and cyclin Acdk p          is structurally related to the p having a similar          sequence in the Nterminal region Inhibition of cell          cycle by p and p is complemented by retinoblastoma          protein pRb and other cell cycle inhibitors tumor          suppressor proteins       In reality besides          their role in the regulation of the cell cycle the cdk          inhibitors in association with Dtype cyclins cyclin E          and cdk play a direct role in the stimulation of          epithelial cell differentiation     p is also          transiently expressed in developing myotomes and enhances          myogenesis              The localization of p to plasma membrane and the          cytoplasm in normal and abnormal striated muscle           in vivo raises a question how          unique these unusual expressions are for the skeletal          muscle cells The observations summarized in Table           indicate that cytoplasmic expression of p is related to          two dynamic processes i advanced transition of fast          to slow twitch fibers rows  and  Table  and ii          gradual degeneration of muscle cells rows  and  On          the other hand regardless of the status quiescent fast          and slow twitch fibers myotubes in transition or          degenerating the muscle cells exhibit plasma membrane          p staining          Excellent models for the studies of cell          differentiation           in vivo are stratified squamous          epithelia     particularly those that are easily to          collect such as the samples of epithelium of ectocervix          from hysterectomy specimens In addition the epithelium          of ectocervix is hormonally dependent and shows certain          changes along with the fluctuations of levels of ovarian          steroids during the menstrual cycle Another even more          hormonally dependent tissue is endometrium Fig shows          p expression in the ectocervix and corresponding          endometrium from the same uteri          In ectocervix during the early follicular phase when          increasing levels of estrogens stimulate proliferation of          stem cells and subsequent shift of cells between the          layers  toward surface some mature epithelial cells          upper intermediate layers showed cytoplasmic p          staining white arrowhead Fig A p expression was          also apparent in the surface degenerating cells black          arrowhead but not between these two layers dotted          arrowhead This resembles the transition of type II into          type I fibers and degeneration of myotubes In the mid          follicular phase p staining was restricted to the          nuclei white arrow panel B but during the luteal          phase when the influence of estrogens is accompanied by          progesterone the nuclear p diminished black arrow          panel C and mature and aged epithelial cells showed          surface p expression similar to that in all types of          muscle fibers          In endometrium the early follicular phase was          associated with strong stromal p expression s panel          D accompanied by variable nuclear expression in          epithelium of narrow glands arrows In the mid          follicular phase stromal and nuclear p staining          increased further panel E but luteal phase endometrium          showed diminution of both panel F Altogether these          observations indicate that in addition to the striated          muscle cells the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane p          expression can be observed under certain circumstances          in other cell types Yet the cytoplasmic p expression          in abnormal skeletal muscles also appears to be          temporary ie during the transition type II to type          I and terminal regression of myotubes          Moreover a combined action of estrogens and          progesterone characteristic for the luteal phase          appears to cause a diminution of nuclear p expression          in the epithelium of ectocervix and endometrium Fig           Cand F Curiously the remnants of p staining were          confined to the nuclear envelope arrows Fig  Cand          F see also Fig A suggesting a degradation of p          in the nuclear core andor a defect of p          synthesistransport These tissues however do posses          nuclear receptors for both steroids               We did not detect similar fluctuation of nuclear p          expression in muscle fibers yet myotubes do not exhibit          estrogen receptor expression      However          estrogen progesterone and androgen receptors are          expressed in the principal cells fibroblasts of levator          ani fascia     which represents another important          component of the pelvic floor involved in its suspensory          function and might be a target of the complex effect of          hormonal fluctuations during the cycle and influenced by          the hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal          women          Some recent studies indicate that longterm continuous          estrogen replacement is not beneficial yet may worsen or          induce the manifestation of PFD      possibly          through the suppression of sex steroid receptor          expression in the pelvic floor Since progesterone and          androgen receptors are also expressed in the levator ani          muscle and longterm estrogen replacement therapy          appears to suppress their expression     both the          levator ani fascia and muscle might be affected by          continuous estrogen replacement                          Correlation of cytoplasmic p with other cell          cycle proteins          Cytoplasmic p expression in the skeletal muscle and          epithelium of ectocervix raises the question if it is          associated with some other cell cycle proteins which          otherwise show characteristic nuclear localization We          investigated ovarian CL another interesting structure          for the studies of cell differentiation and degeneration           in vivo       and found          that cytoplasmic p expression is constantly present in          the CL of pregnancy          Fig  panel A shows that the mature CL of the          menstrual cycle has p expression limited to the luteal          vessels luteal cells show only traces of nuclear p          arrow and no cytoplasmic staining However in the CL          of pregnancy nuclei of luteal cells show abundant p          expression arrow panel B accompanied by moderate          cytoplasmic staining Nuclear p is also evident in          stromal cells s arrowhead When compared to p the          cyclin D is expressed in some nuclei of luteal cells          only arrow panel C and absent from the stromal cells          in the CL of pregnancy However the cytoplasmic          expression of cyclin D is similar to that of p          Staining for cyclin E panel D shows expression in          occasional nuclei The insert shows a lack of Ki          dividing cells Expression of p panel E is similar          to that of cyclin E The pRb panel F shows nuclear          expression similar to that of p including stromal          cells but no cytoplasmic staining of luteal cells          These observations indicate that cytoplasmic          expression of p correlates with that of cyclin D One          may speculate that the cdk is involved since p has a          preferential affinity to the cyclin Dcdk complex If          the cytoplasmic p expression in abnormal muscle cells          is accompanied by staining for cyclin D remains          however to be established                            Conclusions        This is a first report on the p protein expression in        normal and abnormal human striated muscle cells         in vivo Normal muscle fibers show        strong nuclear and plasma membrane expression Cytoplasmic        p staining accompanies perimenopausal transition of type        II to type I fibers In the absence of other muscle        abnormalities the diminution of type II fibers alone is        not necessarily accompanied by PFD Pelvic floor disorders        in perimenopausal patients are associated with the        hypertrophy of muscle cells and moderate cytoplasmic p        expression while PFD during advanced postmenopause are        associated with shrinking and fragmentation of muscle cells        and cytoplasmic p overexpression The cytoplasmic and        plasma membrane p expression is not unique to the muscle        cells since it can also be detected to occur at least        temporarily in other cell types                    List of
