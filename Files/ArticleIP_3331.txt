                                 Where the Sidewalk Ends            Before Iindentured myself to Microsoft and its stock options I worked for apublication called the Washington City Paper  The City Paper iswhat journalists pretentiously call an alternative weekly and what everyoneelse calls a rag Its a free paper full of listings and reviews that canbe picked up from bookstores and restaurants on Thursday evenings and fromgutters and trash piles on Friday morning When I started working at CityPaper  I assumed that the only reason anyone ever took a copy was itslistings which were comprehensive and quirky But after a few weeks I realizedthat I had it wrong The listings are secondary Washingtonians read CityPaper because City Paper cares so intensely aboutWashingtonianstheir local art their local politics their localcontroversies Like any decent local paper it views the city as the place ofmans highest achievement of clashing ideas power struggles great ambitionsCity Paper s staffers are obsessed with their city Whenever there was amovie with DC street scenes our critic invariably devoted the bulk of hisreview to nitpicking about the films bogus geography City Paper sreaders are both fiercely loyal and fierce Every week the letters column fillswith complaints from people who have been mortally offended Almost every cityin America has a publication like this a paper that is parochial in the bestpossible way            I thought about this recently as I was surfing throughonline city guides the Webs latest Next Big Thing Internet tycoons have anew model for urban journalism and its an ambitious one Online city guidesare meant to be category killers a challenge to daily newspapers alternativepapers city magazines the Yellow Pages and even ticket brokers Onlinelistings and reviews are going be more comprehensive searchablepersonalizable and uptodate than those in any print publication Theirdesigners want you to plan your entire weekend from your computerread movieand food reviews find the closest theater and show times book reservationsbuy tickets and even print a map to the restaurant During the past two yearsalone CitySearch awellcapitalized firm based in Pasadena Calif has opened sites for  NorthAmerican cities and more are on the way Its chief rival Microsoft haslaunched its city guide Sidewalk in Seattle New York Boston and the Twin Cities andhas plans to expand Yahoo and AOLs Digital City cover most major metroareas Daily and alternative newspapers are striking deals with the Internetservices New York Sidewalk for example buys listings from the VillageVoice  while CitySearch has made partnerships with the WashingtonPost and Los Angeles Times  The print outlets are also competingwith their own cyberpartners So the industry is crowded In New York aloneSidewalk CitySearch Total New York New York Now Yahoo the Village VoiceTimeOut registration required Paper and HXare battling for online supremacy            Imentioned Sidewalk Pause for full disclosure I have embarrassingly largeconflicts of interest in this story Microsoft publishes both Sidewalk andSlate and pays my salary Sidewalk and Slate are headquartered in the samepart of the Microsoft campus in Redmond I also have a good friend who worksfor Sidewalk in New York Oh and I interviewed for the editors job atWashington Sidewalk            Give credit where its due The utility of theonline sites is high The best of the guidesSidewalk and CitySearch in NewYorkare very useful Their listings are extensive enough to sate even themost jaded Manhattanite Restaurants are catalogued by the thousands andreviewed competently by the hundreds Essentially all movies playsconcerts exhibits readings performances and sports contests in the New Yorkarea are listed All events get the basics time cost location most areaccompanied by a brief description and a hefty chunk are capsulereviewedMaps and directions are plentiful The search engines are a breeze You want tosee Air Force One  A few mouse clicks locate the closest theater showtimes and a review The most obscure events are found easily Two minutes ofsurfing turned up a gastronomical walking tour of Chinatown a place to rentboats for a lunchhour sail and a recitation of Beowulf  accompanied bymedieval harp Sidewalk and CitySearch are customizable You tell them yourpreferencesGerman opera Thai restaurants action movies Pablo Picassoandtheyll send email about events youd like            Sidewalkand CitySearch arent flawless though They shortchange the outer boroughs Iqueried both for kosher restaurants in Queensa county with  Jews andmany Jewish restaurantsand turned up only a single eatery a kosherChinese place Both sites are mildly buggy Sidewalks maps tend to crash orload without street names The greatest annoyance Neither site enables you tobuy tickets or make reservations online But these technical glitches will besolved CitySearch is about to start selling Ticketmaster tickets on its sitesSidewalk on the other hand is engaged in a nasty legal battle withTicketmaster and probably wont be able to strike a similar deal Thepersonalization software will improve And as computers get faster and smallerthe online guides will be as convenient as magazines and newspapers            And yet something is missing from this new cityjournalismnamely the city The online sites are massmarket operations andthey are infected with an inoffensive corporate blandness They ignorepolitics The editorial content is limited to capsule reviews and shortcheerleading columns about yuppiedom The city sites are untouched by the gritand idiosyncrasy that define urban living Sidewalks movie reviews are pablumprovided by Cinemania for Gods sake Couldnt Microsoft afford a localreviewer The Sidewalks of New York Boston the Twin Cities and Seattle evenlook exactly the same stamped out by a cookie cutter at Microsoftheadquarters New York CitySearch and New York Sidewalk are based in Manhattanbut they could have been prepared in Pasadena or Redmond for all that they feellike the Big Apple            The online guides in searchof the largest richest entertainmenthungriest audience have an image of thecity that is deeply depressing Alternative and daily newspapers conceive ofthe city as a place of controversy and passion The online guides see itstrictly as a place of consumption What is a city The receptacle for yourdisposable income The only urban problem to which the online guides have theanswer is Where should we eat dinner
