            hi   hi um okay what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like   well i mostly listen to popular music i uh listen to it all the time in in my car so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i dont like commercials but uh i find myself listening to popular music and   yeah   uh quite honestly i i have some little children and ive unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of uh nursery rhyme music here lately but thats not by my choice how about you     oh really well um i dont have that i dont have that uh experience to share uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of you know i do i switch the stations stations a lot because i dont have a cassette player in my car um       lucky you umhum   uh however i do i do i do like a a lot of different forms of music so i switch quite often um i i think i like uh i im really particular about the type of music that i listen to but the uh theres theres such a wide selection i think i like a lot   umhum   or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music you know i i it i i like music that is that that i feel if its performed correctly or if its done right or if the version is done right i like it but if it if its not then i wont  i i really dont   yeah how do you feel about rap music it seems to be so popular these days   rap yeah well i i dont really have anything against rap music i do the one thing i do object to about rap music is is it   umhum   when it becomes militant or if its uh violence oriented i im i i really i have i have strong objections to that um   umhum right   actually i listened to one time i remember its this is back when rap even uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i   when it was really just starting yeah   yeah right when it was just starting i heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap and uh it was about the the piece of music the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old and it was incredible i mean the parallels you know between it and rap   uhhuh uhhuh right   and um you you listen a lot if you listen if you listen hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially well the black gospel you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean it you   yeah you really it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music a lot of times youll hear songs that you know theyre not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm   yeah   and uh sounds the sounds so much different and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music and   yeah   uh she thinks its pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that shes listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces   yeah yeah they they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it yeah so i think its kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they dont really they dont really   thats right   give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit thats really due to them   no yeah i guess there was even a a bit of a ruckus caused by the MC Hammer whos really you know seems to be the hot one of of today he used um   yeah   Wild Thing do you remember that that song he used i cant remember who the artist was on that   yeah umhum yeah it Jimi Hendrix was the original Jimi Hendrix was the original he wrote   who was it well maybe maybe it wasnt that one then because its a living it was a living person that im that im thinking of that um that said you know hey   okay   thats those are my words  and uh i guess that theyre they because he hadnt originally gotten um permission from him to use it and he he since then has has amended that and   umhum     paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on but   yeah i dont know it mayve it mayve been somebody else because i think i think that even Jimi Hendrix did a i think that was a cover i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of like a John Lee Hooker song or something i mean it was like it was really old   maybe so i i cant think   i mean i i it it a lot therere a lot so many different songs i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean ive heard some songs that that i just thought were horrendous cover versions and im like you know i i dont wanna listen to this  because you know you think of the original its like you know oh that was really great that was a you know   yeah   really good piece of work and then you when you hear the cover its like you know God you know what what are they doing to this  oh i think i think a good one was um there was a Peter Frampton song   well right they destroyed it oh yeah   yeah and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolutely it was pitiful   i i remember seeing the video of it on MTV and i thought it was hideous it was oh i didnt like that either   yeah theres  yeah but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton i mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon i mean there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything   i remember i saw him in a concert when i was   yeah yeah i i think i think that probably yeah i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer   i was in high school umhum he was very good i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in um Philadelphia it was in JFK Stadium it was i dont remember   yeah oh man   hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like   yeah ive i i graduated back in seventy nine so but but i really i i loved i mean i was   umhum   i was really into the album oriented music even then so i was really familiar with a lot of with a lot of the AOR type music um the the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and   umhum oh yeah   the uh the Beatles and you know i mean a lot of people they go you know theyre better than the Beatles and im like you know you you dont know what youre talking about   hm no  oh   oh i mean you know comparison the comparison made between New Kids on the Block with The Beatles i mean it was just   you can only laugh   yeah you just sort of you know well i guess i can just humor them you  know at this point but   right   well they i guess we our our age is showing when we  when we think that   yeah but well well you know i mean i ive i liked a lot of the new music i think um um when i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out um back in the   umhum yeah   in the mid and early eighties and then um i dont know music is kind of in a weird it it its in a very weird position right now i think that i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music which is you know using all these natural forms of music and yeah yeah Paul Simon well you know really thats not world music but what what Paul Simons doing i think is is is is great because hes   like Paul Simon  yeah   uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know using drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um   yeah what do you mean by world music   well world music is um a lot of the a lot of where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener uh for example lets say youre taking like an original Brazilian form of music   umhum   a with a certain style and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for lets say another audience lets say a North American and then when they hear it it it its a really its another form of music and you know its sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music   uhhuh huh right   because i mean there are some i mean i like there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i wouldnt i wouldnt say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know it and its the same way with world you know world music takes   no   the forms that have really been um i guess i you know the best example or you know the cream of the crop i guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that extremely enjoyable and then taking   so then it becomes a kind of music of of its own so to speak or hm   yeah yeah it becomes a kind of music of its own i mean when you listen to it its um uh i think that they dont use electronic electronic some of it its its they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably   uhhuh   so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now and from West Africa thats considered world music because its not particularly using certain types of folk styles   right   but theyre theyre trying to make it somewhat more modern i i a a good example another good example was i heard Miles Davis and Miles Davis worked with Ravi Shankar if you can believe it  i mean you know hes this jazz performer and then hes playing with Ravi Shankar whos a very good   uhhuh uhhuh   hes a very good arranger uh  arrangement to but uh were going to get off   i dont know but no yeah okay but yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and its just incredible   they are they trying to stop   putting in a little interference  okay weve talked our five minutes though oh ive been listening to that a lot lately   yeah i i listened and i heard you know you hear this sitar and then you hear this the muted trumpet and i mean you never think would think that they that they can actually play together but   go together yeah
