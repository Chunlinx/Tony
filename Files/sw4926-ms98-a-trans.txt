        i kind of think the probably the biggest political topic that i can think of at this point       is probably the Ross Perot uh candidacy uh i think that that has some interesting uh effects to it at this point with the uh   umhum   level of um uh outrage outrage that the public seems to have the voting public seems to have with the existing candidates out there and i think that uh that is certainly something that we havent seen to this level before   right well theyve been independent candidates before but uh never as as as popular as he seems to be and i mean it seems to be um doesnt really matter who who it is its just that fact that hes not in either party that uh seems to be why hes so popular i guess   whats your view on big political issues   hm um well if we i i i mean sticking with this topic um i would just say that you know its its interesting that it doesnt really seem to matter what um what his views are you know i mean he seems to have some views which are pretty conservative and which are pretty liberal   umhum   um but it it seems like people are more interested in just the fact that hes an alternative you know than to um to what what you know it i i guess he hasnt really outlined a platform yet you know and people keep asking him you know what what do you feel uh is the best a plan to deal with the budget or blah blah blah   yeah   and um he really doesnt have any answers i guess but that doesnt stop his popularity from swelling you know people are just sick and tired of um everyone else i guess it seems to be i dont know its kind of like um people always people always blame you know they always say how can  uhoh  dogs outside um       people always  say how how can these politicians be in power and stuff but i guess they forget that theyre the ones who put them there in the first place you know theyre always theyre always trying to find third third alternatives like um you know uh limiting limiting number of years in office for instance but you know all they have to do is vote him out of office you know its almost like they want to be forced to vote the way that they could in any case you know what i mean   yeah   it seems strange   its its going to be interesting to see if he uh actually you know we hear the complaints about uh voter apathy and and the whole the whole shebang about throw the bums out      right   it and it it usually you know its a big deal until election day comes around and then it you know it fizzles out and we end up with the same people   exactly   and uh you have to wonder whether is this going to be something that uh is really going to result in      hm   um a mass turnout of the current people that we have in there or whether this is just going to be another of the same old well throw the bums out but not my bum you know   right right as long as he brings pork back  my state then um what what do you think his chances are what do you think uh how much of the vote do you think hes going to get and do you think he will take it more from the Republicans or the Democrats   well the media media keeps saying that hes supposed to drain it away from the Democrats but i know that theres a lot of Democrats that dont like Bill Clinton   umhum umhum uhhuh   im one of them im not happy with Bill Clinton at all uh but i you know im concerned more concerned about Democrats saying theyre unhappy with Bill Clinton and then they go and vote for Ross Perot and then we basically split any protest vote against against Bush more or less in half you know i mean youre dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me thats not a going to be a wonderful uh feeling   exactly right exactly   but uh i think itll be interesting to see um whether it turns out he gets more than twenty percent of the vote if that um i   umhum personally i have a i have a problem with with electing someone whos that rich  um i mean theyre all that rich anyway but but someone whos advertised as that rich i dont know i it i kind of um have problems seeing what he and i would have in common you know   yeah but i you know itll be interesting i i dont i agree that i dont think that
