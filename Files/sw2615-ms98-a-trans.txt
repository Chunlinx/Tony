            i dont know what the the last thing ive done as far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff i havent gotten really involved in anything uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile   yeah i had a similar thing that ive worked on cars ever since i was uh a kid  and that was some time ago but ive gotten to the point where uh the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that uh oh most of the cars i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you dont go through the ignition stuff anymore because thats all solid state or   yeah i know what you mean yeah theyre fuel injected and so theres   or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down theres no way in the world youre going to work on that   yeah no theres no way somebody once said uh i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i cant work on it you know theyve gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh   oh yeah yeah basically thats it   the guys average guys cant really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh   yeah ive got uh an eighty four Chevy van thats uh a one ton van with a camper conversion on it   yeah   its got the the the good old three fifty standard engine in it regular gas engine and that engine i understand i can i can actually work on that engine   absolutely yeah i used to have uh Chevy van it was a short van that had the the three fifty in it   yeah uhhum   and basically it it was a motor and you didnt have all the other junk around it and you could get to it to work on it   right yeah i had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it   yeah the hardest part about uh water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it   well thats true  youre right you know by the time youve finally got down to it i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went   well thats kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i dont think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together   a few years ago i had an Oldsmobile diesel and uh the uh it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it and uh i bought it when we were living in Lubbock when i came back here i brought the car back here and uh i dont know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldnt sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff and uh the injector pump went bad so i   oh yeah   found an outfit down here to rebuild it and uh i reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time   yeah i dont think id know where to start with a diesel   uh well if you know diesels dont require mechanics they require plumbers   well thats true   and uh   i think the only closest thing ive come to to a diesel is ive worked for a tractor repair shop uh when i was in high school and uh we used to overhaul farm tractors basically   yeah   and they were nearly all all diesel but as far as cars ive never never been involved with them   well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm tractors you know what are about the size of your thumb and the yeah you can get to them and the ones in in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with   well yeah yeah and you can you can get to them well i   ive had a lot of good service out of that car but uh uh i finally gave it to my son and he drove it literally into the ground you know  he was out at Tech and he he finished it off   yeah im i guess youre right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i dont know exactly why One of the reasons is i im beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at i sure i dont know if its still uh limited like it was i dont notice it probably because i dont huh   what the availability you mean the diesel availability   yeah i dont i dont notice but maybe because im not looking for it yeah   yeah well id bought uh a GMC diesel pickup and uh loved that thing you know i really liked it but it turns out a pickup wasnt what i really   yeah   needed and it was the van that i needed then to buying the you know traded it in on the Chevy van but uh sure enjoyed it   but you you got the the three fifty in the van   yeah yeah the three fifty regular gas engine   yeah thats what i like because theyve got plenty of power and uh   uhhuh   if you treat them right theyre not the gas guzzlers i think that theyve got the reputation to be im convinced that uh Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes   yeah well uhhuh   im convinced that the small V eight like the the Mustangs original two eighty nine or some of the Chevy two eighty threes were good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers but they had enough power to pull all this weight And the four cylinders just dont have it   yeah i think that little the little Chevy V eight when it started out in sixty in fifty five i think was two sixty five something like that little   yeah   you know not a hold lot more than the than the six cylinder that i think was like about for about two thirty five or something but uh they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred small block four hundred that was uh the same block you know just just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more yeah   i think those guys those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but   yeah well that was uh that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up   oh yeah   the two little cars ive got now bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple years ago and and it was normally carbureted and its fairly easy to work with because theres not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff   yeah yeah thats kind of like the the first well my first car was a fifty six Mustang and uh over the years uh all i had a uh Dodge pickup several years ago and uh i cant remember the size of the engine it was a three O seven or something like that   yeah   but uh i remember working on those cars youd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things Now you open the hood and its scary like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes yeah   uhhuh uhhuh yeah the friend of ours over here hes got uh sixty five or sixty six Mustang with the six cylinder and uh i was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road its amazing   yeah well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to   you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess   my dads got a new um i guess its an eighty nine or ninety uh Chrysler something or other its one those transverse mounted V sixes front wheel drive   oh yeah   and uh he was showing it to me and were looking under the hood and everythings nice and clean and you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front And i said well where are the other three       and he had never really thou ght about it And he says well hopefully i wont have to change them before i trade it off Yeah its going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall   yeah yeah   so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics cant do much with them uhhuh   yeah well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the three fifty with all the you know like well actually i guess here within a couple of years ago anyway was the last ive paid any attention to it the three O five was that that V eight that they put in the the three quarter and and half ton van and it had all the air pump and uh   right   uh i dont know all that all that stuff and all the antismog stuff and uh boy that was uh really a mess back under there under the in that van   yeah the antismog pumps and all that stuff loads the motor down   uhhuh uhhuh   so its trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things but thats one good thing ive got a uh eight ninety uh Chevy Blazer now and its got one uh belt on it a serpentine belt   oh its that one thats about uh what an inch and a half wide got a bunch of groves in it   yeah i havent had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having ive got an an Olds Tornado that i thinks got six belts on the sucker And i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh   yeah yeah   i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where   yeah its kind of like the inside dual on a truck you know when one of them breaks its not the outside one its its the its usually that power steering belt or something thats way back in there  everythings got to come off   oh man you bet everything elses got to come off first well its a pleasure meeting you   yeah and well uh how many times have you done this now is this   uh ive got uh five stickers here from TI so i guess ive done probably uh id say seven or eight of them   yeah i hadnt uh hadnt not gotten any calls here in the last uh this is the first one in a week or so and   yeah i havent gotten any calls in two weeks so i dont know if if its tapering off or what i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting uh answers so it sounds its taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so   if its winding down or what finding a taker   people or either not or maybe theyre burned out or theyre through with it anyway let you go thanks for talking   yeah well okay all righty byebye
