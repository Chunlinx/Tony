                                 Diagnosis Totally Sane            There was a time back inthe s when psychiatry appeared to loom over vulnerable minds with a kind ofmenacing grandeur White coats seemed scarcely less ominous than white hoodsand fervid antipsychiatrists like Szasz and Foucault inflamed lovers offreedom against the depredations of nosology Nowadays though news of afreshly minted mental disorderor better yet a new edition of the AmericanPsychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders containing many such noveltiestends to be an occasion formerriment The DSM  now in its fourth edition is the reference bookwhich details all the mental disorders currently acknowledged by the APA Assuch it provides comic material for a certain contemporary genre of psychiatrycriticism that finds it laughable rather than sinister that psychiatryappears to be expanding its territory from real craziness to everydaylifecoining diseases like premenstrual dysphoric disorder PMS andcaffeineinduced sleep disorder Countless articles in this vein have beenpublished in the past few yearsthe recent controversial New York Timespiece on the absurdity of the diagnosis road rage for instance Youre NotBad Youre Sick Its in the Book or LJ Davis sweeping stumblingcaricature in last Februarys Harpers The Encyclopedia of InsanityAPsychiatric Handbook Lists a Madness for Everyone            HerbKutchins and Stuart Kirk professors of social work and social welfarerespectively have in their second joint effort Making Us Crazy theirfirst was called The                Selling of DSM  combined the paranoid andthe snooty modes of critique to produce a book about the DSM thats morereproving than suspicious and more earnest than parodic Its criticisms aretypical of any number of articles attacking the DSM  and can be summedup in four of the most common contrapsychiatric fallacies bandied about todayTo wit                            If you ever do something thats listed inthe DSM as a symptom it means psychiatrists think yourecuckoo                                       This is the most commoncriticism of the DSM  Once upon a time the argument goes crazy peoplewere crazy people They were the ones barking like dogs and thinkingthey were Napoleon The rest of us meanwhile suffered only from ordinaryproblems of living There is a growing tendency in our society to medicalizeproblems that are not medical to find psychopathology where there is onlypathos complain Kutchins and Kirk The psychiatric bible has been making uscrazywhen we are just human            Theproblem with this reasoning is that the concept crazy is entirely foreign tothe DSM  Insanity is a legal and literary notion now not a psychiatricone Mental disorders in the DSM tend to differ from ordinary problemsless in quality than in quantity and context Checking to see if your oven isoff is not a sign of mental disorder feeling compelled to check it  timesevery time you leave your apartment probably is Which is not to say thatsomeone who checks their oven  times is crazy  whatever thatmeansbut rather that if he should apply to a psychiatrist for help he wouldfind that the psychiatrist would produce a name for his behavior would assurehim that other people engage in it also and might offer him drugs to help himstop                            The DSM changes its mind about whatits going to call mental disorders every few years so obviously we canttrust it as a guide to what mental disorders really are                                       It is certainly the ambitionof the biologically oriented majority of psychiatrists to produce a manual ofmental disorders which as the saying goes carves nature at its jointsonewhich lists diseases that are each traceable to a unique identifiablemalfunction in the brain The DSM as it now stands however has nopretensions to being such a manual The DSM is neutral as regardsetiology which is to say that its disorders are grouped according toobservable symptoms rather than presumed cause If you look up a disorder inthe DSM  you will find that its defined by a list of problems such asimpaired motor activity or feeling numb and empty a certain number of whichqualify a person as having the disease            Tomaintain then as do Kutchins and Kirk that having an operational procedurefor determining whether a phenomenon belongs in a class such as the checklistof symptoms in DSM  does not substantiate what that construct or classis is to completely misunderstand how the DSM works Arguing thatAntisocial Personality Disorder is not really what the DSM says it isis like arguing that Madame Bovary didnt really do all those things Flaubertsaid she did Antisocial Personality Disorder is its DSMdescription Kutchins and Kirk like to refer to the DSM as psychiatrysbible implying that it inspires reverence and is in need of suspiciousinterpretation but the DSM is better described as psychiatrysdictionary It is periodically revised in response to arguments about usage andusefulness but new disorders do not represent claims to fresh biologicalknowledge Which is to say that yes a particular mental disorder is whateverthe DSM says it is                            Unbeknownst to the credulous public theDSM is not truly a scientific document but the product of crude politickingand cynical compromises                                       In  after a series ofheated and embarrassingly public quarrels on the topic the APA decided toresolve the question of whether or not homosexuality should be called a mentaldisorder by means of a ballot mailed out to its members The majority of thoseresponding felt that homosexuality was not a mental disorder and theAPA accordingly removed it from the DSM s next published edition Thisincident was unusual and yet not so very different from the APAs standardmodus operandi Each edition of the DSM is the product of argumentsnegotiations and compromises Kutchins and Kirk cite a particularly amusingexample of such disputes Robert Spitzer the man in charge of DSMIII was sitting down with a committee that included his wife in the process ofcomposing a criteriaset for Masochistic Personality Disordera disease thatwas suggested for but never made it into the DSMIIIR a revisededition In response to one of the proposed symptoms Spitzers wifeprotested I do that sometimes and Spitzer responded OK take it out            ToKutchins and Kirk this kind of ad hoc listmaking is not science but politicsBut its not clear that any science is so pure that its exempt fromcommittee decisions about whats to be considered valid research Kutchins andKirk claim that the DSM isnt a true account of mental illness becauseits informed by particular social values But of course the DSMis informed by social values Medicine is informed by social values Todeclare something a disease rather than simply a part of life is to declareit unacceptable and in need of treatment by doctors When is a person toounhappy When does eccentricity become psychosis or political suspicionparanoia How much pain is pathological Under what circumstances should apersons death be described as natural and attributed to old age rather thandescribed as premature and the result of a disease Social questionsall                            The DSM insults the victims of traumasand societal injustice by calling their problems mental disorders thusimplying that the victims are wacko and have brought their problems onthemselves                                       Its always entertaining togo back and read about the racist inanities of psychiatrists past Take SamuelCartwright for instance who in  coined two ingenious new diagnoses to beapplied to slaves drapetomania  or running away recommended treatmentwhipping and dysaesthesia aethiopis  whose symptoms were sloth and atendency to break things recommended treatment whipping Yes there can beno doubt that psychiatry has beenand continues to beused for very dubiouspurposes and that diagnosis is always inflected by the politics of itscreators            To assume though as doKutchins Kirk and many other leftoriented critics that psychiatry is aninherently sinister enterprise and that diagnosislabeling peopleis meanis to ignore many of the ways psychiatry is used Take Posttraumatic StressDisorder for instance This diagnosis which describes the delayedaftereffects of extremely unpleasant experiences made it into theDSMIII as a result of lobbying by Vietnam veterans who wanted theircontinued suffering symbolically and financially recognized PTSD has sincebeen applied to all sorts of people from the victims of domestic violence tothe consumers of excessive numbers of Twinkies It has become one of theDSM s most popular disorders in part because it is so very useful toits diagnosees It makes them eligible for insurancereimbursed therapy forinstance and it can bolster an insanity defense            Paradoxically though while its often used as part of insanity pleas PTSDimplies not that its victims are crazy but rather that they arent Before PTSD became a recognized disorder after all a Vietnam veteransuffering from hallucinatory flashbacks and wild mood swings looked to thebenighted layperson at least nuts But now his behavior seems ordinary evento be expected Kutchins and Kirk appear to believe that attaching diagnoses tovictims must necessarily be in the service of evil conservatism butpathologizing misfortune is a technique more often employed by the left thanthe rightby those that is to say who want to mitigate responsibility bydrawing attention to its causes rather than those who want to assignblame            As long as psychiatry is in the business of forcedinstitutionalization and it still is though less so than in the s itseems clear that the diagnoses that license dragging people off the street canhardly be subject to enough oldfashioned suspicious scrutiny But with regardto the vast majority of psychiatric encounters which involve adults showing upin offices and asking for help railing against the men in white coats ismostly beside the point Labels can be reassuring Drugs can be our friendsSubtler tools are necessary
