                                 Hard Core Goes Soft            A few years ago whendebates over the fate of Western Civ requirements raged at Stanford andelsewhere traditionalists often pointed to the University of Chicago as theschool where the old ideals of liberal education remained the most intact Nowthat bastion of tradition is itself under attack not by deconstructionists andpostmodernists but by economists and accountants            The turmoil is over aproposal to transform the old Common Core curriculum some version of whichhas been in place since the s into the socalled Chicago Plan Theuniversity administration wants to reduce the number of required courses in thehumanities sciences and social sciences from  to  and to remove alongstanding foreign language requirement Students faculty and alumni whoobject to this change are also up in arms about a plan to expand the size ofthe undergraduate student body by about  percent to They furtherobject to efforts to change the schools image from superintellectual to smartbut fun One way this makeover is to be accomplished is by changing theschools handle from the University of Chicago to just Chicago to identifythe school with the hit Broadway musical perhaps            I should probably start by declaring my own hypocriticalfeelings in the matter I grew up in Chicago the city and thought seriouslyabout attending The University as it was known in my family before decidingthat it was a bit too cloistered and socially claustrophobic for my tasteInstead I went to a bigname Ivy League university I suspect that I wouldhave got a superior education at Chicago but Im still glad I didnt go thereboth because college is partly about leaving home and because I think it wouldhave been too hard and not enjoyable enough Having rejected Chicago in partfor the reasons that its officials are worried about I cant easily argue thattheyre being absurd            On the other hand myinstinctive sympathies are entirely with the alumni who are withholdingcontributions until their alma mater quits threatening to loosen up What wasbest about the undergraduate education I subsequently got at Yale was what wasdone in imitation of Chicagoa freshman year Great Books program structuredaround discussion in small seminars I think its important that the beacon ofthat kind of liberal education continue to exist even though I didntandstill probably wouldntchoose that education for myself My old boss at theNew Republic  Marty Peretz used to say he wanted to found anorganization called Jews for HardLine Christianity Mine would be NonalumniAgainst Changing the University of Chicago            As reports about the campus culture wars go the Chicagostory is refreshingly manbitesdog Instead of being driven by a bunch oftenured radicals the dumbing down of Chicagos curriculum is being pushed bythe universitys Board of Trustees and its president Hugo Sonnenschein aneconomist who casts the need to change as a simple issue of competitionChicago wants to attract the best students and those students are offered morechoice about what to study by other colleges and universities Opponents ofhis plans think Sonnenschein who came from Princeton misunderstands theculture of the school he runs One sign was his hiring as one of his vicepresidents a marketing specialist from Ford who said cringemaking things aboutmaking the university more fun until he was driven out a few weeks ago Theleading opponents of reducing the amount of Aristotle physics and Englishcomposition in the curriculum are liberal professors students and alumni whoreject the consumermarket model of education            The best argument forchange is that its the only cure for a looming financial problem Chicagos billion endowment is puny compared to the big Ivy League universities and ithas run a small deficit in some years The main reason its financial situationis weaker than that of other schools though hardly desperate is that Chicagohas a much higher proportion of unprofitable graduate students Undergraduatesare the cash cows of higher education both because they pay tuition andbecause they later contribute money when they become alumni The unstated logicof the changes is roughly as follows To produce more revenue you need moreundergraduates To get more highquality undergraduatesmeaning those withhigh SAT scoresyou need easier course requirements and a more appealingatmosphere            Chicagos revenues also suffer from the way undergraduatesare taught at Chicagoin small participatory seminars led by full facultymembers Its retail rather than wholesale education and requires more facultythan a lecturebased system In recent years the university has been holdinglarger seminars and using more graduate teaching assistants Those protestingthe Chicago Plan are really objecting as much to what has already happened inthis regard as to whats promised            Chicago hopes to attractmore smart kids by becoming an easier school that offers its students lessindividual attention This isnt necessarily as nutty at is sounds ConsiderBrown whose undergraduates have a higher average SAT score than those atChicago and which gets three times as many applications precisely because ithas a reputation for being a blast and lacks any real requirements The problemwith this logic in this situation is that Chicagos whole history traditionand reputation are on the other side of this divide Intellectual intensity isits greatand perhaps soleselling point Rebranding the University ofChicago as a fun school deserves a place in the annals of marketing lunacyalongside Weyerhaeuser the tree growing company and the New Coke Its liketrying to sell spinach as a delicious dessert Chicago will never be funexcept insofar as intellectual stimulation is a species of pleasure            That does not however condemn it to an inexorabledecline Its not clear that Chicagos financial problem is all that seriousBut if it does need to woo more undergraduates it would probably have betterluck emulating Columbia University Columbia the university that has thetoughest core requirements after Chicagos is as trendy as Brownit admitsonly  percent of its applicants versus  percent for Chicago Of courseColumbia has the advantage of being in New York City instead of in an isolatedenclave on the South Side of Chicago But it also markets the strength of itscurriculum It boasts about its set menu instead of apologizing for not being acafeteria            Chicago ought to do the same Whats valuable aboutChicago isnt just that its a highcaliber difficult school Its that in atime of confusion about the ends and means of higher education it has theclearest and best notion of what constitutes one This is isnt simply readingthe Great Books chosen by Chicagos legendary President Robert Maynard Hutchinsand his sidekick Mortimer Adler Its a commitment to general educationasequence of courses intended to develop critical thinking in a wide variety ofdisciplinesin opposition to early specialization And its the pedagogicmethod that Chicago largely invented small seminars based on original textsand the examination of original works            As for Chicago not being as selective as its IvyLeague rivals are the administration should quit worrying about it Part ofwhats appealing about Chicago is that its more open and democratic than othercomparable elite institutions Unconventionally gifted kids who didnt get topgrades in high school or who dont have perfect SAT scores stand a betterchance than they do elsewhere of getting inand of being presented with thehighest level of intellectual challenge People at Chicago like to say thatits harder to get into Harvard but harder to get out of Chicago This makes itone of the few possible end runs around the meritocraticcredentialing complexwhereby standardized test scores determine future opportunities Chicago hasresisted institutional peer pressure for  years It would be a shame to seeit finally give in and become more like everywhere else
