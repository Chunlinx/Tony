                do you have any favorite restaurants in the area   oh yes i love uh Mexican and uh Oriental foods   oh okay sounds great   both so uh i could say Enchiladas down on Greenville Avenue in Dallas Texas   ive been there   is uh a real good Mexican and we like uh stir fry Hunan style over in Addison   uhhuh have you ever tried the Blue Goose on Greenville Avenue   oh yeah yeah i enjoy   they serve a lot of food   and good food in the Blue Goose yeah that is a good place where do you like to eat   i usually go to El Chico once a week for lunch Thursdays Fridays whatever   uhhuh favorite spot   and uh China Market in uh Keystone   oh yeah yeah thats good what what other kind of food interesting   so oh i like just about everything uh sandwich shops uh Schlotzkys   uhhuh   uh restaurants that have a variety of food like uh Chilis or Bennigans TGI Fridays   uhhuh Schlotzkys is probably my favorite deli deli sandwich i guess because of the bread the uh roll   uhhuh yeah i go to Galligaskins too quite a bit   uhhuh   but uh yeah Schlotzkys is unique as they say different is better   sounds good thats true that is true   do you typically go out uh for lunch or for dinner   well both uh probably eat out for dinner say once or twice a week   uhhuh   and i eat out for lunch probably three times a week   yeah i usually hit the favorite lunch spots uh every week uh being El Chico and China Market   so uhhuh   sometimes Schlotzkys uh places like that during during lunch   yeah   uh i dont get out too much on the weekends but uh ill occasionally go to an Italian restaurant or a Chinese restaurant   uhhuh there is a new Italian restaurant that is really good uh on Greenville its uh La Fontana or something like that its right after you cross uh six thirty five on Greenville   okay ive never been there   it is actually the family has not been here even a year in the states   uhhuh   its real authentic Italian food and their deserts are fabulous so if you like Italian that thats a really good place to go   yeah i live up in Plano so i usually go to some place like uh A Taste of Italy   uhhuh i havent tried that is is it good   uh yeah i think its good its uh   because i live in Plano too   okay ive been to uh Primavera also   uhhuh   i like that its a little smaller and they dont have as large uh uh smoking a nonsmoking section to put it that way   yeah   uh so it it and it it gets gets quite crowded at at uh times especially on weekends   yeah that means a lot to me too nonsmoking   right     yeah um lets see what was uh what about steaks   steak oh yeah they opened up the Hoffbrau here about uh what two years ago in Plano   where you use for a good steak uhhuh right   and thats very good i take uh some some of my relatives there aunts and uncles a couple months ago to the Hoffbrau and theyre dairy farmers so theyre real picky about their steak but they were impressed   uhhuh oh well thats good because i i know Steak and Ale is a favorite prime rib that they have is is usually what i get and   uhhuh   i was real pleased now i havent had prime rib at the Hoffbrau but   they dont i dont think they serve prime rib its mostly just a steak shop uh Steak and Ales a little more upscale than Hoffbrau   really yeah yeah   but the Hoffbraus kind of neat in that theyve got uh that market there too   oh yeah   and those uh shops with all the crafts so while youre waiting for uh for a seat you get to kind uh to browse around and see what what theyve got in the farmers market   oh uhhuh yeah and from what i understand i know on the weekends passing there they have quite a wait   theyve got a wait even on weeknights uh usually between a half hour and forty five minutes   well you really um   so uh and it starts uh anywhere from from five oclock on   well what about fast food what do you grab you know say whats your favorite hamburger Wendys   as far as burgers uh yeah i like Wendys uh i do not care for Burger King   oh   i cannot eat their Whoppers   yeah   uh McDonalds i avoid i used to work there as a teenager   yeah   so uh once youve worked in a place like that uh oh i dont know you dont im kind of reluctant to go back   yeah i can understand that   i know how the food is prepared   yeah well i dont know Wendys i think Wendys tries to be more of a homemade burger so its to me its probably a little bit better you know an   uhhuh   maybe its an adult hamburger     yeah uh Arbys is good too except i dont care for the roast beef the chicken is good   place uhhuh uhhuh well i like just about any kind of food i can usually i can eat anything any at anytime so usually whatever my friends want to go eat it suits me just fine an   uhhuh theyre opening up a new restaurant in about a month uh in Keystone called Razzoos its going to be a Cajun restaurant   oh is that where the Flamingo was okay i noticed they were redoing that   right same building Flang Flamingo used to be the Cactus before that   oh gosh   but the Flamingo never quite made it i went there one time an was not impressed   uhhuh ive never been there now this new one is Razzoos   Razzoos   oh Cajun   uhhuh   well is that a chain or   i dont think so um it it looks brand new in fact we stopped by one time at lunch to uh talk to the guy who is redoing it and uh he was real excited and gung ho   huh uhhuh   theyve got their chef and their recipes all lined up and theyre ready to start business   well good deal   but theyre renovating the place right now it will take about another month i guess before they open up   ill have to try that what about that Italian there have you tried that uhhuh   Eduardos yeah i i went there a couple of times i was there for the grand opening   uhhuh   a friend of mine and myself were the second and third customers he had at that the restaurant     oh my gosh   but uh its a little heavy for lunch   yeah   you get yeah too much pasta   a lot of food uhhuh   i i dont really care for that type of food for lunch   yeah yeah   so usually a sandwich uh maybe uh well El Chico once a week or once every other week something like that   uhhuh soup yeah yeah Super Salads is a favorite place to hit too yeah   Super Salads is good   one of those things you got to go early you know to find a seat yeah   yeah they get crowded real quick the crowds a little dressier too more of a yuppie crowd   yeah   lets see uh fish as far as fish i think my favorite place is uh Dingers over over on Forest Lane   Dingers ive never tried that okay   oh its very good very good matter of fact its right by the TI plant that little shopping center   okay   its pretty good and   yeah i stop by uh oh whats the name of this place Long John Silvers every now and then   yeah uhhuh   for uh fish greasy fish   great yeah yeah yeah   but every now and then you get into the mood for something like that   uhhuh also in the shopping center you know where BGs uh Zaks is that little craft shopping center   yeah i sure do   theres a a home if you want just like a plate you know home cooked meal thats good its called BGs and every day they have like a plate lunch special and its fairly cheap its like two ninety five or three fifty   uhhuh   and its real good so   i dont think ive ever heard of that before   thats oh its just kind of a mom and pop restaurant thats uh vegetables like a couple vegetables and a meat an and roll and   uhhuh   quick usually really quick too so   what do you think about Korean food   i have never tried any   there is a place called the Korean Rib on uh i think its on Alma   uhhuh   or is it on Custer its up here in Plano anyway   uhhuh   and uh its very good i uh really thought it was well its its a lot like Chinese food   i was going to say how does it compare are the spices different   um i it well they have different dishes uh its not so much just a lot of rice with uh with something dumped on top they uh   uhhuh   uh theyve theyve got more type uh specialty type uh meals i guess youd say   oh okay more like an entree   yeah uh   and and vegetable   uhhuh something like that yeah   okay okay   ive also tried uh a Korean restaurant in Dallas uh i cant remember what its called but they have a dish called uh B Bim Bap           B Bim Bap   its uh vegetables with uh fried egg on top   how wild   that and uh Mongolian beef   yeah   typical dishes there   okay well what about Indian have you tried Indian   i uh havent lets see i think ive been in an Indian restaurant one time and they uh i i really dont care for curry that much   yeah i have a friend that goes frequents she frequents and Indian place over there by The Blue Ribbon Cafe   okay i dont know where that is either   im sure oh its uh right there in Richardson on the west side of seventy five   uhhuh   and uh she ive never got the courage to go but thats once a week place for her   sounds different   so yeah well what about TIs cafeteria do you ever   uh yeah i eat there quite a quite a bit usually chicken fried steak   uh oh gosh   mashed potatoes and cream gravy   yeah thats the only thing thats safe   i used to eat the Mexican food but i lost the taste for that   yeah yeah the burrito you can only handle every so often   uhhuh sandwiches are okay but there are better places to go the prices are not that cheap at the cafeteria   yeah right   it uh so not
