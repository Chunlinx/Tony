in Alaska atany moment Six senior employees of the TransAlaska Pipeline System wroteto Sir John Browne the chief executive of BP Amoco and to three UScongressmen warning of an imminent threat to human life and the Alaskanenvironment from irresponsible oil operations there the paper said in its mainfrontpage story BP Amoco owns  percent of Alyeska the company thatoperates both the pipeline and the Valdez oil terminal near where the hugetanker Exxon Valdez crashed on a reef in  spewing millions ofgallons of heavy crude into Prince William Sound Alyeskas other biggestshareholders are Exxon and

JamaatiIslami Party announced that antigovernmentdemonstrations would be held in the Punjabi capital Lahore and in the port cityof Karachi Sharif is planning to argue that the withdrawal is justified by hiswinning unprecedented US backing for new IndoPakistani talks to end theyearold deadlock over Kashmir But Dawn saidthat persistent Indian rejection of anything it sees as thirdparty mediationmight undermine his assertion that President Bill Clintons pledge to take apersonal interest in the row might yield progress            Indeed the Hindu reiterated Monday in an editorial that India must resistthirdparty intervention The country must move to put bilateral relationsback on the railsand obviate the need for third parties it said There isno alternative but to seriously engage in bilateral discussions withIslamabad In another Indian editorialthe Times ofIndia said that while Pakistans fifth attempt at aggression againstIndia has ended like all previous ones in ignominious defeat its leadersare in the process of trying to proclaim victory once again To counter thisIndia should compile a detailed list of the Pakistani soldiers killed in thefighting and publish it in the media and on the Internet The people ofPakistan must realize the extent of Pakistani casualties in the conflict itsaid To sustain the myth that only unsupported mujahideen guerrillas wereinvolved

war dead will havelittle credibility among its own people                           Dawn s editorial Monday was devoted not to the Kashmir crisis but to thesafer subject of the ArabIsraeli peace process It expressed misgivings abouta statement in Cairo by new Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak that he wanted tomodify parts of the Wye agreement His predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu has doneincalculable damage to the peace process by throwing Israels commitment tointernational treaties into doubt the paper said Now it is Mr Baraks dutyto correct that image and prove to the world that agreements signed by aprevious Israeli government are not considered mere scraps of paper by asucceeding Israeli administration and that every Israeli government has theduty and international obligation to honor treaties signed by itspredecessors            TheIsraeli press by contrast was generally upbeat about peace prospectsfollowing Sundays meeting between Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafatwho referred to him afterward as his friend and partner Haaretz reportedthat discussions on the Wye agreement would begin in about  days time afterBarak has visited President Clinton in Washington Quoting diplomatic sourcesthe paper said Barak would present Clinton with a detailed negotiating planthat includes a Middle East tour by Madeleine Albright during the first week inAugust The plan would culminate at the end of the year in aBarakClintonArafat summit to declare an agreed framework for the permanentsettlement or failing that a declaration of principles outlining the stepstoward a settlement In an editorial Haaretz urged Barak to help tocreate a new atmosphere of trust by unilaterally dismantling the outpostsillegally established by Israelis on hilltops outside

United States to be more sensitive toward Russia or riskanother Cold War Russia means to be taken seriously and the US owes it thatrespect the Straits Times said American cockiness over its display of military technologyin the Gulf and Yugoslavia and smugness over its longest postwar prosperitystreak can blind it to a need to cultivate its relations with Russia beyondpromoting democratisation Russians cannot eat democracy The US should snapout of its hubris over Kosovoor the world could become very dark indeed ifRussian hurt turns to mischiefmaking The Guardian said that Russiasanger over
