                well here in Logan Utah        we got a nice little valley here and its like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley   hm well here in Seattle uh its giving the airs getting more and more polluted to where uh were in kind of a basin and uh   Seattles on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains and uh theres been a lot of lot of growth population growth around here and uh its uh its getting worse  i think most of it is from cars   yeah yeah definitely here in Utah up along the Wasatch front along the western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logans up in the valley a little bit further north we get a lot of pollution and its like seventy percent of its from cars   umhum   and uh it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the  inversion and when we get get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and were starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of LA a few years ago   uhoh   its not its almost sad because when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now its not in the mountain valleys   yeah yeah i live in the university district and uh uh its supposed to have about the worst air pollution       i think probably due to uh a lot of students going back and forth to school   huh   and im were right next to Interstate  also   theyre getting serious about things like uh mandatory well theyve already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if youre in certain counties emissions   oh yeah oh yeah they started doing that yet   yeah theyve actually started doing it down along the not in Logan up here because were doing a lot better we have a lot populations a lot lighter up here   we have that here and uh theyre theyre expanding it to uh more counties here um as the population spreads out and i think theyre also gonna be making it uh mandatory for more cars there there was uh something in the law about if youre car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didnt have to get it done anymore and i think theyre eliminating that uh   yeah yep theyre getting eliminating that out here   that loophole yeah   theyre also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun where theyre uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the basically how much of what is coming out the exhaust kind of like a radar gun and yes   oh really they make you do that remotely   yeah do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually   hm  now where does the source light go   and like across the street theyll set up like a trap or something that add in some sense and theyre also looking at uh   oh i see   other you know ways of monitoring this and because they found out something basically that uh and a poorly tuned car can emit something its an incredible amount it was like four hundred times as much   jeez   um of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons then a a properly tuned car and and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the the pollution then you know youd it be one way to cut the pollution in half   yeah thats neat   but its also been uh oh you know everybody is talking about using more mass transient here but it uh its tough you know like ive ive looked into riding the bus to work and i can drive to work in uh and get there in twenty to twenty five minutes over a very congested corridor which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges   uhhuh   but if i uh   if i take the bus it requires several transfers and it takes over an hour   um       yeah and theyre   so it its its not hard to see why i why i keep driving and you know i feel guilty because im driving a
