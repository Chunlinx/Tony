                     Well I was born in Queens NY         And on October twentyfifth          Um my parents are still living up north         My father lives in Queens NY off of Throgs Neck Bridge in Bayside and my mother lives in the Poconos which is known as Stroudsburg PA         Ive been down here now I would say oh about seven seven years now going on eight years         I came down here originally on a to play baseball in the Charlotte area at uh one of the colleges here in Charlotte         And uh I guess Im what you would refer to as a Damn Yankee because I havent left Im staying         Well at least for a while I was         Im presently going to be going on my way out to Denver CO for a job opportunity         But um the reason uh I guess I came down here again was to play baseball         My fathers a doctor up in Queens NY for  years         His side of the family is Austrian Jew and my mothers side is uh Roman Catholic Italian from uh from Brooklyn         And uh                     Thats an interesting combination                              That is definitely an interesting combination         Um so I dont know um                     When did your um fathers family come to the United States                     Well he he I believe he is I guess it would be youd refer to third generation         Um I think its his parents parents that came over         Um as far as my mothers side Im not too sure         It might be roughly around the same         Shes either shes either third or fourth generation         Um                     Do you know why his parents parents came                     I think just like everyone else for an opportunity                     Uhhuh                     Uh an opportunity to come over here I would I would say to practice medicine         It seems like everyone in my family is uh a doctor         And um the just the same on my mothers side         Just for that opportunity to come to America         So but um for myself I love NC         Its a beautiful area         Its a lot different from the North thats for sure         Cant say that Ive come to love grits          but um Ive met my future wife                     Is she a good Southern girl                     Shes a real good Southern girl         Shes a religious background religious background upbringing which I cannot say Ive been a part of         And um shes going to calm me down a lot I think and uh instill a lot of instill a lot of positive aspects of my life that have thus far been deferred                     How did you meet her                     Well I was fortunate enough to meet her in college in which we were best friends for about two and a half years         Until uh finally I dont know the light came on I guess for her I should say because for myself the light came on pretty much as soon as I met her         And uh shell be following me out to Denver CO myself                     Has she been up North with you                     She has         She um weve been up recently         I proposed to her in Central Park         We were in New York City seeing my my family         And my uncle was in town who both my father and my uncle were born and raised in the Bronx not too far from Yankee Stadium                     And uh so I guess youre a big Yankee fan                     Big time Yankee fan                  Its been a good couple of years for us Yankee fans here lately         And uh we were down on FiftyThird Street which is five blocks away from Central Park and um my fiance had just passed her boards and it was our anniversary so I decided to surprise her with walking down to Central Park off of FiftyEighth         And um it kind of just worked out perfect         I proposed to her         I was lucky enough for her to say Yes         And um so yeah shes been up north a couple of times and in the PA area as well the Poconos where you hear the honeymooners always go                     Uhhuh                     And um so                     Well it sounds like you have a pretty bright future ahead of you                     Not too bad         Its getting brighter and brighter it seems every day         And um its going to be a new adventure for us going out to Denver CO with me being a pharmaceutical sales representative and my fiance being in the medical profession as well being a nurse         And um                     Ive heard thats a beautiful area                     Yes it is         Its a lot to do         A lot of hiking and mountain biking         I dont ski         I think my fiance does a little bit         But um I dont know how much well do of that         But I would would suspect that we would end up back up maybe in the Charlotte area         If not NC for sure um                     That would probably make your inlaws very happy                     Very happy along with my family as well         Because Denver CO seems to be a little far         Um but its good we get to start our lives together out there and hopefully uh start maybe in a couple years maybe two to three years tops four start working on a family of our own                  And uh thats something that I very much look forward to         Um creating a family of my own                     Now if you have sons would you want them to play baseball too                     I would I definitely would         And I would probably encourage them to come down in the NC area to play baseball         Its been a great experience for me                     What was what did you like best about playing         Well it was always an escape for me         Kept me uh motivated         Kept me out of trouble                  which was the big thing and um I like being competitive I know my fiance is very competitive as well         So I know if we do have a little boy even a little girl I know there might be a good chance of being some good athletes in the family         So uh yeah         Ill definitely want them to pursue baseball but by all means its probably going to be whatever they want to do         I dont want to force them or anything so                     So where do you see yourself in about  years from now                     In about ten years definitely in the NC area         Um the beach is real appealing         If not maybe Charlotte probably down by Wilmington or some sort         Definitely like to have two children         And um have done a lot of things by that point                     Uhhuh                     Done a lot of traveling with my my wife and seen a lot of things         In  years from now start setting some sort of ah foundation for the family were raising in some sort of steady home         And no more making big trips out to CO or making a big move for the company or something of that nature         So I think uh we should be doing OK in about  years
