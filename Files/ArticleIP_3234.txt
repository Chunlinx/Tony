                                 Artless Heiress            Integrity can be a drag inan actor as Jennifer Jason Leighwho plays Catherine Sloper the heroine ofthe new adaptation of Henry James Washington Square has so often andso vividly demonstrated When Leigh plays unpleasant characters as inGeorgia  and Kansas City  she is as unpleasant asall getout When she played Dorothy Parker in Mrs Parker and the ViciousCircle  she faithfully reproduced the writers vocal cadences at theexpense of such trifles as variety and intelligibility Her work can beunleavened by imagination Compare her turn as a government agent inRush  to Jodie Fosters the same year in The Silence of theLambs  Foster revealed her characters vulnerability by indirectionby howhard the young woman labored to project strength Leigh chose to telegraph thevulnerability She was such a radiant mess that no superior in his right mindwould have sent her undercover            Iinterviewed Leigh for Vogue eight years ago before her acting went tohell I liked her as a person and admired her gutsinessher willingness towork without a net to throw herself headlong into a part even if it meantfalling a great distance onto her face But a weird masochistic streak hasemerged in her performances She now makes a fetish of falling on her face Shemight even want to be loved for falling on her face            As Catherine James plain artless heiress to whom lifehas simultaneously dealt a very good and a very bad hand Leigh is so busyprojecting her plainness and artlessness that she neglects for most of thefilm to pull the audience in Her Catherine has no center of gravity Shedoesnt walk when she can lurch weave or collide with objects her balanceshifting precariously Her responses meanwhile are queerly private as if shewere unsure of how to act out her own emotions All this is by design ofcourse and in an era when You like me You really like me is the mantra ofmost actors that design can seem brave and original What isnt by design isthe mass of neurotic actressy mannerisms which function like layer upon layerof wax buildup You cant see into Catherines soullike water on wax yourgaze beads            In partthis is the fault of the director Agnieszka Holland Like her star Hollandhas done everything right on paper In Washington Square  the early th century American trappings never smack of the sound stage andeach scene is judiciously weighted Holland has expunged much of the melodramathat marked the warhorse dramatization The Heiress made into a film with Olivia de Havilland directed by William Wyler and has evencorrected a problem that irked James years after publication when he rereadhis early novel and declined to revise it for reprinting that Morris TownsendCatherines fortunehunting suitor was too much of a onedimensional lout            But The Heiress  for all its unJamesianblood and thunder remains the truer adaptation Hollands tone is detached tothe point of having no discernible point of view She seems to have confusedJames irony with distancewhen in truth few authors in history haveachieved such pitiless and devastating intimacy For the first twothirds ofthe film Holland barely even lingers on her heroines features This remoteobjective Washington Square carries little wattage            Under thenovels sometimes placid surface is a tug of war which Wyler made palpable butwhich Holland must think will dramatize itself One of James trademarkinnocents Catherine is acted upon by three titanic forces her father DrSloper Albert Finney whose express desire to protect a daughter he considersugly and witless takes the form of ruthless repression her aunt MaggieSmith who wishes to weave out of her nieces life a breathlessly melodramaticromance and Morris Townsend Ben Chaplin the playboy who has squandered amodest inheritance and now seeks salvation in the form of this unlovedunlovely and affluent young woman Each of these characters comes with thetrappings of civilization and high society but it is the natural untutoredCatherine who proves the superiorif ultimately woebegoneforce            Hollands one innovation is in her handling of TownsendThe scene in which Dr Sloper pays a visit to the young suitors sisterto pryfrom her a confirmation of his suspicions about her brothers characternolonger climaxes with the womans expulsive warning to keep Catherine frommarrying him There are still plenty of reasons to think Townsend would be alessthanexemplary husband but fewer to think hed be a monstrous oneIndeed Chaplin never signals the mans duplicity and one wonders if hisTownsend has even fully admitted to himself that his motives are impure Hemight love Catherine for her money but at least he could love herwhereas her father clearly could not The performance is complex shadedirreducibleJamesian And Chaplin makes a marvelous partner for Smithsvivaciously silly Mrs Penniman all shinyeyed with vicarious pleasure andperfumed by her own cheap romanticism Youll have to excuse me MrTownsend she tells the lovers shes supposed to be chaperoning as she flitsto the door I have the most fortuitous headache            Finney plays Dr Sloper as asour and grave man in whom all feeling has been deadened since his wife diedgiving birth to Catherine He is clearly the villain of the piece a man whodeprives his daughter of happiness not simply because he believes Townsendintends to but because he feels that unhappiness is her due It might behowever that his contempt is too much on the surface so that his bitterlyconclusive outburst to his daughter on a mountaintop in Switzerland feels lessthan earthshaking There is so little intimacy between father and daughter thatCatherines lifechanging realization that Sloper despises her is old news            Leigh doeskeep something up her sleeve however Upon hearing the contents of herfathers sadistic will she lets out a musical laugh that is probably thepurest note she has sounded onscreen It was reported that Leighs own fatherVic Morrow inexplicably slighted her in his will and you cant hear thatsound in Washington Square without knowing in your bones where it camefrom Its the sound of genuine catharsis of poison being expelled into theair of bottomless anguish and joyous liberation            If Washington Square is underripeUTurn and Devils Advocate are rotting The former is noir campanother acid and amphetaminesoaked foray into Oliver Stones America full ofpixilated brutality and meaningless montage fractured zooms blackandwhitescudding clouds closeups of carrion and stuffed mountain lions Like NicolasCage in the more sedate Red Rock West  Sean Penn stumbles into a town ofdesert predators where women lull men leggily into the fires of hell not somuch out of guile as instinct Stone doesnt have a political ax to grind thistime out and he lets the actors make whoopie I dont know whom I adored moreBilly Bob Thornton as a greasy hick with a whiff of Tales From theCrypt style demonism Nick Nolte as a skeletal gravelvoiced albino whocould be John Huston after a decade of being eaten by worms or Jon Voight asa blind halfIndian whose portentous utterances are both full of crap andeerily abstruse I do know that I could see every plot turn dragging its limpmaggoty carcass across the desert from miles away The only surprise aboutUTurn is the good reviews it got from people who should know better Itis not a surprise either that Al Pacino chews the scenery in DevilsAdvocate  And the idea that if the devil showed up on Earth hed be runninga New York corporatelaw firm is also to say the least prechewed But thereare scenery chewers and there are Michelingourmet scenery chewers and Pacinohas a threestar feast Waxy lean and lupine in his black Zegna suits hesports what appear to be false front choppers and masticates his dumb satanicmonologues with Shavian relish                           It seems youve
