                                 Paula Jones vs Anita Hill            When William JeffersonClinton vs Paula Corbin Jones comes before the US Supreme Courtasexpectedin January all eyes will be on Justice Clarence Thomas Will aflicker of emotion crease his usually impassive glare as he ponders a shesaidhesaid fact pattern so hauntingly reminiscent of his own ordeal five yearsago            Millions of Clintonsupporters still disdain Clarence Thomas as a sexual harasser But a comparisonof the Paula Jones and Anita Hill episodes suggests that the evidence againstthe president is far stronger than the media has let onand far stronger thanthe evidence against Thomas            Jones evidence which Idetail in a word article in the current issue of the AmericanLawyer  includes clear proof scattered through the public record thatthengovernor Clintons state trooperbodyguard interrupted thethenyearold state employee on the job on May   and took her to meetClintonthe boss of Jones bossalone in an upstairs suite in a Little Rockhotel for the apparent purpose of sexual dalliance            The evidence also includesstrongly corroborative statements made to me by two of Jones friends completewith tellingly detailed seamy specifics remarkably consistent with Jonesallegations            PamelaBlackard and Debra Ballentine first told their stories in February  inexclusive interviews with reporter Michael Isikoff then of the WashingtonPost  But to Isikoffs chagrin the Post printed only sketchyfragments of their accounts  weeks later            Other evidence of course warrants skepticism about Jonesaccount including the claim by Jones trooper escort that she happilyvolunteered to be Clintons girlfriend just after leaving his hotel room Yeta careful review of the evidence makes clear that there are only threelogically possible scenarios that Jones lied in a most convincing manner andin stunning Technicolor detail to both Blackard and Ballentine on May  and to her sisters soon thereafter that all four later conspired withJones to concoct a monstrous lie or that Jones allegations are substantiallytrue And after conducting interviews and studying other evidence Im all butconvinced thateven if Jones embellished somewhatwhatever Clinton did wasworse than anything Thomas was even accused of doing            Meanwhilenot one of the feminist groups that clamored first for a Senate hearing forAnita Hill and then for Clarence Thomas head has lifted a finger on behalfof Paula Jones What the HillThomas and JonesClinton episodes have in commonis that each prompted a rush to judgment by people on both sides of theideological divide And most striking in my view is the hypocrisy orignorance and class bias of feminists and liberalswho proclaimed during theHillThomas uproar that women dont make these things up and that you justdont get it if you presumed Thomas innocent until proven guiltyonly tospurn Jones allegations of far more serious indeed criminal conduct asunworthy of belief and legally frivolous                           She Said TheProposition                        The May   encounter began in theconferenceroom area of Little Rocks Excelsior Hotel where a GovernorsQuality Management Conference was in progress at which Clinton made a speechJones claims and Blackard confirms that both noticed Clinton staring intentlyat Jones while fielding questions from television reporters A few minuteslater according to Jones trooper Danny Lee Fergusonwho had previouslyintroduced himself as a member of the governors security detailapproachedJones and said The governor said you make his knees knock            According to Jonescomplaint Ferguson later returned to the registration desk handed Jones apiece of paper with a suite number on it and said the governor would like tomeet with her there According to the complaint Ferguson stated during theconversation Its OK we do this all the time for the governor  Blackardtold me as she told Isikoff she generally recalls such a conversationFergusons carefully lawyered answer to Jones complaint in which she seeksdamages from him as well as Clinton confirms that he then escorted Jones tothe upstairs floor and pointed out Clintons suite            All thisamounts to clear and convincing proof of Jones allegationwhich has neverbeen specifically denied by the president personally or by his lawyer RobertBennettthat thengovernor Clinton sent a state trooper to interrupt a stateemployees performance of her job and bring her to his hotel room            And that seems pretty shabby no matter what exactlyhappened in that hotel roomshabbier than anything Clarence Thomas was evereven accused of doing by Anita Hill Hill said that Thomas as her boss hadpersistently pestered her in late  and  to date him and talked dirty toher about pornographic movies and his own sexual prowess Hill did not accuseThomas of a single overt request for sex or a single unwelcome touching AndHill was not too horrified to follow Thomas rising star from the Department ofEducation to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC nor to keep intouch with Thomas in subsequent yearsgetting him to write a letter ofrecommendation that helped her land a law teaching job phoning him repeatedlyinviting him to make an appearance at the law school and more                           I Know He GrabbedHer                        The most impressive evidence supporting PaulaJones allegations comes from six witnesses including Pamela Blackard andDebra Ballentine whom I interviewed separately by phone as well as Jones twosisters her husband and her mother All sixincluding a sister who hasimpugned Jones motiveshave said they believe her account of Clintonsconduct            As aneyewitness to some of the events Blackard provides especially strongcorroboration I could see her shaking as she came walking back to theregistration desk Blackard says After five or  minutes Blackard recallsJones related what had happened Blackard says she has difficulty rememberingthe details offhand but that I know he grabbed her She said he just kept onmoving close to her and putting his hand on her knee and every time shestopped him he did something else I asked Blackard if she recalled Jonesdescribing something dramatic He dropped his pants she responded and Idont remember his exact words but you knew what he wanted Blackard added and she said I dont want you ever to tell anybody  Why not I askedHes a governor Blackard responded Hes powerful And we both had statejobs            In her February  affidavit Debra Ballentine swore thatJones had come to her office around  pm that day and after describing thecircumstances told her she rebuffed three separate unwelcomed sexual advancesby the governor Ms Jones described in detail the nature of the sexualadvances which I will not now recount            In a fuller recounting to meon Oct  Ballentine confirmed Jones essential allegations She said he wasputting his hands on her legs and he was trying to put his hands up her dress She said Debbie he pulled his pants down to his knees and he asked me toperform oral sex right then  Ballentine adds He also told her he knewshe was a smart girl and her bosswhats his name Dave Harringtonis agood friend of mine and he told her I know youre a smart girl and youregoing to do the right thing             Ballentine recalls that Jonesalso told her that day about the mysterious socalled distinguishing markthat Jones complaint says she saw on Clinton and on which Jones lawyers saythey are relying to corroborate her account            Paula Jones two oldersisters say she also gave detailed accounts of Clintons conduct to them In anOct  telephone interview I asked one of them Lydia Cathey if Jonesdescribed what Clinton had done Down to the very last detail says CatheyDropped his drawers and tell sic her to kiss it             The other sister CharlotteBrown has drawn more publicity than the other five witnesses combined becauseshe has trashed Jones motives in going public Nonetheless in a February interview Isikoff noted Asked if she believed her sisters story CharlotteBrown said she did because she had never known Jones to lie            Takentogether these six contemporaneous witnesses provide far strongercorroboration than has ever been mustered on behalf of Anita Hill While fourwitnesses testified that Hill had told them in vague general terms of beingsexually harassed only one of them Hills friend Susan Hoerchner said Hillhad identified Thomas as the harasser The other three said Hill had complainedof harassment by an unnamed supervisor                           A Question ofCharacter                        Its reasonable and legally relevant tospeculate that Jones appearance demeanor and willingness to meet withClinton alone may have emboldened him to think that sexual overtures would bewelcome But its odd to hear such traits held against Jones by feminists whowould ordinarily go ballistic at any suggestion that a flashylooking woman wasasking for it            Its true that Paula Joneslegal as distinct from her factual claims have their weaknesses But herlegal theories are hardly frivolous A single extremely outrageous act ofsexual harassment without much more can arguably support a hostile workingenvironment claim under federal law            Given that Paula Jonesclaims against Bill Clinton are both more serious by far than Anita Hillsagainst Clarence Thomas and supported by much stronger corroborating evidencewhy have the media and a lot of other people acted as though the opposite weretrue            Part of the explanation isclass bias against what one Washington bureau chief called some sleazy womanwith big hair coming out of the trailer parks But thats not all of it Notthat is unless you believe that the press would have given similar coverage toa similar accuser making similar allegations supported by similar evidenceagainst Newt Gingrich or Jesse Helms or George Bush or Steve Forbes
