                    Background        It is not uncommon in many fields to encounter data        distributions that are skewed or contain outliers In those        cases the arithmetic mean may not be an appropriate        statistic to represent the center of location of the data        Alternative statistics with less bias are the median and        the mode The median is the value of the variable in an        ordered array which has an equal number of data points on        either side whereas the mode is the value of the peak of        the distribution Figure  The mode is biased the least        by outliers and contaminants      and is used commonly        in astronomy     and occasionally in other fields        including biology         However calculation of        the mode is more difficult than the mean or median and this        has limited its widespread application        For discrete data involving a relatively small number of        possible values and a large number of data points the mode        is easily calculated as the most frequent value Otherwise        the most common mode estimation method for discrete or        continuous data involves construction of a histogram The        value of the bin with the greatest number of data points is        the mode and this value can be finetuned by simple        interpolation with adjacent bins     The major        drawback of the histogram method is that different modes        can be obtained using different bin sizes although some        stability can be gained by using the mean of modes obtained        from different bin sizes For continuous data two other        simple methods have been proposed The Dalenius method           is calculated by selecting the interval with the maximum        number of data points and using the mean of that interval        as the mode The Grenander method    uses two        parameters one defines an interval by limiting the number        of data points in the interval and the other defines the        weight exponent applied as penalty to the range of an        interval However the former method is sensitive to the        size of the interval selected and the latter method is        sensitive to outliers            Several new mode estimation methods have been proposed        in recent years Two related ones are the HalfSample Mode        HSM and HalfRange Mode HRM     The HSM uses        shortest half samples in an iterative fashion to estimate        the mode Similarly the HRM uses densest half samples to        estimate the mode Two substantially different methods are        the Standard Parametric Mode SPM and the Robust        Parametric Mode RPM     These methods transform the        data distribution to an approximate normal and use the        probability density function of the approximated        distribution to estimate the mode The SPM uses the mean        and standard deviation whereas the RPM uses the median and        the median absolute deviation as the average and variance        parameters Each of these methods has been tested in        simulations with normally and asymmetrically distributed        data with and without contamination     The results        showed that different estimators perform better under        different conditions but that the RPM method is perhaps        more versatile than the others        Nonnormal distributions of divergence time estimates        are often obtained in molecular clock studies involving        many genes or with genomic data       Typically        those distributions are right skewed or have noticeable        outliers on the right older side The reason for such        nonnormal distributions is unclear but they are        consistent with contamination from paralogous comparisons        those involving gene duplications although other sources        of bias have been proposed     The rightskewed        distributions seen in some plots of evolutionary distances        are different because they have not been normalized by a        calibration time It is sometimes difficult to distinguish        a paralogous comparison from an orthologous comparison        speciation event when comparing different species        because of gene loss and incomplete taxon sampling For        these reasons the mode  as estimated using the histogram        method  has been used to avoid the bias of such outliers                   In this study we extend the analyses of Bickel           to assess the accuracy and precision of mode estimation        methods for continuous data using simulations We evaluate        additional types of distributions the effect of coarse        data sub peaks and additional levels and distributions        of contamination Finally we applied these different        estimators to five published data sets from a molecular        clock study Our immediate goal was to determine the        optimal method for use with molecular clock data        divergence times involving large numbers of genes        although the results are generally applicable                    Results                  General Patterns          The mode estimators were not biased by randomly          distributed contamination and the cauchydistributed          contamination produced similar results albeit at higher          levels of bias to the normally distributed          contamination For these reasons we confine our          discussion to results using the normally distributed          contamination Also simulations using contaminant data          located close to the true mode  thpercentile showed          that mode estimators performed poorly under those          conditions as noted elsewhere     especially with          the normal and coarse original distributions In those          cases all estimators mean and modes showed similar          bias being equally misled by the contamination On the          other hand most mode estimators performed better lower          bias than the mean or median in simulations using          contamination located at the  thand twice the           thpercentiles Because we wished to compare the          efficiencies of the various mode estimators we further          confine the discussion to results using contamination          centered at twice the  thpercentile Figs             Table           The normal and coarse distributions produced similar          results for the different mode estimators although HRM          showed the least bias as contamination level increased          Figure ei RPM and SPM showed an increase in bias in          a negative direction away from contamination as          contamination level increased However those two          estimators did not show such negative bias with the          lognormal distribution Figure e          All estimators of central location mean median          mode performed well had little or no bias when          contamination was absent at least with the normal and          coarse original distributions Bias increased as the          level of contamination increased with RPM and SPM          exhibiting negative bias at higher levels in the normal          and coarse original distributions as noted previously          In almost all cases at different levels of          contamination the mean exhibited the greatest bias          followed by the median and then various mode estimates          The HRM method showed almost no bias at any level of          contamination and original distribution type Figure           However the highest levels of contamination           produced a spike in the bias and variance of several mode          estimators especially HRM probably because the          contamination was a significant peak in the distribution          competing with the true mode The SPM method generally          produced the highest bias of the mode estimators in some          cases even performing more poorly than the median These          patterns also are reflected in rankings of the methods          Table                           Bootstrapping          The use of bootstrapping with mode estimation had          little or no affect on bias except that bias increased          slightly for the lognormal original distribution Figure          fg On the other hand bootstrapping lowered the          variance of all mode estimators with HRM showing the          greatest improvement and RPM lognormal the least          improvement Figure bcdfghjkl In          effect bootstrapping eliminated the disparity between          HRM and RPM in terms of variance with bootstrapped          versions of those estimators having similar low levels of          variance                          Molecular Clock Analyses          Analysis of the published molecular clock data for          fungi and plants Figure  Table  showed that the mean          was higher than the median in most cases indicating          asymmetric distributions and supporting the use of the          mode Although the true modes are not known in these          cases some patterns were evident Among the mode          estimates those using SPM often were the lowest and          appeared to visually underestimate the center of the          distribution Of the remaining mode estimators HRM and          RPM were  different from each other on average          across the five sample data sets Table  HRMBMO mode          of the bootstrapped modes and RPMBMO averaged           different and HRMBME mean of the bootstrapped modes          and RPMBME were only  different A greater          difference was observed between HRM and its bootstrapped          estimate HRMBME than between RPM and RPMBME All of          these results from analyses of real data were consistent          with the simulation results Figure           The results of all simulations and software for          estimating the mode and its standard error are available          as Supplementary Data          httpwwwevogenomicsorgpublicationsdatamodeindexhtm                            Discussion                  General performance of the mode          There were few cases in this study where mode          estimates performed worse than the mean in determining          the center of location of a data set suggesting a more          general application for the mode For example in          situations where centers of location are needed but          distributions are not predictably normal the mode might          be used as a routine statistic In those cases it would          produce a similar result to the mean for normal          distributions and would estimate the center of location          with less bias than the mean for nonnormal and          contaminated distributions However our simulations          showed that contamination located close to the true mode          will mislead any estimator mean or mode In the future          it would be useful to explore the performance of the          various mode estimators under a greater diversity of          coarse data distributions                          Negative Bias of some Mode Estimators          We found that RPM and SPM the two estimators that use          a data transformation method exhibited increasing          negative bias bias away from the position of          contamination as the contamination level increased          Because the contamination was applied to the right side          of the distribution the bias resulted in underestimates          of the true mode          This may be attributed to the fact that both          estimators are based on the transformation of sample data          to conform to a single normal distribution not to          additional secondary distributions often encountered with          outliers The HRM estimator would appear to be less          affected by such secondary distributions and therefore is          at an advantage Compared with the normal original          distribution and same location of contamination the          right tail of the lognormal distribution integrates with          the outliers to a greater extent and thus obscures more          of the secondary peaks This may explain the lack of a          negative bias by RPM and SPM in the lognormal          distribution Figure e                          Increased Performance of the Bootstrapped Mode          Estimators          Bootstrapping clearly improved the variance of the          mode estimators Of the two bootstrap methods tested the          bootstrap mean of the modes BME is preferred because it          performed substantially better than the bootstrap mode of          the modes BMO in terms of lowering variance The better          performance of BME may result from the lower variance          usually associated with the mean The bootstrapping          probably acts to smooth the coarseness and irregularity          that otherwise might cause inaccurate estimation of the          center of location This is important for a statistic          the mode that relies on the overall shape of a          distribution or peak in density          Without bootstrapping the RPM estimator has a lower          variance than the HRM Figure  in part leading to the          recommendation of RPM as a general purpose estimator              However bootstrapping not only lowers the variance          of both estimators but it reduces that disparity with          RPMBME showing only a small improvement in variance over          HRMBME The same pattern was seen in the analysis of          divergence times Figure  where RPM and HRM mode          estimates exhibited a large difference  without          bootstrapping and a much smaller difference  with          bootstrapping                          Standard Error and Confidence Interval of the          Mode          Methods for direct calculation of the standard error          of the mode have been suggested    but are rather          complex Another approach would be to trim the outliers          from the distribution and estimate the standard error of          the mean of the trimmed data set assuming that the          outliers can be identified and the underlying          distribution is normal However a simpler method and          one that we recommend is to estimate the bootstrap           confidence interval range andor bootstrap standard          error of the mode Although bootstrapping already is used          to calculate the mode M           HRMB or M           RPMB  that must be considered          separately The error estimation requires that each          resampled data set be used to calculate the mode in this          case each such data set is used as a starting point for          further resampling to calculate M           HRMB or M           RPMB  Although a bootstrap standard          error can be calculated it would not be appropriate for          skewed distributions where the error is distributed          asymmetrically around the mode In those cases or more          generally we recommend calculating the bootstrap           confidence interval range                            Conclusions        The HRM and RPM mode methods     both performed        reasonably well under a diversity of conditions However        bootstrapping is recommended for both methods because it        reduces the variance Suggested conventions for indicating        modes that are estimated using these methods are M         HRM and M         RPM for the nonbootstrapped versions        and M         HRMB and M         RPMB for the bootstrapped versions The        bootstrapping should be accomplished by taking the mean of        the bootstrapped mode estimates and by using a relatively        large number of replications such as  or more            In our implementation of the two methods the M         RPMB estimate takes  times longer to        compute In cases where time permits it might be        informative to use and compare both estimators M         HRMB and M         RPMB  and to construct a histogram for        visual inspection of the distribution The RPM method might        have a slight advantage in cases where the data form a        single asymmetric right or leftskewed distribution and        a disadvantage in some other cases Figs   However        because M         HRMB is simpler faster to estimate and        does not exhibit negative bias in cases of outlier        contamination we recommend it as a generalpurpose mode        estimator along with a bootstrap standard error or         confidence interval range                    Methods                  Mode Estimation Methods          The HSM method    iteratively divides the data set          into samples of half the size as the original set and          uses the halfsample with the minimum range where range          is defined as the difference between the maximum and the          minimum value of the sample This method terminates when          the halfsample is less than three data points An          average of these three or fewer values is the mode The          HRM method    is similar but uses the subsample with          the densest halfrange where range is defined as the          absolute difference between the maximum and the minimum          values in a sample Of these two methods only the HRM          was used in this study because HRM has been shown to have          lower bias with increasing contamination and asymmetry                       The parametric methods    are based on the idea of          transforming the data set to an approximate normal          distribution by raising it to a real power Different          values for the exponent are tested and a correlation          coefficient between the transformed data and an ideal          normal distribution is calculated The exponent with the          maximum correlation coefficient is used to transform the          data and approximate it to a normal distribution For a          normal distribution the mode is the value that maximizes          the probability density function Thus by equating the          first derivative of the probability density function to          zero to find the maxima the mode can be estimated          Thus                    where            transforming exponent           mean parameter            standard deviation parameter          In the SPM method     the sample mean and sample          standard deviation of the transformed data are used as          the mean and standard deviation parameters  and  for          mode estimation The correlation coefficient used to          estimate the best value of the exponent  in Equation           is expressed as                    with the operator  giving the sample standard          deviation          In the RPM method     the sample median and the          sample standardized median absolute deviation MAD of          the transformed data are used as the mean and standard          deviation parameters  and  for the mode estimation          The MAD is defined as the average difference of each data          point from the median The correlation coefficient used          to estimate the best value of the exponent  in  is          expressed as                    with the operator  giving the median absolute          deviation                          Evaluation of the Methods          We designed  simulated data sets to compare the          three mode estimation methods HRM SPM and RPM with          the mean and median Each data set was defined using          combinations of the following six parameters modeled in          part after the study of Bickel    but with slightly          larger variance standard deviation parameter   to          more closely

the          nonbootstrap mode methods  replications were used          Additionally  replicates were used for simulations          testing the use of bootstrapping with  bootstrap          iterations performed during each replication An overview          of the simulation design is shown in Figure           The coarse original distribution was intended to model          the class of real data where there is a central tendency          but there are multiple subpeaks within an otherwise          single peak This may arise from limited sampling minor          clumping of data or other factors For the purpose of          these simulations we have modeled the simplest case          involving two subpeaks of a single distribution it is          not intended to be a bimodal distribution To construct          this coarse distribution we used two normal          distributions with one distribution centered at the           thpercentile of the other distribution Thus the latter          distribution is partly to the left of the first one We          sampled  of the data points from the first two          quartiles of the distribution on the left  of the          data points from the last two quartiles of the          distribution on the right and  of the data points          from the remaining half portions of both the          distributions Figure a There are many other possible          types of coarse distributions with multiple subpeaks          but we considered only this simple case The cauchy          distribution was used as one of the contaminants to model          erratic contamination and a high number of outliers          Figure b          In previous simulations contamination was applied          only at the  thpercentile and with a narrow          standard deviation equal to  thof the interquartile          range of the main distribution divided by the          interquartile range of the standard normal distribution              This resulted in a sharp spike peak in the tail          of the distribution In real data sets involving          distributions of molecular time estimates outliers more          frequently appear removed from the main distribution and          spread broadly rather than focused at one point eg          Figure  Therefore we used contamination locations          that were further removed twice the  thpercentile and          more broadly distributed standard deviation   For          comparison we also simulated contamination at the           thpercentile and  thpercentile We predicted that the          mode estimators would perform poorly with contaminants          located close to the true mode          We evaluated the bias the difference between the          estimated value and the true mode and variance of the          estimators for each simulation A ranking system was used          to make comparisons of the different methods Ranking was          done individually each simulation and in groups to          determine a consensus order Grouped ranking for a          particular simulation run was calculated as the average          rank of each estimator for all levels of contamination          The grouping was done by collecting the nodes at the          third and fourth levels of the tree in Figure  In other          words the ranks for the different types and positions of          the contaminants were averaged for a unique combination          of the original distribution type and sample size This          was done because the original distribution type and          sample size are characteristics that are more easily          determined for real data sets and were therefore of          greater interest in this study Average and individual          ranks for particular levels of contamination shown in          Table are for two simulation sets normal and          lognormal each using normal contamination located at          twice the  thpercentile and with a sample size of           This combination of intermediate sample size and          contamination location most closely corresponded to real          data sets involving distributions of time estimates                       In addition to the nonbootstrapped mode estimate          NBM using original data for each method we calculated          a bootstrap estimate using the mean BME and the mode          BMO of bootstrapped modes This permitted us to compare          biases and variances associated with bootstrapped and          nonbootstrapped versions of each method for each data          set We predicted that bootstrapping    might improve          mode estimates because of the smoothing effect of the          resampling emphasizing by chance different subpeaks          and thus generating different modes centered around a          single overall peak in the distribution Therefore the          mean or mode of those multiple subpeaks might better          represent the central tendency of the overall data          set          Finally we applied these mode estimators to published          data sets of divergence time estimates of fungi and          plants     The objective was to observe how the          different estimators performed with real data and to          compare their performance with simulation results to          assist in formulating recommendations for mode          estimation                            Authors contributions        SBH conceived the study SBH and PS designed the        simulations PS carried out the
