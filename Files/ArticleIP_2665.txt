                                 Cybertests            The paperandpencilstandardized test that mainstay of meritocracy soon will join the manualtypewriter vinyl records and communism on the scrap heap of the th century Computerized exams are rapidly replacing it ThisOctober business school applicants become the latest to put down their No pencils and take the Graduate Management Admissions Test onscreen            Thetechnology behind the new tests is remarkable Using a simple form ofartificial intelligence the computer selects questions tailored to thetesttaker shortens the test and displays results instantly These changesmake some people nervous but they are nothing compared to the technologysuses in medical care Researchers are employing the same advances in artificialintelligence to create a computer program that interviews patients Andbelieve it or not it could make your care better            In  nurses became the first to switch from paper tocomputer for their national licensing exams Since then architectspharmacists stockbrokers and even electrologists the hairremoval peoplehave made the leap Aspiring graduate students can already opt to take theGraduate Record Examination on computer and the paper GRE will be eliminatedin  Physician exams will likely go micro next year The SAT required foradmission by most colleges will convert in  at least in urban areas            Testmakers are switching for several reasonsprinting costs are lower forcomputerized tests the technology is therebut especially because ofcomplaints about the length of the old tests The paper GRE and GMAT took fivehours nursing exams two days They had to be that long though because apaper test is dumb It cant select which questions to ask In order toidentify your exact level of say math ability it must ask dozens ofquestions that range from ridiculously easy to sortofeasy to impossibly hardTwenty math questions might suffice to rank you in the top or bottom half ofyour cohort but admissions committees want to know whether youre in the rd   th  or  th percentile            The breakthrough came when test designers orpsychometricians as they like to call themselves programmed computers toselect questions based on your previous answers just as in  When you get aquestion right the computer asks a harder one and an easier one when you getone wrong If youre at the  rd percentile youll get all the easyones and miss all the hard ones so the computer skips most of both groups andsticks to middlelevel questions That saves time the new nursing exam takesless than two hours on average and also makes tests more accurate since thecomputer can ask more questions around your level to ensure you really are inthe  rd percentile            Manypeople fear the new tests Enrollment for the final paper GMAT given this pastJune jumped  percent Others claim the tests are unfair For some typicalcomplaints click  The change in standardized testing is just a mouse stephowever compared with what intelligent questionasking programs will soon dofor medicine Using the same technology researchers are now developingprograms to interview patients and measure sometimes better than doctors canhow well treatments are working            For some diseases such as diabetes or high cholesterolblood tests and other tools help doctors evaluate and finetune treatmentHowever many other diseasesarthritis urinary trouble depressionhave nosuch tests so doctors had to rely on personal experience to evaluatetreatments Then a new school of outcomes researchers suggested an answerRegardless of your disease they argued effective treatment should improveyour quality of life So why not devise a standardized test to measure thequality of patients lives            A fewyears ago outcomesresearch guru John Ware designed such a test the SFThe test asks things like Does your health limit you in walking a blockSeveral blocks More than a mile If youre curious about your own SFscore click here Questions cover pain mood physical function and thelike Doctors can give patients the test before and after treatment for almostany disease Its no substitute for a doctors evaluation but it can show howyoure doing in relation to your own previous condition and to others similarlytreated Research shows for example that patients SF scores consistentlyimprove after hipreplacement surgery for severe arthritis and prostatesurgery for trouble urinating when theyre done right            Not all treatments are as dramatic as hipreplacement however Medicine often produces subtler results that may bedifficult for a fiveminute test like the SF to capture A change inarthritis medication may enable a patient to button his shirt or to playsingles tennis as opposed to doubles To pick up these changes a paper testwould have to ask more detailed questions and soon would become impracticallylong The GRE and GMAT designers showed however that computertailored testsmight help So if a patient answers that he has trouble getting out of bed acomputer could skip questions about vigorous activity and focus on questionsabout ordinary daily activities            Withfunding from Kaiser Permanente the HMO giant Ware is designing just such atest a kind of standardized computerpatient interview He expects that infive years  percent to  percent of all patients will take the test duringdoctor visits He even envisions giving it at home via Internet TV and ifpatients want having the computer alert their doctors if the test finds theircondition worsening            Wares group has developed the mentalhealth segment firstIt asks questions like Have you wanted to harm yourself How often do youfeel downhearted and blue Have you had a lot of energy These alone couldhave valuable uses In preliminary studies for example the questions can showif Prozac is working or not And the computer test may be better than doctorsat recognizing problems in mentally healthy patients For instance the testcan catch when drugs cause slight fatigue or make it harder to enjoy lifefully as some heart medications can Doctors often miss these effects Thetest may make them think twice about medicines that take the fun out ofpatients lives            In thefuture computers might even make up test questions and conduct personalizedinterviews of job applicants college applicants and even patients Will thatbe good Well any technology can be used for good or ill If doctors startusing computer interviews as an excuse to talk to patients less medical carewill deteriorate Patients could certainly get annoyed by having to take even afiveminute computer test every time they see a doctor But artificialintelligence has enormous potential to make care better The question is do wetrust Kaiser to use it that way                           Doescomputerization give ETS an unfair advantage If you missed our link earlierclick
