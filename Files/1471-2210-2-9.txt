                    Background        Prolonged or repeated agonist stimulation of G        proteincoupled receptors frequently causes a reduction in        the response to the agonist     Shortterm agonist        exposure results in desensitization that is characterized        by a rapid minutes and reversible uncoupling of the        receptor from the G protein followed by sequestration        andor internalization of receptors from the cell surface        Downregulation occurs after prolonged agonist treatment        hours to days resulting in a loss of receptor binding        sites       The processes involved in homologous        desensitization have been extensively investigated for the        beta adrenergic receptor which is the prototypical G        proteincoupled receptor Initial uncoupling of the beta        receptor from the G protein after agonist binding is        mediated by phosphorylation by G proteincoupled receptor        kinase GRK of specific residues in the carboxyl tail of        the receptor The phosphorylated beta receptor enhances        the binding of betaarrestin which not only uncouples the        receptor from the signal transduction process but also        serves as an adapter protein that mediates entry into the        internalization pathway     as well as serving as a        platform for additional signaling pathways     The        mechanisms of beta adrenergic receptor downregulation        appear to involve both an increase in the rate of        degradation of the receptor as well as a decrease in the        levels of beta receptor mRNA     Downregulation of the        beta receptor is in part due to trafficking of the        beta receptor to lysosomes via the clathrincoated pit        endosomal pathway             The alpha adrenergic receptors also undergo        agonistinduced desensitization and downregulation        Desensitization occurs both in cell culture systems             and in the intact animal      In general the        mechanisms of desensitization for the alpha adrenergic        receptors appear to be similar to those for the beta        receptor There are three subtypes of the alpha        adrenergic receptor alphaA alphaB and alphaC            The human alphaA subtype undergoes phosphorylation        and shortterm desensitization      whereas the        human alphaC subtype is not phosphorylated    and        does not desensitize     The human alphaC subtype        however does undergo arrestindependent internalization            Many studies      including those from our        laboratory       have demonstrated agonistinduced        downregulation of alpha receptors although much less is        known about the specific mechanisms for downregulation as        compared to the beta receptor In contrast to alphaA        and alphaB adrenergic receptors from several species the        human alphaC receptor does not appear to downregulate in        response to agonist treatment in transfected cell culture        systems     By contrast the opossum alphaC receptor        in the OK cell line does downregulate in response to        norepinephrine      The reason for this difference        is the focus of the current studies        The human alphaA adrenergic receptor has an acidic        serinerich motif EESSSSD in the third intracellular loop        that has been shown to be important in agonistinduced        desensitization but not in agonistinduced        sequestrationinternalization Sitedirected mutagenesis        studies indicate that all four of these serines are        phosphorylated by GRK and all four are needed for        desensitization     The influence of this motif on        downregulation was not investigated however The opossum        alphaC adrenergic receptor has a very similar acidic        serine motif EESSTSE in the third intracellular loop        Figure      whereas the human alphaC receptor        has a DESSAAAE sequence in the same region Figure             Thus we postulated that the lack of downregulation        in the human alphaC was related to having only two rather        than four serines in the motif and furthermore that the        ability of the opossum alphaC to undergo downregulation        was dependent on having all four serinethreonine residues        in the EESSTSE motif To test this hypothesis we mutated        the opossum alphaC serines and threonine residues to        alanines and valine respectively and tested whether the        expressed receptors would downregulate Downregulation        was not observed in the mutated receptors following        treatment with norepinephrine for  h                    Results                  Sequence of the opossum alphaC adrenergic          receptor          In the process of confirming the mutations we also          completely resequenced the wildtype clone and found          several differences from the originally published          sequence GenBank U     The corrected          sequence differs from the original in  bases which          results in  amino acid residue changes as detailed in          Figure  The sequence has been corrected in Genbank                          Characterization of mutated receptors          The results of  Hrauwolscine saturation experiments          using the wildtype and mutated receptors from two          independent transfections of both mutations are given in          Table  The K           d values for the two mutants           nM were similar to those of the wildtype           nM and similar to the previously reported K           d of  nM for the wildtype          alpha receptor for  Hrauwolscine in NaPO            buffer     Inhibition          experiments with  Hrauwolscine indicated that the          affinity of norepinephrine for the mutated receptors was          approximately twofold higher lower K           d value than for wildtype receptor          Figure                           Downregulation          After a  h treatment with  M norepinephrine the          wildtype receptor downregulated to     of control          p   n   By contrast no downregulation was          observed with either the SSVA     of control or          the AAVA     of control receptors Figure                             Discussion        All three alpha adrenergic receptor subtypes from        nearly all species that have been tested undergo        agonistinduced downregulation      Interestingly        we have shown that the potency of norepinephrine to produce        downregulation differs among alpha receptor subtypes             The concentration of norepinephrine required to        produce halfmaximal downregulation is approximately  M        for the alphaA receptor In contrast norepinephrine is        more potent at downregulating the alphaB and alphaC        subtypes with a concentration of only  nM required to        produce halfmaximal downregulation This difference in        potency appears to be a characteristic of the receptor        protein itself because the cellular environment in which a        particular subtype is expressed does not affect the potency        of norepinephrine to produce downregulation        The human alphaC receptor is somewhat unique among the        alpha receptors in that it does not appear to undergo        agonistinduced downregulation     The human alphaA        adrenergic receptor which does undergo downregulation        has an acidic serine motif EESSSSD in the third        intracellular loop Sequentially mutating each of the four        serines to alanine decreased the phosphorylation of the        receptor by approximately  for each serine and mutating        either the first two or the last two serines to alanines        prevented agonistinduced desensitization but not        agonistinduced sequestrationinternalization     The        influence of mutations in this motif on downregulation has        not been investigated The human alphaC receptor by        contrast has a DESSAAAE sequence in the same region        Figure      Thus it is possible that the lack of        desensitization and perhaps also downregulation of the        human alphaC receptor is due to the fact that there are        only two hydroxyl residues in the DESSAAAE motif rather        than the four hydroxyl residues in the alphaA EESSSSD        motif        The opossum alphaC adrenergic receptor has a EESSTSE        acidic serinethreonine motif in the third intracellular        loop Figures and  which could be a substrate for GRK        based on the EESSSSD motif of the alphaA subtype Thus        we postulated that the lack of downregulation in the human        alphaC subtype is related to having only two rather than        four serines in the motif and that mutating the threonine        and serine residues at the end of the opossum EESSTSE motif        to valine and alanine residues to give EESSVAE might        prevent downregulation of the opossum alphaC receptor        Consistent with this prediction treatment with  M        norepinephrine for  h failed to downregulate the        receptor containing the motif mutated to EESSVAE although        the wildtype receptor with the EESSTSE motif was        downregulated by         The inhibition data indicate that the affinity of        norepinephrine for the receptors containing the mutations        is slightly higher than for the wildtype The affinity of        norepinephrine for the mutated receptor lacking two of the        hydroxyl residues was approximately twice as high as the        wildtype The elimination of the remaining two hydroxyl        residues did not have any additional effect on the affinity        of norepinephrine These data eliminate the possibility        that the lack of downregulation in cells containing the        mutated receptors is a consequence of the mutants having a        lower affinity for norepinephrine than the wildtype        The elimination of the terminal two hydroxyl amino acid        residues in the EESSTSE motif is sufficient to prevent        downregulation of the opossum alphaC adrenergic        receptor Similarly mutation of only two serine residues        in the human alphaA receptor resulted in a loss of        desensitization     Because the EESSSSE motif in the        human alphaA receptor is a known GRK substrate and        because eliminating two potential phosphorylation sites        prevents downreguation phosphorylation of the opossum        alphaC receptor may be important in the mechanism of        downregulation of this receptor By contrast a deletion        of twelve residues of the human alphaA receptor         which includes the EESSSSE motif did not appear to prevent        agonistinduced downregulation     Thus a        phosphorylation pathway may not be involved in        agonistinduced downregulation of the alphaA adrenergic        receptor        In addition to the hydroxyl amino acid residues acidic        residues may also be an important sequence element for        alpha adrenergic receptor phosphorylation and regulation             The region from  to  in the opossum        alphaC receptor which encompasses the EESSTSE motif is        a high acidic region with  seven of fourteen of the        residues being acidic amino acids Figure  In an effort        to determine if four hydroxyl amino acid residues in an        acidic environment might be a common motif for        phosphorylation and receptor regulation we searched the G        ProteinCoupled Receptor Database for four consecutive        hydroxyl residues either serine or threonine in a linear        sequence that was at least  acidic with no basic        residues which occurred in either the third intracellular        loop or the carboxyl terminal tail As can be seen from the        results in Table  this does not appear to be a common        motif for G proteincoupled receptors not even for alpha        adrenergic receptors Indeed this motif is not found in        the alphaB subtype which does undergo agonistinduced        downregulation although as noted above a highly acidic        region appears to be important and could be related to the        additional negative charge provided by phosphorylation        Thus it is likely that there are multiple mechanisms that        are involved in downregulation of G proteincoupled        receptors                    Conclusions        A motif with four hydroxyl amino acid residues in an        acidic environment appears to be important for        downregulation of the alphaC adrenergic receptor The        human alphaC receptor which has a DESSAAAE motif with        only two hydroxyl residues does not undergo        downregulation Modification of the EESSTSE to EESSVAE was        sufficient to prevent downregulation of the opossum        alphaC adrenergic receptor Because these are potential        GRK phosphorylation sites our data further suggest that        GRK phosphorylation may be involved in downregulation of        the alphaC adrenergic receptor                    Materials and Methods                  Materials          Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England          Biolabs Boston MA Norepinephrine and other chemicals

previously described                              Downregulation assays          The cells were plated at a density of    cellsml          in mm culture dishes with  ml of growth media and          allowed to grow for four days to near confluence The          medium was replaced with fresh medium lacking G          Twentyfour hours later either  l of  mM          norepinephrine in  mM HCl or

rinsed          with  ml of cold phosphatebuffered saline PBS          containing  mM EGTA pH  Another  ml of PBS was          added to the plate and the cells were scraped off the          plate

stored at C until assayed We used           nM norepinephrine in the downregulation studies          because we have previously shown that this concentration          induces maximal downregulation

determined using a final          concentration of  M norepinephrine For          competition experiments duplicate tubes were prepared          containing  l of tissue  l of norepinephrine at          various concentrations and  l of  Hrauwolscine           Cimmol NENDupont Boston MA at a single          concentration of  nM which is approximately the K           d value Twelve appropriately spaced          concentrations of norepinephrine were used in each          competition experiment The extent of downregulation was          determined using a single concentration of           Hrauwolscine  nM about  times the K           d value We have previously shown          that norepinephrine pretreatment does not alter the          radioligand K           d of the opossum alphaC adrenergic          receptor      thus making it possible to estimate          the receptor density with a single concentration of          radioligand Total binding was determined in triplicate
