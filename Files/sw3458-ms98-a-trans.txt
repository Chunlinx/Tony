              okay you ready   yeah is that it okay um well we i guess we have to talk about magazines and um what what   thats it what what kind do you subscribe to or do you   well i subscribe to People well i did subscribe to People for a long time i do you know i enjoy People and now im um i uh subscribe to uh Ladies Ladies Home Journal   i uh take a computer magazine   uhhuh   and uh also uh Better Homes And Garden   okay are you interested in in computers   and my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside and the cardboard pages   yeah   uhhuh yeah well that that would be one of my peeves my pet peeves with magazines uh the womans magazines especially i mean it its really geared to your all they have is you have too many recipes first of all i just dont you know thats what i dont like about um Ladies Home Journal magazines too many recipes too many um can this marriage be saved nonsense i you know i like to read articles about things that matter well of course People magazine is not you know one of your uh   no   your more intellectual magazines but its nice light reading  you know if i want something intellectual i usually read a book   well thats true i uh i like it when they have short stories like Redbook used to always have a good short story in it   well thats true yeah they did   and i i havent bought a Redbook in a while so i guess i i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore   yeah well is Redbook still in existence i didnt know if they were if they were around anymore   well uh i think it is surely its an institution surely it would have to be   yeah well ill tell you the only reason i bought the uh i subscribe to the Journal is because of   but uh   which  i think it was either yeah it was Publishers Clearinghouse  they they told me you know if i didnt subscribe they were gonna take me off their their winning you know their list  so   right i know and it was serious  mine too i wasnt this was it my last chance   yeah my last right right my last chance to win ten million dollars so i figured hey look  for twelve dollars you know   well i i uh i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh to uh Entertainment   thats it oh yeah oh uhhuh   and i was real disappointed with it   yeah   i i dont know it just not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into  its just little  short articles more than anything  else   right uhhuh   and thats one thing i dont like about People uh its just you know doesnt seem to have enough story to it   well i dont know i just think uh you know its its light reading you know you dont have to excuse well you dont have to concentrate you know you know its entertaining you know and uh   if youve only got a short time to read no thats true     thats i just i enjoy it i you know i um well that Entertainment is is very wasnt that similar to or isnt it similar to to the TV Guide   uh no not really i mean uh not the one i take now its a its a magazine and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies   oh uhhuh   that are going to be released or its behind the scenes   oh i see   and uh im a real movie buff so thats why i thought i might be interested in it but it just hasnt been what i thought it would be   no     and uh my mother has subscribed too the reason i get uh the   right   Home Journal and and the uh computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me   oh   otherwise if if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf ill pick it up then   right right   rather than to have them delivered and think oh i really need to read this   well well ill tell you since ive been getting the Journal like maybe maybe ill read two maybe three if i read three articles in in you know one of the the Journals i figure you know i did really well   yeah it paid for itself   because theres just nothing in there that interests me i dont you know i dont im not into recipes you know recipes and  you know   well i i do like recipe and crafts   see now and im not into crafts so so you know that that eliminates like three quarters of the magazine  you know well     well thats true   i just got the new issue they have Bette Midler on the cover so that should be one article that ill read anyway   do you uh ever
