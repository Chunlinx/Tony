        up here in Rochester uh       were the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution i think Grand Rapids was number one uh we really dont have too much of a problem as far as uh industry since were pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here but we do have the same problem a lot of are other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain   right   coming coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana   well thats thats thats true actually down here we dont have a big problem with uh with air pollution mainly because we dont have anybody to the either side of us uh which helps out a lot as far as that goes i wouldnt even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in Boston and up in uh you know debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and you know in that area over uh air pollution and their attitudes basically well prevailing ins winds are to the east so why should we have to worry   yeah ive ive uh was in Los Angeles once and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes i mean you couldnt really see that much  every once in a while we have these air inversions the weather   oh yes nothing   inversions and then it gets hazy around here but theyre really we dont have a big problem with it i think that uh what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is its its the uh ongoing acid rain problem especially out in the uh uh Adirondack areas where you know the lakes are becoming uh changing the acidity of the lakes and were having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants uh or alkaline liking plants are just not lasting anymore because the soil levels the p H is changing   right   as this acid rain continues to fall and i know that theres been battles over the states up here uh you know Governor Mario going after you know governors of Ohio and  and Indiana to fix whats going on down there i remember when i was in Florida the only problem was that it seemed like it may it wasnt really pollution just the steamy weather   oh absolutely yeah just muggy so yes i think youre yeah i think youre right our most pollute substance down here is just water but uh   yeah it   hey i i i think you know the biggest causes though even then a lot of times are uh uh like when i was up in Boston just all the cars you know all over the place you just got a lot of you know a a lot of pollution from those and uh you know if you dont have a wind it sticks around   oh yeah i you know i was in Boston once and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the tee um just this it looked like billions of cars massing   absolutely   and if they sit there and then theres nowhere for the air to go i mean yeah thats whats in you know Los Angeles is i think thats biggest problem because when i was in Los Angeles for a time its all you know from Los Angeles to San Diego its like all city   right   and theres really theres nowhere for this to be absorbed really um tree planting sometimes can handle you know stopping some of the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything   thats thats very true       uh you know of course then when when youre not recycling youve got these incendiary plants and stuff that can be some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere but i you know youve youve got youve got the industry youve got that and you got the cars and i think the cars are where where its at right now as far as pollution goes air air pollution i mean   yeah i you know Florida doesnt seem to be at least maybe Miami but i i uh you know Fort Lauderdale i i dont know what the big industries are down there uh but you know up here we have Kodak and thats the worst polluter they put uh   right   uh you can smell ether in the air sometimes keeps the neighborhoods happy i guess   i i guess so   uh cause they clean the uh the lenses for cameras and they they make film here and theyre the worst offender but you know sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them but thats really getting under control now   right i you know i i dont know in the air down here what they do uh i i havent run across any major pollutants down there that i i ive really seen a lot of you know upsettedness about uh i i i know ive seen like uh my grandparents live in Corpus Christi Texas and i know theyve theres a lot of refineries down there and and thats thats some pretty potent stuff they can put up in the air   yeah   i but i dont know how uh yeah theres a difference in what you can smell and what you uh you know whats bad   be interesting to see when as Mexico develops industrially whether you know without
