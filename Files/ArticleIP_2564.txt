                                  Channels            Wanting to share theAmerican experience I have just acquired a TV satellite dish I am nowprepared to report on my venture into this brave new world that has so manychannels            You haveprobably seen ads telling of the marvels we can bring into our homes byacquiring a dish free or in the ad to which I responded for  All pricesin this world end in  cents so this price was actually  but forconvenience I am going to round everything off You and I were not bornyesterday and we know that no one is going to give us such a valuable andsophisticated product so cheaply We have read the fine print and know that weget the dish at such a low price only if we subscribe to the service providingthe content for one year at  a month Moreover since this is a new andmysterious gadget it is prudent to get a threeyear repair service contractcosting  and the thing needs to be delivered which is another  And sofar we havent counted the cost of installation That is basically  butin my special case for reasons that may not be so special the installationcost was  Not surprisingly everything is not going to work just right thefirst time and though you are well covered by warranties you are going tospend many hours on the telephone while our entertainment providers areserving other customers Valuing my time at the minimum wage I calculate myinvestment of hours in getting started at  So I now have a fixed costexcluding the cost of content of             In order to get started I had to sign up for a package ofcontent costing  a month That however was a minimum package and therewere many other more expensive options In fact to get fairly representativecoverage but with little sports coverage I soon found myself up to about a month Amortizing my fixed costs over  months the whole thing was comingto about  a month Is that a lot or a little About  million families nowthink the satellite dish is worthwhile and the number is growing A largernumber are paying nearly that much a month for cable with fewer channels thanare available on satellite There are great economies of scale For a householdof five people  a month is  per capita            What do weget for this That is hard to tell The system provides minimum guidance towhat can be seen One can scroll through a guide on the screen that tells whatis showing on each channel but the information given is minimal The names ofmovies are shown but not what they are about who is in them when they wereproduced or any indication of their quality such as one would get in anewspaper listing One click on the name of any currently running movie willbring it up on the screen but without any additional information except forits rating G PG etc Unless one is exceedingly well informed about moviesor quite indifferent one can surf around for quite a while and only reach amovie one wants to watch after it has already begun These problems can besomewhat eased by a subscription to the special satellite edition of TVGuide  but that is also an enormous maze of options            After long and tedious research I am able toreport on the content of the  channels available with the packages I haveor at least what was available during prime time in one evening            Ninetynine of thesechannels provided no content to subscribers That included  blank channels channels containing advertising for the system or schedules of comingevents eight channels of broadcast stations generally available free without asatellite dish but requiring payment with the satellite dish and sevenchannels duplicating what was being shown on other channels Also there were channels airing music without any picture These channels were very finelyclassifieds hits s hits several varieties of rock severalvarieties of country and so on I consider that to be essentially similar towhat can be obtained on the radio in most places            Of theremaining  channels that had some content  were showing movies  forfree and  for pay The fee for the pay movies was low  if your satellitedish was connected to your phone line otherwise  A quick scroll through themovies suggests that their quality is about what you would find in your localtheaters on any given daymany awful some fair and a few good That is nosurprise because almost all the movies have been in your local theater Thepay movies were no better than the free movies only somewhat newer A personwho wants to stay home to see a movie on any night or even on every nightshould find something amusing For oldies like me the most intriguing channelis Turner Classic Movies One morning I came across a  movie calledLove  with Greta Garbo and John Gilbert It was really AnnaKarenina  But even I dont want to watch those old movies for more than afew minutes            The  channels devoted to sports three of them for paywere a surprise to me I hadnt expected so much space to be devoted to rugbytwo channels fishing beach volleyball stockcar racing and ballooningbut I suppose there are those who love these activities More access tostandard events is available in deluxe packages beyond what I paid for            Elevennews channels all have pretty much the same news I generously classify ninechannels as education including two channels of CSPAN the DiscoveryChannel a health channel and a few others Then there is a smattering ofother thingsshopping food housekeeping cartoons religion and so on OneComedy Central carries a new program Win Ben Steins Money  for whichI confess a special interest One channel described in the brochure astasteful adult programming for mature audiences I can vouch for as being veryclean All the girls look as if they just stepped out of the shower            The technology of satellite TVone inchdish on the deck of my apartment receiving  channels from something flyingin space thousands of miles awayis wonderful The programming is lesswonderful But still I cant complain about what is there I do howeverwonder about what is not there When there are so many channels available whyis so little space devoted to education and art My own little corner of theworld policy wonking is an example Washington think tanks long to get theirprograms on CSPAN but CSPAN has space for only a few of them Anotherchannel devoted to such talk could well interest as many people as want to seea  movie starring Conrad Nagel and would not hurt them And that onlyscratches the surface of possible educational programming On the arts sidethere are videotapes of great performances of great operas Could they take theplace of one of the  channels of movies I recently acquired a wonderfulvideotape of ballet with Suzanne Farrell and Baryshnikov producedincidentally with support from the muchmaligned National Endowment for theArts I can imagine a channel devoted to such productions My economistfriends will certainly tell me that if such programming would pay off it wouldbe done But there is more to life than economics            Theselast musings raise in my mind another question a long way from the cuteinch dish on my deck Many estimable people are devoting themselves toridding our popular culture of obscenity sex and violence Who is devotinghimself to enriching our popular culture with high art                           POSTSCRIPT Two more weeks with my cute TV satellite dish have increasedmy appreciation of it I have learned to find my way around better althoughthat is still a problem and I think that a technology that can deliver so muchinformation should be able to provide better guidance on the screen and notrequire reference to a printed magazine I have found that when the incomingmusic is routed through my stereo I get excellent sound Just accidentallywhile surfing and without any prior notice I came upon a broadcast of DonGiovanni that was very good I assume that the whole thing was beingbroadcast although I came in at the beginning of the last act There were nopictures And I have finally sat through a whole movie It was a  versionof The Prisoner of Zenda  with Ronald Colman Douglas Fairbanks JrRaymond Massey David Niven Madeleine Carroll and Mary Astor They dont makecasts like that any more I remain of the opinion however that the content isfar short of the potentialities of the technology
