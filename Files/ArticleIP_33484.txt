                                  Library Cad            Youd think that a city would be thrilled to nameone of its streets after the most famous person who ever walked or in thiscase took a midnight jog down it but thats not how it works in LittleRock Ark Late last month signwavers and activists mobbed city hall whilethe city board considered whether to rename the street where the WilliamJefferson Clinton Presidential Library will be located President ClintonAvenue Hecklers offered derisive amendments Impeachment Avenue wasproposed But the city board eventually compromised renaming just the fewblocks of Markham Street around the library after the presidenta plan themayor said he came to embrace after asking himself What would Jesus do            After a bit of fussingfrom radio talk show hosts and newspaper columnists the streetname dustupblew over but its one of the few controversies connected with the ClintonPresidential Library that has Since Little Rock beat out Hope and Hot Springsfor the library in November  city policies from sales taxes to zoo fundinghave been tangled up in Clinton and the building that will be his legacy Asone local columnist noted in Little Rock even if they say its not aboutClinton its about Clinton            Few Little Rockers dispute that a worldclass librarybuilding will be a boon to a town where the finest example of modernarchitecture is the TCBY Tower and the principal tourist attractions are quiltshows and a building that had a cameo in Gone With the Wind not tomention the hotel rooms where Clinton propositioned women But just as LittleRock residents are embarrassed by Central High the discomfiting monument todesegregation and the towns other claim to history some are queasy aboutcelebrating their notsofavorite son            After all Little Rockhad hardly won the library when the Lewinsky scandal broke and a vast new fieldof inquiry revealed itself to Little Rock wiseacres Whats going to be in thisliebrary anyhow A cigar and a dress Oral histories            But the library has provoked Little Rock not just becauseits a litmus test about Clinton Even some Clinton fans have a bad taste intheir mouths about the way the Little Rock board of directors arranged to payfor the acre site Private donors will fund the  million to  millionlibrary but city officials agreed to deliver constructionready land Andafter recovering from the initial euphoria over winning the big prize MayorJim Dailey and Co realized they had to find  million to buy and clear theproperty            For a city with a  million budget thats ajawbreaker but officials had made a commitment They hit upon the idea ofissuing parks revenue bonds which didnt require voter approval andpledging revenues from the citys golf courses parks and zoo to pay themdown The problem Parks revenue bonds can only fund parks Is a library apark That depends on your definition of the word park The city called thelibrary a presidential park and that took care of it            The plan to take moneyfrom the Little Rock zoo is another saga For reasons too Byzantine to explainits the only unaccredited big zoo in the nation and it could use a cashinfusion City officials are incredibly sensitive to the charge that they arebuying Clinton land with money that should go to feeding the giraffes When thecitys newly hired zoo director came to town for a meetandgreet recentlyreporters were warned in no uncertain terms that he was not to be asked aboutthe library            Chamber of Commerce types welcomed this parksbond trickbut other members of the populace were not so gratified among them yearoldNora Harris a selfdescribed retired housewife Harris sued the cityclaiming the library land deal is an illegal tax because the city will have toraid the general fund to make up for lost parks revenue A Pulaski CountyChancery Court judge ruled in the citys favor in June but Harris plans toappeal her case to the state Supreme Court She has vowed to pursue the case tothe US Supreme Court or at least until she runs out of money            Harris isnt the only onetaking the city to court Local developer Eugene Pfeifer III a vocal opponentof the library owns a piece of property in the presidential park and promisesto fight the citys attempt to take his property by eminent domain            And then theres everyone else in the city When the mayorproposed a onecent sales tax to shore up Little Rocks frayed budget the cityrevolted Opponents such as Harris and Pfeifer argued loudly that the city wasforecasting a deficit because it is saddled with debt voters didnt approve tofund a library they didnt request for the president who didnt inhale Cityofficials squealed at that contentionthe sales tax plan didnt mention thepresidential library and a deficit had been projected before the libraryland grabbut Mayor Dailey was questioned about it everywhere he went and hisanswers didnt impress The tax was walloped by more than twothirds of votersin a May referendum Since then the city has frozen hiring and choppedprograms to stave off a budget emergency            All this time the land for the library has satundisturbed covered with tall weeds and empty buildings its intended purposemarked only by a banner that has grown progressively more tattered The mayororiginally hoped groundbreaking would take place six months ago but it hasnthappened yet Still the library is beginning to seem less of an albatrossEarlier this month Clinton finally picked the architects James StewartPolshek and Richard M Olcott of the Polshek Partnership in New York alongwith exhibit designer Ralph Appelbaum            One unanswered question is how much time Clintonwill spend in his home state once his library is completed Perhaps hell livein an upstairs apartment and huff around town in jogging shorts as he did whenhe was governor The rumor of a Senate run seems dead but a local satiricalrevue proposes that Clinton capitalize on his legendary presstheflesh skillby working as a WalMart greeter Speaking of pressing the flesh Clinton willundoubtedly put the library to good use No one expects that Clinton will spenda lot of time in carrels poring over his papers but even so he has a goodtrack record of making the most of the stacks It was in the Yale Law Libraryafter all that he first put the moves on Hillary Rodham
