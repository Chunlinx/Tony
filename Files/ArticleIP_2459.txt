                                 Filtering Filth            Artificial intelligenceexpert Keith Devlin wrote that a computer will never be able to tell thedifference between time flies like an arrow and fruit flies like honey Addto this mix she unzipped their flies like there was no tomorrow and you getsome idea of the challenge faced by software manufacturers hawking filters toprotect children from the nastiness on the Web The filters are supposed toblock access to sites parents wouldnt want their children to see            The Webcommunity has insisted that government regulation of pornographic Webcontentas in last years Communications Decency Actis unnecessary becausesoftware filters can do the job Now that the Supreme Court has ruled the CDAunconstitutional that bluff has been called Do filters work And which oneswork best            In essence all filter programs work like search engines inreverse keeping out anything with certain words or combinations of lettersThe Sussex County Fair Web page has been blocked by filters because it containsthe three letters sex The breastcancer survivors group found its discussionblocked by America Online which quickly apologized Even the Web page forMicrosofts Encarta encyclopedia has been blocked presumably because somewherethere was a mention of sex or even breasts            Softwarecompanies have two different approaches to marketing the filter programs Oneevokes law enforcement This category includes SurfWatch as well as CyberPatrol motto To Surf and Protect which operates from a screen that lookslike the command center of Rescue   Other filters evoke Mary Poppinswith names like CYBERsitter and Net Nanny Despite its cozy name CYBERsitteris in one way the strictest of the programs Its a tattletale The softwarekeeps a log of the sites the child has attempted to access including attemptsto access blocked material Net Nannys more liberal approach is indicated byits twopronged motto The Best Way To Protect Your Children And Free SpeechOn The Net It provides parents with a suggested list of sites to exclude butnothing is excluded without being specifically designated by the parents As aspokesperson told me in an email We do not automatically block as thatwould be infringing on your rights Think Mary Poppins in a Lilith FairTshirt            All the filters are designed to block siteswith explicitly sexual text or pictures and most also screen out sites dealingwith drugs alcohol hate speech and gambling Filters fail in two waysoverinclusivenessblocking sites that shouldnt be blockedandunderinclusivenessletting bad stuff through All the filter products claimto have sophisticated algorithms to avoid these pitfalls The challenge is inapplying a formulaic approach to a heavily contextsensitive sorting problemCyber Patrol says that it excludes sites that advocate drug use or bigotry butthat it does not exclude opinion or educational material such as thehistorical use of marijuana or the circumstances surrounding santiSemitic Germany As Devlins example shows this is easier in theory thanin practice CYBERsitter which touts its sophisticated contentbased filtersblocks all sites with the word anarchy            Butoverinclusiveness is less troubling to parents than underinclusiveness Intesting each of the filters I was able to pull up Xrated material without mucheffort Filters may prevent access to certain sites but blocked sites can showup when kids use search engines and there is nothing to prevent kids fromreading the raunchy descriptions of the sites or writing down the Web addressesand going off to a friends houseor to the local public library which inkeeping with cherished anticensorship policies probably doesnt use filtersoftware            Filters can protect kids from accidentally orintentionally visiting a Web site that includes material deemed inappropriateby their parents but they are limited to what we might term the pull sideThe bigger problem is on the push side and there the filters are helplessOne of the boys in my Cub Scout troop received via AOL email a photograph oftwo men having sex It was sent as a joke by an older boy he knew My son then participated in a sports discussion group on Prodigy The group wasexceptionally kind and protective except for one participant who was cut offby the discussion leader for general obnoxiousness He retaliated by using afree AOL account to send  copies of an obscene email to everyone who hadever participated in the Prodigy discussion including my son            Comingsoon are filters based on criteria developed by particular groups Parents willbe able to select from filters endorsed by anyone from the Christian Coalitionto the National Education Association Ultimately the WC plan developed bythe international World Wide Web Consortium will provide standard ratings tobe assigned to each page by its developer Parents will be able to set theirbrowsers to deny access to pages without ratings And so they can breatheeasier knowing that their children will only be able to see pages certified assuitable by their own operators            Meanwhile you can download trial versions offilter software to find the one you like best That decision will be based moreon your technical facility than on your notions of what material you want yourkids to see because the programs vary much more in their dependence onparental tweaking than on their approaches to excluding material Parents whoare less adept than their kids at using the Internet will probably preferCYBERsitter It errson the side of exclusion and was especially thorough at preventing even theresults of Web searches that included inappropriate URLs Parents who arewilling to devote the time to setting their own parameters will be better offwith Cyber Patrol Itallows separate settings for separate users important for families with olderchildren or children of different ages It also makes it possible for parentsto block outgoing information to prevent kids from revealing their last namesphone numbers addresses and passwords in an online chat Ultimately thougheven the best filters are a limited and temporary solution None are aseffective as good communication and maybe even more important keeping thefamily computer in a central location so that all surfing is done withinearshot            But filters arent just forconcerned parents The cover story in the last issue of the business magazineAcross the Board identifies nonbusinessrelated use of the Web as aserious problem at the office Among the most frequent visitors toPenthouse magazines Web site are employees at ATT HewlettPackardCo IBM and NASA One statistic floating around is that workers spend about minutes a day on nonworkrelated computer games and Web surfing with anestimated productivity cost of  billion And as SurfWatchs promotionalliterature is happy to point out filters can help protect management fromliability for permitting sexually explicit material in the workplace The realmarket for filters isnt Mom and Dadits Dilberts boss
