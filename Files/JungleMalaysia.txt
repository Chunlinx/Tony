                      The Jungle        To go to Malaysia without setting foot in the jungle would        be to miss an essential beauty of the country A walk in the jungle can        be a rare sensual pleasure Sounds flood in from all sides the buzz        and whine of crickets the chatter of squirrels the pooppooppoop of        hornbills the cries of gibbon apes You are likely to see everything        from the deep gloom of the densest forest to the sudden brilliant burst        of sun in a clearing playing endless variations on the textures and        myriad shades of green in the surrounding vegetation        Five Kinds of Jungle        Variations in soil slope and altitude give rise to five        different types of forest        Mangrove forest Mangrove trees and shrubs grow on coastal        marshland in the brackish zone between the sea and fresh water The        dense undergrowth of their aerial prop roots perform natural land        reclamation The fruit and leaves feed crabs whose waste products in        turn feed fish prawns and mollusks The mangroves distinctive        companion is the low trunkless nipa palm whose curtain of fronds has        traditionally provided roofing material for coastal huts        Freshwater swamp Abundant fruit trees in the fertile        alluvium of river plains attract prolific wildlife Peat swamp found        in the southern half of the peninsula and in Sarawak on Borneo is less        fertile but rich in hardwood timber Where swamp gives way to dry land        you will see the fascinating monstrous stranglerfigs        Dipterocarp forest The botanical term refers to the        twowinged fruit similar to the key of the common sycamore borne by        a large number of the forests tallest trees This dryland rainforest        is what you will see most frequently from just above sea level up to an        altitude of  m  ft Its wealth of trees is remarkable        including the tualang found both in the northern half of the peninsula        and in Sabah and Sarawak The Borneo ironwood or belian produces the        worlds densest hardest timber after the South African ironwood But        Sabah boasts the fastestgrowing tree in the world an acacialike        Albizzia falcataria which was clocked from germinated seed to almost         m over  ft in just  months        Heath forest Poor soil on the flat terrain leading to        foothills or on sandy mountainridges produces only low stunted trees        with thick leaves The heath forest is remarkable for its profound        silence compared with the jungles incessant din        Montane forest At  m  ft and above in large        mountain ranges or as low as  m  ft on small isolated        mountains the large trees and liana creepers give way to myrtle        laurel and oak trees Wild raspberries appear along with magnolias        rhododendrons orchids and other epiphytes plants that grow on other        plants but are not parasites since they procure their own food        supply One of the most intriguing specimens of montane flora also        found in the heath forest is the pitcher plant see page         Animal Life        Unlike the wildlife of the African plain most of the        animals of the Malaysian jungle are not very conspicuous Tigers and        leopards remain rare Plus the elephants rhinos tigers and bears of        Malaysia are the smallest of their kind        Elephant There are about  elephants on the peninsula        and twice that number in eastern Sabah A few have been domesticated        for plantation work They are daintier beasts than their African        cousins        Rhinoceros Scarcely a hundred Sumatran Rhino remain the        best place to see them is at the Sepilok sanctuary where controlled        breeding may combat the ravages of poaching To see it in its wild or        semiwild state try the Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve northwest of KL        or in the Tabin reserve in eastern Sabah        Tapir This animal is remarkable for two features its        short overlapping snout that resembles the sawedoff trunk of an        elephant and its unique body coloringblack up front white in the        middle and back black rear legs It is found only on the peninsula        Your best chance to see it is at the Ampang reserve near Kuala Lumpur        or at Taman Negara        Deer Most common are the tiny mousedeer These timid        nocturnal beasts sport a brown coat speckled with white The largest        Malaysian deer is the brown antlered sambar Another shy creature you        might spot it at the edge of the forest or on river banks The barking        deer socalled because it bays like a dog when threatened by        predators wears a shiny reddishbrown coat        Tiger The few Malaysian tigers left roaming the peninsula        are the smallest of the breed weighing only  kg  lb  kg         lb less than the Indian or Chinese tiger        Leopard The classic spotted yellow or black coat of the        leopard may be seen not only in the jungle but also around plantations        and farms The smaller clouded leopard hunts up in the trees enjoying        a varied diet of monkeys baby orangutans birds and squirrels The        leopardcat is not a lot bigger than a domestic cat and may nip in and        out of villages        Proboscis monkey Unique to Borneo the male sports the        splendid pendulous nose that gives this species its name It is also        the male who emits a formidable honk through its nose at times of great        excitement or alarm The females nose is an unremarkable little snub        but zoologists say that she appreciates and is even aroused by the        males proboscis They can best be seen on the lower Kinabatangan river        in eastern Sabah and the Bako and Samunsan nature reserves in        Sarawak        Orangutan In Malay orangutan means forest personan        appropriate mark of respect for the mammal biologically closest to man        These highly intelligent russetcolored apes live in the swamp forests        of Sabah and Sarawak and are best seen in eastern Sabahs Sepilok        wildlife reserve They are very individualistic nomads meeting        occasionally to share a fruit supper before going their own way Some        visitors to Sepilok confuse them with the similarly colored redleaf        monkeysbut unlike monkeys orangutans have no tails
