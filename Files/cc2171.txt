                    Introduction        Each year approximately   patients in the USA        suffer from sepsis Treatment for this disease costs         billion annually     Despite advances in supportive        intensive care and use of appropriate antibiotics the        mortality associated with sepsis remains high especially        among those who develop hemodynamic shock       Such        patients frequently progress to multiple organ dysfunction        syndrome which results in a much higher mortality rate        than among patients who do not develop such complications               This lifethreatening syndrome is largely        attributed to the cardiovascular abnormalities associated        with septic shock requiring supportive therapy eg        mechanical ventilation fluid resuscitation and        vasopressors with volume loading oxygen delivery and        regional perfusion     However there are still many        controversies regarding choice of fluids               vasopressors       hemodynamic endpoints for        resuscitation         and monitoring        techniques Findings from a national survey of intensive        care unit ICU utilization showed differences in types of        procedures performed between unit types and hospital sizes                   The goals of the present study were to examine        systematically the variations in overall resource use        therapeutic modality use and outcome in patients with        severe sepsis across academic medical centers and to        evaluate relationships between therapeutic modality use and        variation in resource use                    Methods                  Patient population          All participating centers were members of the Academic          Medical Center Consortium which sponsored the study All          eight centers were large tertiary care academic medical          centers with approximately    admissions          annually     Patient enrollment occurred between          January  and April           Patients surveyed represented a stratified random          sample of patients in ICUs and outside ICUs for whom          blood cultures were either positive or negative as          previously described     Among nonICU patients with          blood cultures that were negative at  hours sampling          at all centers was fixed at  Among ICU patients and          patients with a blood culture positive for a pathogen          within  hours the fraction of patients sampled was          established at each center and varied from  to  In          addition all patients who died in an emergency          department or an ICU and all patients who received a          novel therapy for sepsis syndrome were surveyed The ICUs          involved included both open and closed units          Although previous reports included  episodes of          sepsis among  unique patients with  hospital          admissions      the results presented here from          the same database were based on the   patients          representing   admissions with            episodes of sepsis syndrome for whom billing information          was available When patients had more than one episode in          an admission only the first episode in that admission          was evaluated                          Definitions          Sepsis syndrome was defined as described by Sands and          coworkers     using a modification of the criteria          developed by Bone     and involved assessment of the          presence of both screening criteria and confirmatory          criteria for sepsis syndrome Either of the following          were required for a patient to satisfy the screening          criteria all four of temperature greater than C or          less than C rectally respirations greater than          min or mechanical ventilation heart rate greater than           beatsmin and clinical evidence of infection or one          or more blood cultures positive for a pathogen at           hours following admission Presence of any of the          following seven features without an alternative cause          was required for satisfaction of the confirmatory          criteria ratio of partial arterial oxygen tension to          inspired fractional oxygen below  intubated or           face mask in use nonintubated arterial pH below           urine output below  mlh systolic blood pressure below           mmHg or a fall in systolic blood pressure by more than           mmHg sustained for  hours despite fluid challenge          systemic vascular resistance below  dynesscm           prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time greater          than normal or platelets below    l or          platelets decreased to less than  or most recent          measurement before current day and documentation of          deterioration in mental status within  hours In          addition all patients who received a form of novel          therapy for sepsis syndrome were enrolled in the sepsis          syndrome group Because all patients with sepsis syndrome          also meet the criteria for severe sepsis the term that          is most popular now below we use the term severe          sepsis          Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS was defined          as partial arterial oxygen tension below  mmHg despite          fractional inspired oxygen in excess of  and          bilateral pulmonary infiltrates without signs of heart          failure Disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC was          defined as a positive Ddimer or elevated fibrin          degradation products plus a falling platelet count of           of less of baseline and elevation of either prothrombin          time or partial prothrombin time or clinical evidence of          bleeding Central nervous system CNS dysfunction was          defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale score below  in          patients with normal results at baseline neurologic          examination or at least  point lower than baseline in          patients with a previously abnormal examination result          Renal failure was defined as an increase in serum          creatinine of at least  mgdl during the sepsis          episode if creatinine was below  mgdl at baseline or          an absolute increase of  mgdl or more if baseline          creatinine was at least  Liver failure was defined as          present if total bilirubin was  mgdl or greater and          either the alkaline phosphatase or a transaminase level          was greater than twice normal in the absence of          confounding disease Shock after onset of sepsis was          defined as either at least  hour of decreased systolic          blood pressure by at least  mmHg or systolic blood          pressure of  mmHg or less after adequate volume          replacement and in the absence of antihypertensive          agents or continuous infusion of pressors Uncontrolled          hemorrhage was defined as active and livethreatening          bleeding requiring transfusions of more than  units          within  hours of onset of sepsis Moderate or severe          liver disease was defined as cirrhosis with portal          hypertension or hepatic failure with coma or          encephalopathy within the preceding  months                          Data collection          Surveyors recorded the presence of all screening          criteria for every day that a patient was a valid member          of the surveillance group If screening criteria were          met then the patient was enrolled as a case and detailed          information including demographic historical clinical          and laboratory data were abstracted from the medical          record into a standardized data collection form for which          all variables and criteria were defined Additional data          including information on antibiotic use treatment          modalities pulmonary artery catheter PAC use          ventilator support pressor support albumin infusion          hetastarch and dextran complications ARDS renal          failure liver failure DIC and shock and associated          outcomes were abstracted  days after the first onset          of severe sepsis or at the time of death or hospital          discharge whichever came first Hospital length of stay          LOS before and after the onset of severe sepsis and          total hospital charge were obtained from the unified          Academic Medical Center Consortium hospital billing          database          We calculated the patients Charlson comorbidity score              a higher score reflects greater comorbidity We          also obtained information on discharge diagnosisrelative          groups DRGs and DRG weight The current generation of          DRGs was originally based on ICDCM and takes into          consideration operations complications and          comorbidities Each DRG was preassigned an average LOS          and reimbursement rate by the US Health Care Financing          Administration The higher the DRG weight the higher the          level of reimbursement                          Analyses          Because the sampling fractions from different strata          varied     individual cases carried different weight             and all calculations including means and          proportions were performed using appropriate case          weights          We compared the proportion of sepsis patients          receiving each intervention therapy and then the          proportion with complications among eight academic          centers using weighted  statistics We also calculated          the ratio of the highest to lowest proportion for each          intervention and complication Multivariate comparisons          were made using generalized linear modeling with          postonset LOS and hospital charges as dependent          variables and study center coded as dummy variables as          the main covariate adjusting for age sex Charlson          comorbidity score discharge DRG weight organ          dysfunction ARDS uncontrolled hemorrhage moderate or          severe liver disease or acute renal failure and          service surgical versus medical at onset of sepsis The          same adjustment of variables was applied in logistic          regression models to compare the likelihood that a sepsis          patient at a particular center received an intervention          and experienced a complication arbitrarily choosing          center  as the reference center Because patients          within the same center could share some common          characteristics generalized estimating equation          regression models were used to perform the analyses on          the comparisons of resource use between patients with and          without use of modalities The           r value was calculated for each          model All analyses were performed using the SAS          statistical package SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA                                         Results                  Variation in resource use          There was significant variation in mean total charges          among admissions with severe sepsis among the study          centers varying from   median   to            median   Table  The mean postonset LOS          varied from  days to  days median range           days among centers Other measures of resource          utilization including total LOS and LOS in the ICU were          also significantly

Table                           Variation in therapeutic modality use          Interventions used frequently after the onset of          severe sepsis included PACs  ventilator support

the use of          other modalities across the eight centers data not          shown                          Relation between resource use and modalities          Comparisons of resource use among patients treated          with specific modalities and those who were not showed          that administration of antibiotics within  hours after          sepsis onset had no impact on any of the LOS categories          but was associated with total and daily hospital charges          Table  Use of other modalities including albumin          infusion was associated with increased resource use for          daily hospital charges Total hospital charges and LOS in          the ICU were significantly higher among patients who were          given pressor support andor albumin infusion after onset          of sepsis as compared with those who were not Increased          postonset LOS and LOS in the ICU were associated with          use of PACs No associations were found between total LOS          and the modalities studied                            Discussion        Overall we found moderate variation in resource and        therapeutic modality use among patients with severe sepsis        in academic centers In general this variation had little        relationship to clinical outcomes although clinical        outcomes varied substantially between the centers The        exception is that even adjusting for potential        confounders early antibiotic therapy was associated with a        lower day mortality rate Increased use of some of the        therapeutic modalities was associated with greater resource        utilization        Prior studies have shown variability in the use of        therapeutic modalities including PACs ventilator and        intravenous vasoactive and inotropic agents among ICU        patients     and different impacts on outcomes and        use of hospital resources associated with these treatments                In general with the exception of the        recent trial demonstrating benefit of early goaldirected        treatment involving oxygenation including ventilatory        support if necessary and blood pressure including        intravenous pressors if necessary     few data are        available that demonstrate that these modalities improve        outcomes        Colloids and crystalloid are equally effective in        restoring tissue perfusion in patients with septic shock            However the choice of fluid has considerable cost        implications colloids cost more for volume replacement        Largely inappropriate use of colloids was found in a survey        of academic health centers despite guidelines from a US        hospital consortium recommending that colloids be used in        hemorrhagic shock only until blood products become        available and in nonhemorrhagic shock only if an initial        infusion with crystalloid is insufficient      A        recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials        comparing colloids and crystalloid solutions for volume        replacement found that resuscitation with colloids in        critically ill patients was actually associated with an        increased risk of mortality            In addition vasopressors have been recommended to        achieve endpoints of hemodynamic and normal or        supranormal oxygen transport variables in sepsis patients        who remain hypotensive despite adequate volume therapy        However after reviewing the literature on the use of        vasopressors in patients with sepsis syndrome Rudis and        colleagues    found that catecholamine therapy        resulting in increased hemodynamic and oxygen transport        measures did not change the overall mortality with the        exception of two instances in which epinephrine        adrenaline and norepinephrine noradrenaline were given        alone after volume repletion The results from a recent        trial of lowdose dopamine in critically ill patients who        had systemic inflammatory response syndrome and were at        risk for renal failure did not show benefit in renal        protection and survival from the treatment            However a very recent trial of early goaldirected therapy        in treatment of sepsis did demonstrate substantial        improvement in outcome            Another technology is monitoring central pressures by        PAC which is often used in ICUs to assess the effect of        pharmacotherapy on the cardiac index in patients with        septic shock This is done even though the efficacy of the        PAC has never been demonstrated convincingly in a large        randomized controlled trial A number of randomized        controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of PACs        or PACguided strategies in sepsis patients                 and other specific patient groups                   with conflicting results A recent case mix        adjusted observational study of a large sample of ICU        patients found that PAC use was associated with increased        risk for mortality and resource use            Mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS has been        reported to be associated with pneumonia and lung injury               Properly constructed trials are still        needed to define the best use of mechanical ventilation in        sepsis although early ventilatory support was a component        of the recent early goaldirected intervention by Rivers        and coworkers            Use of some therapeutic modalities does appear        correlated with organizational characteristics For        example results from a national ICU survey conducted by        Greoger and colleagues    showed that more technologies        were used in surgical units as compared with other units        as well as in larger versus smaller hospitals and in        universityaffiliated facilities In addition a large        prospective multicenter study evaluated the differences in        ICU characteristics and performance among teaching and        nonteaching hospitals     The results of that study        revealed more frequent use of monitoring and therapeutic        interventions and greater resource utilization in teaching        hospital ICUs Also a recent report from a large        retrospective database study of ICU patients           confirmed that organizational characteristics of ICUs were        associated with variation in PAC use In addition that        report indicated that economic incentives and insurance        coverage as well as clinical variables were associated        with PAC use Similarly much of the variation in resource        use and modality use across centers in the present study        may not be due to patientrelated factors but rather to        organizational factors and physician beliefs        We did find a number of relationships between modality        use and resource utilization In particular there were        associations between LOS in the ICU and use of PACs        pressor support and albumin infusion These may probably        be accounted for in part by the fact that patients with        longer LOS in the ICU were more likely to be treated with        supportive technologies In general however modalities        with higher variation profiles reflect areas of greater        disagreement in terms of treatment decisionmaking Such        areas may be fertile for additional investigation        It is striking that delay in antibiotic therapy was        associated with a higher mortality rate and that some        delays were present in this very ill population Delays are        common in American medicine     even in urgent        situations such as treatment of lifethreatening laboratory        abnormalities     Although we do not know the causes        of delays in antibiotic initiation they appeared more        common in some institutions than in others We speculate        that some may have occurred because of problems related to        crowding for example emergency rooms or ICUs might have        been full resulting in delayed transfer or the clinical        importance of changes in vital signs might not have been        recognized Approaches such as protocols for early        recognition and treatment of severe sepsis and        facilitation of medication orders that are really needed        urgently may be helpful Guidelines for the management of        severe sepsis are probably most applicable for certain        treatment modalities such as PACs albumin dextran and        hetastarch Even use of organ failure treatment modalities        such as ventilator support and renal replacement therapies        might be different if such guidelines were developed        An important underlying issue is why variation occurs             It should not be surprising that it is present in        this domain because the pioneering work of Wennberg           identified variation across a broad array of domains One        of the major causes of variation is probably physician        uncertainty regarding what interventions are truly        beneficial and clinician beliefs where training occurred        and regional practices probably also play roles        Uncertainty may be especially problematic in conditions        such as sepsis in which mortality is high and clinicians        strongly want to do everything possible Variation is        likely to diminish as more evidence becomes available and        is brought to the point of care Analysis of variation can        be very useful for identifying areas of high uncertainty                   This study has a number of limitations We had        information only on hospital charges rather than hospital        costs We did not have information on organizational        variables such as organizational setting staffing or        leadership of practices and the study included only        academic centers Also our data did not include the        indications for use of therapeutic modalities        In conclusion significant variations were present in        hospital resource use and patient outcome among sepsis        patients across eight academic medical centers In general        variation in therapeutic modality use did not correlate        with clinical outcomes suggesting that some use of these        modalities may be of limited value and that further        evaluation of these modalities is warranted The exception        was that delay in giving antibiotics to sepsis patients was        associated with a higher day mortality rate Approaches        to eliminate these delays may improve outcomes                    Competing interests        None declared                    Key messages         Moderate variation in resource use and use of        technologies was present in treatment of severe sepsis        among academic centers         This variation presisted even after adjusting for        potential confounders         Increased use of some therapeutic modalities such as        albumin infusion was associated with greater resource        utilization         Among therapeutic modalities only early antibiotic        use was associated with lower day mortality         Taken together these data suggest that some        therapeutic modalities may be of limited value in sepsis        treatment and that further evaluation is warranted                    Abbreviations        ARDS  acute
