                                 Carnival of Carnage            Are we shooting calls a boyish American soldierMark Wahlberg to distant buddies at the start of Three                Kings He stands in a flat whitish Iraqi desert dotted with mounds On top of onefar away an Iraqi waves a rifle and some kind of cloth Is he taunting theAmerican Appealing to him Is he surrendering or on the verge of opening fireHard to tell The light is too glaring the mans frantic gestures too alien Atitle has informed us that its  that the ceasefire with Iraq has justbecome official Are we still shooting people or what the soldier callsagain In the absence of a clear answerof a clear anythinghe raises hisrifle and shoots The soldiers reach the Iraqi as hes hemorrhaging a look ofwonder in his dying eyes You shot yourself a raghead whoops one but theAmerican who firedidentified by an onscreen title as US Army Sgt TroyBarlowrecoils from his handiwork The war is over and Barlow has just killedhis first man            That scene is like amini Beckett farce with a cruel jet of gore for a punch line Barlow isshooting at people he doesnt know and can barely see for reasons that arenever apparent in a place thats as foreign as the surface of the moon Allthats finally real is the blood From this brilliant overture its obviousthat the writerdirector David O Russell wants to break down your defensesagainst cinemas violent imagery Hes juxtaposing farce and atrocity in waysthat few American directors have dared And hes not stinting on the carnageeither The movies most talkedabout closeup shows the track of a bullet asit enters a body plowing its way through tissue and into a liver whichreleases blackish bile Reportedly Russell had bullets fired into a cadaverNo wound the director is saying screaming in effect should ever be takenfor granted            It helps that Russell is fueled by genuine outrage at thatmost jumbled and arms length of wars the one that pretended to be about theliberation of the people of Kuwait the one that ended up once the oil wellswere recaptured rebounding on Iraqis whod been convinced by President Bush totake up arms against Saddam Hussein As the protagonist Special Forces CaptArchie Gates a hard brooding George Clooney declares in his first scene Idont even know what we did here Cynical and disgusted Gates getswind so to speak of a wild discovery a map lodged in the rear end of anIraqi prisoner that shows what appear to be bunkers holding loot plundered fromKuwait Announcing that he has no moral problem stealing from Saddam whatSaddam has stolen from the sheiks he joins with Barlow Barlows buddy Vigskinny Spike Jonze director of the upcoming Being John               Malkovich  a game but witless redneck and the resourceful Chief IceCube in search of the motherlode Millions of dollars worth of gold bullionGates says can be loaded into their Humvee without firing a shot and theyllbe back at camp before lunch            At this junctureThree Kings seems poised to turn into a relatively straightforward genrepiecea perverse caper movie with a touch of Gunga Din  Butthe surreal setting hints at dissonances disturbing incongruities The whitelight scorches every surfaceit seems to be eating into people Details of thenatural world are bleached out but artificial colorssuch as the pink andgreen footballs the soldiers pack with explosives and lob from their speedingvehicle for sportleap out of the screen like radioactive Christmas baublesThe action comes in jarring spasms A cow is blown up during an exercise andthe Americans are showered with bloody chunks of beefa harbinger of theinsane slaughter to come When Gates and company reach the village where thegold is supposed to be stashed the Iraqi people think theyre being liberatedand rejoice pushing their babies on the United States of Freedom They cantunderstand why the Americans arent chasing away Saddams soldiers whosemission in light of the ceasefire has shifted from fighting the Americanledalliance to ruthlessly suppressing all signs of Iraqi rebellion            The weird juxtapositions in these scenes are the moviessoul Inside a bunker a soldier uses a NordicTrack in front of a televisionjust down the corridor from a torture chamber Piles of cell phonesCuisinarts blue jeans and gold watches sit side by side with weapons of massdestruction The Iraqi soldiers turn machine guns on a truck thats heading forthe village riddling its driver with bullets When it skids into a buildingand overturns it doesnt explode Its tanks are full of milk for the starvingpeople Gates and his men have gone beyond the computer simulations and the TVcameras As Russell has said theyve fallen down a rabbit hole into a placewhere nothing makes sense Its the same twilight zone that Steven Spielbergattempted to capture in Saving Private Ryan  But Ryan  setin World War II ultimately lacked Three Kings  sense of moralchaos                           Three Kings lackssomething too but only because its imagery is so ferociously original thatRussell cant quite find a structure worthy of it All at once the moviebecomes a conversion melodramathe kind in which an amoral Bogartishprotagonist is unable to ignore injustice and so throws in his lot with theoppressed Its a winning formula but a formula all the same Whereas theopening manages to be shocking and ironic at once the pictures turning pointis crudely manipulative Dont read this if you want to be surprisedbut I dorecommend you read this because its not a good surprise A wifeleaves her little daughter and howls for Saddams men to free her husband asoldier pulls her away holds a gun to her head and then in full view of herspouse and child blows her brains out and the little girl throws herself ontop of her mother shrieking Yuma Yuma while the womans blood gushes intothe sand This shocking act recalls the climax of Sam Peckinpahs The WildBunch  in which a prisoner is executed with similar defiance andRussell builds to the same wordless exchange among the protagonists Thosemanly looks that say Were outnumbered and outgunned We could leave now withour money But if we do well never be able to live as men again But thevictim in The Wild Bunch was morally compromised Hed shot peoplehimself for no good reason And he didnt have a wideeyed little girl bearingwitness to his murder            No doubt Russell would justify the starkness of themothers killing by saying you cant make a movie about the obscenity ofviolence without showing something so obscene that it scalds us I dontquarrel with his intentions But after that sequence a part of me shut downWhere do you go from something like that To more horrible killings To moreabsurdist comedy The climaxin which Gates and the others decide to escort ahorde of noble Iraqis men women children the elderly to the border and arepredictably converged upon by Saddams men unfriendly American troops and aCNN reporter Nora Dunnisnt bad it just feels cheap compared to what haspreceded it In Time  Richard Schickel calls the genre structure apretext for a surreal essay on the Gulf War and he might be right And itsalso true that a studio such as Warner Bros would never have spent  millionon a film that didnt have a conventionally rabblerousing outline and anupbeat finish But I think those conventions diminish the movie If Im holdingRussell to the highest standards imaginable its only because his vision isthat powerful            Its also possible thatRussell is too sadistic by temperament to make a fully convincing antiwarfilm Hes out to blast us He wants to punish the charactersand theaudiencefor their ignorance At the time of the Gulf War a study showed thata majority of heavy CNN viewers people who watched seven hours a day whosupported the action believed that Kuwait was a democracy and the soldiershere are portrayed in a similar state of gungho naivet One of the filmsmost outlandish and effective scenes is the torture of Barlow by an Iraqiofficer Sad Taghmaoui who wants to educate him The session begins with abizarre dialogue about Michael Jacksonan AfricanAmerican superstar who inthe Iraqi officers view was driven by bigotry to whiten his face andstraighten his hairand winds up with the Iraqi pouring oil down Barlowsthroat in a brutal effort to drive home the wars real aim            We hate and fear the Iraqi but when he tells Barlow thathe lost his yearold son to an American bomb Russell cuts to a shot of thechild in its crib as the ceiling caves in When he asks how Barlow would feelif his wife and daughter were similarly killed Russell cuts to a shot of themother and child as the walls explode around them The connections among enemysoldiers have rarely been made so palpableor jocular An Iraqi officer tryingto escape from the smokefilled bunker with a huge pile of blue jeans isnt sodifferent from the Americans lugging bullion in Louis Vuitton bags And bothsides share a reverence for Infiniti convertibles and Rolexes ThreeKings is not the first antiwar movie in which opposing soldiers haverecognized themselves in one another before pulling the trigger but it mightbe the first to make the point in a way that has nothing to do with liberalhumanism The movie takes the view of a mordant social scientist who recognizesthat consumerism has become the true world religion            Russells first two films Spanking theMonkey  and Flirting With Disaster  were much smallerin scale but both were products of the same angry sensibility In the latterthe director used farce not to lighten the drama but to darken it so that theslapstick debacles seemed to spring from the heros roiling unconscious InThree Kings  those debacles spring from the blind desires ofnationsfrom the collective unconscious A war movie that opens theinstant the war has ended Three Kings is among the most pitilessautopsies ever filmed
