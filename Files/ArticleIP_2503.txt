                                 Portraits of a Political Puzzle            These two images are halvesof a political puzzle Fit them together and you may solve the great mysteryof the Clinton presidency            That mystery of course isClintons continued high standing in the eye of the electorate Hes stillenjoying high enough poll figures to have refused to answer any scandalrelatedquestions at his recent press conference even to have noted his comfort inkeeping silent High approval ratings cushion even a stonewall            Yet polls also indicate thatthe same electorate that approves of Clintons presidency suspects that manyof the scandalous allegations against him are true How can two such opinionslive peacefully together in the same heads            Gary Hart would probablylike to know the answer to that Thats him in Image No  Hart was runningfor the Democratic presidential nomination in  when this vacationsnapshot of him with Donna Rice on his lap surfaced promptly crushing hiscandidacy Hart was already reeling from allegations of womanizing thephotowhich was exhibited often enough to be burned into our synapsesclosedthe case against him The consensus was that as we could see with our owneyes Hart lacked the discipline and character for the presidency He wasdriven from public life            Whatthen does Image No  show us It shows us candidate Bill Clinton on acampaign flight in  Seated next to him on a jump seat is flight attendantDebra Schiff shes the one with Clintons hand between her thighs The imageis from a video clip shown in February on ABC and since posted on the InternetThis image has occasioned almost no comment What does it reveal aboutClintons discipline and character Apparently nothing Or rather nothing thatthe electorate cares to be bothered with The apparent consensus is thatwhatever we can see with our own eyes its Clintons and Schiffsbusiness            If theres any visual difference between these two imagesits that the one featuring Clinton is more lurid Hart and Rice are knowinglyposing for a camera you could frame the shot and display it on the coffeetable as long as you had the right sort of postmodern family living in thehouse Clinton and Schiff on the other hand have been caught off guard theresult would have a peeping Tom quality if their encounter had any personalintimacy which it does not Theres a third person present a man with whomClinton is conversing even as he rubs Schiffs thighs The effect isdisturbing because Schiff is depersonalized            Why thenthe disparity between the political effects of these two images BecauseoneHartswas perceived to contain vital political information and theotherClintonsapparently isnt In the decade between the public exhibitionof these images  to  character has been largely emptied of thepolitical significance it had throughout the postwar era as least as far asmany voters are concerned In the Clinton era presidential character has beendecoupled from American character            Harts problem was actually that as a symbolof Americanness his character mattered more then than Clintons does nowIn  there was still a significant external threat to the nation and a year tradition of global competition over ideas and issues Potentialpresidentslike astronauts Olympic athletes and other Americans playing onan international stagestill had to carry a lot of symbolic baggage They hadto appear as forthright champions in a historic contest disciplined leaderswho embodied national values Look at Richard Nixon an emotional stiff whowould have a tough time competing for national office today Yet in his own erahe could parlay leadership symbolism into a pair of landslide victoriesLeadership symbolism was pretty much what Ronald Reagan was about            What isleadership minus strength of character Hart failed that test But Clintonnever even had to pass it By  presidential roleplaying was alreadychanging dramatically The Soviets were gone and the Gulf War had seeminglysolidified the US global position The electorate was able to shrug off theGennifer Flowers scandal rather quickly its concerns were becoming domesticInterestingly Clinton is heard on the Flowers tapes telling her that whenasked she can characterize their relationship as she pleases precisely becausethere are no known photographs of them together But Clintons concerns aboutbeing another Hart turn out to have been anachronistic as the limited impactof the ClintonLewinsky embrace imagery demonstrates Even as Clinton wasrunning for office a different presidential model was already assertingitself            Weve seen this model before Whenever the country emergesfrom a national trauma and focuses on its piggy bank presidential expectationsshrink The years following the War of  were politically the Era of GoodFeelings The presidents after Reconstruction were the political ciphers ofRepublican ascendancy In the years after World War I the business of Americawas business            The idea that Clintonsapproval represents something new and immoral in the country is historicallyshortsighted In  a Victorian electorate shrugged off Grover Clevelandsconfessed paternity of an outofwedlock son Didnt matter Clevelands rolelike Rutherford Hayes and Warren Hardings was to take care of businessClinton is said to be concerned with shaping a historical legacy but as may benoted from his failed medical care program his unpopular antiIraq saberrattling and his largely ignored dialogue on race the care of business ispretty much all thats wanted of Clinton too
