                                  A Senate Bestiary            The assumption of bad faithon the part of ones rivals is a hallowed tradition of politics and Flytraphas honored it Democrats have tended to assume that Republicans are pursuingthe president simply out of loathing Republicans have tended to assume thatDemocrats are defending him simply out of political expediency The House byimpeaching Clinton on a nearly partyline vote obligingly fulfilled thoseexpectations            But the pregame of theSenate trial is already confusing those assumptions Some conservatives arebehaving like moderates some moderates like conservatives Democrats likeRepublicans and Republicans like Democrats Why            What follows is a taxonomy of the Senate an attempt toclassify senators and explain why theyre doing what theyre doing            The Controller  Senate MajorityLeader Trent Lott RMiss The three early conclusions drawn about Lottsefforts to broker a deal were that the majority leader is too conservative tooweak or both How else to explain Lotts weak push of the GortonLiebermanplan to cut short the trial by holding an early test vote on whether thecharges justify removing Clinton from office and his concessions torightwingers who wanted an expansive trial            But these conclusions dont do justice to his defthandling of an impossible position Lotts conservative principles are at oddswith the other two defining elements of his personality political pragmatismand an almost pathological love of efficiency Much as Lotts principles tellhim to punish President Clinton and much as he would love to satisfyconservative colleagues Lott knows that the president wont be convicted andthat a long trial will unhinge his Senate disrupt this years business andendanger Republican candidates in             Lott has actuallyaccomplished more than most expected a fact that even Democratic Senatestaffers admit privately He has assuaged conservatives by giving up onGortonLieberman In the process he has paved the way for a trial that will belongera month apparentlybut still limited Which is essentially what Lotthas wanted all along            Blocking that limited trial are the UnbowedConservatives  The most vocal member of this species is Oklahomas JamesInhofe Others include Bob Smith New Hampshire Gordon Smith Oregon SamBrownback Kansas and Don Nickles Oklahoma The Unbowed who tend to bequite religious have never lost their outrage about Clintons moral failingsand crimes They sincerely believe he is unfit to hold office and that theConstitution requires a full trialdamage to the Senate and the GOP be damnedThe Unbowed can afford their principles because of their other notable qualityNone faces reelection in   Most also live in states where torturingClinton is a popular spectator sport The party as a whole may suffer from along trial but they wont            The ranks of Unbowed Conservatives would be thickerbut for the Campaigning Conservatives  By temperament and principlethey agree with everything the Unbowed Conservatives say But politicalnecessity beckons All face tough  races in states where Clinton is quitepopular They know that a prolonged cringeinducing Senate trial could bedisastrous for their prospects The Campaigning Conservatives walk a delicateline They want to inflict the maximum possible punishment on Clinton in theminimal possible time Missouris John Ashcroft for example has demandedClintons resignation declared that censure is unconstitutional and insistedthe Senate hold a trial But he also says the trial should be quick and nowitnesses should be called Besides Ashcroft the Campaigning Conservativesinclude Rick Santorum Pennsylvania Rod Grams Minnesota and SpencerAbraham Michigan            Sen Mitch McConnell ofKentucky is an honorary member The extremely conservative McConnell is notrunning for reelection In his heart he undoubtedly favors a full trial ButMcConnell supervises the National Republican Senatorial Committee whichoversees the  Senate elections for the GOP So he too is backing a quickwitnessless trial to protect his candidates            The largest Republican constituency may be theTightLipped Republicans  These folks who include oldtimers such asVirginias John Warner Alaskas Ted Stevens and Mississippis Thad Cochranare as annoyed by the president as the next guy But theyre sick of the wholebusiness want it to end dont want the Senate or the party damaged by it anddont want to talk about it The most prominent of the TightLipped oddly isArizonas John McCain who is never tightlipped McCain who is runningfor president and has his own shaky marital history has assiduously duckedcomment Im about as big a media hound as anyone McCain told one newspaperbut Ive turned down at least maybe  or requests to go on talkshows on this issue The TightLipped Republicans will probably vote forconviction but will also cooperate with any compromise that shortens thetrial            The TightLipped Republicans are not to be confusedwith the Moderates  who may not vote for conviction The mods are JimJeffords Vermont John Chafee Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and SusanCollins of Maine None seems comfortable with the notion of removing Clintonfor sexrelated misdeeds All but Collins are running for reelection in and all represent states where the removal of Clinton is anathema If Lottsprocedural agreement collapses and the Senate faces a long ugly trial theMods are the Republicans most likely to support a Democratic motion toadjourn            Not all Republicanmoderates are Moderates Pennsylvanias Arlen Specter who is often lumped withthe Mods really belongs with the Prosecutors  Led by Specter and MikeDeWine Ohio who are in fact exprosecutors the Prosecutors viewthemselves as the Senates champions of The Law They tend to favor a trialwith as much procedural baggage as can be attached Specter for examplepushed for the House to drop its Flytrap inquiry but once Clinton wasimpeached became an adamant supporter of a trial He even favors havingClinton testify The Prosecutors reject GortonLieberman as a fraud and callcensure unconstitutional They are also alarmingly prone to say things likeIm a stickler for the Constitution            The Democrats  The DisgruntledPragmatists lead the Democrats Chief among them is Joe LiebermanConnecticut The DPs can barely open their mouths without savaging thepresident Lieberman repeats his desire for a stinging censure so often thatI am beginning to think he likes whips But the DPs tend to view Clintonsfailures as moral rather than criminal            The DPs know that a longtrial probably benefits Democrats but they are so sick of Flytrap and soconcerned about the comity of the Senate that they will do almost anything toend this quickly The other salient characteristic of the DisgruntledPragmatists is that they speak out Most Senate Democrats have ducked thespotlight during Flytrap because they dont want to get stuck defending thepresidents loathsome behavior The DPs who have inoculated themselves byattacking the president have filled that void Those who criticize thepresident most are his most effective defenders            The Disgruntled Pragmatists provide cover for two othergroups TightLipped Democrats and Anxious                Democrats Neither group wants to talk about the scandal The TightLipped like theirRepublican counterparts are sick of Flytrap and will do anything to end thetrial with as little damage to the Senate as possible The Anxious facereelection in  Chuck Robb Virginia is the most prominent Robb who hadhis own sex scandal and represents a generally conservative state has made itthrough a year of Flytrap with barely a public utterance When quizzed hispress secretary gave me the most innocuous three sentences I have ever heardRobb it seems will do his duty The TightLipped and Anxious Dems will lettheir colleagues do the work of negotiating a deal and selling it to thepublic keep their mouths shut and vote to acquit            The Partisans seeka Democratic political victory A few Democrats believe that a full trial canserve the nation and the party A trial would prove once and for allhow frivolous the charges against Clinton are and warn any future Congress notto use impeachment as a political weapon Tom Harkin Iowa is the one senatorwho expresses this view publicly saying that Clinton should be exoneratedwith a definitive vote Harkin also acknowledges the political benefit from atrial I think the Republicans are reeling from this he told the New YorkTimes             At the far end of the Democratic caucus from the Partisansare the Institutionalists  Patrick Moynihan New York and Robert ByrdWest Virginia They dont particularly care about saving Clinton or about thehealth of the Democratic party They arent worried about their poll numberssince Moynihan is retiring and Byrd holds a safe seat They are most concernedabout protecting their beloved institutions Moynihan is now pushing censure inorder to protect the presidency as an institution Impeachment coulddestabilize the presidency and degrade the Republic quickly            Byrd who has joined Moynihan in trying to draft acensure resolution has made it his mission to guard the Senates prerogativesHe has warned the White House not to lobby senators for their vote Accordingto Byrd everyonethe White House the media the Houseshould stop jockeyingand let the Senate be the Senate
