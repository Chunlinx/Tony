              okay what kind of foods would you have   okay um well i like to cook um but i dont like getting too awfully fancy about it just because um   oh i do too humum   uh its too much pressure  you know if i have people over for dinner i like it to be nice but relaxed yeah   uhhuh well yeah you cant enjoy it right   and so i dont like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so   thats thats what i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven its  everybody just   yeah exactly   says how wonderful it is and its its like uh yes uh i thats one of those things that i got famous for in college people would come and say could you would you come over and make lasagna for me  its like well i cant really give you a recipe um  i can   uhhuh yeah uhhuh uhhuh you just do it   i can just do it  so its i like doing that kind of stuff and its its fun because in fact thats what we had for a Christmas party last week   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   we just had a bunch of people over and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and ah yummy   um boy i like that   uh i do too in fact   yeah well im planning a and naturally this is appropriate because im planning dinner for um people tomorrow night and the next night hm on Tuesday night therell be eight people here altogether so   oh oh good uh id say one thing weve done have done quite a bit through the holidays just because its a real easy is just baked potato dinners   oh yeah uhhuh   and have you like three or four couples come over and ill do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like   uhhuh   and it turns out great because i mean youve got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff   yeah thats fun uhhuh   but its its inexpensive plus its real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it and you got a great dinner   yeah yeah thats a good idea   its its real easy i like doing that part ah im in favor of very little clean up um very little planning  because weve got three or four  couples that we get together with to play games and   yeah uhhuh uhhuh yeah uhhuh   its we invariably end up at my house since ive got two kids and that its its fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this were done oh its pretty cool   uhhuh yeah yeah thats good well one of my favorites if i dont wanna have other people bring stuff i just wanna treat them is to make chicken and rice its its very easy to   uhhuh oh oh   you dont like it oh you do okay yeah i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken and then you   oh i love it hm   put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then just   oh over the uncooked rice   yeah over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just it fluffs up and its really moist and   oh oh how neat huh now ive done it with where you put you cook the rice well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a bit of white wine in it   umhum uhhuh ooh yeah   and every once in a while ill put in white ill slice white grapes and ill put it in there and thats because im not a real big wine person but i like it it it adds something to the chicken and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice   uhhuh yeah hm well ill keep that one in mind too yeah   yeah  its it that was one of the first things i made for my husband because its like hm yeah i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of   yeah uhhuh yeah you can get away with it and you know in having a semi nice dinner or you know semi formal but   oh yeah but then i didnt i hadnt thought about doing it with uncooked rice so just like in a thirteen by nine pan   yeah yeah you put in um lets see what was it three quarters of cup of rice or   hm hm   it depends on you can really vary it but you have to put the water in proportionally i cant remember i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth   uhhuh huh yeah yeah its i i use that for breakfast for rice and for when i cook pasta or something ill ill put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor   and yeah thats flavor umhum   hm now that would be good how long do you have to bake it   yeah uhhuh um lets see i think it was an hour ive done it in the microwave so often lately because its its really easy  yeah   i do i do microwave too a lot  its   but i think its about an hour or maybe its only half hour hm um   how long would it be in the microwave how long would it be in the microwave   you just until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone you know before it gets overdone   oh okay okay  do you just brown the chicken to get it colored or do you go ahead and let it cook through   yeah yeah um id let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster but   okay hm oh this is a beneficial call i like this  yeah but that ones an easy one its like just put in a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine put in garlic and onion powder   yeah well i liked it your idea too there uhhuh yeah   or chopped onions if you wanna do that you know whatever whatever you however much effort you feel like putting into it but it it makes a great i mean my ive got a two year old and a four year old and they love it   uhhuh uhhuh   and because because my daughter calls it her gravy and i mean she thinks its wonderful im like good youre a picky eater if i can get you to eat
