was firstused at the beginning of the th century  The reasonis obscure but may come from the gypsy wordtano or tawno meaning little as it was a small coincompared with others then in circulation  It mayalso be so called for the same reason it was called aSimon  A legandary joke concerns St Peters bankingtransaction when he lodged with one Simon atanner  Another name for the sixpence was

or just joey had theorigin in another small coin a fourpenny piece orgroat  The latter was issued in  on the advice ofJoseph Hume a Member of Parliament  Humesidea was for a convenient coin to pay for short cabjourneys  The dissatisfied London cabmen did notlike it  Until then they were usually given a sixpencethe nearest single coin to the amount of thefare and few people hiring the cab bothered to askfor the change  When the fourpenny groat was introducedpassengers handed that over and the cabbieswere down twopence on each journey so theynicknamed it Joey and frequently spat on it in disgustbefore pocketing it whenever one was given to themin payment  It was last struck for currency use in  But in  a silver threepence had been reintroducedand after the disappearance of the

     Proverbs those selfcontained nuggets of folkwisdom can be addictive  I know I once hadan aunt who had a saying for every occasion  Shewas a short plump woman with irongray hair in abun and she liked nothing better than putting in hertwo cents worth  She was a dilatory walker withalways the same quip Slow and steady wins therace  Reading that the government was going toraise taxes she thumped the newspaper and intonedYou cant squeeze blood from a turnip  Ifever asked to explain one of her rare periods ofquiet she would reply Still waters run deep            My aunts visits were infrequent during mychildhood and it was only after her husband diedand I was in high school that she began seeing myparents on a regular basis  I tolerated my aunt andher proverbial wisdom until she began applying it toher nephew  Hearing that I regularly went to sleepafter midnight she lectured me Early to bed andearly to rise makes a man healthy wealthy andwise  When I took a trip to Atlantic City and gambledaway the amount I had intended she warnedA fool and his money are soon parted  She evenfound fault with my studious habits All work andno play makes Jack a dull boy            It is hard to counter a proverb they have all theplodding force of a muledriving peasant earthy andinevitable  So when my aunt related gospel likeBlood is thicker than water I could think of noanswer but a sullen nod  That is until one day whenI was helping my mother fix dinner for a family occasionand my aunt came into the kitchen  She askedhow she could help and when I protested that wehad everything under control she placed her handson her hips and told me Many hands make lightwork            Too many cooks spoil the broth I murmuredMy aunt opened her mouth to reply but nothingcame out  It was a momentous occasion  Severalweeks later I was complaining about having to buy anew suit and my aunt happened to be within earshot            Clothes make the man she informed me  Iconsidered her point            You cant judge a book by its cover I repliedSo much for the wisdom of the ages  After thatmy aunt was a lot more careful what she said aroundme like a burnt child that shuns the fire  But eventuallyshe reverted to her old proverbial ways  Onone occasion I had spent half my allowance on anexpensive pair of sneakers and when she told me Ishould have bought a cheaper brand I simply betmoanedmy small stipend and wondered if I wouldever amass any significant sum of money            That was her cue  She wagged her finger at me            Let me tell you something young man  Takecare of the pence and the pounds will take care ofthemselves            Oh  I admit I was semiprepared for this  Ihad checked out a collection of proverbs from thelibrary and was becoming rather wellversed inthem            What about Pennywise poundfoolish            My aunt thought about this for a moment            I think she said finally you are being deliberatelyprovoking            I weighed the justice of this remark but couldnot be bothered to adjust the scales  If my proverbialaunt was going to advise me I was bound todevise some counterstratagem  Luckily the worldof proverbs sayings adages maxims and plain oldsaws is various enough to say anything you wantSince they are meant to cover all of lifes vicissitudesfrom cradle to grave they are bound to collide attimes sometimes obliquely sometimes headon  Ipressed this knowledge to my advantage  My nextopportunity came soon enough  I was complainingthat I could not find a girlfriend  I complained a lotin those days a habit many proverbs warn againstApparently I protested loudly enough for my auntto take note because she tried to console and scoldme in that double tone that proverbs have  She puther hand on my shoulder            Dont fret so much she said  A boys bestfriend is his mother            A boys best friend is his dog I retorted butI cant see myself asking Jessie out on a date canyou

heart grow fonder            I was growing more educated and this timequoted Shakespeare back  Out of sight out ofmind  Unfortunately for my lovelife my proverbturned out to be the right one            My aunt gave an annoyed tsk  I give up onyou she said and left the room            Of course she never quite conceded defeathope springs eternal in the human breast  She continuedto quote at me and I requoted back  But asshe got older her steeltrap memory turned into asteel sieve and she became almost touchingly uncertainof her words  I recall to my credit that whenshe was despairing of ever doing anything more withher life and muttered You cant teach an old dognew tricks I cheered her up by flatly opposing herIts never too late to learn  She died in her eightythirdyear and though only her name and datesadorn her headstone I often think of inscribing anaddendum A little advice goes a long way            My aunt did not leave behind much in the wayof possessions  What I am left with is a list

theWall Street Journal    Submitted by                              Thunderboxes and Chuggies            In semantic terms the words in the above titlebelong to a specific domain in the English vocabularywith which every member of the human raceachieves intimate familiarity  The naked terms forsuch a traditionally taboo subject as the toilethave always proved too much to bear for polite societywhich hastily covered the barecheeked shameof them with a blanket of euphemism  The domain isa prolific nursery of such linguistic figleaves and asa result contrary thing that human nature is hasalso fostered many ribald versions  It is not surprisingtherefore that there is an almost inexhaustiblesupply of paraphrases and synonymous terms in thisfield ranging from the most tasteful euphemism tothe most flagrant vulgarity  While most of thesebear testament to the wonderful versatility of theEnglish language and the rich vein of humor thatruns through our culture some necessitate etymologicalinvestigation in order to uncover their rootsand in some cases to explore changes in meaningMost indeed defy precision in the attempt altogether            Six hundred years ago toilet designs thoughcrude were what we might term today latrines theMiddle English word was laterin from Latin latrinaplanks of wood with circles cut into them placedover a ditch  Conveniences for the wealthier sectionsof the community ie those who could affordhighrise property consisted of straightdrop orlongdrop privies  The word privy is one of the earliesteuphemisms used in England an anonymouswriter at the turn of the fifteenth century advisedwhanne he sitteth at privy he schal not streynehimsilf to harde  It is derived from the Frenchword priv and the Latin privatus  both meaningprivate and this is the specific sense in which theword entered the English language  The earliest euphemismsdocumented use of the word in this originalsense of intimacy or familiarity between peopledates from  and privy council a small group ofadvisers to the monarch from  when Edward Iestablished it  It is not surprising semanticallyspeaking that the word widened its meaning soquickly since it naturally lent itself as did closet  tothe description of a solitary place one where peopleperformed lavatorial functions                           Privy and closet are examples of euphemism bymetonymy which is the substitution of the name ofan attribute of a thing for the thing itself a toilet is aprivate place therefore a privy  Similarly Bombayfurniture a style combining European forms with Indianornamentation provided the metonymic euphemismThe Bombay the Oxford English Dictionarytells us that the name is possibly attributable to theBombay chair  wherein chamberpots were placed asit was common in the past to have ones chamberpotconcealed in a piece of furniture which could thenbe proudly displayed  The name closestool  whichmakes an appearance in Shakespeares Alls Well ThatEnds Well of  and John Florios Montaigne of was also inspired by the furniture in which itwas cased as was commode             If one is to go by Florios use of closestool itseems interchangeable with another less notoriousterm for a privy the ajax  In the sixteenth centuryan Elizabethan courtier Sir John Harrington inventeda watercloset with a flushing system andwrote a book on the subject entitled A Metamorphosisof Ajax published in   The word howeverseems to have existed before that as Shakespeareuses it also in close conjunction with closestool inLoves Labours Lost  c  and it achieved an entryin Cotgraves Dictionarie of the French and EnglishTongues of   Its exact origin is unascertainedbut it is likely to have been a variant of jakeswith the indefinite article preceding it  Jakes isalso of unknown origin the most common suggestionfor its roots is in the proper name Jacques orJack  which is not unbelievable when we considerother examples such as jerry and john   Shakespeareuses jakes confidently in King Lear c My lord if you will give me leave I will treadthis unbolted villain into mortar and daub thewall of a jakes with him                        Eric Partridge in A Dictionary of Slang and UnconventionalEnglish suggested that the word datesfrom  and was standard English until about when it became a colloquial term  The wordwas also very much alive in the late nineteenth andearly twentieth centuries in the dialect of southwesternEngland where it had come to mean any type offilth or litter according to Elworthys A West SomersetWordBook  Patridge also says that the term isnow obsolete but to this day the blocks of toilets atmy old school St Edmunds College in Hertfordshireare affectionately known as Jakes Tower            The origin of jerry  like so many of these termscan only be guessed at  It is slang for chamberpotand like jakes  could be the familiar variant of aproper name  Jeremiah or Jeremy   It is supposedhowever that it is an

forming diminutivesJerry first appeared in Hottens Dictionary of Slangin  defined as a chamber utensil  In An EtymologicalDictionary of Modern English ErnestWeekly suggested an even earlier association withthe word jordan a medieval alchemists vessel andlater a chamberpot  All these are feasible surmisesby the process of metonymy  Perhaps it hails from ashortening of jerryshop c  a term used todescribe a low beerhouse  As the chamberpot is agreat friend to those with bibulous tendencies jerrymight have become a petname for it            The etymology of the word loo is perhaps thegreatest mystery of all in this field of vocabularyThe word first gained general usage in Britain duringWorld War II and possibly came about as a resultof fraternizing with French troops perhaps as acorruption of leau water or lieux daisance Waterclosetor even as a derivation of the cry  Garde leau  given to warn passerby that someone abovewas about to slop out the anglicised form gardyloo

acceptedidiom of the day indeed children used tohave fun replacing the last zero with a one after theprivy had been used  The number  is not dissimilarin appearance to the word loo  and there wereplenty of servicemen from the USA and England inItaly from  onwards            Among the more incredible explanations as recordedby Adrian Room A Dictionary of True Etymologiesare a derivation

meaning of lavatory was simplya vessel for washing in his  translation of theBible John Wycliffe talks of washing feet in abrasun lavatorie Exodus xxx  Similarly to performones toilet in  was the action or processof dressing or of washing and grooming OED An unclear sensedevelopment of this word ismapped out in the OED  but it seems to concedethat the modern sense of lavatory originated at thestart of this century the British Army and NavyStores catalogue of  lists a lavatory paperholderas one of its items but it was probably earlier TheIllustrated London News reported in  that eachward

ofthe genre  Thus Spooner himself is supposed tohave referred to Cambridge as a muddy bleakplace  When the first motorized vehicles appearedon the roads he opined that Automobiles are allvery well but

The appearance of a fourth edition of this dictionaryDOSAE within thirteen years of the first isan indication of its popularity as well as of its scholarlysignificance  The current edition was partlymotivated by the recent political changes in SouthAfrica which resulted in the unbanning of organizationsindividuals and books  For the lexicographerthis opened up the possibility of new words egthe last apartheid ruler PW Botha had officiallyoutlawed the regime and white minority rule andmore important of new citations            Of all the countries in which English is a significantfirst language South Africa is perhaps the mostcomplex socially and linguistically  While English iscurrently the most important language it is the firstlanguage of only a small proportion of speakers accordingto official estimates for  Englishwith two million firstlanguage speakers is well behindZulu Xhosa Afrikaans Tswana and NorthSotho  Furthermore English is not the only coloniallanguage of the territory for since  theruling Afrikaner nationalists have promoted Afrikaansas an essential language for advancement inthe public service  Finally segregational laws in thecountry have tended to polarize the dialects of Englishalong partially ethnic lines  Lexically speakingthis has tended to produce fragments of South AfricanEnglish rather than a general roughly homogeneousvariety            Such a multilingual environmentand the pictureis made still more complex by other immigrantlanguages like Malay no longer spoken Indian languageseg Hindi and Tamil as well as indigenouslanguages of the Khoi and San families now extinctin South Africamakes the lexicographers task atonce difficult and stimulating  The DOSAE is insome respects a reflection of the contact history ofSouth Africa played out in terms of the English lexiconIn its pages can be found linguistic traces of theformer rivalry between Boer and Briton the namingpractices of the Khoi and San Hottentot and Bushmanin former terms racial conflict derogatoryterms like Boer Kaffir and Hottentot each havemore than a page devoted to them the politicaldiscourse of the apartheid regime and the counterdiscourseof the resistance movements  The morepositive side of language and culture contact doesshow up however in the numerous terms for foodand drink entertainment the landscape terms ofendearment forms of address and words of approvalIt is also through this and earlier editions ofthe DOSAE that one learned to ones surprise ofthe South African provenance of words like offloadunload bottle store liquor store butcherybutchers shop and bond mortagage bond            According to the Branfords own calculationsmade in  the source languages for items in theDOSAE were  per cent DutchAfrikaans  percent English ie neologisms  per cent Bantulanguages and  per cent other  The high proportionof Afrikaans words has frequently been singledout for comment by critics  Some of the itemsin this category are words of long standing since theintroduction of English in the Cape in the late eighteenthcentury that have often passed into internationalEnglish trek veld laager etc  Other uncontroversialAfrikaans items include political andculinary terms widely used in South Africa egapartheid and biltong strips of sundried lean meatThe majority of Afrikaans items however are thosewhich appear in written English sources but rarelyin colloquial South African English even as spokenby Afrikaners  The authors themselves mentionthat some Afrikaans critics of earlier editions of thistext felt that many entries were not really South AfricanEnglish  They responded by reducing thenumber of such entries and by marking others asborderline cases            There is certainly a need for words of Afrikaansorigin that recur in English texts often for localcolor effect to be glossed somewhere a referencework like the DOSAE might be more convenient forreaders than an Afrikaans or Xhosa or some otherdictionary  Likewise it might be necessary for novicesto gloss nonEnglish words that recur in bilingualroad signs and other public notices apteekchemist links left and the now obsolete blankeswhites only might be truly informative for theoverseas visitor  To be consistent the DOSAEwould have to indicate the word for left in all languagesthat appear in road signs in different parts ofthe countryZulu Xhosa Sotho and Tswana            In their entry for slegs only the authors quotean amusing anecdote in this regardSlegs Only A visitors guide to S African EnglishWhat are slegs  a puzzled visitor from overseasasked me  He had been driving along in a hiredcar and had suddenly found himself entering alane marked SLEGS ONLY  But how is a visitorexpected to know that  he demanded after Ihad explained its meaning that it was a bilingualsign  With the population divided into WhitesColoureds and Blacks how am I to know thatSlegs isnt another race group                                       Slegs is one of the relatively few items marked in theDOSAE as Afrikaans rather than English  I wouldargue that this particular signpost does not occurfrequently enough in the book  For example as thismarking is absent in the entry tweetalig bilingualwe must infer that the authors now consider this tobe an English item  Yet the citations they give afforda clue to the real status of this and numerousother items in DOSAE  This wall chart attractive and tweetalig nogal bilingual whats more isto be distributed to all hospitals  and  Fouryears in the charge office as a fraud detective  Thatwas where I learned to speak Afrikaans She is heeltemaltweetalig totally bilingual and  studiedart in Scotland            Surely we are dealing with codeswitching herethe use of words and phrases from two languageswithin the same speech event for stylistic effectwith an audience that is capable of appreciating theplay on words  Many of the Afrikaans words inDOSAE are similarly illustrated from examples involvingbilingual word play by creative writers  Theproblem for the lexicographer is that codeswitchingis openended almost any word or phrase from theone language can be interpolated into discoursefrom the other  It is also in practice difficult to decidebetween the process of borrowing which dictionariesmust concern themselves with and codeswitchingThis is not a problem peculiar to DOSAE rather it is one of the strongest challenges facinglexicographers of a vast number of languages in thetwentyfirst century as English continues to spreadinfluence and be influenced by languages all overthe world in situations of intimate language contact            On the whole I recommend DOSAE highly foranyone wishing to get to grips with English in SouthAfrica  Visitors as well as locals who are faced with abarrage of acronyms in everyday usage will findmany of them glossed in these pages  DOSAE showsattention to detail provides extensive definitionswith detailed cross references has

and badones  It often astonishes me that publishersatwhose door such shortcomings must be laidcanput out books that contain a huge amount of valuableinformation then effectively deny access to it byproviding in the worst case no index at all and inmany instances an improverished index  As one whohas prepared indexes of great variety I recognizethe many problems that one can encounter stillthese are not insurmountable and there is no excusefor producing a work of some complexity withoutaccompanying it by a thorough index  The importantthing is the notion of thoroughness the indexermust try to anticipate and provide for a variety ofusers needs in an index users do not seek the samesort of information and the effort must be made toimagine the uses to which a particular work will beput then to provide the users with as many accesspoints to the information as can reasonably be expectedOn more than one occasion in these pageshave I lamented the absence of an index or of auseful usable one in a book that contains much valuableinformation            Probably the greatest offenders were those whoproduced the earlier manuals accompanying computersand software many of us had the experienceof reading through a manual the first time only tofind later on seeking the format of a certain commandthat there was no index that the index hadnot been updated to conform to the latest looseleafversion of the text or that the item sought was notlisted the only solution was to go through the entiretext laboriously turning each page to find the lostinformation  Todays manuals are much improvedbut they still rely on the users knowledge of thejargon of the computer trade and much frustratingtime is still spent trying to find a given bit of informationwhile trying to imagine what a computerprogrammer would be likely to have called it becausehe was unfamiliar with the jargon of writingediting styling composition or the other arts andcrafts associated with publishing            I have had considerable experience in preparingindexessome simple and straightforward somehighly detailed and sophisticatedfor a wide varietyof books  As I have dealt mainly with texts thatwere in machinereadable form I have been able todevelop techniques for extracting an index from atext especially if the text is consistently styled typographicallyIn other words if information type Ais consistently set in italics type B in boldfaceitalics type C in small capitals and type D inboldface roman if type E always appears in singlequotation marks and so forth one can use this informationto extract discrete categories of data for avariety of purposes            Not all text is so highly stylized and the presentwork deals with biographies autobiographies andfiction which offer little opportunity for automaticextraction because the subjects suitable for indexingare often paraphrases of the words used in the textMrs Bell cites this example from Elizabeth Longfordsbiography Byron HutchinsonWeidenfeld Nicholson Byron George Gordon th Lord hiscourtship and marriage Byron Annabella ne Millbanke wife of B vicissitudes of her marriage                         Mrs Bell comments that the term vicissitudesdoes not occur in the text and I daresay courtshipand marriage do not occur as chapter headingseither            This booklet contains many fascinating insights intothe art of indexing including for example the observation while authors can be subtle and discreet intheir writing indexers have to condense their implicationsto a blunt labelHOMOSEXUAL TENDENCIESfor instance we cannot hint in indexesp                         As this is a rather specialized work we cannotdevote the space to the full description that it meritsamong those who pursue its concerns  Those whoare

 because so much has happened toEnglish since then it is fitting that its history be updatednot only to reflect more recent developmentsin dialect lexicon grammatical theory and the universaladoption of the language as a lingua francabut also to revise scholarship in the light of laterresearch that either elaborates or confutes informationthat is now more than half a century old  AlthoughI was

that can be doneand gives the pronunciation as doouhbl  Thesame definition and pronunciation are given in WebstersNew World and in the recent edition of theConcise Oxford   I then went to my rd edition of theConcise Oxford  it does not give the wordwhich caused me to think that it probably is a recentlyfabricated one and that I should not worryabout it  Surely I thought the OED Supplement willhave something on it  Nothing  So to my magnifyingglassedition of the unsupplemented one  It haddoable  with the same definition and pronunciationgiven in those other dictionaries with this additionaldefinition practicable  It also gives a second definitionCapable of being done or victimized  Theearliest instance of its use given is A law  whichis doablefrom             All this sent me into intense research into theword do   Dr Basil Cottle a scholar at the Universityof Bristol in his useful little book The Plight of English devotes nearly four pages to it describing it atthe beginning as a deplorable little syllable  Theemphatic use of do has long been used in our languageSamuel Johnson deplored the superfluousemphatic use of do  as in I do love heconsidered it vitious  We all use the emphatic do and that is not always undesirable I do believe  I do so want to see her Do have a drink  TheGage Canadian gives  distinct definitions for doalong with  common idiomatic phrases using itThe abridged edition of Eric Partridges A Dictionaryof Historical Slang gives more than five columnsto idioms beginning with do  from do a beer to doyou see the green in my eye                        Then there is How do you do which actuallyis not a question but a genteel response betweenpersons who have just been introduced to one anotherQuite different from it is How are you doingalthough the grammatical difference seems slightDo is a remarkably versatile verb  You can do yourwashing  Or the Rocky Mountains  Or your incometax  Or your thing            And there is the simple interrogatory do Doyou see what I mean  Do you have the time  Thatapparently is North American the Brits one of themtold me say Have you the time                            I lisped in numbers             A recent news item in The Times November published in the international press presumablyto call delighted attention to the obtuseness ofthe chief of police of Dearborn Michigan concernedan officer who was suspended for three daysto seek psychiatric help in disabusing himself ofhis obsession for writing the figure  with a barthrough it to distinguish it from the figure  a disambiguatingpractice long followed in Europe whereit is the practice to write  to look like the lefthalf of an upwardpointing arrow  The incident remindsme that for some time I have intended to commenton the way numerals are said in the UK and inthe US though I am not entirely sure whether thesubject is properly linguistic cultural or categorizableinto some other area of behavior  In any eventI cannot recall ever having seen any comment on itbut then I do not read books on the teaching ofEnglish as a second language            In Britain when a numeral is repeated in say atelephone creditcard house or other number theword double is used to describe it thus for instancethe VERBATIM telephone in Aylesbury  would be uttered as three nine five doubleeightoh or zero but oh is more common  Ifthere are three identical numerals in a row as in  they would be read as two six sevenfour doublefour four sevens in a row would bedoubleseven doubleseven  Occasionally I haveheard a string like  expressed as treblesixtreblesix but doublesix doublesix doublesixis probably more frequent and six doublesix sixdoublesix can be heard  A recent radio advertisementcontained the number   read as eightdoubleeight seven doubleseven  The exceptionthat I have noted is in the naming of  freenumbers where the practice in Britain follows thatin America oh eight hundred            This style takes a little gettingusedto I findthat when I say out of habit three nine five doubleeightoh to Americans they hesitate ever soslightly before fully understanding  Gone are thedays when one picked up the old upright phone wasgreeted by an operator and told herit was alwaysherthe number one wanted with that antediluvianroutine went such memorable tunes as HelloCentral  Give me haven for my mothers thereOne might also observe that despite inflationother American telephonic archaisms persist in theculture like I put a nickel in the telephone to dialmy babys number Its your nickel etc            Readers outside North America may not beaware that American telephone dials now pads  stillretain alphabetical sequences from the days whenlocal telephone numbers contained names likePEnnsylvania Six Five Thousand and BUtterfield usually so written everyone knew that the firsttwo letters of the name were to be dialedPE BU   In its infinite wisdom the telephonecompanies long ago abandoned words for numbershaving perceived that there were some numbercombinations like  could not be readily yieldedby familiar names  The letters were however retainedon the instruments and North American telephonesgroup them this way wisely there is no Q                                       ABC  DEF  GHI  JKL  MNO  PRS  TUV  WXY  Z                        Also in those days the zero could not occur amongthe first three digits and today in North America itcannot be the first digit in contrast to Britain whereall dialling codes US area codes  begin with a zeroas I believe do all international codes universallyIn my memory European telephones have neverhad letters but I am sure that I will be quickly correctedby readers if I am wrong            There must have been confusionperhaps itpersistsabout the alphabetic O oh and the numerical zero for the telephone companies oftenmade a special point of emphasizing which wasmeant I assume that they have statistics on the numberof wrong numbers dialed when one was substitutedfor the other  But in these days of alldigittelephone numbers the tendency particularlyamong younger people who seem to get confusedabout such things is to make certain that the wordzero is used rather than oh  I admit that zerodoes remove any ambiguity in North America butwithout letters on telephones how could it arise inEurope            Ever resourceful Americans quickly recognizedthat they could use part or all of their telephoneletters as a mnemonic  For example a dealer in stolenautomobiles with the telephone number could tell customers to dial HOT CARS a psychiatricclinic with the number  could tellpatients to phone  R U NUTS or U R NUTS dialPLUMBER  if you have a leak COLLEGE to register for extention coursesPASSION  to satisfy cravings KWIKFIT but not ZIPPER because a numbercannot start with a Z or zero for emergencytailoring services etc  Indeed Omnigraphics acompany in Detroit has published a fat bookPhonames that lists all the possible fourletter combinationsin numerical order and for those whomight persuade their local telephone company tochange their number to coincide with a desiredword or command alphabetically as well  I understandthat the US Coast Guard emergency numberwas to have been changed to  SINKINGbut it was decided that it might be too late by thetime the call went through  In an earlier issue ofVERBATIM writers have commented on what havecome to be called bacronyms names of companiesproducts charities and other institutions thathave been chosen solely because their acronymsyield words that are pronounceable meaningful orboth  Here we have the numerical equivalent            It will be noted that the grouping of the numbersdiffers from country to country the US retainsxxxxxxx presumably as a hangover from the olddays of telephone namecalling in Britain theolder fivedigit and the newer sixdigit numbersare written solid xxxxxx on the Continent sixdigitnumbers are written in sets of two xxxxxxNewer sevendigit numbers in Britain are writtenxxxxxxx as in the US  Which of these patterns hasa better mnemonic advantage it is hard to say  Doesanyone use xxxxxx            The literalminded among us have fastened onthe inaccuracy of the retained word dial for whatmany now have on telephones  The noun presentsno real problem for the term number pad alreadyexists to describe the calculatorlike array  But padproves unsatisfactory as a verb  Press seems to havebeen pressed into service but I put a quarter  ortenpence or ten pee in the telephone to pressmy babys number just does

inveighed against the ending of asentence with a preposition and I have includedmention of it now and then in my writing  The interdictionis meaningless for English grammar orstyle having been carried over from Latin where apreposition must accompany the word it is connectedwith syntactically and semantically like thecaveat concerning split infinitives which cannot besplit in Latin because as in most other IndoEuropeanlanguages they are single words unsplittablenuclei unlike the atom            A few months ago a colleague wrote saying thathe had encountered my mention of it but had beenunable to find any reference in Drydens writingsAt the time I did not reply because I did not havethe time to search for it  Now that I have found it Icannot remember who queried me about it but Imight as well present the information once and forall in these pages in case anyone else wishes toknow  The source is The Defence of the Epilogueor An Essay on the Dramatic Poetry of the LastAge

Everymans LibraryJM Dent   p                         The quotations are from Catiline by Ben Johnsonwhom Dryden held in very high regard a most judiciouswriter  Dryden if not a purist was certainlya traditionalist and a precisian in languageTo begin with Language  That an alteration islately made in ours or since the writers of thelast age in which I comprehend ShakespeareFletcher and Jonson is manifest  Any man whoreads those excellent poets and compares theirlanguage with what is now written will see it inalmost every line but that this is an improvementof the language or an alteration for the betterwill not so easily be granted  For many are of acountrary opinion that the English tongue wasthen in the height of its perfection that from Jonsonstime to ours it has been in a continual declinationlike that of the Romans from the age ofVirgil to Statius but Quintilian himself so muchcomplains under the person of Secundus in hisfamous dialogue de Causis corruptae EloquentiaeBut to show that our language is improvedand that those people have not a just value forthe age in which they live let us consider in whatthe refinement of a language principally consiststhat is either in rejecting such old words orphrases which are ill sounding or improper or inadmitting new which are more proper moresounding and more significantThe reader will easily take notice that when Ispeak of rejecting improper words and phrases Imention not such as are antiquated by customonly and as I may say without any fault oftheirs  For in this case the refinement can be butaccidental that is when the words and phraseswhich are rejected happen to be improper  Neitherwould I be understood when I speak of improprietyof language either wholly to accuse thelast age or to excuse the present and least of allmyself  Ibid p  Italics not mine                        It is interesting to observe that Dryden born onlyfifteen years after the death of Shakespeare should amere forty years later regard him as being of anotherage clearly three centuries ago people had quite aperception of time different from our own largely Ibelieve brought about by our more thorough documentationof the past hundred years in books newspapersand other periodicals photographs filmsand more recently videos            He comments on the errors in the writings ofthe great masters that are cited today either in aderisory tone or as an excuse for our own shortcomingsAll writers have their imperfections and failingsbut I may safely conclude in the generalthat our improprieties are less frequent and lessgross than theirs  Malice and partiality setapart let any man who understands English readdiligently the works of Shakespeare and Fletcherand I dare undertake that he will find in everypage either some solecism of speech or some notoriousflaw in sense and yet these men are reverencedwhen we are not forgivenIbid p                         Lest the reader think of Dryden as a stuffy puristhere he is on neologismsAs for the other part of refining which consistsin receiving new words and pharases I shall notinsist much on it  It is obvious that we have admittedmany some of which we wanted andtherefore our language is the richer for them asit would be by importation of bullion other arerather ornamental than necessary yet by theiradmission the language is become more courtlyand our thoughts are better dressed  These are tobe found scattered in the writers of our age andit is not my business to collect them  They whohave lately written with most care have I believetaken the rule of Horace for their guidethat is not to be too hasty in receiving of wordsbut rather to stay till custom has made them familiarto usMulta renascentur quae nunc ceciderecadentqueQuae nunc sunt honore in vocabula si voletususQuam penes arbitrium est et jus et normaloquendiArs Poetica Many words which have now fallen out ofuse will be reborn and many now prominentwill disappear if usage which owns the rightto

an improvement of it a turning Englishinto French rather than a refining of Englishby FrenchIbid p f                        The thcentury sense of sophistication wascloser to smacking of sophistry                              DescriptionProscriptionStyle            As we have observed in these pages on numerousoccasions the professional linguists avowed positionwith regard to usage is similar to that of amedical doctors in relation to a patient both arecharged with the responsibility of observing thephenomena they encounter without expressing qualitativeopinions about them  That is the doctor isnot supposed to express his loathing or disgust at themanifestations of some horrible affliction nor is itdeemed proper for him to assume an accusatory posturereflected in expressions like What a fool youare for having exposed yourself to the Malay wasteaway            The analogy is not entirely apt however for thepatient cannot always be held responsible for catchingthe disease and might not be able to do anythingabout its cure while the person who misspells aword utters grammatical solecisms or uses infer forimply has resourse to remedial measures  In manycases it must be acknowledged the speaker orwriter has not been exposed to the opportunitiesthat would enable him to distinguish between whatis regarded as standard usage versus nonstandardhence it might be said that he is not responsible forusing nonstandard English  But surely someonemust accept the blame and that someone ought tobe the person who employed what we have learnedfrom innumerable cop shows on television to call theperp                        The cable television service in the Old LymeConnecticut area is apparently forbidden to transmitcertain programs because the transmission rightshave been preempted by another station  In suchcircumstances a message appears on the screen thatexplains in quasilegalistic terms why the viewer islooking at the message instead of the programAmong the words used is pursuant  which is spelledpersuant  This message has been appearing onthe screen with that misspelling for the past twoyears or more and the cable company maintainsthat the card bearing the message is provided tothem with the proviso that it be transmitted as isBecause the notice appears almost every evening onat least one channel and remains on the screen for atleast thrity minutes on end its exposure is fargreater than that of a fleeting utterance by a newscasteror a similar written message that appears onlyfleetingly  One cannot help thinking that an entiregeneration of viewersassuming they are able toread at allis growing up learning how to misspellpursuant  Pursuant is a legal term of course not onethat drops readily from the lips of the housewife orcasual observer of the rock n roll scene on MTVThus with some justification one might well askWho cares  And there are always those who willaccuse me of being a purist which I do not think Iam  On the other hand I try not to be a linguisticslob either            If one asks a professional linguist why he doesntsay things like He dont or spell pursuant persuantthe reply is likely to be  He dont is notpart of my speech pattern and I simply do notspell pursuant that way  One may accept that sortof statement at face value in my view it would havebeen more accurate and honest to say I wouldntbe caught dead saying He dont  etc            Last evening  November I was watching Biographyon the Arts  Entertainment network  Inthe course of the program which was about the Britishroyal family there appeared on the screen anumber of titles identifying the person or place picturedIn one such title Prince Andrews fatherinlawwas identified as Furguson in anotherthe site of Prince Charless wedding wasidentified as St Pauls  sic  Carhederal  sic   Asidefrom the fact that the program was rather poorlydone how are we to react to this sort of thingShould we throw up our hands saying Anyone canmake a mistake or What difference does itmake  or You are the one to talk look at allthe mistakes in VERBATIM  As for the last I wouldprotest that the AE network has resources far beyondthose available for the proofreading of VERBATIMThe first is merely a vapid truism  But whatabout the second            I am moved to offer some armchair psychologicalanalysis  For many people their ability to relateto reality is inexorably tied to their control of languagethe greatest common denominator of our understandingof the real world  Berkeleian philosophersneed not waste their time writing me on thissubject  For such people we might say that theirvery grip on reality depends on their control of languageit is their security blanket the corners ofwhich they chew with everlasting selfsatisfactionand in which they wind themselves for protectionagainst the hostile forces that would shake the foundationsof their traditionalism  If their language isthreatened they are threatened  Put another waythe acceptance of nonstandard language to replacethe comfortable protection offered by linguistic purismamounts to moving the goalposts in a game thatthey have been playing for their entire lives accordingto a different set of rules            As readers of these occasional notes on Englishare well aware British standard usage now condonesthe use of the indicative where the subjunctive formerlyreigned and to mention just one other obviousphenomenon the use of the plural pronouns ofreference for what have traditionally been regardedas singular referents as in Everyone should bringtheir book to class tomorrow   The two changes aredifferent of course the former marks a final succumbingto the relentless forces of the indicativethe weakening of the subjunctive might be regardedas a rejection of the tolerance of uncertainty on thepart of the speaker perhaps a product of the latethcenturyobsession with the facts resulting in insecuritywhen faced with doubt with low probabilityor with contrarytofact situations  The issue of pronounagreement might be laid at the door of thefeminists misguided interference with the forces oflanguage resulting in a nervous rejection of themasculine pronoun as the neutral one but in truththe sustenance of the singular nature of words likeeach everybody everyone etc is probably pedantryfor sense and logic are not sacrificed bychanging them to plurals with the added benefit ofavoiding the dreaded hehishim regarded by feministsas the bearer of the stigma of male machismoIn many cases the paraphrase All students shouldbring their books to class tomorrow  and similar pluralizationswill conveniently turn the trick withoutdistorting the meaning            One is led to considering the establishment of ahierarchy of the heinousness  For instance I have a verylow tolerance for spelling errors and grammatical solecismsin letters of application from those solicitingwork job applicants who are too careless to correctthe capitalization of california and the spellingBritian get short shrift though I am more tolerantof those using presently for now   A great deal can bedetermined from a personal interviewsomewhatmore complicated with an applicant a thousandmiles awaybut dialect differences must be accountedfor too  For instance the British use theword machismo but pronounce it almost invariablyas if it were a loanword from Italian with a  k wherethe Spanish has a  tch   Yet macho is utteredwith a  tch  possibly to distinguish it from one of thepronunciations of the word for a variety of sharkThe OEDe is not tuned in to this pronunciation ofmachismo  showing only the  tch  pronunciation theLongman and the newer Oxford Concise show bothbut with  tch  first only the Collins  of those Britishdictionaries I checked shows the  k  pronunciationas prevalent  One professional British lexicographertold me categorically that no one uses the  tch  pronunciationin Britain where it would be regarded aswrong or pedantic  If he is
