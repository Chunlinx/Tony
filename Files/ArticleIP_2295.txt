                                 Blacks Only            The debate about affirmativeaction is usually cast as a fight between conservatives who wish to abolish thepolicy and liberals who want to keep it That is a misunderstanding Theargument is actually between conservatives who want to remodel affirmativeaction and liberals who want to conceal it            Eventhose conservatives deemed the most extreme on issues of race like CharlesMurray and Dinesh DSouza do not favor doing away with affirmative actionRather they propose to base it on the principle of economic disadvantageThis they contend would bring similar results in terms of diversity withoutthe evident unfairness Critics also sometimes argue that racebasedaffirmative action would be fine if it were limited to efforts at recruitmentand training They generally agree that affirmative action is acceptable as aremedy for specific acts of past discrimination Many who think thataffirmative action shouldnt be required by law favor it as a voluntary policyAnd of course most opponents of affirmative action practice it themselvesBlack opponents of affirmative action for example are heavily favored overwhites with similar views in getting promoted by the conservative propagandamachine            If group preferences are wrong in principle as theseopponents maintain none of their exceptions makes much sense Consider theremedy for past discrimination dodge Say youre a highly qualified white mandenied a job by the Birmingham Fire Department Are you supposed to feel betterif you got turned down because the department once discriminated againstblacks You yourself never practiced discrimination The classnotracealternative is even less of an improvement It actually heightens the injusticeof affirmative action by punishing some people for a historical wrong that theynot only didnt participate in but that also never occurred America is asfamous for economic opportunity and class mobility as it is for its legacy ofracial oppression Classbased affirmative action trades in a vexed solution toa real problem for an even more vexed solution to an illusory problem            Liberalson the other hand spend less time defending affirmative action than they dotrying to make it innocuous and invisible The Clinton administration clings tothe evasion enshrined by Justice Lewis Powell in the Bakke case Rigidnumerical quotas are unfair and discriminatory while flexible goals are notRace should be a factor but it must not be the factor Whats the realdifference In either case members of a protected group win jobs promotionsand educational slots that would otherwise go to betterqualified white menThis is colorblindness of a sort No one can identify specific victims orbeneficiaries of factorstyle affirmative action even though both wouldexist as surely as they do under a policy of explicit quotas            Other liberals propose more euphemism as asolution In a recent issue of the New York Review of Books  GeorgeFredrickson recommends that supporters of affirmative action avoid the wordsracial preferences and reverse discrimination in favor of the termequality of opportunity This is like Gerald Fords attempt to fightinflation by banning it from his vocabulary            Clintonsays he wants to mend affirmative action Opponents it turns out say thesame thing So behind the vicious argument is actually something like sharedunderstanding that affirmative action is a toxic medicine sometimes necessarythat weve been using too freely The dosage needs to be scaled back But howHeres my proposal            Any kind of affirmative action means preferring some peopleover others for reasons having nothing to do with their intrinsicmerithowever merit is measured That is not something that the state or anyprivate institution should take on lightly But it remains justified in onecasethat of AfricanAmericans The wrong done to slaves and their descendentsis unique in American history Slavery racism and segregation have left ablack social deficit that is damaging not just to blacks but also to Americansociety as a whole Were this problem evaporating on its own affirmativeaction would not be necessary The condition of blacks is improving but thereis strong evidencesee for example Orlando Pattersons new book TheOrdeal of Integration that affirmative action has played an essential rolein fostering both integration and the growth of the black middle class Ifaffirmative action needs to be reformed the way to fix it is to narrow it tocover blacks only            This wasthe original idea of affirmative action John F Kennedys  executiveorder which first created preferences in federal contracting applied only toblacks So did Lyndon B Johnsons betterknown  order The justificationwas spelled out in Johnsons Howard University speech of that year written byone Daniel Patrick Moynihan You do not take a person who for years has beenhobbled by chains and liberate him bring him to the starting line of a raceand then say You are free to compete with all the others and still justlybelieve that you have been completely fair Johnson said In later yearshowever the concept was stretched to cover other minorities and women whowere less hobbled at the starting line The greatest expansion was underRichard Nixon who it has been suggested saw affirmative action as a Trojanhorse to slaughter Democrats Yet Democrats continued to push to qualify newgroups for government setaside contracts and other forms of preference            Expansion of affirmative action was aninstinctual response of liberalism and not in the crude talkradio sense thatliberals love big government The New Deal political model for socialprograms was to include the semideserving and undeserving along with the trulydeserving A broad base of beneficiaries meant a broad base of politicalsupport Clinton has responded to opposition to affirmative action in exactlythis way His mend it dont end it speech of July  emphasized thataffirmative action helped womenhalf the voting population He even listedgender before race in defining the policy Though this approach didnt stopProposition  in California it has become policy The administrationsexplicit strategy for saving affirmative action is to rally women in itsdefense Thus new Small Business Administration regulations intended to make iteasier for white women to compete for loans            There isto be sure a long history of discrimination against women Hispanics Chineseand so on But the mistreatment of all groups other than blacks was far lesssevere and it has proven far more amenable to cure without radicalintervention Hispanics Asians even African and Caribbean blacks are by andlarge following the classic patterns of immigrant and ethnic assimilation Forvarious reasons blacks are not            In their abstract mode conservatives argue that any groupbias is unfair Why should whites who did not themselves discriminate againstblacks be punished for what their or someone elses ancestors did The answeris that it shouldnt be thought of as punishment Whites who never practiceddiscrimination are nonetheless beneficiaries of it            As athoughtexperiment consider what it might mean to a white victim of reversediscrimination if blacks had always been equal Imagine a law school class with places Under affirmative action a white applicant who ranks th might well be denied admission while a black who ranks th would get in But where would those two applicants have rankedif blacks had not been enslaved and discriminated against Under theovermechanical assumptions of affirmativeaction opponents themselves andputting aside the racial IQ theories of Murray and some others blacks wouldmove up the list and whites would move down            Blacks are  percent of the population Thatdoesnt necessarily mean that in a world with no racial discrimination presentor past  of the top  candidates would be black But the number would becloser to  than to the likely two or three in todays world And in thatcase the white candidate at  th place today wouldnt get inanyway            In other words if our goalis to replicate a colorblind world a world with some forms of racialaffirmative action comes closer than a world without it
