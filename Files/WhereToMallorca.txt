                      Where to go        Whether youre in Palma a coastal resort or an inland        village you can reach any point on Mallorca in half a day and Menorca        is even smaller and more concentrated On both islands tour companies        offer excursions by road or in combinations with boat trips to see the        mountain and coastal scenery famed beaches spectacular caves and        various purposebuilt attractions At these sights though youll        invariably be part of a crowd especially in high season which grows        every year Accommodations are also at a premium from July through        September Charter flights and package deals hotel and airfare become        considerably more economical if youre willing to visit in the shoulder        or off season        Hiring a car see page  is the ideal way to see Mallorca        and Menorca allowing you to go where you likesome of the        leastknown places are the most delightful You can get around by        public bus with a couple of trains thrown in but those options wont        allow you to see as much in a short time        The great majority of visitors enter the Balearics through        its capital Palma de Mallorca and in fact most stay within  km         miles or so of the city ensconced in seaside hotels and villas Any        thought you might have had that you would be vacationing in a sleepy        Mediterranean island backwater will quickly be dashed upon arrival at        sprawling Son Sant Joan Palma de Mallorcas international airport        As islands go Mallorca is quite large it has more than         km  miles of coastline and is at its widest  km  miles        across Visiting all the major regions of Mallorca with any degree of        seriousness would require several weeks while most of muchsmaller        Menorca can be seen in a weeks time On a short holiday its best to        choose a couple of regions and take them in at a relaxed pace See the        list of beach highlights on pages  and         PALMA DE MALLORCA        Palma is a large cosmopolitan working city with a        population that accounts for twothirds of the permanent population of        Mallorca Yet the city feels undeniably tropical and sensual This has        something to do with the palm trees relentless sunshine yachts        bobbing in the bay and fishermen laying out their nets on the        waterfront to be sure but its also a product of the way locals talk        walk dress and sip wine and coffee at outdoor cafs Their leisurely        manner tells you this is no mainland capital        Palma dominates the islanda glance at the map shows how        the islands road system radiates from the citybut it is a world far        removed from the mountain villages of the northwest the small towns of        the interior and the touristruled coastal villas The area of        greatest interest to visitors is the small old quarter that surrounds        the cathedral which sits on a small hill overlooking the bay Historic        Palma can be seen in a day or two though the plazas cafs        restaurants and bars may cause you to linger        From the harbor the great Gothic cathedral rises on a small        hill and dominates the center of the city with the ancient Almudaina        Palace immediately below it To the east is Platja de Palma a long        line of excellent sandy beaches that have been defaced by a sad stretch        of concrete from Can Pastilla to SArenal to the west is the elegant        seaside promenade Passeig Martim of modern Palma where luxury        hotels look out over a forest of masts in the yacht harbor Crowning        the wooded slopes above it are the stone towers of Bellver Castle        The Romans established a strategic post near where Palma        now stands so gracefully but the Moors were primarily responsible for        transforming the site into a real city Few Arab buildings remain        having been razed during the Reconquest but the old quarter Centre        Historic on direction signs still abounds with buildings of historic        interest preserved when Palma fell into decline in the th and th        centuries The old citys narrow atmospheric streets are full of        pleasant surprises best seen on foot        The focus of any visit to Palma is justifiably its        massive Gothic Cathedralone of the finest churches in Spain Called        La Seu by locals it was begun in  after the Christians recaptured        the island from the Moors King Jaume made an emphatic political point        by ordering it built on the site of the Great Mosque Building was slow        and sporadic affected by wars and finance and the great work took        nearly four centuries to complete Densely packed buttresses facing        seaward create an extraordinary effect of power and beauty especially        when they blaze like gold in the setting sun and cast their reflection        in the pool below Before entering have a look at the remarkable        Portal del Mirador entrance overlooking Palmas bay The thcentury        door is a feast of carved stone figurines including a depiction of the        Last Supper by Guillem Sagrera The north door of the cathedral near        the thcentury bell tower is reserved for those attending religious        services in the early morning and early evening Tourists are        encouraged to visit the cathedral in conjunction with the Cathedral        Museum next door a treasuretrove of silver monstrances and        candelabra saintly relics Gothic paintings and Baroque altars A        colossal and ornate early Renaissance doorway in carved stone leads on        to the oval New Chapter House From the museum one enters the        cathedral        The wroughtiron Crown of Thorns canopy over the high altar        called the Baldachino was added by the Catalan modernista architect        Antoni Gaud at the beginning of the th century Gaud who worked        some  years on the cathedral also moved the choir stalls from the        central nave        On the west side of the cathedral is the Palau de        lAlmudaina once the royal residence of the Moorish rulers Part of        the palace is open to visitors and a short tour takes in a        stonevaulted thcentury throne room divided into two stories in the        th centuryyoull see that the window was cut off in the process        In the heavily restored royal offices which are used by the present        king and queen traces of early paintwork survive on ceilings and        frescoed walls There are also several impressive th and        thcentury Flemish tapestries        Leafy Passeig des Born the elongated plaza that runs        inland is where locals love to take their early evening promenade        Once the site of jousting tournaments its now lined with park benches        and cafs At no  is an thcentury Italianate mansion Casa        Solleric which today houses a cultural foundation and hosts art        exhibitions        In the narrow streets behind the cathedral are tall houses        several of which are baronial mansions dating from the th and th        centuries with dark walls and great wooden doors Their forbidding        exteriors hide some of Palmas most inviting courtyards which can be        glimpsed through the heavy metal grilles The Can Bordils on carrer        Almudaina retains its Gothic architecture Can Oms at number  is an        thcentury noble house with one of Palmas finest patios Crossing        over carrer Almudaina is the ancient Arab arch Arc de LAlmudaina        Many courtyards were remodeled in the th and th centuries        including Casa Olesa carrer Morey  with its cool widearched        patios balconies and stately staircases Other spectacular mansions        are nearby on carrer Can Savell look for the the Baroque Can Vivot        sometimes called Can Sureda at number  and Can Catlar del Llorer        with its Gothic patio built in the th century at number         On carrer de la Portella a palatial Renaissance mansion        has been restored as the somewhat sleepy Museu de Mallorca        Descriptions are only in Catalan but the relics of the Muslim period        and fine th to thcentury paintings and carvings originally from        Palmas churches antique tiles and ceramics and a display of        modernista furniture on the top floor make the museum worth a visit        The top floor also houses exhibitions by presentday Mallorcan artists        Old photographs show some of the Arab gateways that were destroyed when        the city walls were razed in  The Banys rabs Arab Baths behind        the museum on carrer de Can Serra  are miraculously still standing        after  years        The thcentury Baslica de Sant Francesc Baslica of St        Francis on the Plaa Sant Francesc is one of Palmas treasures A        statue of Junpero Serra the thcentury founder of the first        Franciscan missions in California is erected in front of the        Plateresque carved portal Inside the church lies the sarcophagus of        the thcentury sage and scholar Ramn Llull He and Serra are two of        Mallorcas greatest sons and heroesthey have both been beatified        and sainthood seems sure to follow The church is rather dark and        heavy a real contrast with the enchanting cloisters whose slender        double columns and stone tracery are light and delicate        The Plaa Cort is the site of the fine woodeneaved        thcentury Renaissance Ajuntament Town Hall and from there its a        short way by smart shopping streets to the yellow faades and green        shutters of the Plaa Major the former marketplace On the west side        of the Plaa Major is Plaa de Marqus Palmer sandwiched among chic        leather and footwear shops are two excellent examples of modernista        Catalan Art Nouveau architecture Can Forteza Rei and Lguila whose        iron grill work and brokentile flourishes are similar to betterknown        modernista buildings found in Barcelona        Down the steps that lead to the Plaa Major is Plaa Weyler        off of carrer Uni where there are two more fine examples of        modernisme One is the imposing and ornate former Gran Hotel The first        modern hotel in Mallorca it was built in  by Llus Domnech i        Muntaner the architect responsible for Barcelonas wondrous Palau de        la Msica concert hall Across from the Gran Hotel is a small bakery        the Forn des Teatre whose modernista decoration graces many a postcard        in Palma Down the street next to Plaa Mercat is Can Casayas two        more gently undulating modernista buildings        Back near the waterfront the turreted Sa Llotja La Lonja        in Spanish was built in the midth century by local architect        Guillem Sagrera the seafront promenade is named after him Once the        city merchants stock exchange now used to house art exhibitionsthe        only time it can be visited it is one of Spains finest civic Gothic        buildings Slim columns twist through its light and airy interior to        the vaulted roof Next to Sa Llotja a cannon and an anchor surround        the thcentury Consolat de Mar the former maritime law courtnow        the seat of the Balearic Islands autonomous government        When the evening promenade disperses the streets of the        old city are usually quiet dark and practically deserted though the        small streets between Plaa de La Llotja and Plaa la Reina teem with        restaurants and bars There is still more action if you head west to Es        Jonquet once the fishermens quarter now full of bars cafs and        clubs clustering under the old windmills which used to grind the citys        flour        A few hundred meters inland from Es Jonquet the Poble        Espanyol is a rather kitschy walled town of scaleddown replicas of        Spanish architectural treasures from across Spain including Granadas        famed Alhambra palace The buildings house shops craft studios bars        and cafs        Just south of the Poble Espanyol perched on a hilltop amid        pine trees and parkland is the fine Castell de Bellver Bellver        Castle A magnificent example of Gothic military architecture the        castle has commanded the sea and land approaches to the city since its        construction in the early th century by order of King Jaume II The        view from the circular battlements of the city and Bay of Palma is        stunning Notice how the sloping roof funneled rainwater into the        castles cisterns Inside theres a small welllaidout museum of the        archaeology of the area        THE BAY OF PALMA        Two magnificent sweeps of white sand almost  km         miles long made Palmas bay a summertime peoplemagnet and the        resorts that mushroomed along them gave Mallorca a name for cheap and        cheerful holidays in the s and s In recent years the picture        has turned decidedly boozy and tacky Athough the coast around Palma is        dominated by downmarket package tourism there are pockets of        luxurious and expensive tourist villas        East Platja de Palma        The southeastern shore of the bay runs through former        fishing villages to the beach resort and yacht harbor of Can Pastilla        almost at the end of the airport runway Then come Sometimes Las        Maravillas and SArenal on a km mile strip of hotels fast food        restaurants highthrottle bars and discos British pubs and German        beerhalls By day youll have to pick your way across the beach through        a sea of tightly packed bodiesdespite the inconveniences Platja de        Palma is an outstanding long  km miles stretch of white        sand        West Side of the Bay        To the west of Palma Cala Major great cove was a        holiday center long before the packagetour boom The Catalan        surrealist painter Joan Mir was a longtime resident of this area and        the Fundaci Pilar i Joan Mir displays a fine selection of his work        as well as his studio as he left it and his living quarters The        coast a mix of rocks and sand continues west past exclusive Bendinat        up to Portals Nous where apartment blocks cluster on the slopes The        glamorouslooking marina of Puerto Punta Portals is not natural but        ambitiously carved out of the cliffs        Sandy beaches start again at Costa dEn Blanes and Palma        Nova which morphs into big brash and overwhelmingly British        Magalluf The wide and sandy beach sloping safely into the sea is a        solid block of bronzing bodies in summer If youre looking for a bit        of tourism overkill this is where youll find it bars a block long        discos built like airport terminals restaurants offering menus in        eight languages from Finnish to French waterslides gokartsyou        name it Magalluf has it Everything but sanity        To the south the oncequiet cove of Cala Vinjes kahla        veenjuhs has been practically buried in an orgy of concrete Head for        cover by continuing on through pine woods to narrow winding lanes to        the pretty coves and beaches of Portals Vells pohrtahls vays In the        cliffs youll find huge rockcut caverns dating from Roman times or        earlier enlarged over the centuries Boats make the short excursion        from the pier on Magalluf beach meaning its not always as peaceful as        you might hope Not far south of Portals Vells you can hike to a very        quiet cove Cala Figuera Farther on the road is blocked the end of        the peninsula is a military zone        THE WESTERN TIP        The main road bypasses the resorts of the Bay of Palma and        meets up with the sea once again at Santa Pona a modern villa that        boasts one of the widest ranges of sports in Mallorca and keeps going        during the off season with an older clientele        The pleasantly treeshaded beaches of Cala Fornells are        still picturesque although hotels and clusters of Mexican        haciendastyle villas press closely round A scenic but twisting little        road leads to Port dAndratx a broad wonderfully sheltered bay that        is home to more yachts than fishing boats these days The old harbor        area on the south side keeps its traditional appearance though a        closer look reveals a string of chic restaurants and the slopes facing        it across the water are encrusted with villas and apartments most of        which have now been bought up by wealthy Germans as second homes        Claudia Schiffer among them Lack of a sandy beach has kept the big        hotels away which is just fine with most visitors A short drive        brisk walk or morning jog takes you  km  miles to the Cap de Sa        Mola the most southwesterly point o n the island with its superb        views of sheer cliffs and sparkling sea        From inland Andratx a deadend road leads to the coast at        Sant Elm a former fishing village that doesnt try too hard to be a        resort The view offshore from its mostly stony little beaches is        dominated by the island of Sa Dragonera said to look like a dragon        rising from the sea and subject of a long legal battle between        wouldbe developers and conservationists The green movement appears to        have protected the oddshaped island        NORTHWEST COAST AND MOUNTAINS        The most dramatic stretch of Mallorcas coastline looks        across the Mediterranean to Barcelona The rugged mountains of the        Serra de Tramuntana sweep down to the sea so steeply here that there        are few points of access and only one harbor and port of any size along        the coast The road winds along clifftops and the sea providing a        series of vertigoinducing viewpoints and meandering back into the        mountains Interspersed among the cliffs are terraced orchards olive        groves and photogenic medieval villages North of Andratx the coastal        road C reaches the first of a succession of miradors lookout        points with a commanding prospect of the entire coast Some of them are        still crowned with an ancient watchtower from which lookouts anxiously        scanned the sea for pirate ships and signaled warnings to the next        point along the chain If possible make the trip early in the morning        or youll be part of a procession from one parking spot to the next        The Mirador de Ricardo Roca provides enticing views of the coast        looking north but save some film because theyre even better a bit        farther on        Four km  miles from the Roca lookout Estellencs is a        pretty ancient town amid terraces and orange groves From town you can        walk or drive down a track to a little fishing cove Back on the main        road some  km  miles from Estellencs take in perhaps the finest        view of the entire coastquite an accoladefrom the snailshaped        thcentury tower of the Mirador de Ses nimes Green cliffs tumble        into the stunningly blue Mediterranean far as the eye can see on either        side The next towns name is clearly Arabic in origin and in fact the        hillsides around Banyalbufar have been tamed since Moorish times into        some of the finest and most photographed terraces on the island        Banyalbufar little vineyard by the sea has a pair of pleasant        hotels and several restaurants making it a good place to spend the        night A small lane twists down to a rocky cove and small beach while        another reaches the sea at Port des Canonge        North of Banyalbufar the road turns inland for a while        Just off the road in the direction of Esporles youll find La Granja        a popular tourist attraction and good family stop that is part stately        home part finca traditional farmhouse and part craft center        The town of Valldemossa was transformed by the short visit        over a century and a half ago of French writer George Sand and her        lover Frdric Chopin Their few weeks here in the winter of         seem to have been fairly miserable Chopin was unwell the weather was        wet and cold and bad for his chest and George Sand disparaged the        villagers in her book A Winter in Majorca calling them barbarians and        thieves  She nicknamed Mallorca Monkey Island         Now busloads of visitors arrive daily in this picturesque        mountain village to see the couples lodgings in the former Carthusian        monastery La Cartuja The monks were expelled in  and some of        their cells were sold as holiday apartments The cells were in fact        threeroom suites with private gardens  The two cells the lovers        rented are now a museum with original manuscripts Chopins death        mask and his piano Youll see too the massive church the monks        pharmacy with its collection of thcentury jars their library and        the guests dining room        In great contrast to George Sands negative impressions of        Mallorca was the lifelong love affair that the Austrian Archduke Ludwig        Salvator or Luis Salvador had with the Balearics and their people In         he bought the estate of Son Marroig just outside Dei which he        proudly proclaimed the most beautiful place on earth The house open        to visitors is filled with his collections In the gardens take in        the birdseye view from the cliffedge temple built out of Italian        marble Hundreds of feet below the house is Sa Foradada literally        rock with a hole in it a rocky promontory jutting into the sea        pierced by a remarkable m ft wide natural window If you feel        energetic hop the little fence just south of Son Marroig and take the        halfhours walk down to the sea and the landing stage where the        archduke Salvator used to anchor his yacht        Dei a gorgeous hilltop town of honeycolored stone and        brightly painted shutters just east of Son Marroig has attracted        plenty of artists and assorted expatriates ever since Robert Graves        the poet and author of I Claudius came to live here with Laura Riding        in  Graves was pursued by a strange coterie of admirers and late        in life became the Grand Old Man of Dei fierce in his defense of the        northwest coast against touristic exploitation He convinced the        Minister of Tourism a friend to declare the area a nature reserve        The pictureperfect town is extremely popular in summer when the        yearround population of  swells with the trendy and chic who drive        up rents by taking houses in Dei Besides fancy luxury hotels in old        manor houses there are a couple of smart lowcost alternatives and        one of the best rosters of restaurants on the coast making Dei an        ideal base for a few overnights At the top of the village near the        church is a small cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean a simple        cement slab bears the inscription Robert Graves Poeta         Its a twisting km mile drive down to Deis tiny        fishing cove Cala de Dei where ladderlike ramps come out of the        boathouses set into the cliffs A snack bar and a beach caf open in        summer but the rocky shore can get choked with seaweed and tourists        whod hoped to find a private cove Just beyond the turnoff to Cala de        Dei is Llucalcari which isnt properly signposted look for the sign        that says simply Hotel off to the left side of the road The tiny        village has but six or seven houses several of them fortified with        coats of armor emblazoned on the doors but if youre up to an        adventurous hike down the hill hurdling a couple of gates property        owners have installed to ward off crowds youll discover a rocky        section of shoreline with pristine transparent waters ideal for        swimming        At Sller and its seaside twin Port de Sller the cliffs        and mountains at last relent The largest bay on the northwest coast        makes a fine harbor but both the water and the beach can be dirty        Sheltered slopes a few miles inland are covered in groves of lemon        orange almond and olive trees with the islands highest mountain        Puig Major  m  ft as a rugged backdrop Sller is a        busy prosperous town that claims like several others that it was the        birthplace of Columbus Sller and Palma are linked by the narrowgauge        Sller Railway built in  Five times a day six on Sundays        polished wooden trains make the hourlong journey in each direction        through orchards and spectacular mountain scenery stopping at Son        Sardina and Bunyola The am tren turstico from Palma takes in an        extra scenic halt above Sller allowing travelers to snap their        shutters before moving on otherwise the trip is the same except for        the price        In a valley of orange orchards and olive groves Sller is        a compact little town of wellpreserved th and thcentury mansions        and agreeable churches and convents The main square Plaa        Constituci is a good place to idle for a while and absorb the        appealing character of the town A walk down Gran Va reveals buildings        with Art Nouveau and neoBaroque flourishes constructed during the        towns earlythcentury expansion        Two tiny and handsome villages near Sller have enticed        foreigners to acquire many of the medieval houses Fornalutx is a jewel        of warm stone so immaculate that it won a national prize a few years        ago for spotlessness Its steep cobblestone streets are lined with        cacti and palm trees and the Tramuntana mountains soar in the        background Similarly set among orange trees and wild flowers        Biniaraix is only a short stroll away down narrow lanes        Authorities felt that the road from Palma to Sller with        its hairpin bends and the m ft pass the Coll de Sller        was impeding development In spite of vigorous protests from        environmentalists plans were approved for a road tunnel under the        mountains and digging began in  Travel time to Palma has been        reduced to about a halfhour        On the southern slope right opposite the tunnel entrance        are the Jardins dAlfabia a seigneurial mansion and gardens that were        once the country estate of the Moorish Vizier of Palma These days the        cisterns fountains and irrigation channels are a tad run down but        the flowing water and shaded walks turkeys feeding under fig trees        and birds singing among exotic plants exude a gentle appeal The house        is like a forgotten palace full of neglected treasures Dont miss the        huge wooden thcentury oak chair in the print room called by one        expert the most important antique in Mallorca         The mountainous country to the east reached via a lovely        drive past Bunyola is a favorite with hikers and walkers based at the        tiny village of Orient or on daytrips from the coast A massive        mountain crag  m  ft high is crowned by the Castell dAlar        a ruined fortress built by King Jaume I during the Moorish era You can        make the long walk from Orient or drive most of the way to the summit        up narrow and tortuous lanes starting a little north of Alar The        higher they climb the rougher and narrower the tracks get but most        standard rental vehicles are capable of the trek Theres a restaurant        and car park off to the left The final ascent is on foot up rocky        paths wear sturdy walking shoes Look for the sign that reads Castell        a Peu To the castle on foot Its a vigorous  to minute climb        The gates and walls of the castle still guard the clifftop and the        views of the mountains and surrounding plains are as thrilling as any        on Mallorca        Forced away from the sea by the steep terrain the main        road north from Sller climbs over the high pass of Coll de Puig        Majorthe Mirador de Ses Barques has fine views of the coast and Port        de Sller as well as a restaurantand past the dams and reservoirs        of Cuber and Gorg Blau Near the second dam a little road leads to the        coast Its name Sa Calobra the snake gives a hint of the  km         miles of hairpin bends that have now become a tourist attraction in        themselves one loop is so exaggerated that the road passes under        itself in a knot Early morning is the best time to avoid the traffic        the most harrowing part of the descent is avoiding roadhogging        dangerous looking tourist buses As a reward at the bottom of the        winding road Cala de Sa Calobra has a couple of restaurants bars and        a pebbly beach but all tend to be overcrowded with daytrippers The        main objective is the deep gorge of Torrent de Pareis the twins        Tunnels enlarged from natural crevices in the rock burrow through to        the riverbed where the gorge widens into a natural theater concerts        are given on some summer evenings        At the Monasteri de Lluc Mallorcas most revered place of        pilgrimage foreign visitors are for once frequently outnumbered by        locals The monastery sequestered in a valley near the Puig des        Castellot mountain was founded in the th century but the massive        buildings you see today date from the th and th centuries        Islanders come to see and pray to a statue of the Madonna and Child La        Moreneta or little dark one so called because of its dark stone        color If you can attend mass in the church you may hear the famous        Lluc boys choir Es Blavets the blue ones named after the color        of their cassocks The monastery is a popular place with inexpensive        accommodations especially for hikers        NORTHEAST CAPES AND BAYS        The northwest coast isnt short on beauty or drama but        beaches are few and far between Many visitors who seek beach time in        Mallorcaa pretty reasonable desire after allbeeline for the        northeast coast and its two great sandy bays which have picturesque        mountainous backdrops and are within easy striking distance of the        historic towns Pollena and Alcdia as well as the protected wetlands        sAlbufera The bays of Pollena and Alcdia are lively and full of        visitors many of them families during a long and hospitable summer        season        Pleasant Port de Pollena is the kind of place that in        contrast to much of the south gives Mallorca a good namewith a        perfectly sheltered gently sloping sandy beach a decent spectrum of        hotels hostals apartments and villas good seafood restaurants and        relaxed nightlife options Wedged in between two rocky promontories        its a scenic place with luxury craft in the harbor and flotillas of        windsurfers in the bay        Nearly every visitor to these parts ventures a bit farther        northeast to the spectacular cliffs of Pennsula de Formentor the        narrow headland jutting out  km  miles on the north side of the        bay The best place to take in the extraordinary lunar landscape is the        Mirador de Mal Pas about  km  miles from Port de Pollena along        an adventurous twisting road Sheer cliffs plunge dramatically to the        Mediterranean and the cape juts out to sea Most boats and cars also        stop at the pretty pineshaded beach Platja de Formentor a favorite        spot for a picnic and swimming The beach enjoys splendid views across        the Badia de Pollenathe same youd get with a nights stay at the        exclusive Hotel Formentor whose manicured gardens are visible from the        beach        From the turnoff to beach parking its another  km         miles to the lighthouse out on Cap de Formentor The road swamped        with cars bicyclists and tour buses can be tortuous as they all try        to squeeze into the tiny parking lot at the top As great as the views        are on a crowded day it may be advisable to turn off after  km         miles from the top There youll find a single trek path down to Cala        Figuera a tiny cove with piercingly blue waters and a small beach        framed by the rocky masses of Formentor        A few miles inland from the sea Pollena was founded in         after the defeat of the Moors Until  the town belonged to the        Order of the Knights of St John whose influence is evident in many        handsome stone buildings in the center The town has a tranquil        inviting atmosphere especially at the outdoor cafes of Plaa        Major        Whether Pollenas tiny bridge labeled Pont Roman is really        Roman is questionable but the locals say so and it certainly looks        the part But the towns principal sight is the Via Crucis Way of the        Cross a long steep climb of  steps lined with  cypress trees        that lead to El Calvari and the venerated church with a rhyming name        Mare de Du del Peu de la Creu Mother of God at the Foot of the        Cross If youre driving theres also a road up which passes the         Stations of the Cross        One of the finest walks on Mallorca can be made only on        Saturdays From Pollena head north taking the narrow road towards        Ternelles Cars usually can go just a short distance before reaching a        checkpoint where they have to turn back However on Saturdays during        spring and autumn the landowners open their frontier to allow only        walkers to go through even cyclists are prohibited The route follows        the gorge of the Torrent de Ternelles at first then turns off to head        for the ruined Castell del Rei built by the Moors on a soaring crag         m  ft above the sea Another rough track leads down to the        shore at Cala Castell The entire hike is about  km  miles        Between Pollena and Port de Pollena is the turnoff for        Cala Sant Vicen a gleaming resort situated ar ound three gorgeous        sandy coves with brilliant blue water excellent for swimming and        snorkeling The setting framed by the craggy Serra de Comayaques and        El Morral mountains is spectacularexcellent for both families and        day hikers        Astride the neck of land between the Bay of Pollena and        the even more expansive Bay of Alcdia stands the ancient walled town        of Alcdia first inhabited by the Phoenicians in the eighth century        bc The Romans then built their capital Pollentia here Too close to        the sea for safety from raids it must have depended on its impressive        fortifications for protection the massive walls you see today are mere        imitations of the originals  The sturdy Gothic church of Sant Jaume        forms the southern bastion in the walls        Beyond the road that circles the town you can see the low        ruins remaining from Roman Pollentia Theyre not impressive as such        sites go but some fine relics excavated here are now displayed in the        little Museu Monogrfic a nicely restored building opposite Sant Jaume        church Just off the road leading from Alcdia to its port is the        Teatre Rom Roman theater hewn out of solid rock in the first        century bc        Port dAlcdia has evolved from a small fishing harbor into        an allpurpose port for commercial naval and pleasure craft theres        a big yacht marina and the largest summer resort in northern Mallorca        Restaurants and discos have multiplied as have hotels and apartment        blocks which now spread around the bay to form an almost unbroken        ribbon of buildings  km  miles long Platja dAlcdia in summer a        solid block of bodies soaking up the sun Though big and crowded the        resort remains pretty lowkey a good option for families with restless        children        Remarkably so close to a major resort lie the precious        wetlands of SAlbufera are a haven for birdlife Drainage plans in the        th century ran into such problems that the British company        responsible for a network of canals paths and bridgesstill to be        seen todaywent bust Much of the bay was originally surrounded by        swampland until development plans prompted largescale reclamation        SAlbufera was one of the beneficiaries of the new environmental        consciousness in Mallorca You can now walk or cycle among the         hectares  acres of wetlands and dunes that have been designated        a Parc Natural nature reserve keeping a lookout for some of the more        than  species of birds that have been spotted here        EAST COAST COVES AND CAVES        Mallorcas eastern coastline attracts nearly as many        sunseeking tourists as the extended Bay of Palma in the southwest        Its generally less seedy if not much less crowded Tiny harbors some        no more than a cleft in the cliffs alternate with larger bays Here        and there great clusters of villas are transformed from ghost town to        boom town as soon as summer arrives        Cala Ratjada is about as far as you can get from Palma        without having to take to the water But the water is what most people        are here for whether its the fishermen catamaran sailors or the        beachbound vacationers The resort is lively but undistinguished in        appearance Only the tourist information office Tel    can        arrange a visit to the Joan March Sculpture Garden on the grounds of        the coastal mansion March collected important works by Rodin Henry        Moore Anthony Caro and many modern Spanish masters        Fine sandy beaches are close by at Cala Gat and Cala Molt        though most of the bathers head to Platja Son Moll lined by large        hotels Up on Cap Capdepera theres a lighthouse with fine views of the        coast If its clear youll be able to see Menorca The cape takes its        name from nearby Capdepera a storybook town with crenellated        battlements of the thcentury castle Castell de Capdepera on the        hill above the town        The agreeable country town of Art  km  miles inland        seems far removed from the tourism that rules farther down the coast        Steps lead up Way of the Cross to the fortified church of Santuari de        Sant Salvador where you are rewarded with a fine view of the town        hills and coast        A sign pointing down a side road in the southern outskirts        of Art says simply Talaiot but it leads to one of Mallorcas most        important Megalithic settlements Ses Paisses        Some distance away on the coast Art has given its name to        the limestone caves called Coves dArt The Coves de Drac further        down the eastern coast get more fanfare but the less commercial Art        caves allow visitors to get closer and better appreciate the awesome        formations that have been brewing for millennia Colored lights and        Bachs organ music point up the name given to the lowest level The        Inferno  Jules Verne is said to have been inspired by a visit here to        write Journey to the Center of the Earth        Two groups of caves in the vicinity of Porto Cristo make a        cool change from the beachand attract an interminable procession of        tour buses The overcommercialized Coves del Drac Caves of the        Dragon to the south of the port contain almost  km more than a        mile of huge chambers and spectacular formations as well as the        unquestionable highlighta m ft long underground lake        named after EdouardAlfred Martel the French speleologist who explored        the caves in  Theres no denying the grandeur of the formations        and their atmospheric lighting The grand finale seems spectacular to        some and completely unnecessary to others The lights in the        amphitheater dim and three rowboats decked out with Christmas lights        paddle out to the middle of the lake one with an organist and two        violinists playing classical music If you wish after the concerto you        can hop one of the boats yourself and go for a little spin across the        water        Cala dOr came early to the resort business and it has now        evolved into a huge complex encompassing several individual coves and        resorts with all the facilities and watersports you could ask for In        contrast nearby Porto Petro still looks like a traditional fishing        village though it too is not immune from the summertime tourist        invasion        Cala Mondrag is practically undeveloped by the standards        of coastal Mallorca and may stay that way by order of the regional        government which has become alarmed by the specter of unchecked        building along the coast One of the gems that first attracted visitors        to this part Cala Figuera is still delightful with neat        greenandwhite houses and unpretentious boats lining its Yshaped        inlet        THE SOUTH        Until recently few visitors knew or wanted to know        anything of Mallorcas deep south Many of the coastal resorts that do        exist are mundane while large sections of the shoreline are simply        inhospitable The long sandy beach and dunes of Es Trenc the souths        best beach were left to the islanders to enjoy The situation is        changing somewhat but it appears that major development wont be        permitted        Cap de Ses Salines the islands southernmost point takes        its name from the local salt flats and ponds where many birdwatchers        gather in the spring to see the migrants on the way north from Africa        Colnia de Sant Jordi is lined with hotels and villas but it seems a        rather halfhearted attempt at a resort The nearby harbor serves as        the starting point for trips to Cabrera a tiny island usually visible         km  miles to the south Visits are limited to parties of        birdwatchers or zoologists and to excursion groups        Some  km  miles inland from Cala Pi is Capocorp Vell        the most remarkable of Mallorcas Megalithic settlements situated  km         miles from Cap Blanc on the road towards Llucmajor From as early        as  bc massive stones were being cut and hauled into place to        build a village The five talaiots three round towers two square may        have been added later        THE INTERIOR        The name given Mallorcas vast interior Es Pla the        plain may not sound promising And in fact it doesnt slow down the        great majority of visitors who stampede across the middle of Mallorca        in a mad dash to their assigned piece of coastline Es Pla is lightly        populated and little geared toward tourism Still there are lovely        agricultural landscapes with ancient stone fincas farmhouses        terraced olive groves farmers who still plough with horses leisurely        back roads and unassuming old towns Its an area best covered by your        own transportation either automobile or bicycle        Northeast of Palma is the attractive town of Binissalem        the epicenter of Mallorcas wine industry which earned a Denominacin        de Origena quality designation similar to the French Apellation        dOriginein  The town features a number of attractive        townhouses dating from the th and th centuries Farther along the        main road heading northeast is the unattractive industrial town of        Inca center of the leather industry The best reason to visit is to        shop at the factory outlets Incas Thursday market sprawls through the        streets and tour buses arrive in flotillas even though the goods are        much the same as in other markets on the island        Just north of Inca is the tiny town of Caimari worth a        quick detour to take in the amazing hillside of terraced olive groves        neatly layered among ancient stones        Sineu practically at the center of the island is probably        the pick of inland towns Built on the site King Jaume II chose to        build a palace which survives now much altered as a convent Sineu        has an elegant Gothic church some attractive seigneurial homes and a        pleasant central plaza with some good restaurants Wednesday is market        day when people come from all over Es Pla for fresh produce and        livestock        In Felanitx the honeycolored church Sant Miquel dates in        part from the th century In the street adjacent is a stone tablet        commemorating a tragedy During an Easter procession in  the        collapse of a wall killed  people Felanitx is the starting point        for a bracing trip to Castell de Santueri a ruined hilltop castle that        was fortified by every ruler from Roman times to the th century Take        the exhilarating walk round the rampartstheres nothing between you        and a dizzying precipice The views of the coast are superb and on a        rare clear day youll see Menorca and Ibiza too        On the next hill to the northand unless youre a serious        walker youll have to go back through Felanitx to reach itthe Puig        de Sant Salvador is the site of a hermitage and one of Mallorcas most        important places of pilgrimage In the church look behind the altar at        the Gothic statue of the Virgin Mary backed by an alabaster panel of        blond angels        Suddenly rearing up out of

  The capital and largest town Ma Mahn in Spanish and        the former capital Ciutadella are on opposite coasts Resort        development is restricted to a handful of coves and beaches on the

scattered across the island though        theyre especially concentrated in the southeast        Ma        Ma is the business and administrative capital of Menorca        but it remains above all a port  The best ports in the        Mediterranean are June July August and Ma said the thcentury        Venetian admiral Andrea Doria noting that beyond the summer sailing        season a fleet couldnt do better than shelter here The km        mile long deepwater natural harbor guarded by forts at its        mouth and shielded from the winds by surrounding hills caught the eye        of the British Royal Navy early in the th century In  during        the War of the Spanish Succession the British seized the island for        its port and kept possession until temporarily losing it to the French        in         British occupation on and off until  left its mark        The English introduced gin and Menorcan gin production has thrived        ever since see page  Parts of Mas old town appear straight out        of Georgian England Whole streets including Costa de Sa Plaa        Hannover resemble thcentury Portsmouth or Plymouth        The only way to enjoy Ma is by foot The city is clustered        on a cliff near the center a twisting roadway Costa de Ses Voltes        and flights of broad ceremonial steps lead down to the quays and port        Mas star sight is its beautiful port and the enjoyable promenade and        restaurants and pastelcolored houses that line it        At the top level follow your nose to Plaa dEspanya and        the fish market where youll see more varieties of octopus and squid        than you knew existed Adjacent are a produce market and stalls housed        in the vast cloisters Claustre del Carme of a former convent selling        Abarcas Menorcan peasant shoes jewelry and Menorcas famous Mahn        cheese Made of cows milk with a small percentage of sheeps milk        varieties range from the young and mild to a hardskinned and

Xoriguer distillery west of the ferry port Established in the th        century the distillery still operates and you can look through big        windows at copper stills bubbling away producing a hot colorless        spirit which is poured over juniper berries to become gin You can        sample any number of liqueurs produced here including calent spiced        with saffron and cinnamon and hierbas dulces a bright green liquid        and acquired taste that restaurant owners may force upon you at        meals end        Take a stroll along the quayside past the foot of the        main steps along Moll de Levantwhere most of Mas best restaurants        are locatedand youll turn the corner into Cala Figuera called        English Cove in the days of the British Navy and the Club Martim        where pleasure craft congregate near the ships chandlers shops and        restaurants that cater to them        If you have time take a glassbottomed cruise from the        port or Cala

  partSpanish style the mansion is better known as Golden Farm The        house is privately owned so youll have to admire it from a        distance        Looking out over the harbor mouth toward vast fo        rtifications on the opposite side still used as a military base Es        Castell also called Villacarlos appears even more English than Ma        There are some lively restaurants and bars along Moll de Sant Fonts at        the waterfront and the Cala de Sant Fonts a boardwalk cleaved into        the rock framing the harbor makes for a delightful stroll        Excursions from Ma South and East        If you set out from Ma the first of many Talaoitic        monuments is found near the city limit at Trepuc off the road south        to Sant Llus The talaiot and taula at the site have been slightly        damaged not least when the French army fortified it and mounted guns        to fire on the British in Fort San Felipe        Sant Lluis a little town of checkerboard streets and        allwhite typically Menorcan houses was built by the French army as        their headquarters in the Seven Years War         The southeast with its small sandy beaches clear water        and proximity to Ma and its airport was one of the first to be        developed for tourism At SAlgar and Cala dAlcaufar villas cluster        near a rocky shore and Punta Prima has a sandy but often unkempt        beach        Though theres little to distinguish many of these        resorts Binibeca Vell also spelled Binibquer Vell is something        different Vell means old which in this case is a misnomer Inspired        by a traditional Menorcan fishing village a local architect created        this sunsplashed toytown of brilliant white houses and dark wooden        beams and shutters in         Just up the coast from Binebeca are some of the        southeasts finest beaches and swimming waters Literally right next        door is an area known to locals as Las Ollasthe name means frying        pans perhaps pertaining to the circular shape of this natural        swimming hole carved by the sea More likely though the sobriquet        refers to the sound of the continually moving waters sloshing against        a beautiful rock basin like sauces bubbling in a pan The pools are        popular with nudist bathers        The road makes detours inland on its way west to the        resorts of Binidal and fine protected coves Cala de Biniparratx and        Cala de Binidal Both are small enough and sufficiently off the beaten        path that youre unlikely to encounter large crowds The former has a        platform at the edge of the sea which provides excellent views of the        coast and back at the small cove To get to Cala de Biniparratx park        your car in the small lot and walk along a beautiful path through a        canyon and shrubs to a narrow cove The beach is sheltered by steep        cliffs that house ancient cave dwellings

 In contrast to CalaEn Porter nearby Cales Coves is        undeveloped Although no buildings survive theres evidence that it        was a port in Roman times Cales Coves is best known however for its        amazing collection of cavesperhaps a hundred or moreburrowed out        of the cliffs You can see the openings of caves once used as        necropolises burial chambers in the Talaiotic period

   Scottish Highland troops who probably thought these rocky hillsides        covered with purple heather were just like home You can drive down to        the sea at only a few places and inevitably some of these have        developed rapidly into sprawling resorts Na Macaret was an old fishing        village and much of the new development seeks to imitate a traditional        look especially around the neat little square Arenal dEn Castell has        a beautiful circular bay almost enclosed and with a wide sandy        beach        Nearby Son Parc near a big flat sandy beach backed by        dunes is an artificial creation centered around a golf club the only        one of its kind on Menorca For greater authenticity head back to the        MaFornells road and onto Fornells which remains a real fishing        village This lowkey town a good base for exploring the north coast        is lined by pretty houses and ballyhooed seafood restaurants along the        waterfront The inlets sheltered coastline and shallow water make it        ideal for sailing and windsurfing        For geological extremes take the rough and potholeridden        track to the most northerly point on the island Cap de Cavallera        Its passable by car with a farm gate to open and close and leads        past the site of the ancient Carthaginian and Roman port of Sanitja        Walk along the sheer drop of the clifftop near the lighthouse for        breathtaking views        Back down the hellish road from the cape and due west is        the isolated beach Platja Binimella Menorcans favor the orangetinged        sandandpebble beach on weekends But if its beaches youre after        you cannot do better on Menorca or just about anywhere than Cala        Pregonda You can only get here by scrambling over the hills just west        of Binimella About  minutes later having passed through a desert        landscape you will have discovered paradise a spectacular sandy beach        framed by a lush pine forest and stalagmitelike sea stacks rising out        of impossibly transparent waters        West from Ma Taloitic Monuments and Inland Towns        From Ma plenty of people blitz right across Menorca to        Ciutadellaonly  km  miles and a direct shot it takes less        than an hour The busy main road from Ma to Ciutadella at first runs        parallel to the one built by order of the first British governor the        Cam dEn Kane The scenic and wellpaved old road passes a number of        handsome haciendas Beyond Alaior the modern road is superimposed on        the old route        Near Ma you can begin a tour of Menorcas mysterious        yearold megalithic sites Just  km  miles from Ma a        lavender sign to the left points down a lane to Talat de Dalt Hop the        small wall and walk through groves to discover an elegantly slim taula        with a fallen stone supporting the basewhich has led some to        speculate that it was formed this way for a reason In all likelihood        the piece merely fell Next to the taula is a dark columned room and        nearby burial caves The settlement here dates to the end of the Bronze        Age around  bc        Back on the main road a little farther west keep an eye        on the fields on the north side Youre looking for Rafal Rub a site        with two stone structures shaped like upturned boats navetas        prehistoric burial chambers These were collective ossuaries used        for secondary burials of bones If you crawl through the low doorway of        the betterrestored naveta you can appreciate the spacious interior        over  m  ft high with shelves at each end The other naveta is        more of a ruin but worth seeing for the beautifully recessed stone        door frame evidently designed to take a stone or wooden door        South of the road and most easily accessible by the        narrow lane from Alaior to Cala En Porter is the fascinating Talaoitic        complex Torralba dEn Salord Torralba has perhaps the most beautiful        taula of allcertain evidence that the ancients were masters of the        art of stone construction Recent excavations and radiocarbon dating        put the taulas date at about  bc The Hypostyle hall has one of        the few intact stone roofs supported by columns This site is one of        the only ones on the island to charge admission and keep set hours        The town of Alaior a mass of white houses clustered on a        low hill looks at a distance like an Arab or Andalusian village The        old section of town at the top is the most attractive quarter Alaior        is famous for its cheesemaking industry stop at either the Coinga or        La Payesa factory for a sample of queso de Mahn To the south of town        a long sandy gently sloping beach and sand dunes have brought        obtrusive highrise hotel and villa developments to the south coast at        Sant Jaume and Platja de Son Bou Besides waterslides and windsurfers        the outline of a fifthcentury basilica discovered in  is visible        next to the beach at its eastern end        A turnoff from the AlaiorSon Bou road signposted to        Torre dEn Gaums brings you to the second largest and most varied of        Menorcas prehistoric settlements Dont miss the hypostyle court with        its central supports and massive roof intact or the water cisterns        carved out in the soft sandstone rock        Choose a clear day and head for Es Mercadal halfway along        the main eastwest highway  km miles from Alaior Here climb the        twisting but wellcontoured road to the top of Monte El Toro Menorcas        highest peak Its only  m  ft high but provides excellent        views of the entire island        A horseshoeshaped cove with white sand and turquoise        water sheltered by cliffs and green pine woods has made the stunningly        beautiful Cala Santa Galdana one of Menorcas most popular holiday        destinations To escape the crowds take the path from the parking lot        opposite the Hotel Gavilanes disregard the sign that says Coto Privado        de Cazaprivate hunting grounds and walk  minutes through the        woods along a fairly welldefined path Youll come to Cala Mitjana a        secluded but popular beach If you try to drive here youll have to        pay to travel the access road        Ciutadella        Perhaps the most enchanting city of the Balearics        Ciutadellawith its sandstone buildings churches and cobblestone        streetspreserves the flavor of a Spanish colonial island town Until        the early th century Ciutadella little city was the capital of        Menorca The British on the island mainly for Mas harbor moved the        capital in  Ciutadellas beautiful but narrow and shallow inlet        simply could not compete        Plaa Alfons III on the eastern edge of town marks the        spot where the road from Ma reached the old city gates The gates are        long gone but the cafs around the squareincluding the atmospheric        Es Mol in an ancient windmillprobably began by refreshing thirsty        travelers Locals flood the old town in early evening Join them on        their paseo and stroll along the main pedestrianonly street that        bisects the old part of the city It takes various names beginning as        Carrer de Ma at Sa Plaa Nova it becomes Carrer J Mara Quadrado        one side of whichthe lovely Ses Voltesis completely arcaded in        Moorish style and lined with shops and restaurants        On Plaa de la Catedral is the stately Gothic cathedral        begun in the th century on the site of the old mosque The bishops        palace adjoins the church Ciutadellas tourist information office is        just across the plaza from the cathedral The pedestrianonly streets        of the Es Rodal area just south of the cathedral are replete with        wonderful stonework the buildings honey color glowing gold as the sun        goes down Look especially for the carved doorway of the thcentury        church Esglsia del Roser down the side street carrer del Roser across        from the cathedral and two thcentury palaces Palau Martorell and        Can Saura diagonally across from each other on carrer del Santissim        Nearby is the Museu Dioces housed in a former convent and cloisters

mansions grand Palau Torresaura        and Palau Salord In the middle of the square an obelisk commemorates        a brave defense against some  besieging Turks in  The town        fell after nine days and the survivors were carried off into slavery        Concerts are still held at the thcentury Teatre del Born on the        north side of the plaa        From Plaa des Born you can view the port below a long        curving inlet lined with fishing boats on one side and pleasure craft        on the other The port the focus of Ciutadellas nightlife teems with        seafood restaurants and openair bars        Prehistory near Ciutadella        About  km  miles west of the city just off the south        of the main road stands the Naveta dEs Tudons one of the islands        finest preTalaoitic complexes A burial chamberclaimed as the        oldest roofed building in Europedates from between  and         bc        Two intriguing taula sites are hidden not far away        Heading away from Ciutadella just after Naveta dEs Tudons take the        next lane to the south and after  km  miles turn left down a        farm track to Torre Trencada There is a signpost pointing across the        fields to the taula and a huge cave Back on the main road take the        next road turning south through stone gateposts and across a farmyard        to the largely unexcavated Torrellafuda obscured by trees From the        talaiot theres a wonderful view of the surrounding countryside        divided by rows and rows of stone walls        Head out of Ciutadella on the road towards Sant Joan de        Missa and branch off towards Son Saura after  km  miles youll        arrive at the prehistoric walled town of Son Catlar situated in the        farmland to the east of the road You can walk round the m        ft long walls which possibly date from about  bc         though on the southeastern side you can see places where much later        the Romans built bastions The taula seems to have been deliberately        broken off and it is possible that the Romans used the precinct as a        temple        Beaches and Resorts near Ciutadella        Almost every accessible cove and inlet on the coast near        Ciutadella has been developed in a rash of urbanitzacis creating a        rash of holiday homes hotels and associated facilities The resorts        are easily accessible but their sprawl is dull and suburban Beaches        here are very small and overcrowded in high summer        However some of the islands finest beaches near the        middle of the southern coast are probably best visited from        Ciutadella The sea is reached only by narrow lanes and farm tracks        but its worth a trek to get away from the crowds The twin coves of        Macarella and Macarelleta are stunning with the kind of calm turquoise        waters and spectacular sea views Menorca is known for Macarella is        perhaps the nicest fully serviced beach on Mallorca the beautiful cove        has an excellent barrestaurant open daily Macarelleta a nudist        beach is lovelier still To get to it take the path to the right of        Macarella a minute walk along the cliff        Occasionally there are times when so many head for the        remote spots that they create a crowd there too A favorite spot for        both locals and tourists is pretty Cala en Turqueta  km  miles        from Ciutadella along the Sant Joan de Missa road        West and south of Ciutadella are the busiest and dreariest        of Menorcas resorts including Santandria Cala Blanca Cap dArtrutx        and Cala en Bos Just west of Ciutadella Cala Blanes and the vast        area of villas and hotels near Cala Forcat make a self contained        holiday town though their two often scruffy little beaches can hardly        cope with the summer influx        The northwest corner of the island in total contrast is        almost untouched by tourism and environmentalists are winning        supporters who want it declared offlimits for development Some        building at Cala Morell  km miles northwest of Ciutadella has        jumped the gun and a number of little white houses and blocks of        villas have sprouted on the eastern side of one of the loveliest bays        on the north coast A maze of paths leads down to the rocky shore and        around the cliffsa geology textbook of tortured strata Carved into        the rock above the bay is a prehistoric necropolis dating from the th        century bc  including a cell with a sculpted faade The oldest        caves though are preTalaoitic dating from around  bc West of        Cala Morell are the lovely remote beaches of Algaiarens
