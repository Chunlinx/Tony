distill all this down to a twoparagraph summary in case you arecalled upon in class You will later boil it down to a onesentence summary foran outline youll use to study for finals The point may or may not appear inthe exam            Such expansion and contraction mean that lawyers arenever quite certain how big or important things are This is why we yell aboutpaperclips and sleep through deathpenalty cases            The Microsoft trial has been called the antitrust trialof the latter half of this century As have the last three antitrust trialsthis century It began as a few disputed sentences in a  consent decreelimiting some alleged anticompetitive jiggerypokery by Microsoft Thesixtoeightweek trial metastasized into a day ordeal spanning  monthswith dozens of witnesses and thousands of exhibits It might have grown evenbigger but Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson deliberately limitedthe number of witnesses and kinds of testimony to prevent the legal entropythat produces an OJ trial            When testimony ended last June it looked for a momentas though Computing as We Know It was on the line But things got quiet wetried instant messaging we maybe upgraded and we bought orange Gap vestsonline            Bill Gates gave money away            Through August and September the case contracted evenmore with each side submitting proposed findings of fact then revisedversions of same each of which told a condensed version of their story fromtrial The government said Microsoft used its monopoly power in the operatingsystems market to bully and threaten its way into dominance over the browsermarket Microsoft argued that it acted competitively in a competitive marketthat distribution channels for competitors were never foreclosed and thatconsumers have not been harmed            More paperclips            Today with two and a half hours allocated to each sidefor closing arguments the case contracts once again until it is virtuallydancing on the head of the pin Except for the venueproceedings movedupstairs to a vast courtroom in the US District Courthouse where we sit underthe watchful statue eyes of Moses Justinian Hammurabi and Solonlittle haschanged Except the lawyers have traded their fine brushes for broadonespaint rollers perhapsand the Microsoft case appears even smaller thanit did before            The Justice Departments outside counsel David Boieswho crossexamined some of Microsofts star witnesses into sweaty littleribbons at trial simply hands out his outline to the class He spends themorning walking us through the elements of antitrust law and offering evidencefrom the record to support his claims This man who virtually commanded thesmall courtroom downstairs during trial seems somewhat diminished today Buthe makes his points Microsoft has monopoly power for operating systemsMicrosoft maintained its operating system monopoly through anticompetitivepractices Microsoft used that monopoly to try to monopolize the browsermarket Microsoft engaged in contracts and conspiracies in restraint oftrade            Microsofts John Warden takes a different tackSpeaking as though his mouth is full of aquarium gravel he paints everythinglarger than it is His job is simple He must punch holes into the governmentssoft places He does not use an outline He simply begins to roar Thegovernment has never ever proved that their browser and operating systems areseparable Whether they were designed to beinseparable he leaves for another day In swinging away at the governmentsweak spots market definition harm to consumer Netscapes marketpenetration Warden employs the kind of hyperbole usually reserved fordomestic fights about who does the dishes The government has offeredno evidence Professor Fisher offeredno analysis Microsoft has never induced an OEM to drop their competitors products            But Mr Warden we saw the contracts             Never he roars Baloney he sputters At somepoint he coughs so hard that someone at the DOJ table hands him a cough dropGames and shams he snarls When he concludes it is with an ominousreference to central planning As Boies rises for his halfhour rebuttal youcan almost hear the drumbeats from Red Square            David Boies immediately agrees Central planning isbad The balalaikas recede Then he whips out his outline He focuses narrowlyperhaps too much so The consumer has been harmed Microsoft did what they didnot to sell more copies of Windows but rather to stop their competitors Nowwe are all dancing on the head of a pin            The trial ends without fanfare Judge Jackson poundshis gavel and leaves the massive courtroom Now he will reduce these thousandsof facts to an even smaller opinion In the interim technologies will changeand change again When the dust settles if it ever settles all of this willstand for something very great in the casebooks and the exam papers            Unless it stands for something very small                                             Clickhere  for dispatches from the last session of theMicrosoft trial between October  and February
