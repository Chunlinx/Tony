                                 The AntiElitist Elite                        Dear Nat            Maybe I was too prickly about Lemanns treatment of theCalifornia Civil Rights Initiative but let me explain why CCRI andopposition to affirmative action generally is popular with middleclassAmericans Meanwhile CCRI was extremely unpopular with the educated elitesOne of the things the educated elites did during the CCRI fight was to use thefull power of their influence in the media and the culture to opposediscredit and in many cases smear the supporters Thats one of the reasonsmost of the normal bigmoney people in the Republican party wouldnt go nearit            In the end the educatedelite assault was not enoughto drive public support of CCRI below  percent That shows that the influenceof the educated elite is not dominant in American society if it werecampaignfinance reform would have passed long ago            But Lemann is writing a book lamenting the fact thatAmerica has this new elite selected at an early age by SAT scores and otheracademic factors He says this system of selecting people so young is unfair tomost Americans Good point But if that is your argument then in the majorpublicpolicy dispute you cover in the book you had better bend over backwardsto give voice to the majority of highschool grads who supported CCRI Insteadthe story is toldfor the most partthrough a bunch of Ivy League lawyers andhighly educated political activists To simplify Lemanns supple narrative abit He decries the existence of the educated elite but when push comes toshove he seems more a creature of that elite than an opponent or a detachedcultural observer            But I dont want to say that Lemann is an old fashionedelitist That is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the educatedelite of which Lemann seems to be a paragon The reality is much moreparadoxical This is an elite raised to oppose elites This is an elite with anegalitarian sensibility Thats why it supports affirmative actionout ofconcern for the less fortunate Thats why its members write books like thisone When members of the elite oppose the middle class and sometimes trampleall over them they are usually doing it in the name of egalitarianism Theelites are more egalitarian than the masses            One of the things that shines through Lemanns writingis his concern for people less fortunate than himself He is neverselfrighteous or showy about this Instead his penchant for exhaustiveresearch seems to flow from a genuine social commitment Ive never met theman but I admire him through his writings From what I know about him heseems to have had all the educational advantages And here he is arguingagainst the privileges of his class but without any radicalchic bravuraandmost members of the educated elite will agree with him            Thats why this elite for all its flaws isfundamentally different than and better than the Protestant Establishment thatit replaced Thats why Im not convinced by Lemanns concluding section inwhich he says we should change the way we select our elites The ethos hedescribes in his heroes undercuts his case If we are going to have aneliteand we arewe should have one made up of people as egalitarian asLemann The current university system seems to inculcate such values Imentioned yesterday that I just finished a book about the manners and morals ofthis educated class When I wrote the proposal I said that my last chapterwould be about the revolt against this class for some of the same reasons thatLemann hints at without sufficiently detailing in his book They are selectedtoo early they live in a culture that is detached from the rest of theculture the income gap between them and the rest of the culture is wideningBut as I traveled around doing my research I couldnt find any evidence ofthis class revolt There didnt seem to be any mass movement to upend peoplelike us who went to or work at selective colleges Indeed the rest of Americaseems to want to learn how to drink espressos like we do The only people whoseemed genuinely upset about the educated elite were members of the educatedelite themselves            This sensibility oozes from the pores of Molly Mungerone of the liberal lawyers Lemann describes fighting CCRI This sensibilityplays out over many spheres This is an elite that dresses casually so it wontappear elite visit Microsoft This is an elite that practices conscientiousconsumption instead of conspicuous consumption This is an elite in whichsixfigureincome intellectuals like Robert Reich churn out books on wideningwealth disparities This is not too say they are hypocrites It is to say theygo to extraordinary lengths to mitigate their social advantages at leastcompared to the old Protestant Establishment            Indeed I have a halfbaked theory that Americatolerates leftwing universities because they serve as finishing schools forthe new ruling class They give the coming elite an egalitarian sensibility sowhen they rise to the top they wont give off offensive vapors that mightarouse class resentments in the middle and lower class In this way Marxistprofessors actually serve to solidify the current class structure            But that wacky theory aside the point for Lemannsbook is this He brilliantly shows how the Protestant Establishment gave way tothe educated elite He tells for the first time how the selective mechanism forthe educated classthe SATcame to occupy its current dominant role Heunderlines the problems with this arrangement He makes a truncated plea forreform But he never shows the great harms perpetrated by this system Hedoesnt show how the new elites have been corrupted by their status or of themisery of How the Other Half Lives On the contrary he shows how educatedelites like himself and Molly Munger are fighting against the Marie Antoinettesyndrome I dont agree with Lemann on a lot of issues but Im glad thecentral flaw of this elite is excessive egalitarianism Thats the least badflaw for an elite to have            You mentioned yesterday that today you were going totake on his concluding section Im looking forward to that
