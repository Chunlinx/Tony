        so do you your privacy being invaded at any time     well one of the things that uh that i found to be uh an invasion is when i pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the on the uh credit card bill       that is something that is not required and in fact uh   right   it is actually prohibited but it doesnt stop many  people from uh from doing it and its one of the things that its used for primarily is for demographic uh research and to get the your your phone number on uh uh lists for phone solicitations   yep yep theres a lot that you you can still yeah i have always done that i started once i found out that thats really not necessary or legal then i just refuse and i say what are you gonna do you gonna say you dont wanna sell me this product then thats fine ill just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all   umhum   and then ultimately they say no you dont have to put it down but uh really its part of this compliance thing   umhum   uh the thing i dont like i know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles   umhum   that really burns me because hey youre required you have to do that   right   and nowhere does it say you have asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone   umhum   and i think thats it its one thing  voluntarily give it because someone asks you can always refuse but its another thing where its required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody   right uh that   you know i dont think i dont think they have the right to do that   i agree with you there thats something that uh people have seen oh heres an easy way to make some money but uh  i dont know if thats been challenged in the courts or not ive ive heard fairly recently uh some talk about that in this in in my state ah the budget problems up here are are pretty tense and people are looking for alternate ways of uh you know enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use and they were talking about selling the DMV lists and there was a lot of uh a lot of uh consternation about that and the last i heard theyd backed down from that idea but it really makes you wonder what other lists youre on that have been made uh public that you dont know about   well thats easy whenever you donate money to someone   umhum   they you become  put on something like a sucker list and you start getting millions of calls or   right   solicitations and then you start  it kind of makes you feel deeded from doing it again like uh National Public Radio or   umhum   any of these the public uh stations you know i i i i think i sent in in money for   umhum   once to uh to public uh TV   umhum   and i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine i its like   hm   and it just started soon after i had done that once and i just said this is this is terrible   right   um and thats also happened to me where as ive given money to my old Alma Mater in college   umhum   and uh its one thing they dont sell the list but the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people to the people do these phonathons and they call you up   right   and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that and they say oh we we know you you uh had uh contributed X amount last year can you do better this year and you know like hold on here who how do you know that why why you even telling me this   how do you know that   is it any of your business i mean its one thing that i and the colleges knows that thats just our business theres no need for someone whos soliciting should know it all   umhum   just uh and that was very offensive too   last year the uh Lotus Development Company the uh company that puts out One Two Three was planning on marketing a uh cdrom     uhhuh right   with peoples names sorted by number of different criteria
