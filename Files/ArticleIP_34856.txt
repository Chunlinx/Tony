                                  Too True To Be Good            Not everything you read on the World Wide Web istrue Not everything you read in the New York Times is true either Sowhen you read about scientific breakthroughs how do you know what tobelieve            Partly you trust your instincts A theory thatlife evolved from clay is more inherently plausible than a theory that lifeevolved from PlayDoh Partly you consider the source A Harvard professor ismore credible than a Dartmouth dishwasher And partly you rely on expertjudgments If a prestigious journal has agreed to publish the clay theory itsprobably wrong            Yes I meant to say that If a prestigiousjournal publishes a theory its probably wrong  Given two equallyplausible theories from equally credible sources that have passed equallystrict scrutiny the one that makes it into a top journal has a smallerchance of being right Heres why Editors like to publish theories they findsurprising And the best way to surprise an editor is to be wrong            Thats not to say thateditors are reckless At least in mathematics and economics the two fieldswhere I can testify from personal experience the editorial process isrigorously demanding Long before an article is submitted for publication theauthor is expected to circulate drafts among experts in the field and torespond to their criticisms and commentsa process that typically takes yearsOnly then is the now heavily revised article formally submitted whereuponthe editor handpicks an expert referee to examine it line by linea processthat can easily take another year or more Are referees ever lax and carelessSurely Are they lax and careless with articles of genuine importance In myobservation essentially never Through multiple rounds of correspondencereferees demand satisfaction regarding every important detail In many casesthe author will visit the referees home institution for a semester or a yearto be available for periodic grilling            Thats exactly whats so damning about the hoax perpetratedin  by Alan Sokal Sokals paper intentionally stripped of logicevidence and even meaning was accepted for publication in the culturalstudies journal Social Text  True this was a onetime event but it wasan event so far removed from anything that could possibly occur in a legitimateacademic enterprise that it converted agnostics like me who had doubted thestatus of cultural studies as an intellectual discipline into hardcore cynicswith no doubt whatsoever            In a serious economicsjournal it would be impossible to publish an article like Sokals But itwould not be impossible or even unusual to publish a carefully reasonedarticle thats still wrong Thats because of the bias I mentioned earlierGiven two papers that have both survived the vetting process editors tend toprefer the more surprising which means that on average they prefer the onethats wrong            Its easy to see how the same dynamic could work at anewspaper Man bites dog is a better story than dog bites man but itsalso more likely to be wrong even if both stories are reported by equallyreliable witnesses In generaland this observation is a mainstay of collegestatistics courseswhen you think youve seen something unusual youre morelikely to be mistaken than when you think youve seen something ordinary Butits the unusual that makes the front page            A few years agoeconomics professors J Bradford De Long and Kevin Lang devised an ingeniousway to determine just how many published economic hypotheses are actually trueThey looked through several years worth of issues of the top economicsjournals and found  hypotheses that were confirmed by strong evidencethesort of evidence that led the authors to accept their own hypotheses Another hypotheses were rejected by their authors In exactly none of the  casescould the confirmation be called overwhelming            But thats OK Strong evidence is after all strongevidence even when its a little shy of overwhelming In most casesoverwhelming evidence is too much to ask for because evidence can be hard tocollect and hard to interpret So no individual article can be criticized forfailing to live up to an unattainable standard            But said De Long andLang out of  true hypotheses surely there should be at least a fewthat are overwhelmingly confirmed In fact they gave a precise definition ofthe word overwhelming according to which roughly  percent of all truehypotheses should come packaged with overwhelming evidence So if all hypotheses are true then roughly  of themcall it eight should beconfirmed overwhelmingly And theyre not            OK so maybe thats because not all  are true Maybe only are true In that case five should be confirmed overwhelmingly Or maybeonly  are true in which case three should be confirmed overwhelmingly Theproblem is that exactly zero are confirmed overwhelmingly and zero is percent ofzero So out of  confirmed hypotheses it seems thatapproximately zero are true            Using a more sophisticated version of the sametechniques De Long and Lang concluded that some of the  confirmedhypotheses might be true but probably not more than about a third of them Inother words when a published article in a top journal presents evidence thatits hypothesis is true its hypothesis is probably false It would be veryinteresting to perform the same experiment with say medical journals insteadof economics journals Id be very surprised if the results were substantiallydifferent            If this makes you feel pessimistic about theprogress of science keep in mind that we can learn a lot from even a very fewtrue hypotheses submerged in a sea of false ones And heres another ray ofhope De Long and Langs results were published in the prestigious Journalof Political Economy  so theyre probably wrong to begin with And thisaccount of them was published in                   Slate                so its probably wrongtoo
