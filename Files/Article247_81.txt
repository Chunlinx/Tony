                                 Did I Dis Sid I Did            Is Chatterbox crazy to think Sidney Blumenthal didnt get enoughfavorable publicity after he was forced to appear before Kenneth Starrs grandjury to tell prosecutors whether he was saying nasty things about them Thesubpoena was after all just as outrageous as the commentariat said it wasDoes Pepperdine law school really want to give its deanship to someone whodoesn t know the first thing about the First Amendment Yet when Blumenthalfinally testified last Thursday and then denounced Starr from the courthousesteps NBC correspondent David Excitable Boy Bloom poisoned Blumenthalssound bite by characterizing it in advance as a tirade The mostgratuitously antiSid coverage was the frontpage sneer from John M Broder inthe New York Times  Broders story began with this After a long careeras a scribbler in the shadows Sidney Blumenthal got his moment in the suntoday  Now its true that Blumenthal was obviously loving the exposurebut so are about  percent of the people who appear in the New YorkTimes  That doesnt usually get them a firstgraph smirk at least whenthere are important things at stake Imagine the respectful tone theTimes would have struck if say Erskine Bowles had been hauled beforethe grand jury But the First Amendment issues would have been the sameBroders third graph was bizarre A former journalist and the White Housesmost celebrated conspiracy theorist Mr Blumenthal faced the cameras at thepeak of the Western Hemispheres last total solar eclipse of the millenniumChatterbox at first thought this was an adventurous metaphor for the wayBlumenthals story had been eclipsed by the news from Iraq or the lull in theFlytrap scandal or by Broders own attitude But no Turns out it was aninjokeBlumenthal is a millennium freak You can laugh now When is aninjoke too in to run Chatterboxs rule of thumb is that if Chatterbox doesntget the joke it doesnt belong in the paper If Chatterbox gets the joke butthe guy sitting next to Chatterbox doesnt its cuttingedge journalismWhy dont reporters like Sid Not simply because when he was a political writerhe was considered pathetically inthetank for Clinton see Chatterbox for Its also his standard demeanor which features a permanentIknowasecretthatImnottellingyou grin Contacted by telephone theTimes  Broder denies any personal animosity toward Sid Yes thatsright Chatterbox actually picked up the phone and called somebody for areaction Journalism Dont expect it to happen again                           CORPORATISM WATCH There is a significant difference between askinga White House official for his sources and asking the owner of a Web page onthe Internet for his sources Marvin Kalb director of the Shorenstein Centeron Press and Politics at Harvard tells the Times  On the Drudge sideyoure in uncharted waters Meaning what That Drudge has different fewerFirst Amendment rights than Blumenthal That Kalb knows how to get his name inthe papers Its true that the Sidney Blumenthal now being pursued by Starris the same Sidney Blumenthal who recently demanded that Matt Drudge revealhis sources Theres some hypocrisy there on Blumenthals part Butthere is a difference between the two situations and its not the offensiveDrudgeisapeon distinction offered by Kalb Blumenthal was never in charge ofa grand jury criminal proceeding the way Starr is He is suing Drudge in civilcourt for libel the same way any citizen can sue another citizen for libel IfStarr had similarly sued Blumenthal for libel or slander instead of calling himbefore the grand jury where among other things youre not entitled to have alawyer present during questioning wed have a different story on our handsBut of course Starr would never do that because hes a public figure andunder existing First Amendment precedents would have the same trouble provinghis case that Blumenthal will have in his suit against Drudge
