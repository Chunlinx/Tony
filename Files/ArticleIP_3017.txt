                                 The Dying of the Light            Jamaica Kincaid is great atdescribing rage Her fictional heroines can name every indignity theyve beensubjected to since birth and because they are usually bright young women fromtroubled families in poor island backwaters such as Antigua or Dominica theirlist of injuries is long Theyve seen corrupt governments sadisticschoolmasters domineering mothers who spoil their sons but train theirdaughters to be selfless clotheswashers and feckless men whose only reasonfor living is to seduce women and then disappear Sometimes as in the case ofthe yearold protagonist of Lucy  a Kincaid heroine gets so fed upthat she moves to the United States as Kincaid did at but there she onlyfinds more fuel for her anger in the pitying stares of unconsciously racistwhite liberals            Rage is Kincaids strengthOne senses it above all in her amazing control over words which whileextremely satisfying on the level of literary technique also comes across as arefusal to be vulnerable and a reply to anyone who would try to keep herdown            Stillrage is only one shade on the spectrum of human experience Kincaids newmemoir is more expansive than her fictionand at times more movingbecause init she begins to explore some of the others            The story she has to tell is sadly simple Her brotherDevon Drew died of AIDS in  at the age of  The event was far fromunique of course Many thousands of young men have died a similarlyfrightening needless death and not a few memoirs have chronicled their lastdays And anyway Kincaid wasnt even all that close to Drew He was theyoungest of three younger brothers all of whom shared a father different fromKincaids and although he was sharp and curious as a boy he threw away histalents and made a fatal decision to glide through life on charm alone AfterKincaid moved away he grew up to become an irresponsible pothead Rastafariana boastful ladykiller a gardener who toyed with becoming a singer and gavehimself the stage name Sugar But one of the themes of My               Brother is the overpowering gravitational pull of familieseven ifyours is so sick and infuriating and doomed that you left the country to escapeit When Kincaid finds out that Drew is ill the news comes from a familyfriend since she and her mother are in the middle of a monthslong quarrel andhave stopped speaking she flies to Antigua to visit him and to offerhelp            Criticsoften praise nonfiction by saying that it reads like fiction when all theyreally mean is that it is absorbing and well written In this case thecomparison really does hold up My                Brother reads a little like alyrical mystery novel Its clear from the very first sentence that Drew isgoing to die and what follows is Kincaids attempt to figure out what led tosuch a waste of a life She picks through childhood memories for aforeshadowing of what was to come There was for instance the ghastlyincident shortly after Drew was born when he was lying in the arms of theirmother who was asleep and red ants crawled in through the window and nearlyate him alive And she adds a plot to her unfolding understanding of whathappened to Drew the adult She plants clueschance encounters withacquaintances of Drews whose significance she doesnt grasp until a hundredpages later As with Kincaids novels what stands out is her obsessivecataloging of subtly different emotional states in clear looping musicalprose On a break from the bedside vigil she returns to her family in Vermontand wonders how she actually feels about her brother Love always feels muchbetter than notlove and that is why everybody always talks about love andthat is why everybody always wants to have love because it feels much betterso much better With a scary honesty typical of one of her heroines shedecides that her feelings for him are intense but probably smaller than loveclouded by anger            But this remains a piece of nonfiction andits a handy reference point for anyone who wants to argue that the recentascendance of the memoir hasnt wiped out artful ambitious writing Far fromit Kincaids favorite fictional themes show up in My                Brother and they gain from the reallife urgency Theres the messedup sexuality ofAntigua the way girls are taught to be virgins while boys are encouraged to becareless and promiscuous Kincaids heroines have suffered from this sicktraining and here we watch it slowly kill her brother And there is Kincaidsmother The figure of the motherwronged by men but stronger than Atlasselfish and prejudiced and quite possibly evil but once in a while capable ofinfinite lovehas dominated nearly all Kincaids stories and novels InMy                Brother we see the real McCoy and she is if anything moreformidable than her various imaginary incarnations Click for Kincaidsrecollection of a childhood incident that remained buried in her memory untilhanging around with her mother while Drew died suddenly shook it loose                           My                Brother isa modest little book And yet although Kincaid never says this so grandly youget the sense that Drews death somehow prompted her to look at lifedifferently from a less narrow point of view perhaps and that thediscoveries this book relates might eventually spill over into her fictionKincaids stories so far have been about young women of color born into a worldthat absolutely fails to value them Her heroines have been fierce andadmirable but their struggle to be acknowledged has necessarily entailed adegree of selfdramatizationeven you might say of selfishness The heroineof Lucy rejects the meek role that life tries to assign her announcingI wanted to have a powerful odor and would not care if it gave offense Howmuch rounder a note Kincaid strikes when she writes of Drew And I began towonder what his life must be like for him and to wonder what my own life wouldhave been like if I had not been so cold and ruthless in regard to my ownfamily acting only in favor of myself when I was a young woman After allthese years shes still writing about survival But as of this book it lookslike shes made it to the other side
