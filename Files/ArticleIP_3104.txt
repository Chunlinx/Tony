                                 Slaves of Fashion            It isntjust the widening international scope of the fashion industry that makesclothing design everybodys business these days Its the shows which are evermore fantastic and the press coverage of them which is ever more hystericallyserious It certainly isnt the clothes If you look around at what men andwomen are actually wearing in the big fashion citiesParis Milan London NewYorkyoull see very little evidence that runway fashion has any impact atall The extreme garments created for the shows may be worn occasionally bypeople in fashion showbiz or society But the only way the public has ofrelating to these items is to gasp at them and applaud them swoon over themand deplore them laugh at them and compare themand its not even the clothesthat evoke these responses its their likenesses transmitted by the media            On television we seecloseup interviews with designers babbling tensely just before the show andgasping with relief and fatigue afterward This lets us know how epic thedesigners personal ordeal has been how heroic his endurance The other epicelements of the show are insistent music striking lighting and a piquantsetting perhaps a skating rink But these are beside the point The centralfocus of everything is the bevy of unbelievable models and the way they workClothes no matter how outrageous dont register by themselves Its the girlsparading around in them that make the show dazzle the audience magnetize thecameras and entrance the world Them and the obscurely thrilling knowledgethat they are paid enormous sums to do it            In Paris last week I attended the Vivienne Westwood fashionshow Several palatial chambers and corridors in the  th centuryHtel Crillon were given over to the operation they were packed with rows ofgolden chairs leaving a serpentine passage for the parade and surrounded bybanks of lights and ranks of camerapeople The audience was an untidy mixmilling and chattering in several languages and photographing each other duringthe long wait some dressed in startling Westwoody costumes A tape of Baroquemusic began the mumbling stopped and on came the procession of ravishingvisions They passed inches from me stalking and swaying pausingoccasionally casting friendly looks on one and all They were very young andvery slim  feet tall and distinctively beautiful each wondrously clad in awide range of strong colors and textures that were cut and fitted or draped andbuttoned to mold the body and occasionally expose the bosom or upper thighsIn this show Westwood again demonstrated her talent for employing authentichistorical styles to achieve shockingly modern erotic results The girls allhad fluffy multicolored piles of hair and beestung lips and wore veryhighheeled boots or shoes so they looked like a team even though each costumewas different            Such ensemble work iscrucial at fashion shows On television the camera rests fleetingly andincompletely on a single outfit But in life the important thing is themesmerizing sequence of models At the Marc Jacobs show for Louis Vuitton thegirls all had bare legs and flat mules and their hair hung down perfectlystraight They wore no makeup at all The clothes were unshaped and the colorsrestrained But everybody was  feet tall and slim very young and verybeautiful and paraded with the same pleasing well disposed manner and wellpaced gait through the perversely austere production            At Lanvin there were many nipples visible throughtransparent fabrics At Guy Laroche there were glittering red sheaths belowhuge wigs At Issey Miyake there was stiff fabric sculpted around the bodiesas always At JeanPaul Gaultier everybody was muffled up in boots and longskirts with caps and sweaters hoping to suggest the Left Bank in  Throughall such intensely concocted efforts year after year set ablaze by fiercelights and lashed at by loud music rows of tall beautiful amiable youngwomen stride and pause and turn obligingly decked in strands of rope piles offeathers patches of metal mountains of taffeta Every once in a while one oranother will endearingly stumble            It wasnt always likethis Mannequins have paraded in designers collections since the turn of thecentury but until World War II their status was low and so was their pay Theywere employees at individual designers studios and their job was to resemblestorewindow dummies or the sketchy figures in fashion drawings The sexualcharms of prospective customers were on no account to be upstaged by those ofthe model Mannequins were nameless their standard good looks as uninterestingas possible their erotic selves effaced At Paquin around  models worefleshcolored coverings on arms back and bosom when they showed dcolletevening wear so their bare skin wouldnt be distracting            It has remained true that the fashion models only job isto appear in clothes indeed in the atmosphere in which they shine asindividual stars its all the more important that they have no otherdistracting talents The appeal of these female platoons is ancient potentand forbidden They are like rows of whores or slaves odalisques orconcubines servants in Astartes temple Satans demons as myriad sirens Theydont offer intricate performances that took years of severe training toperfect they dont sing speak or chant they dont earnestly appear for acause they arent eagerly joining in a festival They have no will Theyparade their fresh charms in seductive borrowed plumage for our judgment butonly for the greater glory of the sultan the high priest the whoremaster theringmaster the devil himself the designer and his backer who have bought themas toys to play with Its one of the oldest erotic fantasies recurrent inlegends and fictions of many kinds lending itself well to traditional balletand cabaretsee Scheherezade  La Bayadre  Les Folies Bergresthe Copacabana            We dont allow ourselves toperceive fashion shows as variations on this particular theme because it wouldforce us away from the comfortable notion that fashion is the mirror of ourtime But we do know that deep beneath our surface approval of the wholesomeworldwide tide of luxury commerce that keeps the fashion businessafloatboosting economies promoting employment and cultural exchangeenriching the media with new material and the visual arts with new scopeit isall about sex of a very oldfashioned and dirtyminded kind What we secretlylike about fashion is seeing it perennially exposed in daring costlyridiculous delicious televised runway shows full of mobile passive perfectgirls Anyone looking for a further proof of the return to barbarism at the endof this millennium could probably find it there
