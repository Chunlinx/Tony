          hello   oh   hello   hi hi uh can you hear me   yeah   hi my names Wanette Miller im in Berkeley California who am i talking   Berkeley California   yeah   this is Carla in Sherman Texas   well hello Carla how are you   good how are you doing   im doing fine so you want to talk football eh   yeah thats what they gave us   well i guess you better push one   yeah okay   okay   yeah   um   so tell me do you like football     what yeah yeah i love football football professional   how could you be from Texas and not like football right   right well im not really from originally from Texas but uh professional football is my favorite thing to watch really   yeah so well then in in that case youre probably a devout Forty Niners fan     yeah exactly i do like uh whats his name     like whats his name   whats whos the quarterback out there   Joe Montana   oh yeah yeah i do like him   yeah yeah well i dont know if you know this but do you know that that both Roger Craig and uh oh what is that linebackers name oh Ronnie Lotte   uhhuh   theyre not coming back   oh really   yeah theyve signed with another team   so theyre not going to be as good this year huh   well i dont know those are two heavy duty players   oh yeah   you know Roger Craig and Ronnie Lotte i cant imagine you know so uh   yeah   its just amazing you know you i i i i hope that living there in uh in in Texas you you of course dont let anyone know that you like the Forty Niners do you     not at all not at all im im really a a a bandwagon fan i think i like whoever is good that year     oh yeah well thats all right too   yeah i you know yeah so i so i liked the Forty Niners last year   but uh i like watching the Colts play because im from originally from Indiana and   oh oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute if  the Colts the Colts the Colts i still have trouble adjusting to that the Indiana Colts   yeah the Colts yeah   yes i guess i guess that sort of dates me but uh uh i i still think of the Colts as Baltimore   yeah yeah i know a lot of people do but uh       we like Jeff George so its fun to watch him play being a rookie and all last year   uhhuh   oh yeah   yeah   yeah for sure   uhhuh   but i imagine speaking of football teams you guys have the what happened to Dallas what what whatever happened to Dallas     well they did the wrong thing by uh releasing Landry a few years ago   i yeah i thought they were going to lynch those people   i know   really   i i liked  Tom Landry you know i have no respect for the for the new coaching staff since they ousted him   well you know how do you get rid of an institution like that and and and and justify it i mean   oh not i know not at all   that really was kind of sad i got sort of a raw deal on that   yeah   really     So uh   you you you said something you know uh in in college teams you guys have some some have you got  anything promising this year as far as college teams like like uh Texas A and M     well   or you keech up keep up with collegiate   well i have to admit i dont keep up with Texas i keep up with uh im from Purdue   oh yeah oh absolutely   and and so i keep up with whats going on up there theyre going to have a new coach this year from Ohio State   uhhuh   and uh they it looks looks to be promising for Purdue within the next few years so were looking forward to seeing their program turn around   uh yeah well Purdues been kind of out of it for a long time   yeah   i i i didnt know Purdue i didnt even know Purdue still had a football   oh yeah  you dont hear about them much in fact you dont even hear about their basketball team much any more but you know         thats how it how it goes i guess   yeah well it will be interesting to see well especially you know um uh here here in the in the bay area you know this this used to be the home also of the of the of of the Raiders and   yeah   a lot of people here still feel that the Raiders are are are are you know in are in Oakland but uh i its its going to be real interesting to see what happens because uh there therere a lot of changes are happening here in the bay area as far as that theyre talking about maybe getting a new stadium and with those guys leaving i mean   uhhuh   Feagin and and Ronnie Lotte i i i cant imagine a more devastating blow to a team you know the the uh the the top running back and the top defensive player uh leaving is   right   gee going to be interesting to see what happens   what are they going to do about Bo this year   uh Bo well i dont know what theyre going to do about Bo Bo is is       is pretty much out of it   yeah   yeah i think Bo is youre talking about speaking about Bo Jackson   right   well uh uh uh uh it just doesnt sound like that with whats wrong with him that you know were going to find out what Bos made out of   oh yeah some people think theyre predicting that hell make a big comeback   well uh im sure he wants to but i would be id frankly extremely surprised   yeah i would be too   i really would that kind of you know that that kind of injury is not not something that well i i hope he does you know more power to him i think thatd be just absolutely wonderful so do you i i guess uh uh i ive talked with a lot of folks from from Texas it   yeah uhhuh   a lot of folks from Texas uh on this thing and so its its its  i guess all you folks just kind of got into this thing huh but   right TI uh somehow got us on it   yeah well thats great i mean its kind of fun ive met some great folks i really have and had some great conversations   yeah yeah i bet they love to talk about uh pro football dont they   oh yeah indeed definitely     or any football   yeah well i i i i must admit i as growing up football was really a great part of my life i grew up in North Carolina and   uhhuh   south and and uh played uh football was just you know   you played football for North Carolina   oh yeah yeah i played football played played in college a little bit but
