thebrothel Boult says that she quickly poopedhim meaning that she overwhelmed him  In todaysslang pooped has the sense of exhausted  andsometimes worse            Shakespeare even managed to insert a

was named La Villa Real deSanta Fe de San Francisco de Ass   In later versionsthis grandiloquent title really more a dedicationthan a name sometimes has the definite article lainserted between de and Santa  which changes themeaning from Saint Francis of Assisis Royal City ofHoly Faith to the Royal City of the Holy Faith of SaintFrancis of Assisi   In modern times at least and possiblysince its founding the capital no longer royalhas been known simply as Santa Fe   Since Romancederivatives of Latin sanctus mean holy as well assaint  the Spanish name today like the same namefor several towns in countries of Spanish culturemeans in English Holy Faith  Incidentally Englishspeakingwriters more used to French than to Spanishnames often misspell the name Sante Fe            By whatever name Santa Fe is nestled in thefoothills of a cordilleran spur called the Sangre deCristos   No one really knows how this mountainrange came to be named for the Blood of Christ buteducated guesses are not lacking  At sunset thesemountains are sometimes suffused with a rosy glowthat some romantis souls like to think could haveinspired the descriptive name  However sixteenthcenturySpaniards and their descendants were tooliteral about their religion and too indifferent to natureto be inspired by sunsets  A more probable explanationattributed to a thoughtful historian namedBill Tate is that cruciform crevasses in winter filledwith snow that are visible on the mountainside fromSan Gabriel the first Spanish capital reminded Juande Oate the leader of the first successful Spanishcolonizing expedition of the cross he wore to symbolizemembership in a lay religious order devotedto reverence for the Precious Blood of Christ  Thetrouble here is that according to TM Pearces NewMexico Place Names as late as  the range wascalled Sierra Madre and has been called by its presentname only since the early nineteenth centuryThe most plausible etymology in my opinion suggestedby the learned Fr Benedicto Cuesta amongothers is that the range took its name from penitentechapels or shrines in its foothills consecratedto the Redeeming Blood of Christ at a time when inthe Spanish empire such chapels were so numerousthat Blood of Christ was practically synonymous withchapel             By modern standards the Spanish colonial andbriefly Mexican capital of New Mexico was more avillage than a city  Almost as the Spaniards foundedtheir capital on the ruins of an Indian pueblo theAmerican conquerors of New Mexico built their territorialcapital on and around a dilapidated SpanishMexicancore little of which remains today  Thecity of some  as it exists today derives muchmore from the town built by Anglos who have beenattracted here since the mid nineteenth centurythan from the SpanishMexican colonists and theirdescendants who populated the tiny frontier capitalfor over two centuries previously            The names and architecture of Santa Fe havegone through three parallel stages in a paraboliccourse  The original architecture was Andalusian filteredthrough the tastes and customs of Mexicothen called New Spain and further modified by thematerials available and the centuriesold experienceof the Pueblo Indians  The walls were of adobewhich to the first Anglos was mud pure and simpleIn north Texas adobe bricks were even called Dallasstiffmuds  The roofs were flat and supportedby trimmed logs called vigas  and they leaked  Tomost Victorian AngloAmericans the houses of SantaFe even the sprawling governors palace were atbest unrefined and at worst squalid  So in the secondstage of construction the primitive structuresof the Spanishcolonial past were gradually replacedand surrounded by more proper architectureThe relatively grand new cathedral for instancewas built in the style of Archbishop Lamys nativeProvence  Aside from a scattering of historic colonialbuildings around and near the plaza the oldestbuildings in Santa Fe tend to be in a style that owesmore to the American Midwest and East than to Hispanicor Indian origins  Then came the third stageearly in the twentieth century when Santa Fe wasinvaded by a more sophisticated in some cases artisticcosmopolitan kind of AngloAmerican that recognizedthe esthetic value and appreciated the exoticcharm of the surviving bits of the colonial townand began to cultivate a revival  Others Hispanicand Anglo came to see in this revival commercialpotential and modified versions of the old Puebloand Territorial styles have dominated indeed monopolizedarchitecture in the capital ever since            Nomenclature has tended to parallel the physicalmetamorphoses of Santa Fe  At first andthroughout the seventeenth century there were nostreets to bear names only a nameless quasistreetleading a short way from the parish church  A FriarDominguez is quoted by Adrian H Bustamente inSanta FeHistory of an Ancient City as describingthe villa in  the year of American independencefrom British rule as consisting of many smallranches at various distances from one another withno plan as to their location for each owner built ashe was able wished to or found convenient now forthe little farms they have there now for small herdsof clattle which they keep in corrals of stakes or elsefor other reasons  Such place names as there wereapplied to clusters of buildings such as casas realesroyal houses renamed Palace of the Governorsby the AngloAmericans or Barrio de Analco for thecluster that housed MexicanIndians   Analco is Nahuatlthe language of the Aztecs and means on theother side of the river  Roads entering the settlementwere called by the names of the towns orplaces to which they led such as Camino de PecosCamino del Alamo or Camino de la Canada   Andeventually physical features such a main irrigationditch  acequia madre  or the wall that enclosed theofficial buildings gave their names to streets associatedwith these features  But the oldest streets inthe modern city date back to the AngloAmericanoccupation and reconstruction and therefore havesuch basically English names as Washington LincolnPalace Avenue San Francisco Street CathedralPlace  and so on  These streets and their names correspondto the architecture of the first wave of AngloAmericanoccupation  Likewise the period ofrevival of Pueblocolonial architecture in the twentiethcentury corresponds to an attempt to reviveSpanish or at least historic nomenclature  So therecently constructed loop around the inner city hasbeen named Paseo de Peralta   The thoroughfare enteringtown from the south that was originally calledTelegraph Street because the telegraph line ran alongit and was later renamed College Street because StMichaels College was built there is now romanticallycalled Old Santa Fe Trail             It is in the often hastily constructed and hastilynamed developments on the edges of Santa Fe thatthe names are most feverishly given  In Santa Fewhere the Hispanic heritage and population remainconsiderable the new pseudoSpanish names aremore apt to be correct than in say California orTucson  Nevertheless there are many cases of developerspidgin  The most common solecisms arethose of syntax and grammatical gender  Thoughthere are plenty of examples to show that somenamers of streets in Santa Fe are aware that in Spanisha definitive modifier follows the modified wordso that there are streets properly named for instanceCamino Cerrito Calle Lorca  or Plaza Fatima there are other street names that betray oblivion tothis grammatical rule for example Monte VistaPlace or Cielo Vista Court where Monte Vista andCielo Vista are supposed to mean respectively MountainView and Sky View but so far as they signifyanything really mean View Mountain and View Skyor Heaven   Even more common in Santa Fe arenames in which adjectives fail to agree as to genderwith the nouns they modify for example CalleLargo Calle Lejano  or Calle Contento   This errormay be due in part to the English tendency to reduceall unaccented final vowels to schwa and inpart due to the fact that Spanish adjectives are listedin dictionaries in their masculine forms only  Alsoout of context Spanish adjectives are thought of asmasculine            One can imagine a bulldozer operator as heblades out a road for a new development beinghailed by the developer thus Hey Loyd Here I should explain that there is a fairly recentnew tendency to give Spanishsurnamed babies jarringlyunSpanish first names which results in suchoddities as Loyd Martinez or Priscilla Chavez  Inthis practice I believe we are happily lagging behindthe Brazilians  Hey Loyd how do you saylong in Spanish  To which Loyd Martinez bilingualmight reply Largo            So Long Street would be Largo Calle   To theAnglo ear the final o  an a  and perhaps the e of calleare schwa            No turn it around Calle Larga             Oh yeah now I see it here in this pocket dictionary largo And knowing calle from previousexperience the Anglo developer jots on his padCalle Largo   The phonemic distinction between unaccentedfinal a and o goes in one Anglo ear and outthe other            Finally there are Santa Fe names that are simplypretentious or inept  The Rio Grande the riverin whose valley the capital lies has been called theGreat River in English maybe partly because SpanishGrande suggests English Grand  but in fact RioGrande means simply Big River   Great River wouldbe Gran Rio   That tricky syntax again  Formallycorrect but pretentious is the street name Caminodel Monte Sol  which before it was paved was sometimesirreverently called Camino del Muddy Soil Then there is La Fonda the rather famous Harveyhotel that superseded the old Exchange Hotel whenthe local Anglos woke up to the touristic value ofSpanish nomenclature and architecture  A Mexicannewcomer to Santa Fe once told me that he hadbeen much puzzled by hearing rich Anglo touristsextol the charm of La Fonda in English pronouncedlike fond plus schwa  In Mexico he explained afonda is the cheapest grubbiest sort of dive                              Whereas sexologists have previously asked whetherthe female gentilia resemble those of men Eves Secretsuggests that mens sexual organs may be derived fromthose of women  From a PaladinGrafton book advertisementin The Guardian  nd

locked into thatparticular language structure  As Mr Jacobs affirmswhat does not conform to the rules of ones nativetongue is not just different it is wrong or at the veryleast odd  When I took my first foreign language inhigh school I clearly remember being intolerantlyamused by the peculiar way Spanish speakers saycertain things which I learned were called idiomaticexpressions  They often

Appellate judges differ significantly from othergroups that generate material for their own specializeddictionaries  One difference is that othergroups need to do so because in order to functionthey must either attach new meanings to existingwords and phrases or coin new words and pharasesMost groups go too far partly because the obscurityof their jargon sets them apart from others therebyincreasing their prestige  For example althoughcomputer specialists properly coined byte to representa new concept they could have used the everydayexpression turn off instead of inventing a newmeaning for take down   In contrast in virtually allthe cases I read the judge who wrote the opinion didnot have to invent a new meaning for a word orphrase the relevant statute yielded a clear meaningthat would have resolved the case  The judge whowrote the opinion however did not necessarily likethat resolution            Judicial jargoan also differs from other jargoan inthat the creators of the latter do so openly  They donot pretend that they are merely reading ordinarylanguage as anyone else would read it  After theyproduce enough new meanings or newly definedterms they are likely to publish a dictionary  Theyexpect the definitions in it to supplement not tosupplant secretly the definitions that are in commonuse  Judges however claim merely to be interpretingwords and phrases in statutes either in the sameway that anyone else would or in a way that effectuatesthe legislatures intent  They never acknowledgethat they are in effect writing their own dictionaryin order to arrive at the results they favorTherefore they implicitly replace existing definitionsand because in the future judges will acceptas precedents the cases in which they do so theytruly do change the meanings of words and phrases            The most important difference between nonjudicialand judicial dictionary making is the magnitudeof the adverse consequences  People who arenot judges can do little harm beyond mildly degradingthe language and annoying linguistic purists  Incontrast the statutory interpretation practices ofjudges threaten rights and property  In fact theyeven threaten freedom in a significant number of thecases I read the invention of meaning resulted in acriminal conviction  Also because those practicesmake it nearly impossible to predict the outcome of acase persons litigate even though the plain meaningof the relevant statute is not in their favor and theirattorneys run up huge bills looking for ways to inducejudges to ignore the plain meaning of statutes  Thoseinterpretive practices thus have enormous social andfinancial costs  They also have institutional costs becauseto the extent that they subvert clear meaningthat the legislature created they usurp legislative authorityand diminish the separation of powers one ofthe bedrocks of our system of government            Despite these practices judges are not evil personsThey are operating as judges have operated fora long time  They also reflect their legal educationIf law schools recognized the importance of statutorylaw and advocated interpreting statutes only so as toreveal their plain meanings they would have evenless material to teach  Judgeswho in one senseare merely lawyers in robeswhen they are on thebench also continue the lawyerly practice of beginingwith a desired result and then working backwardsto arguments that perhaps support it  Neverthelessclandestine judicial dictionary making inaddition to its serious social and political consequenceshas deleterious linguistic consequencesThe first step in preventing those consequences is torealize that in courts words are losing their meanings                              The cyclist hopes to survive the mile racethrough

                             A Menagerie of Words            Metaphor the literary process that makes a directcomparison of one thing to another hasa dual personality in word formation  Its facilitatingrole is to create a new word from an existing oneowing to some similarity in their referents  Thus kitewas aptly made from Old English cta hawk since akit hovers in the air in the manner of a hawk            With the passing of time however metaphoralso has a debilitating effect  Only an etymologisttoday would be expected to know of the kitehawkkinship  and only he is able to see a kite in a springsky and appreciate it as the hawk it once was            Since animals are so common they are oftenused in metaphorically formed words  Some animalsare named from a comparison to another animalAardvark was borrowed from Afrikaans aard earthplus vark pig the similarity being the snouts  Alligatoris from Spanish el lagarto the lizard since thegeneral configuration of both reptiles is horizontalChameleon originated as Greek chama  on theground plus loacuten  lion from the shape of the animalsmanelike head  Hippopotamus  from Greek isa horse that swims in a river  Porcupine  fromLatin is a pig with thorns            The metaphor in canary is senseless thoughbecause the word is actually a misnomer  TheFrench canarie designated the principal isle of thegroups of islands  The word had come through SpanishCanaria  originating as Latin Canria Insula Isleof the Dogs  Early explorers on the islands foundgreat numbers of large dogs there and named thearchipelago after them from the Latin canis dogLater there came to be a demand for the birds aspets  They were called canaries and the dogs weresoon forgotten            Original animal metaphors are all but obliteratedin words that have no reference to animals  Anasinine  human action is the one only an ass shouldcommit since ass animal known for its stupidity isbased on Latin asinus ass  To play a bugle is toblow on the horn of a wild ox through Old Frenchbugle  from Latin bs ox  Butter hides the Greekbos ox plus trs cheese  A canard is a false storyfabricated to deceive  The lost metaphor in canardis a duck from a French expression vendre un canard moiti to halfsell a duck  To halfsell anything isnot to sell it at all but to make it seem as if it hadbeen sold that is to deceive            From Greek knps mosquito the Romansformed conopium couch with a net to keep mosquitoesaway  The canopy used as an elegant coveringover a modern bed then is a metaphoric net tokeep the lowly mosquito at a distance  The ultimateorigin of the word is an Egyptian town Canopus  evidentlywell known for the notorious insect  Caper isfrom Italian capriolo male roe deer  One who capersaround is likened to leaping like a deer  A cavalieris tied to his steed through Latin caballushorse  Chenille was so called from its comparisonto a hairy caterpillar from the fabrics hairy textureThe ultimate origin of the word is Latin canis dogThe forgotten animal in columbine is a dove fromLatin columba   The flower of the plant resembles acluster of five doves  The original cynics were Greekphilosophers who made fun of wealth  Their namecame from kn  a Greek word meaning dog  Mostcynics actually lived barely better than dogs            The animal completing the metaphor in dandelionis a lion  It was the French who established thecomparison in dent de lion tooth of a lion from thetoothshaped leaves of the plant  Easel was borrowedfrom Dutch ezel ass  The artists easel supportshis canvas in the manner an ass carries a travelersbelongings on his back  Gossamer is a collectionof weblike material seen floating through theair in autumn  Gossamer was formed from earlyEnglish gs goose plus summer summer  The referenceis either to the similiarity of drifting goosefeathers or to the time of year when geese begin tomigrate  Latin ms mouse is the origin of muscleThe association is due to some muscles shapes beingsimilar to that of a mouse  Also the movement of aflexed muscle was thought to resemble the creepingof a mouse            The animal in hiding in pavilion is a butterflyfrom Latin papilionem butterfly  Early pavilionswere tents which were shaped like the spread wingsof the butterfly  Todays doctors pavilion is far removedfrom a tent  Pedigree completes its metaphorwith the Old French pied de grue cranes foot thethreebranched print of the foot of a crane beingsimilar to the lines showing ancestry on a genealogicalchart  Porcelain was borrowed from Italianporcelaine cowrie shell from a similarity of the surfacesof each  The origin of the word however isLatin porcus pig since the curve of the shell resemblesthe curve of a pigs body                           Ukulele  from Hawaiian is a metaphor from ukuflea plus lele to jump  Since ukuleles often providemusic for dancing the association might befrom the dancers flealike movements or therecould be a connection with Edward Purvis a Britishmilitary officer who popularized the instrument inHawaii            Metaphor as can be seen in this menagerie ofwords is ironic in that it is a great help in the creationof a word but in a certain sense it is also anaccomplice in its death                              Dear Sir            Having lived in Italy for some time I believe Imay be able to answer Barbara Bassetts

Drinking wine can be a lot of fun and talkingabout the taste and aroma of the wine whiledrinking it can make it even more fun  My scientificinterest in wine description grew out of watchingpeople mostly men hold a glass of wine up to acandle swish it around sniff it taste it and uttersome wonderfully poeticsounding remark such asThe burnt fruity nose a bit overpowers the butterylushness of the finish  I was certainly impressed bythe language and I wondered first what thesewords meant and second if I too could learn totalk that way            The first part of my study involved collectingand analyzing those descriptions used by wine writersand enologists to characterize wines  Although thevocabulary can be indefinitely expanded I collectedabout  words that I found to be commonly usedA list of the commonest appears at the end            Some of these terms are straightforwardly descriptivesuch as sweet dry  or woody  but much ofthe vocabulary combined both a descriptive and anevaluative element  If we consider body  for examplewhich corresponds to the amount of alcohol anddissolved solids in the wine we find neutral wordslike light and heavy  but more evaluatively loadedwords like thin or coarse  meaning too light or tooheavy respectively  Some of the wine descriptorsare purelyor at least mostlyevaluative such asgreat noble  and elegant  or hollow and bland             Especially interesting are the descriptors thatare taken over from very different semantic domainssuch as words that describe personality andcharacter aggressive charming diffident honestfeminine masculine   How can these descriptions bemeaningful  In order to understand how a wine cantaste feminine or aggressive  we rely on intralinguisticassociations  Since feminine is semantically relatedto words like sweet perfumed light  and delicate which can be related to the smell taste andfeel of wines in the mouth we can understandhow a wine might be described as feminine             The next phase of my study was designed to determinehow descriptive language is applied towines  Three groups of wine drinkers served as subjectsfor a variety of experiments            The first group consisted of nonexperts from differentparts of the United States who had neverdrunk or discussed wine with each other  At each ofthe five sessions subjects were given three perceptiblydifferent red wines or three different whitewines typically from different countries and fromdifferent varietals wines made primarily from a singlegrape variety and subjects were asked to describeeach of the wines  Though subjects sometimesprotested that they did not know any wineterms once they got going they often wrote lengthydescriptions  As a related task I gave them a list of wine descriptors collected from the first phaseof my study and asked them to circle all the wordsthey considered appropriate for each wine  Resultsshowed not only that the descriptions were differentbut that they were inconsistent  One particularwine was described as sweet a bubbly flowerylight fizzy feeling in the mouth by one subjectquite dry quite tangy by another and harshodor pungent unpleasant bitter sharp by a third            Two observations on the vocabulary may explainpart of the problem  First because people prefersome wines to others and because many of the wordsare valueladen subjects who like a wine used termsto describe it that differed from the words of thosewho did not like it a subject who liked a light winewould not select a negative term like thin   Secondmost of the terms involve a reference to some implicitscale wines may be termed light or heavy sweet or dry with respect to all other wines to winesof that class red or white or to wines of that varietalEach subject was making an implicit comparisonbut the reference was never made explicit  Furthermorepeople who are used to relatively heavywines Chianti for example might find Beaujolaislight whereas people used to light wines such asAustrian reds might judge that same Beaujolais tobe heavy            Another set of experiments used a matchingparadigm  A pair of subjects was given the samethree perceptibly different wines  One subject hadto describe and differentiate them so that his partnercould identify them on the basis of the descriptionsOverall the success level for correct matches was nobetter than chance            Subjects in the second group also nonexpertsmet every two weeks over a period of eight monthsto taste and talk about wine  Tasks similar to thosepreviously described were performed but the goalwith this group was to see whether they would developa consensual vocabulary and come to understandwhat the others meant by the words they usedRecords on consensus were taken at the beginningand end of the eightmonth study  Subjects did notdo much better on the matching task at the end thanat the beginning showing that no group consensusemerged yet they reported that they felt subjectivelythat they communicated better  They learnedwhich of the others shared their own preferencesand whose judgement they could trust  Moreoverthe words they used changed with experience whenit became clear that earthy was used in very differentways by different people its use dropped significantly            The third group consisted of wine scientistsgraduate students and winery staff at the Universityof California at Davis Department of Viticulture andEnology  Among this group there was greateragreement in wine descriptorsbut only with Californiawines that is those wines with which the subjectshad the most experience  On the wines fromPortugal Australia or France their agreement wasno better than that of the nonexperts  This showsthat training and experience contribute to consensualuse of language but do not automatically generalizeto the descriptions of unfamiliar wines  Thereason is that experts first identify the wine and thenjudge it according to the relevant norms for thattype if the wine is unfamiliar they lack the relevantstandards for judging            If the use of language by most people who describewine is so subjective and idiosyncratic shouldthey drink silently  Not necessarily  Much of thetime people describe wines as they are drinkingthem and there is no need to pick out a particularwine  Talking about a wine I believe enhances theexperience by allowing one wine drinker to pointout characteristics that another might miss  Supposethat one person says something like Can you tastethat chalkiness on the back of the tongue  Thisdirects the other tasters to notice something theymight not have observed  It would not necessarilymatter if wine experts or wine scientists would denythat the wine had any chalkiness and that what wasnoticed was something completely different  Muchof our conversation especially in informal settingsis not so much to provide information about the externalworld as to form social bonds  Communicatingabout a personal experience for example how awine tastes is such an activity  And if a winetastingexperience can be enhanced as a results of a descriptionit does not matter whether or not that descriptionis either conventional or accurate  When it isnecessary to be precise and construct a publiclyshared language with clear referents people can doso  Wine scientists for example are seriously concernedwith such goals and have addressed the problemeven if they have not yet completely solved it            In between are the wine writers who want tocommunicate about their experiences and preferencesand make good recommendations  I suggestthat readers try a few recommended wines to see iftheir tastes and word use are in accord with those ofa particular writer  If so they can continue to trustthose judgments if not they should follow anothersrecommendations            For those who would like a list of the wine

notthorough  Here now amid the standard coursebooksand grammars is a specialist dictionary ofEnglish personal names or as we would probablyprefer to call them first names  The modest paperbackcan be regarded as a complementary volume tothe authors earlier work A Dictionary of EnglishSurnames published in   It contains some first names and as well as the main body ofthe dictionary has a brief preface a short section onthe history of English first names a bibliographyand a separate listing of some  derivatives orpet names with cross references to their full form            Inevitably one compares the main entries withthose in similar recent works such as LeslieDunkling and William Goslings Everymans Dictionaryof First Names  and Patrick Hanks andFlavia Hodges A Dictionary of First Names The content and treatment fall somewhere betweenthe two although the style is noticeably more succinctand less discursive  Where Rybakin scoresover the other two works is in the provision ofpronunciations and for a main or source name aselection of literary characters who bear it  In thelatter respect it differs from Dunkling and Goslingwho go more for reallife bearers especially stageand screen celebrities and from Hanks and Hodgeswhose representation of historic bearers is rather restrictedWhen a name is biblical and of Hebreworigin too Rybakin boldly goes where few lexicographershave gone before and gives the actual Hebrewalbeit in Roman transliteration            A typical Rybakin main name entry has sevenitems of information following the headword that isthe name itself pronunciation in IPA gender Russianform both traditional and modern languagesof origin ultimate literal meaning examples of literarybearers and derivatives  Equivalents in otherlanguages sometimes serve as an eighth item  Sohere he is for example in English translation andwith abbreviations spelled out on Susan SUSAN suzn feminine Suzan earlier Suzanfrom French Susanne Suzanne from

Bronts novel Shirley  Derivatives SUE SUEY SUKE SUKEYSUKIE SUKY SUSIE SUSY SUZY                        An entry like this has its good and bad points  Itis good to have the name traced back through thedifferent languages to its Hebrew original but theinclusion of just two literary Susans out of whatmust be hundreds tells us little except perhaps thatthe name was already in general English use in theearly th century  As their role models Dunklingand Gosling prefer the popular actresses Susan HaywardSusan Hampshire and Susan Strasberg whileHanks and Hodges instance no individual Susan atall literary or otherwise            Rybakins range of names is comprehensive  Aswell as all the expected first names old and newthat appear in dictionaries of this type he includesnames that are more familiar from the Bible and literaturethan everyday life so that his letter G  forinstance takes in Galahad and Ganymede and hisletter P Pliny and Psyche  none of which appears inthe other two books  But even if almost no one isnow or ever called by these names it is excellentto have a book that gives their origins if only forpurely academic interest            Rybakins etymologies are mostly quite soundand accord with current scholarship  However heproposes a source in Latin ancillus  servant for Lancelot which like most names in the Arthurian cycleis almost certainly of Celtic origin  He also offers thehoary old bitterness or rebelliousness for Mary whereas it is now thought that the name derivesfrom the Hebrew root element MRH meaning literallyto be plump so in a transferred sense strongbeautiful            In a bare six and a half pages Rybakin takes uson a crash course in the history of English firstnames from AngloSaxon thelbeald to the titlederivednames of modern times such as Duke andEarl   He rightly devotes part of his survey to a considerationof surnames as first names although in hismain entries names of this type such as BradleyChester Clifford and Seymour are simply explainedas deriving from the surname  Dunkling and Goslingand Hanks and Hodges on the other hand takesuch names back to their own origin often in aplacename  But maybe Rybakin felt that thus far isfar enough and that for surname origins the readeris best advised to consult a different dictionary suchas his own            Armed with both his books and of course aknowledge of Russian one

competing books on the same subject appear atthe same time for the reviewer is thereby given theopportunity to compare andor contrast themThese two as can be seen from the bibliographicinformation above are almost exactly the samelength and their trim sizes are identical the typographyof the ODNW is superior as is the bindingNeologisms  though higher priced being perfectboundlike a paperback and characterized by atrocioustypography  According to the blurbs the formercontains  entries the latter  but theODNW is more densely packed with informationat least thirty per cent more by my calculations            More as we all know is not necessarily betterThere is some overlapping of entries but thebooks offer somewhat different kinds of coverageIn the first place with all the new dictionaries publishedsince  and the updatings and revisions ofexisting works that continue to appear both in theUS and the UK it is difficult to see why Green choseto go back to  as a point of departure unlessone takes into account the publication of the BarnhartDictionary of New English Since  and its second edition  and assumes that thisbook was intended to compete with them certainlyNeologisms hasnt patch on Barnharts books  TheOxford work however gives a great deal of usefulinformation largely I imagine because Oxfordscitation files are probably more extensive

in basketball where it first appearedamong the University of Louisville team in the season Louisville player Derek Smithclaims to have coined the name  By  it wasalso being used widely in baseball especially towelcome a player to the plate after a home runand in this respect is similar to the hugs andother celebratory gestures used by British footballplayers  Television exposure soon made it afashionable gesture among young people generallywhat ensured its eventual importation to theUK was its adoption by the Teenage Mutant Turtlesin the form highthree since Turtles do nothave fingers as

and fullness are obviousThe stated purpose of the ODNW  as set forthin the Preface is to provide an informative andreadable guide to about two thousand highprofilewords and phrases which have been in the newsduring the past decade  Green on the other handdescribes a different purpose in his Introductionto witto encompass as wide as pertinent a range ofvocabulary the sole proviso being that the wordor usage has entered the language in the lastthirty years  The basic qualification for inclusionhas been that the language in question hasentered the mainstream                        Thus Green cannot be faulted for offering moresuccinct entries especially when the further commentin ODNW indicates a difference in purposeThe best one can hope to do in a book of thiskind is to take a snapshot of the words and senseswhich seem to characterize our age and which areader in fifty or a hundred years time might beunable to understand fully even if these wordswere entered in standard dictionaries without amore expansive explanation of their social politicalor cultural context                        While neither editor deserves high fives for lucidexposition the message is that different targetswere being aimed at and unless one wishes to haveboth books the choice between them may bethought to remain an open one  Still I am naggedby inadequacies in Greens definition of highfive which suggests that each individual might be simplyclapping his hands together and I am bothered bythe ODNWs failure to note the date of entry intothe language saying that the earliest use of the termdates to  I think that Green is right to hint atthe fact that the gesture preceded its use in sportmy guess is that slap five arose among black teenagersor perhaps musicians as a form of greeting approvalfarewell and the like and was later carriedover into sports perhaps as the ODNW suggests byDerek Smith where it became high five   It seemsunlikely that we shall ever know for sure            One question is raised by the statement in theODNW Why should contemporary users need orwant information expressly prepared for readersfifty or a hundred years hence  The question is ofcourse specious the book is available now for all tosee and if one does not need or want the more repleteversion the abridged style of Neologismsmay well suffice  Personally I like to see as muchdiscussion of the meaning sense development andorigin of a term as I can find but one must sacrificethat to get a longer list of entries  Also one will findjet set in Neologisms  because it was coined after but it is not in the ODNW because it wascoined before   Both list Filofax  Neologismsholding that the trade mark was registered in the ODNW says the early thirties and as expectedthe latter includes several subentries eg Filofiction which indicates not only the productivity ofFilo  as a prefix but the metaphoricity of the elementand six citations Neologisms  in its short entryand one citation leaves the user to derive what hecan about the metaphoric uses of the word            I have not taken the trouble to research the accuracyof the information given in these books butI did note that grody to the max  which is not inNeologisms  is described in the ODNW as US teenagersslang while that might be technically correctI have evidence that leads me to believe that itoriginated in the slang of Hawaiian teenagers andwhile no American would dispute the nationality ofHawaiians responsibility should be laid at the doorof the real culprits            Laurence Urdang                              The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary            Reviewing dictionaries of this kindthose similarin content and purpose to what are called collegeor desk dictionaries in the USis probablyquite useless in providing guidance to potential purchasersthere is always the temptation to carp atomissions cavil at what are seen as infelicities in definingand other information and argue ones caseagainst the theories that are reflected in the organizationof the text  In the long run however dictionaryreviews probably serve no function in the faceof the relatively overwhelming funds at the disposalof some publishers to promote their books reviewsfail to dissuade people from buying bad dictionariessuch a small percentage of the dictionarybuyingpublic attend to reviews that their effect is slighteven when favourable finally the value of a dictionaryto an individual can be tested only over long usewhich even the wisest reviewer cannot anticipate            I have found many things to criticize in theOEED  some of which are matters of accuracy andconsistency and inclusion others matters of tasteand preference all of which I feel it my duty to reportIt is the proper function of a reviewer to questionthe reason behind the publication of a bookthough in the present case I believe it to be thatOxford University Press took a long hard look at therevenues to be realized from a dictionary that couldcompete in the UK market at least with dictionariesof similar length published by Collins LongmanChambers and others  And in the UK market aprice of  might make sense  In the US marketa price of  or  for a dictionary ofabout the same extent as the larger college dictionariesby Random House Simon  Schuster andAmerican Heritage which sell for about makes no sense at all especially when the subjectwork falls short of the competition in a number ofrespects            The encyclopedic sizzle packed into the backof the book seems an unfortunate afterthoughtimitative of a similarly constituted edition of theCollins English Dictionary  and quite sloppily put togetherat that  Many of the pages are not numberedand a number of the callouts labels that is on theillustrations are not even entered into the main textof the dictionary to wit number  flyhalf nosetackle tight end wide receiver safety linebackercornerback  to name a few  A note in Appendix informs that In Rugby League there are no flankersyet under flanker  the definition a flank forwardis preceded by in Rugby and AmericanFootball flank forward is defined as  Rugby Footballa wing forward and I was unable to find anyentry for wing forward  on its own under wing  orunder forward   The difference in style make onewonder about the distinction if any between inRugby Football and  Rugby Football  the Guidein the front is of no help            There is a color map section at the end of thedictionary  There are no illustrations in the text            The encyclopedic character of the bookthen cannot be traced to the handful of listings anddiagrams in the back matterstructure of theUnited Nations genealogical table of British sovereignsand other dull material easily found in othersources it must lie in the text itself  Sure enough inthe entry for Rugby we find out why the football hasits present oval shape because they originally used apigs bladder which as we all know is footballshaped            Getting into the dictionary itself one becomesaware that something is a foot for there are not asmany headwords as one might expect to find in otherbooks of this size  The reason is that OUP havecleaved to their favourite structural approach to thelisting of compounds phrases and hyphenatedwords by nesting them beneath the main word  Ihave never been a devotee of that approach not onphilosophical grounds but on grounds of convenienceto the user  In the OUP system chainarmourchain bridge chain drive chaingang chaingearchainletter chainlink chainmail chain reactionchainsaw chainsmoker chainstitch chain storechainwale  and chainwheel are all entered as subentriesunder chain                        The most naive speaker of English realizeswithout going into the details of their syntactosemanticrelationships that chainarmour and chainmaildo not bear the same relationship to chain aschaingang chainletter  and chainstitch  that thechain in chain reaction is different from that in chainstore not a store where one buys chains and inchainsmoker not a person who smokes chainsand that while chain drive and chainsaw are relatedbecause both are driven by chains the use of chainin chainlink and chainmail is semantically misleadingfor the chief characteristic of a chain is its onedimensionalitywhile chainlink and chainmail areof course twodimensionalcreating what might beconsidered a bent metaphor  To me the placementof chainarmour under chain strongly implies themeaning armour made of parts linked together as ina chain but that is certainly not the case as thedefinition at once makes clear  In other wordschains are characterized by sequential linear linkingin which the parts or interlocked end to endclearly not the case in chainarmour or chainlinkfor instance  However unfortunate purists mightview that fact to be at least if the entries are listedseparately at some graphic remove from the entryfor chain  their physical distance would make theirsemantic metaphoric distance more understandableIf the only reason for submerging these compoundsunder a key word is that they share an elementthat has the same form then I consider thatinadequate  If there is any justification for submergingthem then it must be that there is a semanticcategory of chain that suggests twodimensional interlacingin contrast to linear interlocking anotherthat suggests the notion of interconnected sequencewhich would take care of chainsmokerchain reaction chainstitch  etc and other describablesemantic reflexes            At least the subentries under chain reflect thesame form as the headword  That is not the case foralternating current  a subentry under alternate  orthe array to be found under pass  which includes inpassing participlegerund make a pass at nounpass by verb passed pawn adjectivepast participleThis grammatical gallimaufry is not even in alphabeticalorder for pass through comes before passthe time of day is there some rule about ignoringarticles that I missed  Then thinking that we havecaptured them all we find that passkey passmark and password are given separate headword statuspresumably because they are solid  But the vagariesof spelling are such in our language see the list atchain  that one never can tell where to look forwords unless they are to be listed in some uniformfashion  Thus the user has to come to the dictionaryalready aware that peaceoffering and peacepipe arehyphenated so they are listed under peace  whilepeacemaker and peacetime are solid hence are headwordsthat is not very helpful if as is most likelythe user merely wanted to discover whether theword he was seeking is spelled with a hyphen as twowords or solid            Do proverbs have a place in dictionaries  Iquestion their status as lexical items but cannot argueon safe ground because they might well be categorizedas part of the encyclopedic informationThus we find cast pearls before swine under pearlbeggars cannot or must not be choosers under beggar and even more curiously know the time of dayunder time   I doubt that cannot or must not appear inthe second proverb as frequently as cant I cannotrecall ever having heard must not or even mustnt but the last expression is always preceded by not and other representations are inaccurate            Other unpleasant questions arise from inconsistencies              Why is George Gershwin identified as beingof RussianJewish family while Irving Berlin is describedas Russianborn and Benny Goodman andLeonard Bernstein as American  There is nosuggestion at their entries that Fats Waller DukeEllington or Louis Armstrong were black butwhile no direct mention is made of Bessie Smithscolor the encyclopedic informationin a sixlineentryyields the intelligence that She died frominjuries received in a car accident reportedly afterbeing refused admission to a Whites only hospital              Why is Ralph Vaughan Williams listed underVaughan Williams but Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appearsunder Doyle                          Why is the dispute between the Greek governmentand the British Museum over the ElginMarbles raised in a dictionary regardless of how encyclopedicit is              What accounts for the seemingly randomamount of space devoted to biographical entriesElgar gets  Elizabeth I  Elizabeth II  quiteunrevealing though friendly and chatty            The question of whether proper names of peopleand places have a rightful place in a dictionary isprobably an obsolete one their presence was formerlyjustified on the grounds that as words theyare far more frequent than many of the legitimatewords like elytron greave or mithridatism   Thatmight be justifiable if there were accurate frequencyinformation available  That not being the case certainnames are in because the people and places arewell known some are in because they belong to categorieslike presidents of the United States worldcapitals all places with a population exceeding xthousand and so on  By frequency standards thenMillard Fillmore Arthur Meighen and Eadwigwould be unlikely to make it though I expect tohear from their respective booster clubs            Balance is a questionable feature in this bookthe information about LSB Leakeys widow andson seems a bit over the top as does the note abouthis citizenship Captain Cook gets  lines theUnited States  Niels Bohr  Shakespeare and so on  One might think given the emphasis onencyclopedic information that etymologies of placenames would be included but they are not  The basicproblem is that the editors did not seem able tomake value judgments regarding the amount ofspace to be devoted to the entries on the one handwe find acid house chaos theory and desktop publishingnone of them succinctly written on theother long strungout entries on Steffi Graff MargaretAtwood and Paul McCartney and to whatavail  As a consequence of all this deadwood we aredenied useful lexicographical information like thefact that chapter and capital are cognates            Were I to nitpick at missing entries I suppose Iwould find the kinds of omissions that amateur reviewersdelight in but I shall mention only one  Onthe day I picked up the OEED to review PhilipHowards feature WordWatching in The Times November  used in his definition of cicisbeismthe word poodlefaker which as near as I can makeout is an obscure or archaic Briticism possibly militaryslang  Still neither is in the OEED  though bothare in Collins English Dictionary             As might be gathered from the foregoing I amnot enamored of this book as a dictionary though Imust admit that it is different and might well set atrend in reference books  We seem to be entering astage when many families might have in the entirehouse only one book that provides any clue to whatis going on in the real world  I suppose that if that isthe case this one might be it            Laurence
