          okay uh do you work outside the home   no i do not   okay wow  have you yes uhhuh   do you have i uh no not actually   okay well yes i do in fact i am at work right now uh and so let me take the lead uh Angela uh i think   okay   what is really important uh  of course salary is very important because thats why you are working for your for the money but job satisfaction to me is also uh very important in having a job and uh one of the things that uh she asked us to discuss was benefits uh im assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you   right   okay and so we could we could talk about uh that path you know how important you think his benefits are and and and uh how important you think they are and if what would you like to see increased in his benefits like uh perhaps uh he has uh   okay     the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family uh uh and how much coverage uh it provides and also your hospital coverage and uh um probably dental how important you think that would be   right i i think that job wise benefits are important just as important as salary is   because they of course if you did not have them you would be pulling from your salary of course right right   exactly exactly especially when you have a family with children and you are always going to the doctor for   and they always have surprises for you with children you know and so its it is uh   exactly they always do   we could not do without the benefit package from from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small uh uh business   yeah i think any any even if your insurance policy is not the greatest   you would still have something   exactly you  you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time   right   just by yourself also  for working women   yes   uh i think a lot of the companies should start providing for day care in the in the in the building   uhhuh they are getting a handle on that in fact uh my oldest daughter is uh is uh a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and thats one of the areas that she is working on to have uh uh a day care center for the individual the children of the of the nurses that are staffing the facility   right   and that is true in many many areas of you know uh job titles   yeah   and professions   like in may case i have three children   uhhuh   from ages nine to two and its just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that i would be making would be going to day care   sure would it would it would be just futile   and it would be just basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care center exactly   and they would not have the quality and they would be deprived of their mother yeah no i understand that totally   besides which it would be easier uh theres a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of women are starting to have babies without a partner and to go to work   oh i hear yes thats true   you are worried about your child besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care and if they were in the same building   right uhhuh   then you are going to the same place and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child or you know and take your breaks with your children or something   yes do you do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting do you think that would be   i think that i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper   acceptable i do too right that you right thats right with the company than than having to go   with the company helping our if everybody you know pulled their own weight in it   thats correct thats right yes i agree with that   i think it would be really really great   that would be fair   yeah   yeah   i do   uh and how how do you feel about uh lets see eye care   eye care is good i dont im not sure i dont think we have that on our policy   okay   but uh we   vision i guess its called vision care   yeah it would be great i mean uh the glasses that the exams themselves are not expensive its the glasses   it depends on who has examines your eyes   yeah thats true   if you have an an ah optometrist or an ophthalmologist theres a vast difference in those two uh professionals   right now like my right well like my mother she has to go for testing cause she has got   glaucoma   well she does not have it but she is like on the verge of it or something her eyes are changing and she has to be tested periodically and and those are expensive tests   oh oh okay so yes uhhuh yes they are   now i think your insurance covers her on that but you know for something like that   uhhuh uh   it thats just as bad as a medical you know thats   right thats critical because shes in need of it so often yes   right   and you know we have uh needs in our life that are unique to us and uh you know people have needs in their life that unique to us to them   right   i mean we are all different so   now i i would like to see bettle better dental insurance to me was that our beep   well no thats my other phone   oh huh   so thats it thats okay my that phone is ringing to an empty desk and shes on vacation  so its okay   okay but with the three children   uhhuh   um orthopedic care um not orthopedic orthodontic ca re   thats very expensive   because on on a lot of the dental insurance they do not cover that well for the the orthodontal stuff   yes thats true orthodontic work is terribly expensive especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth and   yes it is uhhuh   and you have to really get them when they are young in order to have uh not uh a decent smile when they are fifteen sixteen years old   right   i know two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight uh because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth   yeah   and we footed the bill because there was not any such thing and when they were young   right my middle child needs to have uh orthodontic hes because his his pallet is squared not rounded   oh uhhuh   and it affects his speech a little bit not not anything you know   uhhuh major   right but just enough that his bite is off a little bit and its like four hundred dollars and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it   uhhuh well i tell you i i just read an article in the paper about what they are doing i think it was an ad in in our publication at Texas Instruments where they are breaking the jaw and and lining the jaw up with the teeth its its less painful and less expensive   oh really   yeah   that sounds like it would hurt more   i i know but it its its uh easier on the patient in the long run which amazed me   oh gosh i i would much rather that do that to myself than make my five year old  go in and do it that would kill me
