                                 The Rating Game                           XitStrategy                        David Edelsteins Blame Blockbuster Not theMPAA makes good points about the way that the aftermarket also influenceswhat can be seen in theaters But I believe the MPAA is partly to blame forthat situation because it allowed first the X and then its clone the NC tobe described as categories hospitable to hardcore pornography My hope is thatan A rating would work specifically because the NC would be retained togive Blockbuster something to feel pious about            The current situationhas become impossible The R rating has been stretched to the bursting pointand now permits material that would have been NC a few years ago Yet aKubrick film cannot be seen as he intended it             Roger Ebert                        ChicagoBurning Bush                        I was disappointed in Michael Kinsleys  becauseit took so many cheap shots and was so internally inconsistent He firstasserts that George W Bushs having an opinion about how one gets to heaven istantamount to condemning most of humanity Then in response to Bushsefforts to get out of this subject by stating that God decides who goes toheaven Kinsley mocks him noting that we can stipulate that God decidesWell which is itis Bush condemning people by having an opinion or is he aweenie for saying that God decides            Then after frying Bushfor having a view idly wondering if he is an antiSemite and criticizing himfor trying to avoid a theological quagmire in the midst of a politicalcampaign Kinsley attacks him and others for not sticking to their true viewsand also criticizes the general public to which he was pandering only a fewcolumn inches previously for caring about what other people believe about suchissues Reallyit seems like Mike is trying to have his cake and eat itseveral times             SteveAeschbacher                        Woodinville Wash                           The Road toHell                        Who in the hell careswhether anyone thinks someone else will go to heaven See Michael KinsleysGo to Hell Does this belief change ones ability to govern This should onlymatter if the person governing is governing over the place where admission tosame is the governors prerogative As long as the religious belief of theperson governing does not promote or condone acts of violence against thosegoverned or in the repression of those who fail to share hisher religiousconvictions then the beliefs that the governor holds are not a newsworthyevent or even the publics business We in the United States seem to give toomuch weight to things that do not have any bearing on the persons ability tolead the country I couldnt have cared less if President Clinton had anextramarital affair other than that he spent taxpayer money to get ontelevision and swear to us repeatedly that it did not happen His affair has nobearing on his ability to do his job  his dishonesty does If we ever provethat George W Bush has lied to us at our expense then this will be a factorthat should be weighed in determining his ability to truly lead this countryBut otherwise so long as his religious convictions no matter how weak orstrong they may be are not geared toward the outright oppression ordestructionneglect of those who fail to share his views they should notmatter and warrant no scrutiny             Jeffrey KHonor                        Raleigh NC                           Closing theCircle                        I shall direct my remarks to Ellen McGarrahan I like you on the morning of May   attended the legal execution ofJesse Tafero at the Florida State Prison I like you was attending hisexecution as a witness not for my former employer the Florida Highway Patrolbut to complete a cycle A promise to myself as it were You see unlike youI was on the scene the morning of Sept   after Jesse Tafero shot andkilled state trooper Phillip A Black and his friend Canadian constable DonaldIrwin Irwin was unarmed I will save you the description of the scene thatmorning but it is indelible in my mind as Taferos execution obviously is inyours Your murderer you said suffered for seven minutes I cannot tell youthe length of time it took Black and Irwin to die Irwin was shot through theeye Black was shot multiple times and had a stun gun used on him Then the twowere left to die on the pavement I thought it more than a little curious thatyou did not mention those fine law enforcement officers in your article            I realize the purpose ofyour article was to indict the electric chair as well as to generate sympathyfor the likes of Jesse Tafero Yes the death penalty involves deathUnfortunately it is often the death of a law enforcement officer thatinitiates the process I am somewhat surprised that you did not invoke thatoverworn liberal word deterrent somewhere in your article But then youressay was not against the use of capital punishment only the barbaric electricchair Well Im sorry that I cannot join your indignant outrage If someonebeing electrocuted in the chair God forbid happens to get burned or suffer anosebleed so be it One fact remains above all others it was Jesse Taferoschoice             Don Walston                        Fort Pierce Fla
