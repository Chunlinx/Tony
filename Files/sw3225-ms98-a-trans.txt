        okay so youre into microwave cooking     yeah its just its so easy nowadays you know and its uh especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave and it be ready in just a few minutes   and that yes and thats what we all are looking for isnt it something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work   yeah   ive gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that i have leftovers all week   all week well weve done that too theres just my husband and i and he he sometimes makes a huge spot of uh pot of spaghetti and we   umhum   you know were eating it for a week and a half and i kind of get sick of it after a few days   i know i try not to make too much its just my husband and i too and i try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week but uh i usually i usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or you know something like that or sometimes a roast but   uhhuh yeah right right   whats your favorite thing to cook if youre having a dinner party   um i have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas   oh   its its really good i got it from a friend of mine that i used to work with and uh every time ive served it everybody just loves it   uhhuh ooh that sounds delicious   so thats thats one of my favorite things to make  what about you   umhum we i end up with an old standby that we call Russian chicken because its so easy   umhum   and uh it goes you have to cook very little to go with it just some rice and some salad and thats about it you know   uhhuh well what do you put in it   uh you make you just take your boneless chicken breasts and then you take and make a a dressing out of uh Russian dressing one bottle of that   uhhuh   and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix   umhum   and three ounces of apricot preserves   ooh that sounds good   and you mix it up and you just put it on the top of the chicken and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour   uhhuh   and then i take the foil off and let it brown   uhhuh   takes about another twenty minutes   uhhuh   and its delicious   ooh that sounds good   and its so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business and by the time ive got everything else ready the chickens ready chickens done   is done right   so thats a real easy thing for me   yeah that sounds good too   umhum   ive got a um  a great recipe for cheesecake   oh really   i dont know if you get Southern Living that magazine   no i dont my mom gets that but   they have one if you like to cook they have every recipe ive tried out of that has been a really good one   really   and um you know every month theyve got all different kinds of recipes but i got one in there about a year or so ago on cheesecake and its just a regular cheesecake and then you can put raspberry um topping on it but inside the cheesecake uh recipe you put um   umhum   lemon peel and orange peel   hm   and its just enough to taste it you know when when when youre eating the cheesecake and it is wonderful but it takes a long time because you have to cook it for forty five minutes and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for another forty five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty five minutes   hm oh my goodness   and then youre supposed to um i think chill it to room temperature   umhum   so sometimes ill do that overnight and then put the topping on the next day but its its very good   well i love cheesecake i have never been i dont know the ones i have made i have not done that well with   umhum uhhuh   i like a baked cheesecake you know i dont ive had a recipe that someone has given me that its kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it you know but thats not the same as a a New York style cheesecake   right yeah no no   and uh the recipes that ive used everybody will say oh this is real simple and then i make it and its its really not very good   its not right   but yours sounds good i bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness   it does and it it it is really good   hm well that sounds interesting so theres your good dessert for your dinner party   it is it is pretty good right     are you into serving wines with your dinner party   oh sometimes but i mean im not a wine connoisseur by any means   me either i wish i knew more about it   ive been to you know some wine tastings up in Napa Valley but um   umhum   you know and i learned a little bit about them then but you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take   umhum they would be if you just had time to do it   and yeah and then theres places um do you live in Dallas okay theres places here that um   umhum   offer i think its like once a month you can go and to a particular restaurant or whatever and you can kind of take a cooking class   umhum   and then you get to eat everything afterwards and then they also go into the wines you know to serve with you know different types of of meals and that kind of thing and it sounds like its a lot of fun we have some friends whove done that and theyve really enjoyed it   well how neat umhum hm well i didnt even know they were offering that i guess i   yeah this place is called like Medinas or Mesinas Kitchen or something like that   umhum oh well i bet thatd be a fun thing to do   yeah it it sounds like like it
