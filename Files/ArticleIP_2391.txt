our protagonists acting in unavoidable response to theexigencies of a contest dominated by the incumbents strategy and tactics setout for the heartland in a manner similar to his where beneath stormrivenskies suggestive of incunabular Turners the desperate reality of their taskbegan to reveal itself rising like a black basalt orogeny from the soft soilsof internecine enthusiasm            Chapter              the locomotive a dieselburning Class Santa Fe  that had been constructed in  but had survived the decadesmost admirably and now gleamed like a Secret Service agents lapel pin wasgaining speed swiftly its one hundred and five tons departing anotherwhistlestop in another anonymous town whose inhabitants clustered where therails seemed to converge their fluttering hands and smiling faces congealedinto a tuberous mirage that already was beginning to deliquesce its bipedalspores gamboling away from the station where only moments before thecandidates had stood to receive the traditional accolade from the traditionalclosepacked crowd            The last car with itsfunereal platform and tufts of bunting gave off a flapping chorus thatenveloped Dole and Kemp as they looked backward down the rails Around themedged subalterns each plucking away like a bluesuited migrant worker thedecorations that went up before each stop The crew had to work quickly lestmomentum send the froufrou and gewgaws drifting onto the roadbed In a minutethe removal had been accomplished and the two men on whose behalf thisexcursion had been undertaken again had the expandedsteel protuberance tothemselves Even Glassner for dogs years Doles body man and coat carrierhad retired to the common area where the staff would be attempting its usualstab at gaiety They believed in Bob Dole they had to believe in him even ashis brooding presence infected the farthest corners of the campaign with anacidity specific to him His people would never admit what he was admittingthat the prize he had chased almost all his adult life was bound to elude himin the most humiliating manner            His capacity for gloom had ever equalled his capacity forwork but he could never have foreseen his worst musings outgalloped by thecampaign of  a brokenbacked stumble in which no error was too small toconvert into an enormous problem He had in his wretched twenties dangling bya wrecked arm on a homemade exercise gibbet accepted no hugged to himselfthe knowledge that life was hard and then you died It was damnably unnaturalthis state to which he had most ironically ascended When things were in theirproper order a buoyant spirit led not a mordant one and what was he if notthe most mordant man in America It was a cruel fate to replay in parallax therole he had taken decades back with the affable Ford a man who like Kempcould be counted on to float above any malaise like an empty water cask It wasas if he had been struck by a hail of red Kryptonite and instantly become theBizarro candidate immensely strong yet unable to prevail against thebackwardbeating current            Dole who at the rally had projected a steelyexcitement the contained enthusiasm of a veteran politician in firm grip ofhis emotions but willing to share with his supporters what bits of them hemust sank back into himself simmering in a glumness he wished he couldcontain but knew he could not Terrible things had always happened to him andalways would this was only the latest of them but it was a terrible thing ofa specifically galling nature He was the most prestigious passenger on ahellbound train a shining doomed conveyance hurtling down a narrow and fataltrack Through all his trials darkness had always been his strength anobsidian girder holding him to the path now it stood to crush him and perhapsnot coincidentally the entire Republican ticket which his opponentseverclever propagandists had labeled as DoleGingrich as if he and thepumpkinheaded speaker had conspired like Jesuits to ruin the nation            Kemp leaned closerspeaking more loudly than was necessary perhaps to compensate for the rush ofair around them and the clatter of steel wheels beneath and behind Somethingpreoccupies you Bob Kemp said I thought that was really neat back theredidnt you            It was Kemps habit to voice such banalities in an utterlyunironical manner a gift of naivet withheld from Dole since birth and madeeven more distant by life Why could he not have been born a Kemp blessed byluck and genes with the smiling disposition of a boy who is shown a stable fullof ordure and instantly concludes that there must be a pony in there somewhereDole was sentenced to always know better than what he wanted to believe            Yes most assuredly he replied struggling not toanswer with a grunt I sense we might profit from a few minutes out of theweather Of course there was no weather to speak of but he had learned athousand years ago that sometimes he had to say something            Certainly his running mate said stepping asideso the older man could enter the rail car He did so with surety using theelbow of his bad arm to steady himself at the threshold then raising bothfists in a stretch At the far door a steward stood            Your pleasure gentlemen            A Diet Coke if you will please Kemp chirpedCaffeine free            None for me right themoment thanks            Dole pulled off his suit jacket and assumed his usualposition in an overstuffed chair on the starboard side of the car He loosenedhis tie Kemp still wearing his jacket did likewise            What troubles you my friend he asked again Isit the poll numbers The backbounce We have as yet seven weeks to do thethings we must Do not despair            As you know despair is not in my vocabularyDole said leaning suddenly so that he was looking Kemp in the eye He wantedto bark out the syllable that had become his hated signature but did not Damnthe myopic but allseeing eyes of that newsferret Cramer for having the cruelwit to reduce him to an onomatopoeia No longer could he essay an Aaargh inpublic or private without apprehending in his marrow that he had become what hewas described as being            No what is on my mind is the damnable situationinto which we have been thrust by this contest Dole continued rising to hisfeet Clinton and his railroad trick have forced us into a like strategy Iwould vastly prefer to travel by aeroplanethere is no substitute for theswiftness the ease the comfortbut here we are bumping along the groundlike a crippled millipede waging a campaign that could have been waged in thelatter days of the last century            But surely Bob you must acknowledge the romanticappeal of the tactic Kemp said At Nixons grave remember it was you whoinvoked the whistle in the night the long rumbling procession of cars carryingsomeone else somewhere else            Yes yes I recall my eloquence all too wellDole said exasperated at having been caught in the web of his own rhetoricBut I was not running for president then            Kemp grinned impishly Bob you have been runningfor president since  he said What would you say to a little gamesomething to take our minds away from the press of combat            The suggestion relaxed Dole Excellent he saidLet us commence with a session I will wait on the platform while you makeready            Kemp velellidous mopshining like the crest of a blowdried raptor reached for their instrumentsUpon joining the ticket he had instantly made it his habit to maintain theequipment            Amid the clotted air on the platform Dole let his eyesease into the night Bob my friend Kemp called from the center of therailway car He was holding up a pair of grey rectangles linked by a blackumbilicus and each winking a single garnet eye Excellent news I have foundthe Game Boys The batteries are as fresh as new flounder Lose not aminute            Dole could never have predicted that in this hisgrimmest hour after all these years of morosely pursuing the presidency hewould come to enjoy as his particular friend a chronically cheery formerfootballer who could broadcast an enthusiasm for gimcrack economic theory insuch a way that one could not tell if he was embracing it or mocking it Nowas he squinted at the red lights in Kemps fists and felt his companions boonpersonality radiating in his direction he also faced the knowledge that lifewas more durable than pain more difficult than you could have imagined andyet still you lived as he now lived seeing that his last campaign the battleto the candidacy would be his last success He stepped inside and closed thedoor on the wind
