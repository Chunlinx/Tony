                                 Bring On the New Order                        Hello Richard            Interesting thoughts indeed            Susan Faludi says the old order is breaking down Iagree She says Oh Dear and I say Hooray The only problem I have isthat its not breaking down nearly fast enough due to vested interestsinstitutional inertia and lots of uncertainty about the new models of wealthcreation that will replace the industrial leviathan Gender has a role to playhere too Men have dominated the old order Or perhaps its more accurate tosay that a certain interpretation of masculinity based on dominance has imbuedthe old order Many men feel comfortable with what they know and its notclear that they will be able to enjoy the same kinds of perks from theirmasculinity as wealth creation evolves toward new models in the next centuryFifty years of social science have decried what that old order did to humanbeings A quick glance at my bookshelf tells that story Alienation and Freedom  Class andConformity  The Hidden Injuries of Classbrilliant still The Organization Man The Lonely Crowd  if we believe what weve beensaying then we should all be celebrating            Why is this order breaking down If you read Faludi theanswer seems to be something likefickle and inept commercial interestssuddenly turned on to the financial benefits of treating employees like paperclips This is simply wrong US employers have always been arrayed insomething of a normal distribution with some being quite progressive andhumane offering great benefits and employment security and some being rightbastards Most were somewhere in the middle treating employees like paperclips when their balance sheet required them to do so This situation has notchanged Today the really cool companies that make the Fortune cover with their great family policies benefits andsecurity employ at most about  percent of the workforce The normaldistribution still holds for the rest Despite all the hype about the end ofloyalty most of the studies conducted by labor economists show that the lengthof time that people spend with an organization and the number of changes theymake during their careers has not varied dramatically over the lastquartercentury There was an increase in the churn rate for younger lessexperienced managers in the early s during the recession but even thatappears to have moderated            So in what way are things changing The short answerhere I think is choice The very success of the old order has created newchoices as well aseducated informed people interested in new choices Theelectronic infrastructurenetworks PCs the Internet wirelesscommunications satellites etcis increasingly making it possible todecenter from the old epicenters whether those are the cities like LosAngeles and London and New York or the old organizations themselves in theirskyscrapers and industrial parks This means new choices for employment and newchoices for consumption People vote with their feetand will increasinglyThey dont want to depend upon the oldstyle institutions for their employmentor their consumption They are seeking ways to exert more control over theirown lives and in the process to enhance the quality of their lives            For all the narcissism of those who are busy ringingaround the anthills of Los Angeles and New York in order to be winners inthose loony hierarchies the new boomtowns in the United States are in placesrecently regarded as pastureland places like Douglas Colo and FayetteGeorgia and yes even Camden Maine Here the old definitions of whats globaland whats local no longer accurately describe the scene In these new worldspeople are participating in the global economy while their lives remaincentered in their families and their local communities Nineteen ninetysevenwas the first year in which there was a net migration away from the cities andsuburbs to socalled rural areas The United States now has  millionhomeoffice households which is  percent of the total  millionhouseholds More than twothirds of those home offices areincomegenerating            In the  th century mostcommercial activity was based at home Craftsmen had their shops out backMerchants met clients in their formal parlors But in the  th century men were plucked out of their homes to go to work infactories and offices Perhaps as a way to displace their collective griefthey decided that the workplace was really important and what went on at home well that newly feminine world was at best a distant second The only guywho was allowed to work from home without being regarded suspiciously was thepresident who still conducted business in his White House Places like Mainereunite the  th century with the st  Youre right its not like living in NewYork or Los Angeles Thats the whole point And there are vast numbers ofeducated people who can now free themselves from the hegemony of the oldepicenters to live the life they want without sacrificing their participationin the global economy            So where does this leave the masculinity crisis Itbrings us right back to choice The people making these new choices are theones forcing the breakdown of the old order Yes its doing plenty to makeitself vulnerable but organizations based on the old industrial model aresimply not the first choice of an increasing number of people who work andconsume The new path they are forging is still in its infancy but unlike theedges of the stream that Susan Faludi chose to shine her lights on these arethe trends on which I place my bets for the future For the men who are makingthese new choices I dont believe there is a masculinity crisis but rather aliberation from an identity constrained by the I am what I do and the I ammy status on the totem pole mentality that dominated the emotional lives ofmost men in the  th century These men areexcited about carving out a wider individuality in which they can develop andenjoy a more spacious and multifaceted sense of self For those who continue topursue the more traditional masculine identity there is no crisis but ratherdenial They will work to keep those identities intact until something happensin their personal or professional lives that profoundly challenges their senseof meaning Only then will they choose to change I loved the way Faludishowed Mr Stallone teetering on this choice Unfortunately he didnt knowvery much about choosing friends capable of a commitment to the person he couldbecome rather than the man he had been You called the men Faludi interviewedlosers Its a hard word but there is truth there They are losers becausethe old identity is foreclosed to them while the new choices dont appear to beaccessible And it is precisely for this reason that however important theirstories may be they do not provide a basis for generalizing about the state ofmasculinity today            More tomorrowShoshana Zuboff
