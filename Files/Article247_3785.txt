                                 On Rereading Guumlnter Grass            Since Gnter Grass won his Nobel Prize a week ago critics have argued thatGrass political views make him a parody of a leftwing German intellectualWho can take seriously a man who mourns the lost asceticism of East GermanyBut the question the Swedish Academy forces us to address is not whether Grassis a Soviet apologist The question is is he now or has he ever been a greatnovelist            Pretty much everyone agrees that Grass is not a great novelist now Nothinghe has written since  when he completed his first three novels TheDanzig Trilogy  that is which is made up of The Tin Drum  Catand Mouse  and Dog Years is memorable and a lot of it is bad Thatincludes The Flounder  published in the United States in  an epicdisquisition on the perfidy of women Grass leftism does not extend tofeminism that is narrated by a fish and continues through centuries withasides on matters of sexual and culinary history Culturebox has not readGrass  novel The Rat  but Ian Buruma has described it as tales ofthe end of mankind with the German chancellor riding through the forest inwhich concentrationcamp victims disguised as mutilated fairytale characterswere roaming around the poisoned trees This typically German combination ofdark ecology and Nazi trauma found such disfavor Buruma continues thatGrass went off to India to sulk Last week Culturebox read large chunks ofGrass latest novel The Century  to be published in the United Statesthis December and it seemed like a decidedly minor booka Ragtime likefantasia comprising  short monologues each narrated by someone with someconnection to one of the past  years none of them with EL Doctorows witor affection In any case the Swedish Academy has explained why it gave Grassthe prizebecause of his first novel The Tin Drum  published in            The Swedish Academys defense of their selection echoes the conventionalwisdom on The Tin Drum for the past  years that it made Germanliterature plausible after the Holocaust had made it impossible Specificallysaid the Academy The Tin Drum brought German literature back to lifeafter decades of linguistic and moral destruction This statement harks backto a famous  essay by the literary critic George Steiner who askedwhether the German language had survived the Hitler era whether wordspoisoned by Goebbels and used to regulate and justify Belsen could ever againserve the needs of moral truth and poetic perception            What is it about The Tin Drum that unpoisoned the German language andmade it safe for moral truth The novel tells the story of Oskar Matzerath whowas born in  in Danzig as Grass himself was a city on the border betweenGermany and Poland Oskar possesses an adult awareness from birth but developsa powerful revulsion against the petitbourgeois society in which he findshimself so at the age of  he decides to stop growing up This he achieves bythrowing himself down cellar stairs Thereafter he plays a tin drum in lieu ofspeaking aloud and when anyone tries to take it away screams so shrilly thathe shatters glass all around him Kept home from school he becomes anunblinking observer of the world around himhis mothers adultery the rise ofNazism Kristallnacht  the invasion of Poland the ravages of war andafter the war the economic miracle            Contrary to the popular understanding of the book Oskar does not provideits moral center He is not antiNazi nor does his story per se serveas a critique of Naziera Germany Whenever people claim that The TinDrum is an antiHolocaust novel they invariably cite two scenes In thefirst Oskar sheltered under a rostrum at a Nazi rally disrupts theproceedings by pounding out the threequarterstime beat of a waltz andconfusing the marching band so that everyone waltzes off The second sceneoccurs during Kristallnacht  the night of broken glass when the Nazisdestroyed most of the synagogues and many of the Jewishowned stores inGermany Oskar discovers that the Jew who sells him his tin drums has committedsuicide in his store while storm troopers rampage around his corpse poking itwith puppets and dropping their pants to shit on the floor            It soon becomes clear however that neither Oskars drumming nor histhoughts on the Jewish toystore owner are politically motivated He is aperfectly amoral character with the selfabsorption of a child an observer butnot a critic a participant who neither is nor isnt a responsible party hesGrass disturbingly neutral allegory of the German people Later Oskar willwillingly play his drum for Nazi officials Nor is the Jew a sympatheticcharacter In an earlier scene he seemed a figure from a Naziera movie a Jewobsessed with a German woman in this case Oskars mother whom he begs onbended knee to run away with him to London            If The Tin Drum has a negative take on Nazism it is expressedobliquely through explosive bursts of irreverent language and by dint of thefact that in  Grass talks about things such asKristallnacht something few other German writers did at the time atleast not so boldly In the toystore scene for instance Oskar says of aneighbor who also took part in the great national pogrom though he wasnt inthat particular store Meyn was not there he says just as the ones whowere there were not somewhere elsea swipe at all the Germans who claimed notto have been around whenever Nazi crimes took place Culturebox has not readthe book in German but those who have say the writing is stuffed withsimilarly witty phrasing The German critic Hans Magnus Enzensberger haswritten of how Grass ranges with masterly skill from highflown parodies ofCatholic litany to the impersonal tone of case histories to slang to dialectand so on            But does relentless even brilliant irony remain an adequate response tothe Third Reich knowing as we do now so much more than we did then The Germanscholar Ernestine Schlant the wife of Bill Bradley doesnt think so Sherecently published a book called The Language of Silence  about Germanliteratures relationship to the Holocaust in which she accuses Grass of aflippant disregard for Germanys victims There is an ingrained obtusenessand insensitivity to those who suffered and died evident in a language wheresilence is veiled in verbal dexterity and a creative exuberance rooted inpreHolocaust aesthetics This seems strongyou can condemn a criminal regimethrough an unsympathetic portrayal of its perpetrators as well as throughsympathy for those they killedbut its true that in  Grass dance of themacabre does come off as weirdly timid Compare the eeriest passages of TheTin Drum with Daniel Jonah Goldhagens descriptions of the wintry deathmarches by means of which the Nazis killed off most of the remainder of theirconcentrationcamp prisoners at the end of the warexercises in puresurrealism with skeletons moving slowly through a wellfed Germancountrysideand suddenly even Grass fertile imagination seemsimpoverished            Grass sarcasm is a welcome respite from the heavyhanded literalism of somuch contemporary Holocaust narrative from the  television seriesHolocaust another mass catalyst for German selfawareness toSchindlers List to the odious Jakob the Liar  And yet for allof Grass rage at Germanys crimes the fact that The Tin Drum rarelynames those crimes or explores their existence and seems so focused on thesouls of the Germans with little empathy to spare for their victims makes thebook feel more like a step on the way to something than like the thingitselfwhether that thing be a more moral or simply a greater work ofliterature A few years after the book came out George Steiner himself doubtedwhether Grass really was the savior of German literature that people weremaking him out to be in Steiners name His quibble was that Grass efforts tocome up with an adequate description of the brutality of German society had inmany ways brutalized him Grass he writes is nearly always too longnearly always too loud But he concluded Totalitarianism makes provincial Grass ponderous gait the outmoded flavor of his audacities are part ofthe price German literature has to pay for its years in isolation In shortThe Tin Drum did restore German literature to the world and the world toGerman literature But like Grass himself what once seemed a masterwork hasbeen overtaken by history
