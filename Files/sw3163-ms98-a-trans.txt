                okay well originally i guess women were um in the house cooking and uh cleaning and all that good stuff   taking care of children   oh yeah oh actually the children they they dont have as many children these days   thats right   because theyve gone out to work and theyre um  uh well the families of shrinking the divorce rate is up um theyre still trying to get the pay that uh the men get um i guess even farther back um they uh used to not even have sports for the women   umhum   and uh then the women starting wearing the tennis shoes and playing sports and going out to work um     well i i was thinking too in terms of of in terms of this you know the education is so different i think women are so much better educated now than they used to be and i think that makes a big impact on what women do   oh sure   um also i was thinking the the clothing has changed so dramatically uh you know you like when you said with sports i thought well it was so limiting because of their clothes   umhum uhhuh   they werent allowed to to wear certain things and so then they couldnt participate you know they couldnt participate in sports because of it so um i thought thats thats made a difference uh   uhhuh yeah well its kind of ironic theyre also  these days theyre trying theyre working their way back into the house   umhum   and theyre trying to have the best of both worlds   umhum   and theyre just now figuring out in the Nineties that its not quite working   right   and they cant have both   yeah   so um i guess theyll have to make a choice   well i think so or spend part of their lives doing one thing and part of their lives doing another you know it   right theyll just have to allocate that time   yeah uh because you know because really it isnt that long a period of time that you have to be home with children uh comparatively speaking if you look look through your whole look at your whole life um and i do think theres real value in being in the home uh i do sort of both but um   umhum   you know it it is its an interesting topic i the thing thats been hard for me to believe too is that how long how short a time its been since the women had the vote and thats always been amazing to me     umhum   that thats been a relatively short period of time and i think that made a major impact on womens roles uh you know from that point on   um umhum well i guess the men have definitely figured out that women are as smart   i   theres a considerable amount more um theres a considerable more amount of doctors these days than there used to have been and of course you like you said theyre more educated   thats right   and um uh weve weve uh brought quite a bit to the world   well and it will be fascinating to see within the next twenty to thirty years how that changes even more i think the impact will be felt more and more as as better educated women come into the work force um and more and more women come into the work force um   umhum   i you know it its going to just change things drastically i think   well some women are actually leaving the husbands home with the kids   thats right  thats right     and well i dont wanna talk about the husbands changing roles but theyre all theyre learning to cook now and to do the laundry and uh all of those good things   well i think that you know that one of the things that may come out of this is to let people do what theyre best at you know some people uh may men may stay home with children better than some women may and so whoever   umhum   you know whoever does which role best i think should do it  um   umhum   if if people can compromise and do that kind of thing   umhum   that that takes a lot of   yeah its no surprise that uh movies like Dances with Wolves have come out in the Nineties   uhhuh   and their influence uh with the men   umhum   and uh the changing of roles actually   umhum umhum   uh that was a very good example of women in the Nineties and whats a real man and a real woman you know they uh they do a little bit of both um the hard labor and uh   yes   you know the smart the uh all brawn and no brains on both sides   thats right thats right well  i think thats all i have to say do you have anymore nice talking to you thanks byebye   okay well it was nice talking to you okay thank you bye
