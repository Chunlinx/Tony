                                 Liberal Tobacco Whores            To liberals Harry McPhersonis a saintly figure As a longtime aide to Lyndon B Johnson McPherson was animportant advocate for the civilrights movement a dove on Vietnam and one ofthe architects of the War on Poverty In  when marchers were attacked inSelma McPherson helped persuade LBJ to deploy the National Guard to protectthem Inside the White House he tried to talk Johnson out of escalating thewar            TodayHarry McPherson is a tobacco lobbyist representing Philip Morris RJR Nabiscoand the three other tobacco companies that have been negotiating a globalsettlement with the attorneys general of  states McPhersons heavilyDemocratic Washington law firm of Verner Liipfert Bernhard McPherson Hand is being paid about  a month by the tobacco industry according tothe National Journal  As senior partner McPherson has also helpedrecruit liberal heroes of a more recent vintage as cigarette lobbyists Thefirm recently deployed Ann Richards the acidtongued former governor of Texasto work on the settlement alongside former Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell who was already on the case Other wellknown Democrats have alsojoined the tobacco team recently Carter Eskew a political consultant who hasworked for Sens Chris Dodd Joseph Lieberman and Tom Harkin is giving mediaadvice to the companies involved in the billion settlement with the helpof others at his Democratically inclined PR firm the Bozell Sawyer MillerGroup            It is hard to say precisely what all these bignameDemocrats are doing on behalf of the tobacco companies According to a reportin the Dallas Morning News  Ann Richards who is not a lawyer recentlypaid a lobbying call on Sen Ted Kennedy to encourage him to either support theagreement which needs congressional approval or softpedal his objectionsRichards declined to comment as did her former Chief of Staff Jane Hickie aVerner Liipfert attorney who is one of four lawyers conducting negotiations onbehalf of the industry Mitchell also declined to comment as did Eskew Noneof them has yet filed a lobbying disclosure form that might give additionalparticulars McPherson says that his own work involves advising the tobaccocompanies and lobbying the White House and Congress to support the deal            Unlike Verner Liipfertsrecently acquired Republican bauble Bob Dole who is still covered bypostgovernmentemployment restrictions on lobbying Mitchell is free to workhis former colleagues Mitchell was the one who brought the tobacco companiesin as clients and who participated in some of the early negotiating sessionsBut McPherson says Mitchell hasnt yet done much talking on Capitol Hillbecause he has been too busy as special envoy to the Irish peace talks Butthat distraction hasnt stopped Mitchell from lobbying on other issuesAccording to a recent issue of Roll Call  Mitchell and Dole workedtogether on a provision of the budget deal on behalf of Fruit of the Loom WithMitchell working the Hill and Dole advising backstage the firm succeeded instriking out a provision supported by President Clinton that would have allowedmore apparel imports from the Caribbean            To seethese two former legislative colossi bury their ideological differences andcome together on behalf of American underpants is either inspiring orgrotesque depending on your perspective But while Doles agreement with thefirm is that he wont lobby for the tobacco companies Mitchell is likely toply the corridors of the Capitol for them this autumn            McPherson argues that lobbying on behalf of thetobacco settlement is not the same as working for the tobacco companies underordinary circumstances something he suggests his firm would not have done Hesays the proposed deal serves the public interest by restricting cigaretteadvertising and marketing and by requiring the tobacco companies to cough upbillions if youth smoking fails to decline dramatically If Congress enacts itin pretty much its current shape I believe it will be the biggest step forwardin public health with regard to tobacco in history McPherson says Thetobacco companies have had to come forward with an inconceivably large numberof major concessionscommitting to change everything about the way theyadvertise and market cigarettes            BerlBernhard another Verner Liipfert partner who is an oldtime liberalheworked for Edmund Muskie and at the US Commission on Civil Rightsoffers asimilar defense of his firm He says that Verner Liipfert agreed to take ontobacco clients only after being persuaded that they were ready to mend theirways and that a global settlement would serve the common good Bernhard aversthat he has been amazed by the billions of dollars the tobacco industry hasagreed to pony up The amount of money is staggering he says They havegone way beyond where I thought they would go            In a deal like this its not unusual for both sides toclaim as McPherson and Bernhard do that theyre getting the short end of thestickthats all part of the negotiation What is truly odd is lawyerssuggesting that cutting a lousy deal absolves them of blame for working forcreeps This defense is also preposterous Like any lawyers the VernerLiipfert attorneys are trying to get the best deal they can for their clientsThe morality of their participation doesnt depend on how badly they do            McPhersonand Bernhard also stretch the bounds of credulity when they suggest that whattheyre doing is OK because theyre merely working on a settlement not ontraditional tobaccoindustry concerns such as preventing regulation Theres nomoral distinction here You settle a case if you believe youll be better offdoing so And in any event theres no reason to think Verner Liipferts workwill be confined to the settlement An April  statement announces that thefirm has been retained to provide counsel in light of the heightened legal andregulatory activities surrounding tobacco products I asked both Bernhard andMcPherson whether the firm would in fact limit its work to the settlement Bothanswered in lawyerly fashion that the issue of work on other matters hasntcome up            Finally it is fallacious to suggest thatbecause society may benefit from a compromise with an evildoer work on behalfof the evildoer is justified If Verner Liipferts lawyers are goodand theyare at least well connectedthey will strike a better bargain for theirclients than the clients would otherwise have got These lawyers might make thecase that even tobacco companies have rights and that the public interestactually was served by getting these companies a better bargain But theydidnt make that case at least to me They themselves appear to acceptor atleast to be unwilling to challengethe widely held assumption that the publicinterest lies in the worst possible deal for the tobacco companies            The traditional lawyersdefensethat the Constitution entitles everyone to legalrepresentationhardly cuts it here either Working for Philip Morris isntlike defending an indigent murderer in a death penalty appeal Its more likedefending a rich mobster Philip Morris is going to have decentqualityrepresentation whether or not any particular lawyer decides to sully his handsAnd in this instance the lawyer defense is even weaker because MitchellRichards Eskew and the others are working not just as lawyers but aslobbyists and media advisers as well Despite the best efforts of Washingtonsinfluencepeddling community theres still no constitutional right to lobbyingor PR If you cant find a lobbyist the court wont appoint one for you            Former Republican NationalCommittee Chairman Haley Barbour too is working on behalf of the companiesinvolved in the settlement and he deserves as much scorn as his Democraticcounterparts But somehow you expect that from Republicans whereas you dontexpect it from bigname national Democrats especially Northerners like GeorgeMitchell The only thing you can say on behalf of the liberals is that whilegreedy operators on both sides have sold out to the tobacco industry theyalone seem to feel a bit embarrassed about it
