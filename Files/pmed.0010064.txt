                    Introduction        Antiretroviral therapy ART has been a milestone in the treatment of HIV infection        Current treatment guidelines for HIV infection in the United States recommend the        initiation of ART in patients with CD T cell counts of less than  cellsl  In        implementing these guidelines healthcare providers face the ongoing challenge of        developing treatment strategies that minimize drugrelated toxicity and adverse effects        while retaining effective control of viral replication Furthermore treatmentassociated        costs particularly in resourcepoor areas difficulty in maintaining longterm optimal        adherence  and the emergence of viral resistance  have limited the feasibility        of lifelong ARTmediated viral suppression increasing the need for alternative treatment        strategies Intermittent therapy strategies consisting of alternating cycles on and off        ART have increasingly emerged as a potential intervention to address limitations of        continuous ART  Therapy interruption TI studies in ARTtreated patients with        suppressed HIV infection  have addressed the general questions as to whether such        strategies can achieve greater viral control through increased antiviral responses        autoimmunization hypothesis or simply serve as a strategy to reduce cost of longterm        therapy and drugassociated toxicity While pilot studies and uncontrolled or incomplete        trials in patients with chronic HIV infection have addressed viral and immune outcomes of        fixedlength TI and fixed ondrug cycles  no completed randomized        controlled trial has yet addressed by intenttotreat analysis the outcome during an        openended TI of sequential TIs versus continuous treatment in patients with confirmed        suppression The largest study to date in this area is the prospective singlearm        SwissSpanish Intermittent Trial SSITT conducted in  recruited patients undergoing        sequential wk TIs and showing a lack of impact of this strategy on achieving sustained        viral loads of less than  copiesml off therapy in those that completed the study         However the lack of a control arm in this study has left unanswered questions about        the impact of multiple TIs on time to rebound immune reconstitution therapy failure and        viral resistance when analyzed against a randomized control arm of continuous treatment        followed for equal time before a single openended interruption        We completed a randomized controlled trial on the outcome of repeated  to wk TIs in        patients with chronic infection in which the comparator group maintained continuous therapy        and then an openended interruption period was applied in both treatment groups The study        addressed the potential for repeated interruptions of therapy to delay time to viral        rebound as a primary outcome and analyzed secondary outcomes regarding studydefined safety        criteria viral suppression and resistance and retention of immune reconstitution                    Methods                  Participants          Between August  and December  we enrolled  patients infected with HIV who          were older than  y and on ART eligibility criteria included CD counts of greater than           cellsl on ART with a nadir of no less than  cellsl ARTmediated suppression            copiesml for more than  mo and less than  copiesml at recruitment on any          antiretroviral regimen Approval of the study protocol was obtained from the          institutional review board IRB of the Philadelphia Field Initiating Group for HIV          Trials Philadelphia Pennsylvania United States Written informed consent was obtained          from all patients Human experimentation guidelines of the United States Department of          Health and Human Services and of the authors institutions were followed The study          protocol including the patient consent form the CONSORT form and the IRB approval can          be found in Protocols SS                          Randomization and Study Design          Fortytwo eligible patients from the Jonathan Lax Immune Disorder Clinic in          Philadelphia Pennsylvania were randomized via sealed envelopes in a  fashion to a          first phase phase I of either  three successive TIs of   and  wk respectively          or  maintenance of ART for  wk before a final interruption of therapy in both arms          phase II subject to therapy reinitiation criteria as described below Phase II          consisted of an openended interruption to allow for virological and immunological          comparisons between the groups off therapy Study visits were every  wk for the repeated          interruptions group and every  wk for the continuous ART group during phase I Both          groups were followed every  wk during phase II We followed a study design with          stepwise increases in the length of TI cycles to address potential safety concerns          resuppression was confirmed after shorter TIs before longer interruptions were          initiated and the hypothesis that sequential viral replication intervals would stimulate          viral control and a delay in time to viral rebound          Phase I procedures for the repeated interruptions group included the following           Interruption of therapy was individually timed to occur after two HIV RNA measurements of          less than  copiesml without any viral load measurements greater than  copiesml in          between these interruptions increased from  to  to  wk sequentially  If a log          or greater reduction in viral load did not occur by  wk of reinitiated therapy or less          than  copiesml was not achieved within  wk of reinitiated therapy patients were          withdrawn as therapy failures and a resistance test was performed  Patients were also          withdrawn as therapy failures if a the CD cell number declined by more than  of the          baseline CD count b participants developed an opportunistic infection even if          retaining required CD count levels or c a viral load of greater than           copiesml occurred once with or without development of acute retroviral syndrome as          defined by fever skin lesions and pharyngitis          Phase I procedures for the continuous therapy arm included the following  patient          monitoring if detected viremia was between  and  copiesml with the patient          withdrawn if their viral load did not return to less than  copiesml immediately prior          to phase II and  patient study withdrawal as therapy failure if during the wk ART          period viral load rebounded to more than  copiesml at two consecutive time          points          Phase II procedures for both arms included the following  monitoring for patient          study withdrawal criteria as described in phase I  determining time to primary end          point of a viral load greater than  copiesml  monitoring until the time of          therapy reinitiation at a viral load greater than  copiesml for three consecutive          time points and  after reinitiation of therapy followup on therapy to confirm          resuppression to less than  copiesml at   and  wk on therapy Clinical and          laboratory parameters CD count and viral load were monitored at each visit and venous          blood was collected for additional secondary outcomes during selected study visits          In both phase I and II participants taking nonnucleoside reversetranscriptase          inhibitors NNRTIs were instructed to stop them a day earlier than the remaining drugs          in the regimen                          Primary and Secondary Outcomes          The primary outcome was time to confirmed virological rebound during phase II Rebound          was defined as first time point with greater than  copiesml Viral replication          magnitude as defined by mean HIV plasma RNA area under the curve AUC          HIV RNA  was measured as a secondary outcome at weeks  and  of          phase II based on reinitiationoftherapy criteria outlined above          Additional secondary outcomes included  safety outcomes serious adverse events          SAEs and patient withdrawal based on criteria defined above  retention of          ARTmediated immune reconstitution and  detection of viral resistance Retention of          immune reconstitution was analyzed by  sameday whole blood flowcytometrybased          analysis of CD and CD T cells including total and nave CD lCDRA and memory          CDRO subsets as described  and  sameday recall response analysis of          peripheral blood mononuclear cell lymphoproliferative responses to           Candida albicans as described  Viral resistance mutations          were retrospectively analyzed on cryopreserved plasma samples by genotyping of first          available sample with viral load greater than  copiesml following each interruption          using the TruGene Assay Visible Genetics Toronto Canada at the Gladstone Institute of          Virology and Immunology San Francisco California United States as previously          described                           Sample Size          The sample size required was calculated using PS  software and based on a type I          error of  with  power to detect a difference of  wk or more in time to viral          rebound between arms Eighteen patients per group resulted in sufficient power  for            for  to determine a difference of  wk or greater between groups in time to          rebound of virus during the openended interruption Assuming a loss to followup of           we targeted  patients per group or  total                          Statistical Analysis          The primary analysis was an intenttotreat analysis in which dropouts were assigned a          week  rebound time eg maximum failure to delay rebound In secondary analyses          these dropouts were excluded The logrank test was used to test the null hypothesis of          no difference between arms in the number of weeks from initiation of the openended TI to          reaching viral rebound as defined Patients not reaching end point at  wk after the          beginning of the openended TI were censored Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to          compare baseline and week  of the openended interruption between groups Wilcoxon          signed rank tests were used to test for no change from baseline to week  of phase II          Finally Wilcoxon rank sum tests were employed to test between groups for equality of the          mean AUC          HIV RNA up to  and  wk In all cases a twosided alpha level of           was used to define statistical significance Unless otherwise stated results are          presented as median interquartile range in text and tables

of the two groups at baseline are          summarized in Table  Seventyfive percent of participants were on their second to          fourth regimen while  were in their first regimen           No significant difference was found in baseline parameters between          arms with  of patients on proteaseinhibitorcontaining and  on          NNRTIcontaining regimens Owing to the high participation of patients on NNRTIbased          regimens and concerns about TI and safety in general patient outcomes and treatment          failure were reviewed monthly by the IRB of this study during the first  mo of study          quarterly for the following  mo and semiannually thereafter Figure  shows study          design for both arms with a median followup of   wk during phase I for the

count reviewed further below or due to studyassociated SAEs disease progression          or acute retroviral syndrome However four nonstudyrelated SAEs occurred two          patients from the continuous therapysingle interruption arm were hospitalized one for a          cholecystectomy and one for acute rectal bleeding during the wk ART period a patient          from the repeated interruptions arm died of liver cancer during week  of the openended          interruption after previously reaching a viral load greater than  copiesml yet          electing to stay off ART and a patient from the repeated interruptions arm developed a          transient ileitis                          Immune reconstitution          No significant difference was observed between groups in CD T cell counts at the          start of phase II as illustrated in Figure  In addition no difference in the          percentage of nave CD cells or decrease of recall response to           C albicans was observed confirming the absence of          significant differences in the retention of baseline immune reconstitution correlates          between arms However a significant decrease in the abundance of CD cells relative to          other T cell types as summarized in CD but not in absolute CD count  was present in          the repeated TI arm corresponding to a significant increase in CD T cell count In          spite of fluctuations in CD T cell count levels between the start and end of each          monitored TI a recovery of CD count levels was achieved upon resuppression following          each TI in conjunction with a retention of lymphoproliferative responses against           C albicans before during and after each TI as illustrated          in Figure                           Viral resistance mutations and therapy failure          An intenttotreat analysis of the combined number of patients per arm with detected          resistance mutations irrespective of therapy failure in phase I and during the final TI          in phase II showed no significant difference between arms continuous therapysingle TI           repeated TI            p            Studydefined criteria for therapy failure of a previously suppressive regimen were          met by  patients in the continuous therapysingle interruption arm patients S          S S and S in association with selfreported nonadherence to therapy and          detection of resistance mutations in phase I as listed in Table  One patient in the          repeated interruptions arm  patient S failed therapy after  wk following the          third TI by maintaining a viral load between  and  copiesml in the presence of          previously undetected resistance mutations          In patients who reached phase II in the absence of therapy failure a total of           patients were identified to have resistance mutations at the first viremic time point          continuous therapysingle TI  repeated TI            p   A greater number of resistance mutations was detected in the          repeated interruption arm as summarized in Table  In ten out of these  patients a          change in resistance patterns was observed when comparing the first viremic time point to          the last All  of  patients in Table  who reinitiated therapy retained suppressive          ability of their respective regimens as did all other patients who did not show          resistance mutations in phase II In the repeated interruptions arm analysis of newly          detected resistance mutations in phase II as defined by a lack of detection during          viremic time points in phase I identified  patients patients S S and S with          this pattern see notations in Table                             Discussion        Earlier reports on TI strategies in patients with chronic HIV infection include multiple        pilot or singlearm study designs centered on the effects on viral control by comparison        with pretherapy periods detection of resistance mutations without parallel followup of a        continuously treated arm and inclusion of variable criteria regarding viral resuppression        before proceeding with repeated TIs  In contrast our strategy mandated        resuppression of viral replication to less than  copiesml before each TI and presents        the first comparison of viral replication during a final openended interruption of therapy        between patients randomized to complete three sequential TIs or stay under continuous        therapy Our data based on intenttotreat analysis did not show that repeated TIs        resulted in a clinically significant virological benefit as measured by the time to viral        rebound to more than  copiesml see Figure  Secondary astreated analysis on viral        replication magnitude also indicated a lack of difference between arms Consistent with the        findings of SSITT  analysis of our data by the categorical classification of a        responder as a patient with viral load less than  copiesml at week  off therapy        showed no significant difference in this frequency between arms single TI  repeated        TI  suggesting the presence of responders irrespective of previous        protocolmandated TIs        Based on secondary outcome measures the incidence of adverse events SAEs therapy        failure and patient discontinuation or clinical disease progression as indicated by CD        count on therapy or opportunistic infections was not observed to be different between        arms Prospective safety outcomes in our study are in accordance with reports from a        retrospective analysis of  patients who interrupted treatment at least once          mo without an increased risk of HIVassociated morbidity or mortality with the exception        of patients in Center for Disease Control and Prevention stage C during first interruption        only  In regards to immunological outcomes a concern associated with interruption of        suppressive therapy is the potential for irreversible viralmediated CD T cell loss        leading to disease progression  We did not observe a decrease in CD cell numbers or        lymphoproliferative responses against         C albicans when measured between arms before the openended TI        see Figure  nor following resuppression after monitored TI reinitiation cycles in the        repeated interruptions arm see Figure  The latter is consistent with observations by        others and does not support an immediate immunological cost to shortterm TIs         However we do show that monitoring CD cell numbers by percentage could        lead to misinterpreting a significant loss of CD cells as a result of a significant        increase in CD count following TIs even though absolute CD count numbers remained        unchanged see Figure  Interestingly the increase in CD T cell number also        corresponded with an increase in HIVspecific responses as measured by interferongamma        expression data not shown which in light of an absence of effect on viral load between        arms further supports that TI strategies alone may not significantly alter the preexisting        balance between viral replication and host antiviral responses         Importantly no evidence for an increase of viral resistance in association with therapy        failure was present in the repeated interruptions arm See Table  We did not observe a        greater clinical failure of NNRTIbased regimens in the repeated interruption arm due to        single drug periods as predicted by recently redefined drug halflife estimates and the        presence of viral replication during each interruption  However the percentage        of patients with resistance mutations detected in this study in the repeated interruption        arm  is higher than the  observed in the SSITT cohort  in which patients with        prior treatment failures were excluded  We interpret this difference to mean that the        resistance detected off drug in both our and their cohorts is likely associated with the        greater number of drugexperienced patients in our cohort  and the detection of prior        archived resistance mutations as supported by Metzner et al  who documented in          SSITT patients the presence of minor populations of MV occurring at least once off        drug during interruption of therapy        In spite of the lack of difference in the total number of patients with resistant        mutations detected on therapy during phase I and off therapy in phase II   versus          respectively in both arms we do report in similarity to others a greater        detection of resistance mutations in the TI arm when restricting analysis to the last        offdrug period only  as three of   had mutations detected off drug in the        continuous therapysingle interruption arm compared to nine of   in the repeated        interruption arm However based on the lack of association between viral resistance        detected offdrug shortly after TI and resuppression by the same regimen in all patients        it remains undetermined to what extent TIs favor the detection of archived mutations in        chronically suppressed patients and to what extent these mutations are a signal for a        future therapy failure The latter is best exemplified by the data we collected on patients        on NNRTIbased regimens in the repeated interruptions arm where two patients S and S        showed KN detection only during the offdrug periods in the absence of therapy failure        while maintaining the same regimen after each TI including poststudy followup Table        S On the other hand virological failure in the continued presence of an NNRTIbased        regimen in phase I was associated with detection of KN as observed in one patient S        in the repeated interruption arm and three patients S S and S in the continuous        therapy arm with selfreported nonadherence        Drug resistance that occurs during virological drug failure predicts virological        responses to salvage treatment  In contrast the clinical implications of drug        resistance mutations that appear shortly after TI in chronically suppressed patients are        not clear Case reports in this cohort of patients have demonstrated that drugresistant        variants that appeared during TIs may not persist in subsequent time points even after        repeated use of the same antiretroviral regimen  We now observe that drug        resistance appearing during TIs can be transient since  and  of patients listed in        Table  showed complete and partial reversion to wild type respectively when comparing to        resistance at the last available viremic time point in phase II See Table  Further we        observed durable resuppression of plasma viral RNA level in many patients who had        drugresistance mutations off therapy that would otherwise be expected to affect part of        their treatment regimen when reinitiated see Table S Virus populations that expand        shortly after TI may lack all of the adaptations required to achieve high levels of plasma        viremia in the presence of drug during continuous treatment These adaptations may include        the resistanceassociated mutations which were detected as well as secondary mutations        that may increase the viral replication capacity  or envelope adaptations required        to escape concurrent humoral immune responses  It is of interest to note that        despite the large amount of research activity on TIs in patients with suppressed chronic        infection and the hundreds of monitored interruptions studied to date only limited cases        of development of clinical resistance as evidenced by a lack of viral resuppression        following therapy reinitiation have emerged in contrast to the multiple reports of        detection of viral sequences off ART associated with resistance as shown in this study and        others         Taken together while our data show no clinically significant benefit for repeated TIs        of less than  mo in patients with CD counts greater than  on therapy with regard to        viral control as defined by time to rebound secondary outcomes document no significant        difference in levels of retention of immune reconstitution between arms and no increased        incidence of virological failure as a consequence of TIs While our data indicate that this        TI strategy should not be pursued outside of a clinical trial setting we argue that it        will be important to collect additional data on the potential benefits of drugsparing        regimens such as reduced longterm toxicity and reduced cost and to define longterm        outcomes in comparison with continuous therapy
