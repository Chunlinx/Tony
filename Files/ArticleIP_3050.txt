                                 Accidental Writer            No authors name not evenShakespeares has the talismanic effect of Chekhovs Speak that name to anyintelligent reader or theatergoer and his eye turns inward though not awayand his mouth drifts into a soft private smile Chekhov belongs toeveryone who knows him            Thus anew serious biography has a commanding basic importance And Anton ChekhovA Life does more than fulfill basics The author Donald Rayfield whoteaches Russian literature at the University of London and has previouslywritten two critical books on Chekhov spent three years in Russian archivesgoing through among other items  letters written by Chekhov letters addressed to him These materials had not been thoroughly examinedeven by Russian scholars because the Soviet authorities had wanted to keepChekhov quasicanonized The result of Rayfields research is a book thatamplifies much that we have known and adds much in color and facet that hasbeen omitted or only sketched up to now            Rayfields prose is of the packhorse variety bearing alongits load of information sturdily but not with much grace Like many biographersof our day empowered by new research technologies he is reluctant to discardany of what he has been able to harvest He includes minor stuff merely becausehe has culled it Do we really need to know the eventual fate of a shopboy whoonce worked for Chekhovs father But Rayfield gives us a more roundedportrait of Chekhov than we have ever had less sanitized and he deepens theflow of paradoxes that runs throughout            The firstparadox rests in the first facts Chekhovs origins His grandfather Egor wasa slave The usual term serf gilds it slightly In  Egor managed tobuy freedom for himself and his family Egors son Pavel became a shopkeeper inTaganrog struggling but free and there Pavels son Anton was born in Anton certainly never forgot his origins He once described himself as a youngman squeezing drop by drop the slave out of himself and waking one morningfeeling that real human blood not a slaves is flowing through hisveins            This grim selfknowledge begets contradictionThe origins of some writers explain to a degree their subjects and stylesTurgenev the scion of elegance reflected it in his work Gorky the child ofdifficulties wrote much about the wretched But Chekhov out of a childhoodthat one of his brothers called crushing anguish ranged the full field ofsociety and always with a delicacy that still makes the world gasp            Writing the art of writingentered Chekhovs life tangentially In  aided by a grant from theTaganrog city council Chekhov went to Moscow where most of his family hadalready moved to study medicine To help pay his way through medical schoolhe began to writesketches and stories for newspapers and magazines Within avery few years he was established as a writer In  he qualified as aphysician and he never completely gave up medicine as his short life raced toa close He died in  at  But paradoxically what had started as anadjunct to his medical education became his chief supportfairly handsomesupport too            Thestories ascended breathtakingly in quality and varied greatly in length thoughhe never wrote anything in grand Russian novel proportions Rayfield says inhis preface Biography is not criticism and he assuredly keeps his wordEach of the major stories gets only a small identification tag from him of notmuch critical value Possibly he deals more helpfully with them in his criticalbooks unread by me But this critical tagging becomes even less helpful whenhe deals with the kind of writing that Chekhov came to in his last yearsdrama            Chekhovs major plays Uncle Vanya  TheSeagull  Three Sisters  and The Cherry Orchard have linkswith his antecedent stories as well as with events in his life Rayfieldclarifies these connections But he does not come near conveying that in thewhole of Western drama there is no precedent for the style and texture ofthese quietly towering plays For an exquisite illumination of these matterssee Richard Gilmans recent study Chekhovs Plays An Opening IntoEternity             Butvividly Rayfield presents the man tall energetic socially scintillatingThe famous sought him out The venerable Tolstoy a secular saint in his timecalled on him more than once Tchaikovsky contemplated writing an opera withhim at one time Women pursued him feverishly Yetanother paradoxhe was afrequent patron of brothels Involved though he was with a literary life henever abandoned medicine as long as his health permitted He worked heroicallywhen a cholera epidemic struck the area of his country home In  he spent days crossing Siberia to the penal colony of Sakhalin so he could spendthree months there studying the health conditions about which he wrote a veryfull report            Another paradox contradicting his broadhumanism and also contradictory within itself is his attitude toward Jews asubject that Rayfield traces throughout this book On the one hand Chekhovbelieved that Russian Jews could never be truly Russian he categorized everynew acquaintance as Jew or nonJew in his letters he frequently used aslurring term for Jews Yet one of his dearest friends was a Jewish painter whogreatly influenced him aesthetically When the Dreyfus case was raging clearlythe result of antiSemitism in the French army Chekhov then in France was afiery Dreyfusard He was even engaged for a time to a Jewish woman Rayfieldassists us with these contradictions by saying that by the standards of histime Chekhov was a judophile            The overarching paradox ofhis life lucidly detailed by Rayfield is the state of Chekhovs health andhis attitude toward it By his middle s he knew that he suffered fromtuberculosis and he coughed blood increasingly as the years went on When hemarried in  he and his wife Olga Knipper of the Moscow Art Theater wentdirectly from the ceremony to a honeymoon in a sanitarium Why did this manhimself a physician pay so relatively little attention to his disease Theonly comprehensible explanation is that the vocation that had burrowed in nextto medicine had taken control had insisted In  he said in a letter to afriend Not for a minute am I free of the thought that I must am obliged towrite Write write and write            Chekhov was an ingeniousphrase maker with many of the phrases scattered in his letters Allgynaecologists are idealists One line unintended as an epigram stingsunforgettably In  he was in Moscow staying at the Great Moscow Hotelwhen he began to cough blood profusely He sent a note to a doctor he knewBleeding Great Moscow No  Chekhov The terseness the immense taciturngravity makes the note truly Chekhovian In those circumstances Dr Astrov inUncle Vanya might have written it
