                                 The Chinese Connection            The latest twist in thecampaign finance furor is the allegation that the Chinese government funneledmoney to President Clintons reelection campaign in an effort to influenceUS policy What is the evidence linking Chinese government money to ClintonDid the president know about such an initiative and was he or his staffinfluenced by it            No oneexcept for a Chinese Embassy spokesman disputes that the Chinese governmentplanned on contributing to the Democratic National Committee and congressional campaigns In early  the National Security Agencyeavesdropped on multiple conversations between the Beijing government and itsWashington DC embassy describing its intention to spend  million on theupcoming election Campaign contributions from foreigners let alone foreigngovernments are forbidden by US election law            According to most analyses Beijing worried that Clintonwould follow through on his  campaign promise to revoke Chinas MostFavored Nation MFN trading status to punish humanrights abuses Inaddition China has grown increasingly concerned over the disparity betweenTaiwan s sophisticated Washington lobbying and publicrelationsoperation and its own piecemeal setup            So farthere is no hard evidence of whether the Chinese government followed through onany of its plans to influence American elections The FBI has been unable totrace back any donations to the Chinese government But there has beenspeculation about different channels the Chinese government could have used tofunnel contributions Media stories have focused on John Huang Charles Trieand Pauline Kanchanalak three AsianAmericans who raised nearly  million forthe Democratic National Committee Ultimately the DNC returned the moneybecause of suspicion that it included laundered foreign cash             Here are the grounds for suspicion                           John Huang  Theformer deputy assistant secretary of commerce and DNC vice chair is said to beconnected to China through his longtime employer the Lippo Group  anIndonesian conglomerate When Huang left Lippo to work at Commerce in  hereceived a  severance package and continued his relationship with thefirm Huangs Commerce Department logs show that he made  phone calls fromhis government office to executives of a Los Angeles bank controlled by LippoIn  Huang raised  million in donations for the DNC from donors with tiesto Lippo The conglomerate has multiple investments in China In  Lippoeven became the governments partner when it sold  percent of its holdings ina Honk Kong bank to a Chinese government corporation During his month stintat the Commerce Department Huang met with Chinese government officials onthree separate occasions                           Pauline Kanchanalak The founder of the United StatesThai Business Council represents Thaiindustrialist Dhanin Chearavanont whose conglomerates are among the largestoutside investors in China and who is a partner in several Chinesegovernmentrun corporations There has been speculation that the Kanchanalak personally donated to the party originated with Chearavanont andhis government partners                           Charles Yah Lin Trie The Little Rock restaurateur raised  forthe Clinton legaldefense fund Of the three Tries links to Beijing are theclearest On his resume he even boasts about his friendship with seniorgovernment officials His major business partner in China is a governmentofficial in the southern city of Guangzhou Also last year Trie arranged forChinese arms dealer Wang Jun  the head of a staterun corporation toattend a White House coffee organized by the DNC            Though all three were viable conduits for laundered Chinesegovernment money there is nothing more than highly circumstantial evidence tosuggest they actually participated in a government scheme But they also couldhave raised such large sums by laundering money from their foreign businesscontacts These businesses all have dealings with Beijing that give them anindependent incentive to influence US policy toward China This secondscenario would also be illegal            The Lippogroup also paid  to former Associate Attorney General WebsterHubbell last year while he was waiting to begin a jail term for bilkingclients of his former law firm Hubbell is a close friend of both Clintons Atthe least he was hired in an attempt to influence administration China policyThat would not be unusual But skeptics suggest a darker scenario that theLippo fee was a payoff to Hubbell to keep quiet about Whitewater            There are assertions that Chinese donations tomembers of Congress swayed Congress  vote to renew MFN The Wall StreetJournal reported that in  while at Commerce John Huang consulted withRep Howard Berman of California an influential Democrat on the HouseInternational Relations Committee Their conversations took place at preciselythe moment the House reconsidered China MFN Lobbying Congress was not part ofHuangs job at Commerce and Huang had contributed to Bermans  campaignAccording to the Journal  nine other Democratic lawmakers who receivedcontributions from Huang spoke with him during this same period But againtheres no evidence linking Huangs involvement to the Chinese government            LastJune the FBI told six members of Congress that the Chinese governmentintended to illegally contribute money to their campaigns The six were SensBarbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihanof New York and Rep Nancy Pelosi of California all Democrats plus twoothers not yet identified Apparently none of these members receiveddonations they could link to the Chinese government though Feinstein didreturn a  check brought in by Huang All known targets except Pelosidid vote for MFN and had been strong MFN supporters all along            Clinton claims to have known nothing about the Chineseplans In fact the White House says that when the FBI briefed NationalSecurity Council staffers on the subject the FBI told the staffersspecifically not to pass information to higherups The FBI denies thisAccording to Attorney General Janet Reno the NSC staffers probablymisconstrued the agents instructions to treat the matter delicately            Though nobody contests thepresidents assertion that he was kept in the dark critics speculate that theatmosphere at the White House might have discouraged NSC staffers frominforming their superiors Previous NSC warnings about Huang and otherAsianAmerican donors had been ignored and fund raising was known to be a highpriority
