                                 OneHit Wonder            It is a curious but perhapsessential dimension of the Ralph Ellison literary myth that he published onlyone novel Invisible Man  and that his entire authority as a writer andintellectual rests on this work which whites felt brought black writing ofage beyond mere protest and sociology Ellison who died in  published noother collections of fiction in his lifetime Some of the fugitive pieces offiction he did publish in magazines and journals are collected in FlyingHome and Other Stories along with some very early unpublished work Thebook appears during something like an Ellison revival as the last year hasalso seen the publication of a volume of his collected essays and one of hisinterviews            Thecreativewriting teachers clich is that we each have one good novel in usEllison seemed to have discovered instantly that his one good novel was hisfirst Maybe that is why he never published his second that most talkedaboutadvent that produced only excerpts here and there The adulatory reception ofthe first may have made a second impossibleif Ellison felt he had to producean even greater book that is He might have especially felt this pressure asthe years went by and public expectation grew with the wait Perhaps he saideverything he had to say in Invisible Man             Whatever the case the payoff from Invisible Man waseverything a writer could want No black writer roughly of Ellisonsgenerationnot Richard Wright not Langston Hughes not Zora NealeHurstonwas able to parlay one novel into a position of being a respectedcritic and theorist of American literature Ellison became a true intellectualas no other black novelist had been The full apparatus of Americanintellectual lifethe major universities the literary organs the forums forspeakingwere open to him in ways they were not even to James Baldwin themost noted crossover black literary star of the s Ellison drew thiswelcome partly because he was the first black writer to win a National BookAward in  and the only novelist among his contemporaries to win one ofthe major literary prizes In the age of integration this endorsement ofEllisons genius by the white mainstream meant he had transcended hisrace            Yet hisreception also had much to do with his attitude toward writing and toward raceEllison believed firmly in the artists detachment from politics and politicalengagement in the primacy of aesthetics over the political and sociologicaldimensions of literature These beliefs are reasonable enough even liberatingfor black artists burdened by the political demands of their race But theywere also in concord with the dogma of the white literary establishment adogma that persists to this day that art should transcend the socialconditions that produced it The white literati appreciated Ellison because hedidnt drag the bugaboo of race into the literary act I wasnt and am nothe said concerned with injustice but with art            With one exception all the stories inFlying Home and Other Stories were written before Invisible Man from the late s to the middle s Thus the tendency is to see thestories not in their own right judging them strictly on the basis of their ownstrengths and weaknesses as short fiction but as adumbrations of InvisibleMan  The lessfair question is Would these stories have been published ifsome unknown writer had written them Are they worthy of our attention whenconsidered apart from the person who wrote them            This isnot easy to answer These are obviously apprentice works the equivalent ofartbook sketches practiceroom exercises Ellison was clearly trying to learnhow to write fiction And while it is true that no author no matter howaccomplished ever ceases to struggle with the craft of writing there issurely a difference between that stage when one is fumbling around trying todiscover if one can even be a writer and the stage where one is fullyconfident of addressing the world as nothing but a writer because one is ascompelled to write as to breathe Isnt the entire premise of this collectionbased on the idea that they suggest a culmination an arrival in InvisibleMan             Some of the adumbrations of Invisible Man are nothard to spot The old man who tells of his dream of flying around heaven inFlying Home obviously is a prototype of Trueblood the novels storytellingincestuous black farmer Aunt Kate in That I Had the Wings suggests MaryRambo the downhome black woman who nurses the Invisible Man back tohealth            But such aliterary game does not address the significance of these stories What is ofmoment here is how much in these stories Ellison struggled to find his ownvoice not to replicate say the voice of Richard Wright but to use Wrightianelements in an Ellisonian way as he did in A Party Down at the Square astory about a lynching and an airplane crash told from the point of view of avisiting white adolescent Here Ellison uses Wrights preoccupation withinterracial violence and graphic nearsurrealist detailing to provide thereader an ironic ambiguous tale of a white boy a moral innocent coming ofage A Hard Time Keeping Up is very much a Chester Himestype of hardboiledstory told through Ellisons prism Taking Himes unromantic harsh view ofblack urban underground life Ellison delivers a payoff not of violence but ofa seeming violence that is in fact comic            Ellison wrote these stories after havingabandoned a career in music for one in literature He was reading a great dealtrying to establish his literary ancestry and ascertain precisely the kind ofwriter he could be The struggle with influences and the experiments withpoints of view narrative mode characterization realism surrealismvernacular language and the like is all very naturaleven predictableandthus baldly apparent here There are several stories about riding the rodsas illegally riding trains was called Ellison did this as a college studentas well as tales about growing up in the Midwest with Ellison making use ofhis Oklahoma upbringing We see the apprentice writer trying to transform hisraw autobiography into art with varying success            Of thenotable stories in this collection A Coupla Scalped Indians published in and possibly a fragment for a new novel is the biggest disappointmentsince it is the latest Ellison work here The unnamed narrator seems to be thesame person as the narrator of Invisible Man  and the story seems toreplicate what was done in the earlier novel Buster and the narrator arecamping out in the woods in a male initiation ceremony like the Australianwalkabout What Ellison is doing here as Hemingway did is equating theprocess of becoming an artist with that of becoming a man Throughout thestory Ellison uses the symbol of horns investing them with a number ofmeanings relating to sexual desire the horny young boys artistic creationthe instrument of jazz and masculinity the symbol of a bull But thesymbolism ultimately overwhelms the story The story seems selfconsciousheavyhanded in its intimations of meaning via symbols preoccupied not withits characters but with its intention of being larger than itself            The two most successful stories here That I Had theWings and Flying Home are less selfconscious than A Coupla ScalpedIndians They show Ellison exploring black folklore as a source for blackfiction using flight for example as a metaphor for escapea common tropeamong slaves who imagined themselves able to fly back to Africa The twostories further illustrate the unease even hostility that blacks have tendedto feel about their folklore and about black history generally In That I Hadthe Wings Riley a young black boy Ellison uses in several stories hates hisAunt Kate and wishes she had died back in slavery times in Flying Homethe black pilot who seeks escape hates the black farmer who rescued him afterhis crash In Invisible Man  the Talented Tenth narrator must overcomenot only the various ideologies that are presented to him as masks orsubversions of identity but also the various roles and prescriptions forleadership his own race wishes him to fulfill Similarly in these two storiesthe pilot and the two boys are in effect fighting against the power of raceconsciousness as a form of conformity even as they are trying to find theirmeaning through their race            These stories particularlyreveal Ellisons concerns with the individuals complex confrontation with hissociety and his group and the way they assign him roles and identitiesEllison was not by any means the first black writer to explore these issuesBut he was among the first to explore them with a level of intellectual verveand artistic sophistication that suggested to blacks and the world that therewas within the American dilemma of race not only the expression of mere localand immediate political protest but the broad and rich possibilities of thehuman condition itself Whatever the merit of these stories it is certainlyclear from them how Ellison was able to write his masterpiece InvisibleMan
