                                 Capture the Flag            Among the dozens ofappropriated motifs that swim in and out of the later work of Jasper Johnswhose career is the subject of a curatorially brilliant retrospective at theMuseum of Modern Art is the face of the Mona Lisa  The reference is notto Leonardo The reference is to Johns For the Mona Lisa is the classicinstance of the image that becomes synonymous with its creator It is theemblem of painterly emblems the imprint on the ultimate tote bag of Westernart Its the archetype for Marcel Duchamps urinal Jackson Pollocks dripsAndy Warhols soup can and Jasper Johns flag            The flagwas the outcome of a standard modernist ritual of selflaunching In  whenhe was  and an artistic unknown Johns decided to destroy all his work witha view to purging himself of influence and beginning afresh with a blankcanvas It was a sacrifice the gods seems to have found satisfactory which isof course why we know about it If they hadnt found it satisfactory thestory would have acquired a different beginning For they sent Johns a dreamin which he saw himself painting an American flag and the result was the workwith which his name will always be associated an image he would produce manyrenderings ofwhite flags flags on orange backgrounds flags with bymistake  stars flags drawn in pencil and graphite wash flags insuperimposed triplicate            The original Flag which is arepresentation of the familiar red white and blue starred itemfirstattracted attention in  when it was displayed in a group show at the LeoCastelli Gallery The following year Castelli gave Johns a oneman exhibitionAlfred Barr of the Museum of Modern Art attended and agreed to purchase fourworks Flag was among them but the possibility that the Museumsacquisitions committee would object to it as unpatriotic made Barr nervous sohe arranged for the architect Philip Johnson to buy it the price was with the promise that he would donate it to the Museum later on which he didin  when it was worth a lot more than             Thethought that Johns Flag which seems so sweet and inoffensive incomparison with the art that causes controversy today would give anyonepolitical jitters seems a commentary on the oppressiveness of early Cold WarAmerica But it is really a commentary on the timidity of the artestablishment For a version of Johns White Flag  hadalready appeared in the window of Bonwit Teller in  as a background fortwo mannequins displaying the latest in ladies suits and no one seems to havecalled in the FBI American commercial culture in the s and early swas in its lack of inhibition way ahead of American high culture It was thisfriction between the agitators of appetite and the guardians of taste that gaverise to pop            Johns  show figures in many stories ofAmerican art as the first step in the turn away from abstract expressionismfrom the hot grandiloquence of Pollock and De Kooning toward the cool of popminimalism and conceptual artthe art of the s and after There is sometruth to this version but not enough Johns must have been happy to havedisplaced in his understated way the cultural dominance of the big actionpainters The title of his sendup of abstract expressionism Painting withTwo Balls and there they are squeezed forlornly between two bigpanels of drips and brushstrokesis about as explicit as Johns ever gets Theflags targets and twin Ballantine ale cans Painted Bronze areplausible prototypes for the art of Andy Warhol Roy Lichtenstein and BruceNauman But the Johns retrospective makes it clear that that to insist onthinking of him as popist or a minimalist or a conceptualist is to miss out onthe pleasures of his work            KirkVarnedoe has arranged the exhibition and the excellent catalog thataccompanies it to exemplify what has become a leading theme of his work aschief curator of painting and sculpture at the museum This is the idea thatmodern art is a song that never endsthat what began with Czanne and Picassodid not stop with Warhol or with Schnabel but is an impulse that iscontinually being renewed and revisited in Western culture There may be nobetter illustration of this thesis than the work of Jasper Johns            From one point of view Johns flags and targets derivefrom the famous readymades of Marcel Duchampthe urinal the bicycle wheelthe snow shovel all exhibited before  They are antiart They ask thequestion asked by Duchamps bicycle wheel and later by Warhols soup canswhich is if this is a work of art then what is not But from another point ofview they derive from Monets haystacks The flags and the targets and therest are like the haystacks simply subject matter for painterly treatmentThey are as Johns himself put it things the mind already knows forms whichcan be remade over and over and seen anew This puts them about as squarelyin the artistic mainstream as anyone could wish            For Johns paintings andsculptures the ale cans the sculpmetal shoes and flashlights and thecombines lose exactly half their point in reproduction They retain theirintellectual aspect but lose their sensual aspect In reproduction the flagpicture is a familiar dadaist conundrum something that is neither a flag nor apicture On the wall though Flag is a magnificently variegatedsurface an intensely made thing a dense amalgam of newspaperencaustic and paint It does not occur to you when you encounter it in theflesh to contemplate its metaphysicsany more than encountering a movie starin the flesh inspires reflections on the nature of modern fame You are toobusy soaking up the sense data            Take anobject Do something to it Do something else to it Ditto The recipe is froman early notebook of Johns and it is the best explanation of his procedureIt is why a list of the materials Johns has used over the  years of hiscareer includes beeswax lighter fluid oil stain plaster casts crayoncharcoal chalk cardboard ink on plastic and the impress of his own bodyOne painting features his teeth marks He doesnt want to represent or todeconstruct He wants to transform            An artist who takes a bite out of his ownpainting and who derives his subject matter from a dream is in some sense aprivate artist and the later work as Varnedoe has organized it suggests anincreasing absorption in a personal vocabulary composed of body partscrosshatching patterns an overworked motif of the s vases clocksskulls specific borrowings from Duchamp Picassso Holbein and a th century Grnewald altarpiece little stick figures with bubbleheads and in the most recent work the image of a spiral galaxy            Like the early flags theseelements got reworked in a variety of media and a range of combinationsasthough if the right combinations were found the rebus might be decodedthough of course it never is There are periods in which the work fadesinto hermeticism there are periods when it aspires to a lyric summing up asin the four Seasons  in which the shadow of the artist isprojected onto a sequence of Johnsian montages Sometimes the desire to workout an ideaas in the largescale panel picture According to What which presents a series of Johns customary images in a deliberatelydecentered compositionproduces a flaccid surface But mostly there is thespectacle of technique brought to bear on form and although this is a minimaldefinition of art there is nothing minimal about the results
