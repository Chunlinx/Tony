                    Introduction        Enumeration of peripheral blood PB leukemic cells in        mycosis fungoides MFSzary syndrome SS can be        difficult by morphological methods This is due to        difficulties in unequivocally distinguishing neoplastic        cells from reactive lymphocytes on standard        WrightGiemsastained PB smears Electron microscopic        evaluation of blood samples is impractical for routine use        Therefore most centers have relied on flow cytometric        evaluation of such specimens        Flow cytometric abnormalities in MFSS that have been        correlated with the presence of tumor cells include        increased populations of CDpositive andor CDnegative        Tcells      We have recently shown that increases in        CDpositive CDnegative Tcell populations are highly        associated with the presence of tumor cells in MFSS                   Another approach to flow cytometric detection of tumor        cells has been the identification of phenotypically        aberrant populations that express different amounts of cell        surface proteins than normal Tcell populations Such        stable abnormal expression levels of panT cell markers is        a common feature of T cell tumors     We sought to        identify the frequency of such abnormalities in MFSS in PB        and to determine whether these immunophenotypic aberrancies        are stable over the course of treatment We report that        alterations in expression of multiple T cell markers as        detected by flow cytometry are an easily identifiable and        stable feature of nearly all cases of MFSS Such        immunophenotypic aberrancies can be used to quantify tumor        cells from a patient over the course of the disease                    Methods                  Patient samples          We screened all PB smears from patients referred to          our hospital between January  and June  who had a          diagnosis of cutaneous atypical lymphoid infiltrate MF          or SS and a had a full PB flow cytometry panel Cases          were considered morphologically positive if they          contained at least  tumor cells by manual differential          We also included subsequent involved PB samples from          these patients Most of the PB smears were reviewed by a          single hematopathologist DJ to ensure relatively          uniform criteria in counting of tumor cells Szary tumor          cells were defined as either those with markedly          convoluted nuclear contours or those that were enlarged          and had prominent nucleoli Diagnoses were based on          criteria outlined in the updated World Health          Organization classification     Patients were          diagnosed to have MF if PB involvement occurred          subsequent to patchplaque cutaneous Tcell lymphoma or          SS if the presenting features included an erythrodermic          rash with L PB tumor cells          All studies were carried out in accordance with the          Declaration of Helsinki and followed a laboratory          protocol approved by our institutional review board                          Flow cytometry          We utilized a standard Tcell antigen panel to analyze          the  PB samples from the  patients   or          color flow cytometric analysis was performed on all          samples following a standard red cell lysis method using          mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against CD clone          D peridinchlorophyllaprotein PerCPconjugated          as well as various combinations of CD fluorescien          isothiocyanate FITCconjugated CD SK FITC or          phycoerythrin PE CD SK PE CD H FITC CD          SK FITC or PE CD SJC FITC and CD L          FITC In addition CD S FITC CD LF PE          and  Tcell receptor TB FITC or PE were done in          a subset of cases All antibodies were from BD          Biosciences San Jose CA and analysis was performed          using FACScan or FACScaliber cytometers BD          For each antibody negative staining levels were set          by comparison to an isotypematched control In a subset          of  cases cluster analysis using Paintagate          software BD was done to correlate the size of the          different lymphocyte populations with the phenotypically          aberrant Tcell clusters Aberrant T cell populations          were defined as discrete immunophenotypic clusters          representing a tight cluster of  or more of analyzed          events exhibiting change in levels of expression of          Tcell antigens relative to an internal          immunophenotypically normal Tcell population or relative          to expected expression of T cell associated antigens As          a control group for variations in Tcell markers in          nonneoplastic Tcell populations we used the flow          cytometry results from  patients with MF or cutaneous          atypical Tcell infiltrates whose PB smears did not show          identifiable tumor cells and  samples from control          patients without any evidence of malignancy or chronic          disease The details of these PB cases were previously          summarized     We have previously shown high levels          of correlation between the presence of an abnormal Tcell          population identified by this flow cytometry panel and          the presence of morphologically identifiable tumor cells          on examination of the smear              The KruskalWallis test and Spearmans rank          correlation test were used to compare the association of          phenotypic aberrancy between different markers          Statistical significance was defined as                               Results                  Immunophenotypic aberrancy of common Tcell markers          is present in nearly all cases of MFSS          In  of  MFSS patients  there was a discrete          phenotypically abnormal populations identified by flow          cytometric analysis that correlated with the presence of          morphologically identifiable tumor cells on PB smear In          a group of  SSMF patients with morphologically           uninvolved PB smears flow          cytometric analysis identified a phenotypically abnormal          CD Tcell population in only  cases These abnormal          populations detected only by flow cytometry comprised           and  of total white blood cells and were discrete          CDdim CDnegative Tcell populations Rereview of PB          smears from these patients who had typical cutaneous          findings of MF did not identify definitive Sezary cells          The CDCD ratio was elevated  in  of the          involved PB samples at presentation and in  of the          followup involved PB samples but in only  of the PB          samples from MFSS patients without tumor cells seen on          smear No flow cytometric abnormalities were detected in          CDpositive Tcells from  control patients without          lymphoproliferative disorders          The overall incidence of different immunophenotypic          aberrancies among the  MFSS patients is summarized in          Table  We noted abnormal expression levels of CD by          flow cytometry in  of patients tumor cells were          dimmer for CD than normal Tcell levels in  patients          brighter than normal for CD in  patients Fig A and          completely negative for CD in  patients Similarly          abnormal levels of CD expression were seen in            patients  dimmer  brighter  negative Fig B          Coexpression of CD and CD was seen in tumor cells from           patients In  of patients tumor cells showed both          CD and CD aberrancies however the magnitude of these          changes were not highly correlated when graded as          negative  dim  normal  or bright  R value                     In a subset of cases tested abnormalities in the          dimmer expression level of CD  were seen in  of            cases Fig A Tcell receptoralphabeta          TCR expression levels were determined in  cases          and was  correlated with CD expression in that dim          TCR expression in  cases was associated with dim CD          and TCR was negative in the  cases that showed          absence of surface CD CD expression was abnormal in           of  of tested cases dimmer in  brighter in           by standard analysis However the level of CD          expression in Tcells was typically variable and careful          cluster analysis in  additional cases identified          discrete CDdim tumor cell populations          Tcells in normal PB typically showed a continuous          variation in CD expression level In involved MFSS PB          samples tumor cells were uniformly negative in           patients  and uniformly positive in  patients           In the remaining  patients  CD expression          in tumor was variable Fig B and was often          indistinguishable from the range of expression seen in          normal Tcells The Tcell activation marker CD was          uniformly negative in tumor cells from  patients           uniformly positive in  patients and showed variable          positivity in  Thus in  of   patients          CDCD and CDCD histograms clearly separated the          phenotypically atypical Tcell populations Figs Cand                                    Multiple phenotypically aberrant Tcell populations          in MFSS          In  patients with long standing MF we noted           discrete phenotypically abnormal Tcell populations in          PB In  patients these included a CDdim population          Fig A in  other patients there were CDdim and          CDnegative populations Fig BC The remaining          patient had two discrete populations detected by CD and          CD staining In  cases cluster analysis correlated the          different phenotypically aberrant populations with the          normalsized and large transformed neoplastic Tcell          populations seen on PB smear This was done by          pseudocoloring the abnormal cell cluster in the various          antibody panels and correlating the relative cell size of          these clusters on the forwardside scatter histograms          Fig AC                          Phenotypic aberrancies in Tcells are stable over          the course of disease          In  of the patients we analyzed followup PB samples          that had tumor cells identified on smear and a          phenotypically abnormal population identified by flow          cytometry We examined from  to  different samples from          these patients over the year study period In a subset          of cases we used the Paintagate software on the          forwardside scatter and other histograms to quantify          the size of the aberrant tumor cell Tcell population          in comparison with the other white blood cell types          detected As shown in Table  such a technique could be          used to document oscillations in tumor cell number that          occurred over the course of treatment          In  of  patients phenotypic aberrancies in the          levels of CD CD and CD were stable with similar          expression levels detected in all involved PB samples In          contrast CD expression varied in the aberrant tumor          cell population in  of   cases Fig shows a          patient with CDdim phenotypic aberrancy in tumor cells          that remained constant over the course of disease In          this patient intervening treatments with Targretin          interferon and photopheresis had no discernible effect          on overall PB tumor cell number However initiation of          deoxycoformycin pentostatin therapy resulted in a          decrease in the size of the aberrant CDdim tumor          cluster as well as decreases in the population of normal          Tcells consistent with treatment response          In  patients there were changes in the phenotype of          tumor cells noted over the study period In one case          large cell transformation of tumor cells was associated          with partial loss of surface CD In another case with          CDdim and CDnegative tumor cell populations          effective treatment was associated with selective loss of          the CDnegative population data not shown                            Discussion        We examined the flow cytometry findings in involved PB        samples from  MFSS patients most of who had multiple        sequential involved PB samples Using a standard Tcell        cytometry panel we noted abnormal Tcell populations        showing one or more antigen aberrancies in  of patients        In  MF patients we noted multiple persistent        phenotypically abnormal Tcell populations consistent with        clonal heterogeneity We present the first report on the        stability of such abnormal immunophenotypes in the        neoplastic T cells of SSMF over disease course Despite        varying treatments immunophenotypic aberrancies noted were        maintained over the course of disease in  of cases        excluding common variations in the level of CD expression        These findings support the hypothesis that these abnormal        Tcell populations represent the neoplastic clone and        provide strong support for the use of flow cytometry in        routine monitoring of treatment response        Tumorassociated variation in one or several panT cell        antigens is a typical feature of neoplastic lymphocytes in        many Tcell malignances and has been termed antigen loss        or deletion     Using immunohistochemistry on a large        bank of Tcell lymphomas we have previously noted a        frequency of such antigen deletion of  for CD  for        CD  for CD and  for CD     Flow cytometric        analysis can allow a more sensitive assessment of subtle        variations in the levels of surface marker expression than        immunohistochemistry     In nonneoplastic Tcell        populations we noted relatively narrow range of CD CD        and CD expression with majority of cells clustering within        one log intensity In contrast the aberrancies noted in        expression in Tcell tumor often showed  logfold        intensity differences from the normal populations                       Most routinely assessed Tcell diagnostic markers eg        TCR CD CD CD and CD are components of the        antigen receptor complex and are dynamically regulated        during Tcell maturation and activation     In a        subset of cases analyzed we noted that surface CD levels        frequently correlated with levels of TCR but that CD        did not always correlate with variations in the levels of        surface CD We also found variations in MFSS tumor cells        in the expression level of CD a phosphatase that        regulates TCR activation     The finding of frequent        variations in the levels of these TCRcomplex proteins in        tumors is intriguing and suggests abnormal regulation or        formation of the TCR complex in some tumor cells This        could be lead to dysregulated TCR signaling effecting        growth regulation        In previous studies others and we have noted that MFSS        tumor cells frequently lacked CD and that this finding        was helpful in identifying the tumor cell population             In this larger longitudinal series we confirm these        findings and noted that tumor cells showed a consistent        pattern of CD loss over the course of disease The stable        loss of expression of CD a Tcell activation marker in        MFSS suggests that this activation pathway may be        nonfunctional in most MFSS tumors CD is an ectoenzyme        which delivers a costimulatory signal in Tcells its        expression is upregulated on Tcells in response to        mitogenic signals and downregulated through interaction        with the insulinlike growth factor II receptor            The consequence of CD loss is unclear CD modulates the        action of many molecules including the chemotactic activity        of some chemokine important for Tcell migration to skin                    In contrast we noted that CD expression was frequently        modulated in tumor cells over the disease course Several        previous studies have demonstrated that CD loss is not a        predictable marker for detection of MFSS cells as its        expression is variable in this tumor type             Although there is data to suggest that CDnegative Tcells        may represent a distinct differentiation pathway in normal        and neoplastic helper T cells     the variable        expression of CD in MFSS that we have observed suggests        that this marker may be highly modulated by tumor        microenvironment andor treatment        Identification of a stable tumorassociated        immunophenotype in MFSS allows tumor cell quantification        to assess response to therapy Cluster analysis of abnormal        flow cytometric immunophenotype is more reliable and easier        to compare over time than morphologic analysis and can        detect PB involvement in a small number of cases without        easily identifiable Sezary cells     Routine flow        cytometric profiling is also not as technically demanding        as molecular monitoring     or electron microscopy        Such a separation of tumor from normal Tcells is also        important in assessing the effects of therapies on normal        leukocytes        In conclusion we found that the absence of CD and        other aberrant surface expression of T cellassociated        markers allowed identification of a discrete quantifiable        population in nearly all MFSS patients with PB tumor        cells Immunophenotypic aberrancies are maintained        consistently over the course of disease and can be used to        monitor tumor response to therapy
