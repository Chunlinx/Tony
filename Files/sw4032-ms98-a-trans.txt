                okay Martin do you do any exercise   yes i do uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting those are probably the two main things i like to do     uhhuh um so those are more or less indoor sports hows the weather out there in Georgia   yeah um  in in in the winter you typically its its probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall   uhhuh   but in the winter it its gets pretty cold   oh   um yeah so its mostly indoor sports i think in the winter   uhhuh   um how about yourself   well yeah im on a exercise program im riding my Aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning and im just about ready to   uhhuh   up it to forty five minutes a morning and i feel like thats been a real nice exercise in the winter time   umhum   its its kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise   right do you uh do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise   no huhuh i first of all id like to get my weight off im about fifty pounds overweight and so id like to get the weight off and then id really like to get into that   umhum   and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video thats called The Firm i dont know if youve heard of it but its a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down but youre using weights and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done it is really its really fun   huh yes its its its aerobics its similar to aerobics with weights   yes uhhuh   but its like low impact aerobics where you use weights   uhhuh yes   okay are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics   um no i mean yes i am but i have never done it myself have you done that   uh yes i have in in Atlanta thats um most of the health clubs   oh   are all thats the thats the in thing   thats the big thing huh   at first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over   oh so how is that   um it they call it a low impact aerobics and its supposed to burn off more calories at the same time   ooh   and from when ive done it it does give you a good a real good workout       but the only thing im concerned about is potential for injury to your knees   oh   you know that and movement of going up on the step   uhhuh   you know that could create a problem   yeah   they they seem to think that it it wont but you never know   huh now if um playing basketball are you knees do you have healthy knees   yeah i i think my ankles probably are my lame weak point but   oh dear     ive ive kind of taken care of that i wear high tops and then also an an a support ankle brace which is very stiff     uhhuh   and um wearing wearing that i havent had any problems in the past year or so   umhum thats good well that sounds you sound just like my husband he he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and   yeah   oh hes just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy and so thats what he does he wears his   yeah i   his brace and his high tops and   umhum yeah i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy   oh uh oh shoot   i mean it would only take three or four days and i could play again on it   wow   because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself to play that way     uhhuh oh dear  oh     but um so how how successful is your exercise video   it is amazing how fast you take off the inches   uhhuh   and i would once i start my forty id like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day id like to incorporate the video um and then the bike on the other day   um   but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off and the muscle builds   umhum   real fast um you can start they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty five pound dumbbells   umhum   and then youre just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and its a hour long video   so its a good workout   so it is yeah i really enjoy that so im looking forward to       losing this weight and being firm and healthy   umhum so in the winter i guess theres a lot uh its quite cold and and snow   yes yes now this one has been quite mild um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground it was quite chilly but not
