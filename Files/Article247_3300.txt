                                 The Quiet Revenge of Vile Food                        Dear Chris            Fourteen volumes of Rosalynn Carter Now theres a dreadful thought Whichreminds me to say on Eleanors behalf that she is at the very least extremelyinteresting In general the whole school of firstlady journalism bores me totears and I think ERs tenure misled subsequent journalists and popularhistorians into thinking that the firstladyship or whatever you call it wouldgo on being a noteworthy role The truth is that almost all writing about firstladies chews more than it bites offincluding I think ninetenths of the inkweve all spilled over HRC            Because the first lady is obviously something of a freak in this day andagea woman who is famous chiefly for being a wife and in most cases a womanwhose life has been hideously warped by the fact that her spouse chose a careerin politics Such a life has very little to offer other women in the way ofexemplary lessons and were right to feel a bit queasy over a first lady whopromises or threatens to accomplish anything very substantive on the strengthof who shes sleeping with Note The major exception to the boredom rule wasthe revelation of Nancy Reagans allpowerful astrologist Now there wasa good story            But thanks for taking me up on that question of how first ladies havesometimes served their husbands as useful camouflage You chose great examplesof the benign and malign forms of this phenomenon in citing FDR and ERstagteam response to the Bonus Marchers and ERs later cover for FDRs neglectof the refugees I agree that the problem isnt gender stereotyping its thesleightofhand the arrangement encourages This used to drive me crazy aboutthe Bush White House when everyone was writing mistily about how deeply Barcared about Head Start funding and how she was secretly proabortionrightsand how in effect she represented Bushs moderate domesticpolicy impulsesHe seemed over time not to bother having much of a domestic policy himselfand Barbara was a huge part of the cover None of this is ERs fault  asyou say but to some degree it is her doing All youve got to say to promotethe powerbehindthethrone theme as either participant or observer isWhy look at Eleanor Roosevelt Surely this is why Hillary was communingin the solarium with ERs spirit An interesting question to consider iswhether this legacy is more useful to Republicanswho can use it as Bush didto mediate their constituents ambivalence toward government actionthan it isto Democrats Dont you suspect that when push comes to shove George WBushs compassionate conservatism is going to consist in very large part ofLaura Bush            Im with you on being mystified about why Hick thought ER might leave herhusband I do think its a symptom of the way that Cooks focus on the marriagesort of wavers in this volume However I cant let our last day of discussionpass without praising Cook for one of her neatest insights into ER and hermarriageconcerning the passiveaggressive behavior by which she punishedFranklin and others ER apparently avoided confrontation but kept two nastydogs who snapped at journalists and senators the larger of them actually bitthe Canadian prime minister And when the Roosevelts moved into the WhiteHouse ER carefully employed as cook and housekeeper the dreadfulinexperienced Henrietta Nesbitt who barked at the president and sneered atforeign dignitaries and made sure the White House served the worst food inAmerica Poor FDR properly chastened had to flee to Hyde Park to eat the goodfood he loved Shades of Hillary banning smoking in the White House            I liked Cook for giving Eleanors Revenge a nice fat chapter near the startof this volume But I fault her for not quoting the best thing Ive read onthis subject a passage I came upon in Joseph Alsops centenary memoir of FDRThe drink being the Presidents department was not actively repellentwrote Alsop But the food                           The salads were especially deplorable for they tended to becomplicated and decorative and might even conceal bits of marshmallow in theirdreadful depth  What Nesbitt perpetrated was only part of the storymoreover Scrambled eggs are not an easy dish to cook in such a way that hungrymen turn away in discouragement yet the scrambled eggs Eleanor Rooseveltalways made in a chafing dish for Sunday night supper were undeniablydiscouraging                        Eleanor he wrote                           was never against quiet revenges with a moral excuse She equatedplain living with high thinking so it was moral to eat badly And if herhusband did not like eating badly why there were passages in their joint pastshe had not liked either                        Reading this did make me wish in hindsight that ERs biographer were alittle less admiringly sober Now that Ive said my piece on behalf of the NewDeal I can admit to having found Cooks prose clear and readable but notespecially memorable I guess theres not much hope that she can kick up herheels a bit in Volume III what with World War II just over the horizon            But when that next book does hit the shelves Ill pick it up and rememberthis exchange with pleasure            All best            Marjorie
