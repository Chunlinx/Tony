                                 Kosovo            Last week Serbian policemassacred at least  Albanians in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo Thedead Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic says deserved their fate Theywere Islamic terrorists promoting the secession of this remote southern swathof Serbia Balkan watchers say the killings will provoke the Albanianspercent of Kosovos populationinto armed revolt sparking a conflagrationthat could involve the rest of Europe Why the long history of AlbanianSerbianacrimony Will Kosovo be Bosnia reduxanother bout of ethnic cleansing andwarfare or worse            Accordingto the conventional wisdom last weeks murders were the latest chapter in acenturieslong feud between Albanian Muslims and their Serbian OrthodoxChristian neighbors Serbs still sting from their defeat at the hands of theOttoman Turks in the  Battle of Kosovo which began the Turks yearoccupation of Serbia Blame for the defeat is pinned on Albanian Muslims wholike the Bosnian Muslims are accused of having collaborated with the invadersBut this interpretation misrepresents the record Most Albanians resistedinvasion they didnt collaborate with the Turks any more than their Serbianneighbors did            In the mid th century with the growth ofnationalism across Europe Kosovo became an obsession among Serbianintellectuals a symbol of Serbias past grandeur and currentmistreatment Poets wrote epics with antiMuslim subtexts romanticizing theBattle of Kosovo And Kosovo morphed into Serbias Jerusalem The liberation ofKosovar Serbs and Serbian holy places from Muslim tyrants became thenationalist rallying cry as did the redemption of Albanians who had convertedto Islam during the Turks rule            Thenationalist myth of Christians vs Muslims belies a pluralistic realityAlbanians and Serbs coexistedpeacefullyunder Ottoman rule Only whenSerbia beat back the Turks in  did leaders in Belgrade begin to transformtheir nationalist fantasies about Kosovo into policy Serbs exported coloniststo Kosovo and expelled Albanians Even so Albanians have always vastlyoutnumbered Serbs in the province there are now  million Albanians comparedwith  Serbs            When Communist dictator Josip Broz Tito tookover in  he attempted to quash Serbian nationalism  He preachedthat there was no room for ethnic differences in the class struggle But Serbssuspicious of Titos Croatian and Slovenian background said he was giving themshort shrift To allay fears of antiSerb chauvinism Tito prohibitedAlbanianlanguage publications and gave Kosovos most desirable jobs to SerbsWhen Albanians staged protests in the late s Tito attempted to pacify themby strengthening local government largely dominated by Albanians over localaffairs and by restoring jobs This satisfied no one It was not enough to dentAlbanian unemployment and just enough to rile Serbs Following Titos death in malcontents on both sides rioted            In while other Yugoslav leaders ignored the Kosovo mess Slobodan Milosevic thena littleknown Communist Party apparatchik began accusing Albanians ofperpetrating genocide against Kosovos Serbs Milosevic organized massrallies in Kosovo one of them attended by  million Serbswhere hecharged Yugoslavias leadership with ignoring the crisis His attacks won himpopular support which he ultimately parlayed into control of YugoslaviasCommunist Party Milosevics demagoguery over Kosovo helped convince theCroatians Slovenians and Bosnians that they could no longer deal with SerbiaIn  they seceded from Yugoslavia            Under Milosevic Albanians lost all semblance ofautonomy  They were removed from jobs in the party and government Separatebut unequal Albanianonly school and health care systems were established Itis credibly alleged that Serbs poisoned Albanian schools water supply with thenerve gas Sarin Unemployment among Albanians reached  percent higher thanin wartorn Bosnia Arbitrary arrests and searches increased as Serbsimplemented de facto martial law            The Serbcrackdown spurred the first organized Albanian opposition In the early sIbrahim Rugova  a writer created the Democratic League ofKosovo  modeling it on Gandhis and Kings nonviolent campaigns Rugovaestablished a shadow government and sent envoys abroad to make the case forindependence But Milosevic remained intransigent Smarting from losses in theBosnian war and from the collapse of the Serbian economy opposition partiestook to the streets in the winter of  to demand Milosevics resignationAlthough Milosevic survived the protests his position remains tenuous Hebelieves he cannot afford the loss of prestige that would accompany acompromise on Kosovo Even opposition leaders agree that it is Serbiasmanifest destiny to control Kosovo            Meanwhile Albanian discontent increasesAlbanians feel slighted by the  Dayton Peace Accord which gave autonomy toBosnian Muslims but stayed silent on their fate The lesson they have drawnLiberation comes from armed struggle not nonviolence Support grows for theKosovo Liberation Army  a band of militants many of whom fought onbehalf of Bosnia The KLA now controls several mountain villages and hassmuggled a sizable cache of weapons across the border from Albania            One rumor has Milosevicfunding the KLA because he needs an excuse to start another nationalistwar to boost his popularity Another says he ordered last weeks crackdown onlyafter he received the implicit green light from the Clinton administrationsspecial envoy to Yugoslavia Robert Gelbard Last week Gelbard called theKLA a terrorist group  The Clinton administration has tried to play it bothways on Kosovo It rejects Albanias claims for independence but decries thecrackdown Last week the US government and European allies agreed they wouldstiffen sanctions on Serbia to protest the massacres But the United States isafraid that the  peacekeeping troops stationed in neighboring Macedonia willget drawn into battle            Various nightmarescenarios describe how the conflict in Kosovo might escalate  Onehas Albania which has said it wont tolerate further attacks on its people inKosovo entering a bloody war with the Serbs Another has the war spreading toMacedonia where ethnic Albanians would come to the support of their fellows inKosovo This in turn would inspire Greece to intervene to restore order andprotect the Greek minority in Macedonia Once Greece a NATO member getsinvolved the whole of Europe bound by treaty could follow
