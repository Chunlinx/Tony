                                 Suffocating the Cat            Gen Augusto Pinochet madea comeback on Europes front pages Friday after British Home Secretary JackStraw announced that Spanish extradition proceedings against him could goahead The Daily Telegraph of London claimed that it would now be severalyears before the yearold former president of Chile would either be sentfor trial in Spain or freed In Spain the British decision was warmlywelcomed El Passaid in an editorial Friday that the mere fact that Pinochet is to besubjected to extradition proceedings constitutes an irreversible victory forthe rights of man It represents the birth of an effective universaljurisdiction for dealing with crimes against humanity and at the same time anunequivocal warning that the United Kingdom will not be a refuge forbloodstained dictators            In another editorial El Mundo of Madrid said much the same thing welcoming thearrival of a supranational judicial structure that will be able from now on toknock down the protective barriers that tyrants throughout the world haveerected around themselves Both papers welcomed the fact that Pinochetsfriends and supporters El Pas named Margaret Thatcher HenryKissinger exPresident Bush Sen Jesse Helms and the popehad failed intheir efforts to get him freed            In London theconservative press took the opposite view The Daily Telegraph calledStraw a straw man and ridiculed his claim to have made his decision with anopen mind The paper said The Home Secretary does not allow his open mind tobe troubled by the fact that long after Gen Pinochet peacefully relinquishedpower his former opponents are pleading for his return Nor does the damageinflicted by the affair on British national interests already palpable in theFalklands and on our annual exports to Chile of  million pounds million disturb the peace of the ministerial open mind The tabloid DailyMail quoted Thatcher as saying that Straw had demeaned his office with avindictive decision            The main story across Europe though was NATOs admissionthat it accidentally bombed a refugee convoy in Kosovo This gave rise to muchcomment that clean wars dont exist and renewed support for NATOs decision tocontinue the bombing Wars mean casualties said the Telegraph  callingonce again for the deployment of ground troops And the liberal Guardian had aneditorial saying exactly the same thing If Nato is to blame for Wednesdayscarnage then that has only underscored the inadequacy of air power Forces onthe ground is becoming urgent Le Figaro of Paris said the West has no choice but tocontinue fighting and quoted a Provenal proverb Once one has startedsuffocating the cat one has to finish it The German press reported broadsupport in the Bundestag for the governments commitment to the war and notedAmerican reservations about its peace plan                           Corriere della Sera of Milan reported huge flightdelays in Italy because of congestion in the skies caused by military aircraftbombing Yugoslavia Five out of six domestic civilian flights are now departinglate it said In Britain the Times reported that the BBCs world affairs editor JohnSimpson was coming under fierce British government criticism for Serb biasin his coverage from Belgrade In an astonishing attack senior officialsaccused him of presenting at face value claims by the Serbs about damage doneby Nato attacks being grossly simplistic in suggesting that the Nato assaulthas united the Serb population and Milosevics forces and of swallowing Serbpropaganda about the impact of Natos air raids the Times said In aneditorial the paper defended Simpsons reporting from Belgrade but attackedNATO for being so quick to blame Serbia for the deaths of Albanian refugees inthe disputed convoy incident            The Pentagonsinordinately clumsy handling of the news when it first broke must have leftSlobodan Milosevic weeping tears of joy the paper said Since the Pentagonhad no evidence at that time to show who was to blame its spokesman KennethBacon did the credibility of the Alliance nothing but harm by alleging thatSerb forces had done the killing themselves to embarrass Nato  Thisdisastrously gave the impression that Nato might stoop to the black propagandaat which the Milosevic regime excels            According to an Australian biologist certainrebel worker bees have found ways of breeding in defiance of the conventionthat only queen bees are allowed to reproduce Ben Oldroyd of the University ofSydney told the SydneyMorning Herald Thursday that in normal bee colonies only the queen isallowed to lay eggs and if worker bees lay their eggs they are destroyed inseconds by other bees which can identify the queens eggs by a specialchemical she marks them with Because of a genetic mutation however certainbees are able to put a fake royal marker on their eggs making other bees thinkthey are the queens The forgery enables a worker bees eggs to survivethrive and reproduce Oldroyd said
