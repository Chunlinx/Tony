                are you satisfied with the public school system in your area   uh well we dont have children but um from what our peers tell us um most of them do are not in favor of the way the Dallas public well i shouldnt get specific the way the public education system is run here   okay   um they just dont feel that um the quality of the teachers and the quality of the uh curriculum and they actually send them to uh the suburban areas i i guess its okay if i say the area Plano   sure uhhuh   um and i think one thing that the states doing right now about the refunding i think is completely unfair its not that i   yeah i dont agree with that either the the Robin Hood approach where the rich give to the poor   yeah yeah is is that the basic reason you dont agree with it   no i dont people move to the suburbs to Richardson and Plano uh uh mostly because of the school district because of the level of education thats offered   yeah yeah and theyre already paying for it i mean i you know um i know we used to live in Garland and a lot of the people there sent their kids to private school because um they just didnt like what was going on   yeah well it costs uh so much in taxes here and uh even if they do give money to the poorer school districts i dont think its going to lower my taxes at all   uhhuh i know it i mean i look at high schools like um what was the one in Richardson J J Pearce High School that just won the national academic some kind of um uh championship or tournament that they had for academics and that Richardson is one of the school districts that would be hit by taking away from them   yeah sure   thats a good way to say it the Robin Hood um approach   well thats thats exactly what what their doing um   yeah   i dont think thats going to improve the talent as far as the school teaching uh goes   you know i used to work at EDS and Ross Perot you know the big joke sometimes um about him but the one thing he did a few years back in testing the competency of the uh faculty   yeah   i still think thats a good idea   well i think it is too uh every   because i dont i dont know where did you go to school in Texas   no i went to school in Wisconsin   and i went to school in Chicago so i can tell you its probably the same type of thing that um i had a really good education but it wasnt where i went to high school it was an inner city but it the faculty was very good   right uhhuh well we need qualified teachers no matter whether theyre teaching in the inner city or the suburbs   and i dont know what you right   uh the trouble is that uh the suburbs are able to pay more thats going to attract the the better uh teachers   uhhuh which is understandable i mean id go where i would be compensated the most   sure and uh it cost more in tax money too so   yeah i mean its yeah in Texas i dont know i dont if its because of um the influx of minority uh in terms of that theyre trying to please all people and their not pleasing anybody you know i dont know if thats what it is   well it could very well be uh there is a definite racial split here   i dont know im not really yeah i mean i dont know if thats exactly it or not but it seems to be a little bit more um well i dont know schools in Wisconsin im trying to think of some of the things i know about the schools up north compared to down here it just seems like down here that unless youre in a suburban entity their SAT scores their reading comprehension levels theyre just not as high   well i was in a rural area in Wisconsin and uh we had a good public school system but i dont think it was great i think the curriculum was very deficient to prepare people to go to college   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh the the racial mix of um students in my area was entirely white we had uh no minorities at all     and mine was uh mine was completely um Hispanic in terms of Puerto Rican uh Caucasian and eastern European   okay well thats interesting   uh it was very eclectic um but the teachers were what did curriculum i mean they had things like philosophy and journalism i mean   huh   but there wasnt a uh real for people such as myself that knew they wanted to go to school and knew they wanted to um go to a fairly competitive undergraduate program it wasnt what i would call a uh a career a academic path preparatory path for college prep um as opposed to suburban schools like Evanston Illinois which has one of the largest  you know   right   uh student bodies in the country and the and the money base to go with it um   sure   i dont know i just look at high schools like Plano East and West and the ones in Richardson and i think well you know i would send a child there   well the good school districts here do have honors programs uh they do encourage that among the students who are uh prepared to go to college but uh that brings up a whole uh bunch of other problems um   uhhuh uhhuh yeah i mean my high school did have honors programs and i was in it but it really you know in terms of im wondering how much different it was compared to in terms of city now there is a high school um is it WTT White or is it Jefferson i dont know that much about the Dallas high school system um but i have heard that the of one or two that are very good but out of how many you know fifty to sixty high schools   sure   its just um and then i read the other day that Plano was going to be the site for a possibly new um parochial or Catholic high school   all right i havent heard that yet   something like to be one of the largest ones in the Southwest or something yeah   thats interesting i know some people at work who uh have uh children in high school and theyre not satisfied with the school district at all and they do send their kids to the private school private schools   uhhuh do they see and are they in Plano or are they in Dallas Dallas   um they send them to Saint Marks i think where ever thats located   okay yeah yeah thats one of the more um yeah i have some friends that uh have younger children and they send them to the Montessori system   yeah uhhuh   um and when you hear what theyre paying you just   well he he said about six hundred a month and that doesnt include their personal expense   oh my goodness   so youre youre talking about uh college uh level fees here   yeah twelve years and you add more than one child to that and you say oh my goodness yeah i   sure but i think i think the honors programs are good in the high schools but uh some of the problems you get are the kids that are in those programs get harassed by their peers       for doing too well   this is true yes i can personally relate to that yes   and that discourages them from doing well   uhhuh i dont know i think one thing the United States does um my stepfathers from England and one thing they do their at least in in the section of London where he was from that they um   so uh   they actually they call them externships but they actually the childs um uh they go by forms they dont go by grades and i guess i guess what would be the equivalent of our early high school nine tenth grade they call it the tenth of eleventh form um   yeah   they actually are forced to take time off and pick an area of study its proctored its you know regulated and all that sort of thing um but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own thing on a particul ar subject and it doesnt matter what it is   uhhuh   it has to be academic but they its free of their choosing   well their allowed to progress at their own pace then   right in that one just for that one particular semester quarter or what ever you know that one quarter uh a study unit would be and   all right   i dont know i dont think we do enough of that here in terms of getting children to think independently   no i can relate to part of that uh in in my high school uh say just for for example in my math courses uh i i was not to brag about this at all i was so far ahead of everybody else that i didnt have to go to class   uhhuh oh my   and i got to sit by myself in an empty room while everybody else was in class taking algebra and work at my own pace   uhhuh see yeah thats kind of what im talking about i mean um uh i mean we can only speak from personal experience and im not bragging either but its the same thing i mean i took AP or advanced placement classes   sure   and it there were things that i probably knew about in other segments but they just didnt offer them i mean they offered them in things like English and chemistry   yeah   two things that were obscure to what i was interested in in terms of um a career um i think part of the thing about schools today is too is the way the families have gone down the tubes the structure that now teachers play police officers you know their parenting their disciplinarians   yeah im sure that has a definite effect yeah   you know and im doing this all this second hand we dont have any kids in school or anything so i cant   well i i know people uh i dont have any kids either but uh from i know people who had been neighbors once upon a time   uhhuh   who had kids and whenever the father was traveling away on business or they they had financial problems their kids uh their it was definitely noticed at their performance in school   isnt that something i mean are parents  i mean my folks were divorced too but i cant remember ever i mean it was sort of just like uh you knew you had to study or you just didnt   yeah it got so bad with with this one kid that uh the the school uh called their parents up to ask if there were any problems going on   oh goodness   because his performance at school had degraded so much   i mean i wouldnt want to be growing up now a days thats one thing um but i dont know how you solve that you know those are social problems the academic problem i dont know i think of two or three things in my mind i think teachers should be tested   i i believe in that   and they probably would shoot me if they heard that and i know a lot of teachers um two i think that they should leave the funding or the money where the proven programs are     yeah   and three i do think that parents need to be more involved i dont know i just its probably easy to say because none of us have children but um i just   right well i remember as a kid uh they had PTA Parent Teacher Association meetings all the time   yeah association yeah   and uh my parents always went to those uh   yeah mine too i mean and do they have those anymore i mean i dont even   i i dont know   i dont have any uh but you know just the other day we were somewhere actually on Saturday we were in the Park Cities ordering in a we were in a specialty uh food shop ordering something to send out of state and the man we were all upon the topic of adoption which may be in our future um if were real lucky at any rate he was saying how he was glad that his two children one biological one natural um this had to do with the adopted the adopted one which biological i mean one adopted one natural um thats irrelevant but he was saying that uh my husband said and what does your son is very good looking what is he well hes nineteen he graduated last year um but hes interested in theater and hes just going to Richland and he said you know he said im not calling him stupid or slow he just he said he did really didnt want to study and he goes and you know he leaned over to my husband and he said well you know so and so he said when you have them if you get one what youll understand is youll just be glad if they dont you dont get a call from the police   sure   and he said our son Mark you know blah blah blah um he may be have only been a C student but weve never had trouble with him he said and when you raise a child in todays society he youre just glad they make it through school   uhhuh yeah well the the dropout rate is so high in Dallas and Fort Worth uh yes it is i i think its thirty eight percent     is it see i dont even know that
