                                 Reading the Inaugurals            President ClintonsInaugural Address this month is the  rd in the series that began in All are worth a readnot just the highlights such as George WashingtonAbraham Lincoln and FDR They will give you a feeling of being there not asan omniscient historian of  looking back at  or  but as an ordinarycitizen who sharesand is limited bythe information the concerns and thevalues of those times Thanks to Columbia University all the addresses can befound on the Web            Among allthe past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literarygenius Lincoln After  years his second inaugural still brings tears toyour eyes and chills your blood None of the other inaugural addresses are inthat league But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches givenby articulate men each in touch with his times and aware that his inaugurationwas the most solemn occasion of his life            The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gonethrough three phases The first lasting until Lincoln was that of the modestclassic public servant The second lasting through William Howard Taft was ofthe prosaic government executive The third in which we are still is thephase of the assertive theatrical leaderpreacher This classification is notwaterproof Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren GHardingCalvin CoolidgeHerbert Hoover in the second But the trend isclear            On picking up Washingtonsfirst inaugural one is immediately struck by the modesty He had just beenelected unanimously by the Electoral College He was more respected than anysubsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration And what does hesay                           The magnitude anddifficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me beingsufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens adistrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm withdespondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticedin the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of hisown deficiencies                        None of his successors has made the point asforcefully as that But echoes are to be found in almost every president forthe next  years John Adams was an exception He was apparently so enviousof Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his ownexcellent qualifications for the job That era ended with Lincoln Subsequentinaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility but they areperfunctory and do not sound sincere            Theantebellum modesty while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette ofthe time may also have served a political objective to alleviate the concernsof those whoin the early days of the republicfeared it might be transformedinto a monarchy and the president into a king A little later perhaps after a new worry arose Would the power of the federal government be used tointerfere with the peculiar domestic institution of the Southern states Thepresidents assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intendedto give comfort to those states            Lincoln faced a different situation With the South alreadyseceding he could only preserve protect and defend the Constitution byasserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chiefexecutive It was no time for modesty Lincolns successors inherited a federalgovernment with much more authorityand more need to use itthan before thewar and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers            In the third phase theInaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the governments policy toinspiring the publics behavior Presidents recognizedor at leastbelievedthat the country had problems they ought to deal with but could notmanage by using the instruments of government alone Thus in his firstinaugural Woodrow Wilson said At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of ourlife as a whole We see the bad with the good the debased and decadent withthe sound and the vital With this vision we approach new affairs            If thecountry is debased and decadent the cure has to come from uplifting thepeople not from acts of government Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appearin later inaugurals            Presidents derived their license to serve asleaderpreacher from Theodore Roosevelts remark that the presidency was abully pulpit a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address Themetaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact betweenthe preacher and his flock Radio andeven moretelevision made this possibleon a national scale A telltale sign of the leaderpreacher inaugural is theuse of the phrase Let us  meaning You do as I say This expressionappears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals but it has hit itsstride in recent years John F Kennedy repeated it  times in his InauguralAddress and Richard Nixon has it  times in his second one            Thechange in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated byone statistic In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchananthe average number of words per sentence was  From Lincoln to Wilson it was and since Wilson it has been  I do not consider this a deteriorationthis article has an average of  words per sentence but it does reflect thechange in the size and character of the audience and in the means ofcommunication William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments ofAthens Rome and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know whathe was talking about That wouldnt be true today But Harrisons audiencewould not have known what the Internet was            Presidents and their speech writers have mined theirpredecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attributionKennedys trumpet call Ask not what your country can do for you Ask what youcan do for your country has an ironic history In his inaugural Hardingsurely no model for Kennedy had said Our most dangerous tendency is toexpect too little of government and at the same time do for it too littleAnd even before he became president in a speech in  Harding had said Inthe great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what thegovernment can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for thenation            Many anissue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more Thatincludes the Indians the coastal fortifications territorial expansion theIsthmus Canal civilservice reform polygamy and Prohibition Some subjectsthat you expect to appear dont Hoovers inaugural March   gives nohint of economic vulnerability Roosevelts second inaugural Jan  contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany But what is most amazing atleast to a reader in  is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject ofwomen The word women does not appear at all until Wilsons first inauguraland it always appears as part of the phrase men and women never as referringto any special concerns of women Even Harding the first president to bechosen in an election in which women voted nationally does not remark on theuniqueness of the fact in his inaugural            One subject that does get ample treatment istaxes Taxes or some equivalent word appears in  of the  inauguraladdresses to date Coolidge said in  The time is arriving when we canhave further tax reduction  I am opposed to extremely high rates becausethey produce little or no revenue because they are bad for the country andfinally because they are wrong Federal taxes were then about  percent ofthe gross domestic product Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in when they were  percent            The mostdisturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaidon the subject of race relations which Arthur Schlesinger Jr calls thesupreme American problem The words black blacks Negro or race asapplied to blacks do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes  JamesMonroe asked in  On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of ourUnion Who has been deprived of any right of person or property These wererhetorical questions intended to get the answer No oneas if there werenot millions of slaves in America            Before the Civil War the word slavery appears only in theInaugural Address of Martin Van Buren  and Buchanan  and then onlyas something that pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve theUnion should not be interfered with But although generally unmentionable thesubject was boiling and would boil over in  After the Civil War it is inthe inaugurals of Hayes James Garfield  and Benjamin Harrison that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convertinto reality the rights and freedom granted to the freedmen on paper by the th   th  and  th amendments Garfieldswas the strongest among these He had been a student at Williams College inthe s  years before me when the college had been a station on theunderground railway But the subject then began to fade William McKinley saidin his first Inaugural Address March   Lynchings must not be toleratedin a great and civilized country like the United States but he said itwithout horror Taft raised the subject of race relations in  only toexpress satisfaction at the progress that had been made And then the subjectdisappeared FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals            After World War II thesubject came back to inaugural addresses but in a weak and abstract form Thatis true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with racerelations in Americalike Harry Truman Lyndon Johnson and Bill ClintonPerhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a blackwomanMarian Anderson Leontyne Price or Maya Angelouperform at hisceremony In Clintons first inaugural the only allusion to the race problemis in this sentence From our revolution the Civil War to the GreatDepression to the civil rights movement our people have always mustered thedetermination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history Irecall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere butonly to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal tothe values shared by Americans            There ismuch more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here There is muchto be proud of in what we have endured and achieved in the peacefultransference of power and in the reasonableness and moderation of thepresidents we have elected But there is also much humility to be learned Welook back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by whatour past leaders have said and our past citizens believed We should recognizethat  or  years from now readers will shake their heads at what we aresaying and believing today                           POSTSCRIPT To read Herbert Steins analysis of President Clintons secondInaugural Address click
