                what kind of lawn and garden work do you do   well right now the place where im living the yard was basically neglected for the about the last twenty five years so ive been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn and after three years of working at it ive ive been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back instead instead of mowing it the same direction every time changing one day youll or one one one time youll cut it cut the lawn the long way then youll go the opposite way instead of going lengthways you go width and it helps the grass come back   oh does it really i didnt know that did um youve been working on it for three years     for for three years   really what have you done   killing lots of fire ants       i was firmly convinced the entire front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound   uhhuh   because it was like you couldnt you couldnt even stand still out there without ants starting   you know i can barely hear you   is this better   yeah a little bit yeah   it was like youd go out in the yard to water something youd just be standing still   uhhuh   and the ants would start crawling up your legs and its like im not standing in a mound though   oh wow how did you get rid of them   uh Dursban Two   pardon   a chemical called Dursban Two its a crystal   oh Dursban Two yeah  Dursban will get rid of just about anything i think but um so you havent had a problem with that since   um not bad every once in a while youll have a mound pop up but thats   yeah   gonna to be expected   what else did it kill did it kill anything else it wasnt supposed to   um as far as i can tell it hasnt killed anything it wasnt supposed to the even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds it didnt kill it   not really yeah really well thats pretty wild we yeah we used it for fleas we had fleas in our yard real bad last year and we did that um i just im not basically i like to mow the lawn believe it or not but i sometimes have problems starting the mower so a lot of times i dont get out and do it but my husband basically does most of it and he does the you know edging and all that kind of thing and were renting and so we dont really put a lot of money into the uh you know this like this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt and some Saint Augustine we just we have winter rye out back and we have i dont even know what it is out front but um we this is the first house weve ever lived in and were just not real into the lawn probably because we rent i guess huh but anyway   well well you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard   right uhhuh we get   uh i found one thing that its kind of a weird thing to say to put out in the lawn but every time ive done it its got it it drives the fleas completely out of the area   what   powdered sulphur   oh really hm i wonder why it does   you dont you dont have to put a whole lot out just if youve got a broadcast spreader   uhhuh   i think it comes in a forty pound bag and its real fine like flour   uhhuh   and you just sift   yeah   go out and do the entire yard and you i mean you dont have to put clumps of it just very lightly cover the entire yard   really well ill have to remember that because uh hopefully we wont have them this year but we have a cat that comes in and out and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was uh quite a drag because um we got them in our house and were Christians and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas and we got rid of them believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do but we did and so we dont want them back this year you know so ill remember that if we see its a problem in the yard we almost they were so bad last year even ticks it i dont know weve had ticks before a lot and weve had to get out and treat our lawn for that i think we used Dursban we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing you know and spread it all out everywhere but thats about the extent of our lawn care so i dont know do you enjoy doing it   oh i love it my wife cant understand itd be a hundred degrees outside ill be out there but its too hot to be working in the yard im under the trees im having fun and im stopping to drink water so whats the problem   yeah well thats well thats funny yeah not everybody enjoys it though everybody has a different things i kind of enjoy it and my husband doesnt i kind of have to sometimes im too busy to get out there and do it and he you know he doesnt really enjoy doing it but hell do it and he doesnt gripe about it or anything but you know im kind of like you and hes kind of like your wife and you know in that he doesnt really enjoy it but i would like to have a garden though thats my thing but right now where were living we have the trees where the uh roots are at the top of the ground everywhere all over the ground i dont know what kind of trees they are but you cant have a garden you cant till it or itll itll tear up a nice tiller so were going to wait until we move we dont have a lot of sun either because it big trees back there so were going to wait and when we move thats one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a um garden and so id like to do that i have a feeling ill be out there all the time taking care of that but thats our next thing do you have a garden   ive got the this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at im sitting on about a two acre lot now and uh half of its the back half is my garden   umhum oh are you kidding that sounds fun where do yall live   uh in Missouri City southwest southwest side of Houston   oh really what southwest where   southwest Houston   oh really oh because were in Dallas i guess i assumed you were here well thats neat and um yeah thats what we want we have a yeah thats really what we want but we just havent been able to do that yet so one day well be able to do it and im excited about it and then i dont know anything about it and ill have to learn and maybe ill give you a on gardening       what do you do in your garden and ill go nothing what is should i do but anyway i guess thats about it though it sounds like weve covered all the bases so i guess well let you go and um do you have anything else you wanted to say   uh no  enjoyable very enjoyable conversation with you   okay i know you too i hope you have a nice day and well talk to you later bye   okay you too okay byebye
