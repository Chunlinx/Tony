          ill let you go first   well i think i dont know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes   umhum   and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax so if youre renting a house or doing anything else youre not actually contributing to the education of your children and i think thats wrong i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system so as it turns out we dont really have a tremendous education system because they dont have the money they need to run it   yeah i uh i spent a couple uh years down in uh Plano Texas   umhum   and uh i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death for the uh Plano uh school system   yeah yeah   and uh  ive you know i know that Texas doesnt have a state tax and so all the things come out of the the property taxes   no   and i was uh really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying i was i was better off paying a state tax  back in Maryland where  than i was uh paying the uh property tax down there   yeah yeah you would be   uh what they did in Maryland to get around that is they uh they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services  that the renters were getting including the uh educational services   oh yeah   and uh the tax was administered by um the uh rental company that actually was managing the apartments so when uh long long time ago when i used to live in apartments i would pay a rent   uh   payment every month and a tax payment every month   gee   and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was getting as a a resident of that particular county   yeah um   and uh thats the way it worked here in Maryland we have uh a certain portion of your your property taxes uh goes to education but also a portion of the state tax that you pay   yeah   goes back into the county that you live in   ah   to pay for the educational system   oh well thats pretty good   and so it it works out nice it it it makes it so that the uh whole county now i i know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland uh like Collin County uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County here in Maryland   oh yeah   i mean the the counties are much larger you know in the the whole state of Maryland i believe theres only like uh fifteen counties   gee whiz   and so uh you know each county has their own school system an and it works out real nice um the the the flip side to this is are we getting what were paying for and i dont believe so um a lot of things have come to head um recently and i heard a report because of uh   yeah   uh the emphasis that the President was putting on education   umhum   you know um him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something um   yeah   they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education in other words they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing   yeah   and then at the end of uh school year they would be tested and then they go into the fourth grade and everybody in the fourth grades basically taught the same thing so when they came up with these this nationwide system of public schools   yeah   uh they gave some figures out and since its inception uh theyve the price has gone up per student the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent   yeah   and so theyre actually spending thirty three percent and thats real dollars you know that adjusting it back to to the days you know when it started uh probably you know seventy years ago   yeah   and what theyve said is that we havent had a thirty three percent improvement in education   no huhuh   weve actually gone backwards   well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation that our high school graduates cant even match the national average   yeah   so you know our school system down here is no where near perfect but they keep complaining they dont have the money to do it   yeah well they theyve been having some problems uh even here in uh like Baltimore City which is a a pretty good city good good sized city   yeah   uh theyve been putting a lot of uh stress on it and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything theyre supposed to do and of course theyve uh been cutting the teachers salaries because they say we dont have the money to do it and   oh yeah yep   all the services are costing more money and and everything uh but the uh a lot of emphasis now is being put on you know when children used to be taught you know like uh uh each child is individual you know theyre not all the same   yeah yeah they need to take things at their own speed   and some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old   yeah umhum   and you know seem to excel and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on uh one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed some kids   yeah i think itd be a lot better   yeah   you know each child has to learn at his own rate they cant keep force feeding things to each other and or you know at the kids   and and uh and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior   umhum because he cant do it   because hes not as good as another kid his same age i mean its like   yeah   you know thats ridiculous   and its not that he cant do it he just cant do it quite as fast or   yeah and uh you know i have uh i i have five children total and ive got two out of the house already and i have i have two that are in uh eighth grade this year   yeah all right   and prior to their um when i when they were in elementary school they were identified identified as being slow   yeah   and so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade and it wasnt until the last two years um last year my uh theyre theyre a set of twins um a boy and a girl last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well   umhum all right   and it it it everything started to click in for him and he knew what he n eeded to do um and this year it it happened for uh for the daughter   huh all right   she just has been   jumped on out there   really doing grea t this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think its just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible   thats good yeah i did too up until ninth or tenth grade   up until about yeah about the seventh eighth grade i i i started to to come around and realize an and basically i got interested in math and uh never really did well in English but you know once you got interested in something   yeah   and things started to click in place then after that you take off   yeah and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take but we lived out in the country and we didnt have all that   umhum   fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our agricultural shop and   yeah   you know we had just about every thing that we needed but they dont have it anymore theres a lot of things that they dont do in school anymore our our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here and they go to school four and half days a week so   jeez   thats pretty weird   yeah it is um my children had a uh real culture shock um when we lived in Plano i guess i dont know if youve heard about the Plano school district but theyre uh they really stress academics there   no hum   and uh God if your child is not an honor student well then  youre something wrong with you as a parent and that thats kind of the way they are there   gee yeah   and uh when we moved back to Maryland um i moved to a uh a Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland   umhum   and its basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point   yeah   and we lived you know in the northern part of the county uh we went from a uh middle school in Texas that served fifty five square blocks to a uh middle school in Maryland that served fifty five square miles   yeah   and it was just a complete culture shock because i mean they theyre riding on the bus in the morning with uh other kids that you know are a sleep because they got up at three oclock and were doing chores and you know its   yeah i can imagine yeah yeah that would be quite a shock   and they had uh agricultural they had an agricultural course uh i forget what it was called uh but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts but its  agricultural and where they had to raise a small animal   umhum oh like Four H then   had to learn how to drive a tractor they actually had to go take a driving test on the tractor i mean they just couldnt believe this and it was great they loved it   all right all right   i mean they really enjoyed the courses um and it you know it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain   yeah just something you do everyday   yeah and it was you know it was like  kind of like the way we feel about going to work   yeah yeah just something i have to do everyday     but uh up here they seem to have made it uh a lot of fun for them and they they seem to really enjoy it   thats good our oldest boy went into school politics and made vice
