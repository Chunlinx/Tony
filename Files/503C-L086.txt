              November        Name Address City ST Zip      Dear Name      Please send a million dollars so we can really support geological      activities here at IUPUI in perpetuity Late last Spring we established      an account for the IGGS Scholarship to help defray the tuition costs for      an undergraduate major in Geology at IUPUI As I explained at that Spring      meeting I hoped that eventually the IGGS Scholarship fund would have a      principal of  so that the interest would cover the complete costs      for a student for one year The account now has about       There are several ways that we can reach the balance of our target      principal The simplest is for one or more of the members to simply      donate one million dollars to the IGGS Scholarship Fund If because of      the depressed stock market your assets are not liquid enough for you to      come up with one million dollars this year then we can consider one of      the other alternate ways to achieve our goal      One alternate is for you and each of the  friends of IGGS on my      mailing list to contribute  to the Scholarship Fund and our goal      will be reached immediately      Another alternate way to reach our Scholarship goal is for everyone to      contribute as much as he or she can this year and each year for the near      future and sooner or later the goal will be attained      Let me assure you that we would appreciate receiving one million      dollars from you But let me also assure you that we would appreciate      equally well the contribution you are able to make Whatever you can      contribute you will be helping to support a geology student at      IUPUI      Your taxdeductible contribution may be sent in the enclosed      postagepaid envelope with the attached return card As an Indiana      resident your gift qualifies for a special tax credit of  up to a      maximum of  for an individual or  for a joint return For your      convenience I am enclosing a copy of Form CC which should be filed      with your Indiana State Income Tax      Sincerely      Arthur Mirsky Chairman
