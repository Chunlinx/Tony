                    Background        The tumor suppressor gene PTEN also called MMAC has        been found deleted or mutated in a great variety of human        tumors and tumor cell lines       and its tumor        suppressing function has been confirmed in several         in vitro studies                  Mice which are homozygously deficient in wildtype PTEN die        during embryonic development and harbor regions of        increased cellular proliferation whereas heterozygous mice        are viable but spontaneously develop tumors of various        origins             PTEN has been shown to exhibit dual specificity protein        phosphatase activity as well as lipid phosphatase activity                in vitro                 These enzymatic functions appear to be involved in the        regulation of at least two separate signal transduction        pathways First PTENs protein phosphatase activity is        able to downregulate focal adhesion kinase FAK        phosphorylation which leads to the inactivation of the        RasMAP kinase pathway       Second its lipid        phosphatase activity targets the second messenger        phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate PtdInsP           and thereby blocks activation of the        protein kinase B PKBAkt pathway                Whereas both of the above pathways are intimately involved        in the control of cell growth and survival PTENregulated        FAK activity further appears to impinge on cell adhesion        cell migration and cell invasion      It therefore        emerges that the loss of PTEN activity may confer increased        survival ability proliferative potential and invasive        capacity on cells and thereby may promote progression        towards a more malignant phenotype        A characteristic phenotype of tumorigenic cells is their        ability to grow anchorageindependently in suspension        culture or embedded in soft agar without the need for        attachment to the surface of a cell culture dish             A flurry of papers has established a close link between        anchorageindependent growth and the activity of several        components of the cell cycle machinery such as various        cyclins cyclindependent kinases CDKs and the CDK        inhibitors p Cipand p Kip                 There are indications that PTEN may be involved in these        processes as well For example mouse embryonal stem ES        cells with homozygous deletion of the PTEN gene exhibit        increased anchorageindependent growth as compared to        normal ES cells     Similarly transfer of a wild type        PTEN gene into anchorageindependent human glioblastoma        cells which lack functional PTEN results in their        greatly reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar              The interpretation of these latter findings however        is complicated by the strong antiproliferative effects of        PTEN even in monolayer culture which is consistently        observed when the wild type version of this gene is        introduced into PTENnegative tumor cells                   Moreover in human glioma and breast cancer cell        lines the ectopic expression of wild type PTEN leads to        anoikis which is apoptosis initiated by the disruption of        cell matrixinteractions               Because essentially all of these previous studies have        analyzed PTEN function by introducing the cloned version of        the gene back into PTENdeficient cells essentially        nothing is known about the regulation of the endogenous        PTEN gene in response to alterations of cellmatrix        interactions For example it is unclear whether PTEN is        constitutively active or becomes activated in response to        changes in the cellular microenvironment Here we present        our findings that in normal anchoragedependent fibroblast        cells the expression and activity of endogenous PTEN is        increased when cellular adhesion to matrix is disrupted In        parallel phosphorylation of FAK a known target of PTEN        is greatly reduced In view of PTENs potent        growthinhibitory capacity we conclude from our study that        the increased expression and activity of endogenous PTEN in        response to the disruption of cellmatrix interactions        contributes to the maintenance of the anchoragedependent        phenotype of normal cells                    Results        A model to study cell regulatory events during        anchorageindependent growth is the culture of cells in        suspension ie on HEMAcoated plates that prevent cells        from attachment to the matrix of the cell culture dish            Several studies have employed this approach and        characterized the regulation of various cell        cycleregulatory proteins after the transfer of cells to        such suspension culture          Here we        have used this model to analyze the potential involvement        of the tumor suppressor PTEN        The murine cell line T and the human cell line        MDAH both of which are anchoragedependent fibroblasts        were detached from their tissue culture dishes and cultured        further on HEMAcoated plates As shown in Figure  this        transfer to suspension culture resulted in elevated        expression of PTEN protein in each cell line This increase        was apparent within the first four hours and continued for        several more hours In parallel the expression of cyclin        A an essential component of certain cyclindependent        kinases and absolutely required for the progression of        cells through the cell cycle      was downregulated        under these conditions Figure  consistent with earlier        observations       Furthermore expression of the        CDK inhibitor p Kipwas strongly increased in suspension        cells Figure  similar to what has been observed in        other cell types after the disruption of cellmatrix        interactions       Finally as we have reported        before     the expression of cdk one of the        catalytic subunits of CDKs was not significantly altered        in suspension culture cells and therefore could be used as        a loading control for the Western blot analysis As        expected in the case of anchoragedependent cells the        activity of cyclindependent kinases was strongly reduced        and cell proliferation was inhibited under these suspension        culture conditions not shown        To analyze whether the observed induction of PTEN        protein was due to elevated expression of its mRNA        Northern blot analysis was performed In this case        increased expression was found as well Figure  In MDAH        cells in particular the increase in PTEN mRNA closely        correlated with the observed increase in PTEN protein and        encompassed both major mRNA species of  and  kb In        the mouse cells only the shorter mRNA species appeared to        be induced In order to determine the relative increase in        PTEN mRNA levels the Northern blots were stripped and        rehybridized with control probes for actin and choA the        latter a highly abundant mRNA of unknown function            We consistently found that the amount of actin mRNA was        somewhat reduced during suspension culture whereas the        amount of choA remained relatively stable We therefore        used choA as the loading control and calculated the        increase in PTEN mRNA with reference to choA Using this        approach we determined that PTEN mRNA was increased up to        fold in MDAH cells and fold in T cells This        induction was comparable to the increase observed in        Western blot analysis and therefore indicated that the        levels of PTEN protein were elevated due to the increased        expression of PTEN mRNA Although clearly induced in both        cell lines the kinetics of PTEN induction in T and        MDAH cells were somewhat different at later time points        ie there was a slight reduction of PTEN mRNA and protein        in MDAH cells at  hours possibly indicating some cell        typespecific differences        By using nuclear runoff analysis we further determined        that the induction of PTEN was regulated at the        transcriptional level ie the transcription of the PTEN        gene was significantly higher in cells that were        transferred to suspension culture conditions Figure                We next analyzed whether the elevated quantity of PTEN        protein would indeed be reflected in increased phosphatase        activity in suspension culture cells In order to establish        whether PTEN protein phosphatase activity could be reliably        measured in vitro we first transfected PTENnegative U        cells with an expression vector harboring PTEN cDNA As a        control the cells were also transfected with empty vector        Then PTEN was immunoprecipitated from the respective        cellular lysates and the antigenantibody complex was        analyzed for protein phosphatase activity As shown in        Figure A only cells transfected with PTEN cDNA exhibited        significant enzymatic activity Nontransfected U cells        or cells transfected with vector alone did not exhibit        protein phosphatase activity above background levels        After having established that PTEN protein phosphatase        activity could be determined specifically we transferred        MDAH cells to suspension culture conditions and measured        PTEN activity at various times afterwards As shown in        Figure B there was an increase in PTEN activity that        could be detected as early as four hours after detachment        and reached its maximum at around  hours It is        noticeable that the activity at the onset of the experiment         hours cells attached to tissue culture plates was        higher than background which likely indicates some basal        activity of PTEN in attached cells This basal level        activity was not detectable in PTENnegative U cells        compare Figure A        Focal adhesion kinase FAK is a known substrate for        PTEN and has been shown to be dephosphorylated by this        phosphatase in vitro and in vivo       We        therefore determined whether the increased PTEN phosphatase        activity would correlate with decreased phosphorylation of        FAK in our cells This was indeed the case As shown in        Figure  the detachment of MDAH cells from their matrix        resulted in decreased tyrosinespecific phosphorylation of        FAK The overall amount of FAK protein in these cells did        not change under these conditions indicating that the loss        of tyrosine phosphorylation was not caused by reduced        amounts of protein        In light of a recent report establishing the tumor        suppressor p as a transcriptional activator of PTEN        expression     we investigated whether this protein        would affect the observed induction of PTEN in our cell        system As MDAH cells themselves are pnegative we used        MDAH cells stably transfected with a tetracyclineregulated        p gene called TR     These TR cells were        pretreated with or without tetracycline in monolayer        culture After the induction of p was maximal the cells        were transferred to suspension culture conditions and        analyzed for their expression of PTEN As shown in Figure         the degree of PTEN induction was essentially the same in        the absence or presence of p indicating that p did not        affect the induction of PTEN protein under these        conditions In parallel MDAH cells were also treated with        tetracycline and transferred to suspension culture In this        case as well tetracycline treatment had no effect on the        induction of PTEN confirming that tetracycline by itself        did not affect PTEN expression Figure  In conclusion        MDAH cells pnegative T cells ppositive and        TR cells high or low levels of p all exhibited        similarly increased expression levels of PTEN in response        to the disruption of cellmatrix interactions Therefore        we conclude that the observed induction of PTEN occurs        independent of p                    Discussion        In light of the close correlation between the        anchorageindependent phenotype and the tumorigenicity of        transformed cells it is important to fully understand the        cellular mechanisms that are involved in cell growth arrest        after the disruption of cellmatrix interactions Many        previous studies in this area have focused on the        contribution of various components of the cell cycle        machinery Collectively they have established that the        expression of cyclin A and cyclin D in combination with        the activity of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitors p        Cipand p Kip is a crucial determinant of        anchoragedependent cell growth culture                 However while the above elements clearly are essential        executioners of cell cycle progression it is conceivable        that other elements directly or indirectly might be        involved in anchoragedependent growth control as well In        this regard a report from our laboratory has indicated a        role for the serinethreonine specific protein phosphatase        type A PPA            In this current study we investigated the response of        the PTEN tumor suppressor to changes in cellmatrix        interactions of anchoragedependent human and mouse        fibroblast cells Previous studies by others had shown that        the ectopic expression of PTEN in anchorageindependent        tumor cells greatly reduced their ability to grow in soft        agar       In this latter situation however the        forced expression of ectopic PTEN effectively impairs        cellular proliferation in general even under        twodimensional culture conditions where the cells are        attached to substratum             It was        therefore difficult to discern from these experiments how        effectively and selectively PTEN participates in        anchoragedependent growth control As an alternative to        the forced expression of ectopic PTEN in        anchorageindependent PTENnegative tumor cells our study        has focused on the regulation of endogenous PTEN in        anchoragedependent mouse and human fibroblasts We found        that upon detachment both cell lines exhibited increased        levels of PTEN expression due to the transcriptional        activation of the PTEN gene The increased levels of PTEN        protein resulted in strongly increased intracellular PTEN        phosphatase activity Thus our results revealed a close        correlation between the disruption of cellmatrix        interactions and the subsequent activation of the PTEN        phosphatase In light of the wellestablished        growthinhibitory effects exerted by increased levels of        this phosphatase it is reasonable to conclude that this        activation of PTEN significantly contributes to the        anchoragedependent phenotype ie to the inhibition of        cell proliferation after detachment from matrix        It should be noted that the fibroblast cells lines we        used remain fully viable after detachment and transfer to        suspension culture      This is in contrast to most        epithelial cells which undergo anoikis ie apoptotic        cell death after the disruption of cellmatrix interactions            It is of interest that some anchorageindependent        tumor cells most of which are of epitheloid origin become        susceptible to anoikis after the introduction of exogenous        PTEN        These observations are in line with        the established ability of PTEN to downregulate the        phosphatidylinositol kinase PIKPKB survival pathway             The absence of anoikis in our two cell lines        may reflect inherent cell type specific differences ie        the superior ability of fibroblasts to survive under        suspension culture conditions One could speculate that        increased levels of PTEN might favor growth arrest in        fibroblasts versus apoptosis in epitheloid cells        Furthermore it appears that the specific experimental or        physiological conditions of cellular attachment or        detachment might influence the precise function of PTEN in        these processes For example it was shown recently that        the reduction of PTEN expression levels by antisense        oligonucleotides in a colon carcinoma cell line generated        differential effects on cell adhesion depending on whether        the cells were kept under static or hydrodynamic conditions        of fluid flow            One of the established in vivo substrates of PTEN FAK        is known to play a major role in growthregulatory signal        transduction initiated by cell surface integrin receptors             As we observe a correlation between increased        PTEN activity and decreased levels of FAK phosphorylation        compare Figure Band Figure  it is likely that the        dephosphorylation of FAK in response to the disruption of        cellmatrix interactions is accomplished by increased PTEN        activity Such a scenario would plausibly explain some of        PTENs growthinhibitory effect Additional        growthinhibitory effects of increased PTEN activity are        likely to occur through the stimulation of the cell cycle        inhibitor p Kip This protein acts as inhibitor of        cyclindependent kinases the cell cycle engine            and its elevated expression has been consistently        demonstrated in different cell types after the disruption        of cellmatrix interactions compare Figure and               Furthermore p Kipis an established target of        PTEN signaling ie its activity has been found increased        after the forced expression of exogenous PTEN               In combination with the data presented in this        manuscript it therefore appears that PTEN contributes to        anchoragedependent growth control by a twofold approach        the dephosphorylation of the signaling molecule FAK in        combination with the stimulation of the cell cycle        inhibitor p Kip                    Conclusions        In view of PTENs potent growthinhibitory capacity we        conclude that its induction after cellmatrix disruptions        contributes to the maintenance of the anchoragedependent        phenotype of normal cells The underlying processes involve        the stimulation of expression of p Kipand the        dephosphorylation of FAK                    Materials and Methods                  Materials          HEMA polyHEMA polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate was          obtained from Sigma St Louis MO and
