                     Just start talking         Go                     OK um lets see         I remember when I was probably around nine ten eleven somewhere in there we used to play outside a lot         We used to play kickball a lot         We had groups of us that would get together and play kickball every night until it got dark so dark that we couldnt see and then we rode our bikes         And back then it was colder in the Charlotte area than it is now and we would have snow at least once or twice a year and it wasnt unusual to get a foot of snow         And we all had ice skates so we would ice skate up and down the streets I remember doing that         We missed at least two weeks of school every year for snow and we always had heavy coats and mittens stuff that you dont have now here                     Huh                     Yeah         And the only place there were no skating rinks in Charlotte         The only place that you there were no roller skating rinks at all         The only place that you could go iceskating was at the Coliseum         And every weekend we would have hockey games and during the day they would you know redo the ice and then you could ice skate         So thats what we did during the day         And lets see I used to climb trees         Once I climbed a tree a pine tree and I got to the top and it started swaying         And I was afraid and I couldnt come down and so my daddy had to get this really high ladder and come up it and get me down         You know about that dont you                     Yes                              Been there done that         Um lets see there was uh obviously no VCRs or any of that         I remember when color we had a little black and white TV thats all anybody had         And I remember when color TV came out and I was so excited         My parents finally bought a color television and the first thing that we watched in color was Bonanza         And I was madly in love with Little Joe                                                               And I remember running around outside being really really hot thinking Bonanza would come on at  on Sundays         And wed come running back in the house to watch it and wed be all hot and sweaty and dirty and mother would make us sit on the floor and wed sit there watching Bonanza         And lets see and the other thing that I remember that was my favorite movie was The Wizard of Oz         That was my very favorite movie         And then lets see movies very different from now         The only theatres that was in Charlotte was the Manor Theatre on Providence Road and what was called the Carolina Theatre up town         That was the only places to go to the movies         There were no shopping malls         Um we would ride the buses a big treat was to ride the bus uptown to go shopping at Ivys and Belks         And for Christmas they had these elaborate window displays and we would ride the buses uptown on the weekend to look at all the and walk all through uptown to look at the window displays with all the Christmas decorations         That was the big entertainment         I remember when Carolina Place Mall was built that was the first mall         Everyone was excited about that         Um we used to go shopping there         When I was your age I worked uptown and um there was only two big buildings First Union building and the Wachovia building and all the rest of it were parking lots         So its its changed a little bit                  I cant think of anything else to talk about                  We didnt um in Charlotte back in the s and s they didnt have the big orange school buses and we either walked to school because everything was neighborhood schools so in elementary school we always walked to school         And there was like a thing where wed cut through the woods         Thats to tell how different it was         It was totally safe you never locked your doors         We cut through the woods walking to school         Um and then when I got in junior high we started riding city buses to school         Im not sure how that worked or how the route worked I just remember doing it         And we had sock hops on Saturdays         Once a month wed have a sock hop and wed walk to that          or wed thumb         And the first time I ever went to Myrtle Beach I was  years old and it was we went with a friends of mine         Her parents were renting a place and she and I and another one of our girlfriends went         And we would go up and down the main drag there at Myrtle Beach where the Pavilion is and we would thumb up and down the and we would just hop in the car with guys and ride up and down and yell and wave to everybody and then wed get tired of those guys and wed hop and go hop out and hop in the car with some more guys                  It was totally safe         You never worried about it         Um then all the hippie stuff started in the s and that was during Vietnam         When I was in uh junior high and high school there was big letter writing campaign to all the soldiers in Vietnam a lot of the guys I was in high school with got drafted                     Uhhuh                     Uh hmm Im running out of things to say again                  I was dating a guy that lived in the apartment beside Steve         And Steve would see me going up there to visit him or see us going out and stuff         And then um a neighbor that lived across the street from me her husband was a member of the Jump Club Steve was jumping then and she had a cookout one night invited some people over and I went over there and um I think I was the youngest one there         They were all going out to a club or something and I wasnt old enough to get in but I went with the rest of them         I think I was kind of at the end of the line and I snuck in anyway and Steve thought I was really cute         And then he got home and I dont know how he got my phone number         He got it from somebody and called me         And I wasnt really dating that guy that seriously so I decided to go out with Steve         So I went out with him         Then I was dating this other guy         And then one of my girlfriends that was living with me at the time we worked together at First Union she bet me that I couldnt date a different guy every day for  weeks so I did that                  I thought youd get a kick out of that one         I used to be cute                                                               Um anyway Steve and I dated I guess not quite a year about nine months or so and then we decided to get married and then he took it back and then we decided to get married and then he took it back and then we decided to get married and then he took it back again         What else         Hmm                  Ask me a question                     So did you get married                      years ago                              Obviously                     Yeah         There were no there were only two night clubs in Charlotte so if you wanted to go out like to listen to music and dance there was only two places to go         So most everything the apartment complexes would have parties         Like every weekend there would be parties in the clubhouses of the apartment complexes and that was pretty much where you would go to dance and just hang out with your friends         Um things escape me                  Oh         When I was in high school the big excitement was cruising Shoneys         There were four Shoneys in Charlotte and you would ride from one it was like a big circle and you would ride from one to the other and everybody would hang out there because it was a drivein then so all the cars were parked outside         And you could cruise through to see who was there and if it wasnt any cute guys there or anybody you liked then you would cruise to the next one         They were spread out around town so it would take about an hour to drive between all of them         And they had the the Shoneys Big Boy was always sitting out front         And that was the big thing for all the guys was to steal the Shoneys Big Boy and try to get it on top of their car and go riding down the road with it on top of the car         Um once when I was in high school I spent the night with my girlfriend across the street and we snuck out and pushed her mothers brand new Camero out of the driveway and halfway down the road then we started it         And then we went cruising and we had an egg fight with some other guys riding down Independence Blvd         We were leaning out the windows throwing eggs at each other and everywhere the eggs hit it knocked the paint off her mothers brand new car         So we had to get jobs and earn the money to repaint the car                  I was a little wild                     Yeah                     Family things         All my familys in eastern North Carolina so we went there several times a year to my grandmothers and aunts and uncles         I had two cousins that were my age         And I spent a lot of summers I spent like a whole month in the summer there with them         We this was at the beach and wed go to the beach during the day and the movies or stuff at night         The family would come up here         The most traumatic thing my daddy decided to build a house when I was in the th grade so and he literally built the house and when we moved into it there was no sheet rock on the inside and the plumbing wasnt hooked up yet         So we had a garden hose coming in through the kitchen window for our water in the sink in the kitchen         We had one toilet in the house that was flushable but since there wasnt any sheet rock around the bathroom we hung these big army blankets to the studs nailed those to the studs for privacy         And all my aunts and uncles and cousins came up to help move in and work on the house         So we had a weekend when it was like  of us staying there with one toilet the hose going in through the kitchen         and piles of dirt and then the porch wasnt finished and we had boards going up to the porch so you had to walk up the boards to get in         So I had my dates pick me up at somebody elses house because I was embarrassed for them to come my house                  But I know how to put sheet rock up and do shingles and all of that         Thats the house my parents are still in                     Really                     Uhhuh                     Neat                     Daddy built the whole thing                     Wow         Well did you and Linda ever play together                     My sister and I didnt like each other growing up we fought all the time         We werent friends until we were in our s         Theres four and half years difference in our age         Thats a big difference         She was my bratty little kid sister that got in the way and tattled on me         I remember when we were both teenagers she would sneak in and take my clothes and we would fight over that         But then once we got we lived together for a while before Steve and I got married         So once we were grown we were very close                     Hmm                     Um my parents didnt have much money         Daddy worked for Douglas Aircraft and then they closed up and they didnt want to move so they stayed here and he had it took him a while before he found jobs         He had a gun shop he tried several different stores and he had a gun shop         He had that on the porch of the house and I used to sit out there and help him load shotgun shells and we used to go target shooting and stuff                                                               Um so we just didnt have much money         When I was in junior high school the big thing was um alpaca sweaters Aline skirts and Pappagalo shoes         So I had a little part time job         So that all I could afford to do was get the shoes and the sweaters and I made all my skirts and made my blouses         And the first time I ever we we camped we would go to the mountains and go camping that was the only thing we did as far as a vacation         Never flew I was  years old before Id ever flown on a airplane         I was a teenager before I ever went to Myrtle Beach         Um there werent many restaurants         We just didnt eat out         My mother worked         So when she got home I was responsible for doing the cooking and having all that done when she got home from work         We just didnt the big thing was to go to a place called Dinos Pizzas and get pizza         Um is that  minutes
