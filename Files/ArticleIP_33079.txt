                                 Tomorrow Is an Udder Day                           Shes Got a BoneTo Pick                        One very important factor that Emily Yoffe leaves out in all the comparisons among diets in China Africa and America isgeneticethnic background            Did these studies compare ChineseAmericans toChinese people in China and AfricanAmericans to native Africans            The genetics of a person of European descent can bevastly different from a person of Chinese or African descent Osteoporosisbreast cancer and sexual maturation are all highly influenced by geneticsUnless you are comparing rural Chinese diets with the diets of Americans withthe same ethnic background these comparisons are largely invalid            People in Northern Europe and North America haveconsumed dairy products as a large part of their diets for centuries They alsotend to have very different body types than Asians or Africans It is knownthat many people of African ethnic origin and other ethnic groups includingAsian have problems digesting milk products past puberty People of NorthernEuropean descent often do not have this problem Could it also be that NorthernEuropean ethnicities have more problems with hip fractures or higher estrogenlevels for reasons other than diet            Just because ruralChinese and African people may not need high dairy consumption to be healthydoes not mean that Americans should be discouraged from drinking milk                           RachaelHarralson                        Auburn Calif                           The ValuesThing                        With respect to Jacob Weisbergs Ballot Box he makes one decent point and then blows it            Its true that as he says Were electing someoneto run the government not minister to the condition of our souls And thoughBill Clinton proves that people will elect presidents who feel their painstill I think Weisberg is close to the mark on this point But from there hegoes wrong            George W Bush and Bill Bradley are not talkingabout individual holders of wealth Nor are they engaging in subtle classwarfare They are responding to those who would assert that American society asa whole is just fine because it is collectively wealthy American society ismanifestly not just fine            I believe the majority of Americans if they thinkabout it at alland keep in mind that the ones who think about it are also theones who take the time to votethink that our cultural life has coarsened oreven debased and that the sense of values that just  or even fewer yearsago meant that the majority of Americans felt no need to lock their doors hasbeen perhaps irretrievably lost How else can people understand tragediessuch as Littleton in which normal middleclass kids are not playing baseballor flirting with girls or even duking out their differences after school on theplayground they are nursing monstrous visions of murder and mayhem whilebuilding bombs in their clueless parents garage Anyone who pays the leastattention could make a long list of their preferred examples            This is the spiritualemptiness Bush and Bradley are talking about Not whether a yearoldDellionaire is bored with his Lamborghini Or whether those less fortunateare envious of his horsepower                           PatrickMoore                        Dallas

such an organized and frankly insane plan has much in common with therevenge killings by Albanians we assume of Serbs in presentday Kosovo            I think the Serbian government and police were theevil monsters in the recent conflictthe Yugoslav army maybe less soand thatthe outcome of our bombing campaign was generally a good thing However Ivenever had any illusions about the unsavory nature of the Kosovo LiberationArmy as the more simpleminded media outlets seem to still hold            The killings of the  Serbian farmers look to be acase of classic terrorism with a clear political aimscaring the remainingSerbs out of Kosovo Killing even the boys and old men doesnt sound much likethe vengeance of honorable men            The Revenge Group on the other hand was bent oncarrying out revenge killing without any political aim The Nazis were well outof power nothing would have come of the killings except a vague sense ofselfsatisfaction on the part of those involved            In any case I cantcondone what either group of killers did or planned to do To even for aninstant try to intellectually justify killing members of one group simplybecause other members of that group did unspeakable thingswhether that groupconsists of Serbian civilians or imprisoned SS guardsis lazy thinking Itsplainly wrong and theres no amount of philosophizing that could convince

installmentof Culturebox  by Judith Shulevitz deserves comment Shes wrong Theissue isnt that working parents must choose between anesthetizing theirchildren with television or catering to all their whims while also trying topay the bills and nuke the frozen dinner Given a little guidance and somesuitable playthings children who dont get hooked on television at an earlyage are actually perfectly capable of amusing themselves for long stretches oftime Obviously theres a lot more to say on the subject but Shulevitz doesntseem to be aware of much that has already been said
