that take off from uh  uh across across across the country on a crime spree   Thelma and Louise yeah i havent seen that is it good   Thelma and Louise yeah yeah it really is its its interesting   is it   oh yeah i enjoyed i was gonna go see uh the Billy Crystal movie also which was im a little bit behind i usually rent them   yeah i im not familiar which which Billy Crystal movie   oh this is the uh just the one oh gosh it was the uh City Slickers right have you seen that   oh City Slickers thats a real good show yeah its great uh it says a lot about uh uh you know im im young but it says a lot about middle life you know and uh  uh its a really good show   uhhuh yeah i i ive heard lots of good things about it and i would have would have liked to have seen it but i was with my wife and i figured shed like Thelma and Louise better so   yeah   and id heard it was really good too so   yeah uh   it is   yeah im not too familiar with Thelma and Louise uh  uh uh uh recently i ive seen uh the Fisher King have you seen that   yeah no no   thats a really good show   okay   uh has Jeff Bridges and and uh Robin Williams   uhhuh   uh really really good   yeah theres theres been a a fair number of of pretty good movies out recently   yeah   i mean it kind of runs in  in batches i mean for a while sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just i dont even you know doesnt even sound like something i want to see you know   uh uhhuh   yeah what what kind of movies in general do you like to watch   um  well i like to be entertained once in a while but uh i i really enjoy watching a movie that uh  where they dont really try and attract you know the great audience but rather put out a a real good movie   um umhum   um uh  always my my favorite movie of all time has been uh uh The Mission did you ever see that   no in fact im not even familiar with it i dont think   uh its a a i think its put out by Landmark Productions the same people who put out Chariots of Fire   uhhuh   uh its a its a has Robert DeNiro in it uh he plays one of the main characters and uh its about uh Jesuit community in uh   Mission   at the Inca Falls in in uh South America Northern Argentina   hm hm oh uh uhhuh oh no in fact i i ill ill look for it because i  ive been   uh really really good show yeah its its something that you know its its really stirring the cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music   umhum actually yeah my wifes from down in that region around the Seven the called the the Seven Missions which are which are right down in this where im sure where it was filmed at   oh yeah   and uh im sure that that would make it worth worth her watching she my my uh my movie watching has has severely uh has has changed a lot since i got married   oh yeah   yeah she she likes uh action movies and uh and and comedies and so anything thats has anything little is a little little bit less than sort of mainstream Hollywood is   uhhuh uhhuh   is boring to her  and so i i i i really i used to watch a fair number of foreign films i used to watch a lot of sort of the less the less popular films   oh uhhuh   and i find i dont do it anymore or else i have to watch them on my own   yeah im much the same way i i i i have a fiance and it it gets very difficult to uh  uh she yeah yeah   find something both of you will watch yeah um she its its funny because i mean most women arent really sort of shes sort of Schwarzenegger fan type of yeah she really likes all these gory shoot them up films   oh really uhhuh uhhuh   keep her on the edge of her seat       ill watch them you know theyre kind of fun to watch in a way   yeah yeah they are sometimes youre in the mood for it even   yeah  but uh  so it it it varies i dont seem to get you know as much variety these days lately as i used to   uhhuh i found when when i get when i get with my uh old college buddy we we usually rent uh good gladiator movie or two       uh prior to that i i still enjoy watching those you you cant just watch them by yourself or else its its just not bearable   yeah   but its its fun to   well yeah on the other hand you you know given that my wife likes those i i  i occasionally like to watch them and and so uh you know so its you can always count on her to watch something like that and shell even watch things like karate movies and stuff  which     oh yeah   you know which most most women wont wont come within ten feet of   yeah yeah thats thats the ones where they dub in dub in the English   the the all the all the   all the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air  but uh yeah     thats great uh  on on foreign films did uh did you did you watch are you uh fluent in another language or   echo i speak yeah i speak several uh but i i dont mind watching subtitle movies uh no i i i dont   oh you dont i i dont either i i feel foolish sometimes because i i dont speak another language fluently but i do enjoy watching you know subtitles   yeah i mean for some people thats just you know thats out of the question you know if you give it subtitled they wont watch it   yeah
