                    Introduction        The incidence of cholestasis related to total parenteral        nutrition TPN among preterm infants has been estimated to        be between  and  depending on the population examined        and the definition of cholestasis used   In infants        with necrotizing enterocolitis or short bowel syndrome the        prevalence of TPNrelated cholestasis is           Although cholestasis is reversible in most patients after        the successful advancement of enteral feeding progressive        liver fibrosis and cirrhosis occur in some patients even        after complete enteral nutrition has been established          Some studies have suggested that excessive amino acids        hepatotoxic bile acids bacterial overgrowth sepsis        micronutrient deficiency and TPN contaminants all        contribute to cholestatic liver injury            Diminished volume of enteral feeds may also independently        contribute to the development of cholestasis However the        mechanisms of liver injury in cholestatic diseases in        infants remain unclear        Recent studies have supported the hypothesis that        generation of reactive oxygen intermediates ROIs and        elevated lipid hydroperoxides in the liver during        cholestasis cause tissue injury Exposure of isolated        hepatocytes to hydrophobic bile acids leads to        intracellular production of oxygen free radicals and lipid        peroxides   Animal studies using models of surgically        induced extrahepatic biliary obstruction have also shown        that lipid peroxidation products  specifically        malondialdehyde MDA  are increased in the cholestatic        liver    This increase is associated with decreased        tissue antioxidant activity increased leukocyte        infiltration and early evidence of collagen deposition        these effects are ameliorated by the administration of        exogenous antioxidants     Consistent with these        findings several forms of liver disease in humans have        been shown to be associated with oxidative tissue injury        Specifically products of lipid peroxidation are elevated        in patients with hepatic hypoxiareperfusion obstructive        liver disease alcoholic liver disease Wilsons disease        Alagille syndrome sepsis and inflammatory liver diseases                      In vitro  procollagen gene        expression increases in human liver cells after exposure to        lipid peroxide breakdown products   Furthermore        deposition of lipofuscin a byproduct of lipid        peroxidation characterizes TPNinduced cholestasis in        preterm infants          The purpose of these studies was to determine whether        TPNinduced cholestasis in preterm newborn infants is        associated with increased oxidative stress secondary to        increased ROIs We hypothesized that elevation in markers        of oxidative stress would be associated with increased        liver injury as measured by serum alanine transaminase        ALT and aspartate transaminase AST levels In order to        quantify ROIs in infants we measured urinary        thiobarbituricacidreacting substances TBARS The most        abundant of these substances is MDA an aldehydic lipid        peroxidation product formed by the action of ROIs on lipid        membranes The identification of ROIs as potential markers        of liver injury in cholestatic preterm infants may aid in        the diagnosis and management of those at highest risk for        ongoing liver impairment                    Materials and methods                  Patients          All preterm infants  weeks gestation born at          St Peters University Hospital New Brunswick NJ USA          and admitted to the hospitals neonatal intensive care          unit between March  and December  were serially          screened during the course of hospitalization for entry          into the cholestasis study group Fig  Infants with          major congenital anomalies including all          gastrointestinal and liver anomalies or with congenital          or acquired infection were excluded The criteria for          entry into the cholestasis group were direct bilirubin           mgdl  moll and duration of TPN   days          If the infant met these criteria the parents informed          consent for entry into the study was requested During          this period  infants qualified for the cholestasis          group and informed consent was obtained from the parents          of  When each eligible infant with cholestasis was          enrolled a preterm infant without cholestasis was          matched for gestational age birth weight and severity          of respiratory illness and the parents informed consent          was requested to enroll the infant as a control subject          For the  infants enrolled in the cholestasis group          matched controls were identified for  Parental consent          could not be obtained for  so  infants constituted          the control group Study personnel obtained demographic          and medical information from infants medical records                          Determination of urinary          thiobarbituricacidreacting substances          Urine samples were obtained under sterile conditions          from all enrolled infants at the time of their entry into          the study Informed consent was obtained from parents for          the acquisition of samples and these studies were          approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human          Subjects in Research of St Peters University Hospital          TBARS were measured as previously described             Briefly  l of urine was combined with  l of           butylated hydroxytoluene in glacial acetic acid and           l of a  aqueous thiobarbituric acid TBA solution          The samples were vortexed and were incubated at C for           minutes and the absorbance at  nm was measured          using a PerkinElmer Lamba B spectrophotometer          PerkinElmer Wellesley MA USA The quantity of TBARS          is proportionate to the amount of MDA a lipid          peroxidation product generated by the oxidation of          membrane lipids by reactive oxygen species MDA reacts          with TBA to form a  MDATBA adduct that absorbs at           nm In the present studies MDA was confirmed to be the          predominant TBAreacting adduct by highperformance          liquid chromatography analysis of representative samples          To control for urine concentration data were normalized          to urine creatinine concentrations as previously          described                            Determination of serum bilirubin ALT AST          alkaline phosphatase          Blood specimens were obtained from subjects within           hours of the urine specimen Quantitative determinations          of serum bilirubin ALT AST and alkaline phosphatase          levels were performed by the clinical laboratory at St          Peters University Hospital                          Statistical analysis          Direct bilirubin ALT AST alkaline phosphatase and          urinary TBARS values were not normally distributed The          data are presented as median th th percentile          Differences between the groups were analyzed for          significance by oneway ANOVA using natural log          transformations of the data which are normally          distributed Differences were regarded as statistically          significant at           P values   Correlations of          bilirubin ALT and AST with TBARS were calculated by          regression using the logtransformed values to ensure          normal distribution of all variables in those          analyses                            Results        Twentyseven infants were enrolled in the cholestasis        group and  infants served as controls The cholestasis

the cholestasis group and  mgdl         moll in the control group          P   Median serum ALT and        AST levels were also elevated in the cholestasis group         vs  and  vs  Ul respectively         P   Values for alkaline        phosphatase and mean urinary TBARS did not differ        significantly between the groups Table  Urinary TBARS        were not significantly correlated with gestational age        gender days on TPN indirect bilirubin or alkaline        phosphatase not shown Likewise urinary TBARS were not        correlated with direct bilirubin Fig  top In        contrast urinary TBARS levels among all infants were        independently correlated with serum ALT and AST Fig         lower                    Discussion        We found that elevated liver transaminases are        associated with increased oxidative stress These findings        suggest that oxidant stress as indicated by elevated        TBARS is associated with hepatocellular injury in preterm        infants Although there is ample evidence that oxidant        stress follows cholestasis our findings suggest that        oxidative injury in the liver may be induced by mechanisms        that are independent of cholestasis       For        example the production of ROIs in the liver may be linked        to inflammation which has emerged as a primary mechanism        of liver injury after pathophysiological insults Activated        Kupffer cells and neutrophils release ROIs and proteases in        response to inflammatory cytokines in the liver   ROIs        in excess inactivate proteins disrupt DNA and oxidize        lipids   Preterm newborn infants may be particularly        susceptible to such injury because they exhibit an        imbalance between antioxidant and oxidantgenerating        systems For example such infants exhibit decreased levels        in the liver of superoxide dismutase vitamin E and        carotene     Antioxidant capacity in preterm        infants is also compromised by relative deficiencies of        selenium and taurine as well as reduced ability to        synthesize sufficient glutathione          Despite longer TPN courses and elevated serum        transaminases infants with cholestasis or elevated serum        direct bilirubin did not display elevated urinary TBARS        Our findings are consistent with previous reports        indicating an inconsistent relation between bilirubin        levels and the degree of histologic liver injury           This inconsistency suggests that cholestasis and hepatic        impairment in preterm infants receiving TPN are induced by        mechanisms that are not dependent on oxidantmediated        hepatocellular injury For example lack of enteral feeding        plays an important role in the development of cholestasis        in the neonatal period possibly mediated by direct        hepatotoxic activity of bile salts   Bile salts are        thought to exert adverse effects on signal transduction and        gene transcription in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes and to        activate Fasinduced apoptosis   TPNinduced        cholestasis in infants also appears to be related directly        to developmental immaturity of bile flow and production and        to possible infection          TBARS measurements provide a measure of membrane lipid        peroxidation and as such may provide a direct assessment        of the progression of liver injury at the cellular level        Although there was a statistically significant relationship        between urinary TBARS and liver transaminases a large        degree of overlap existed between the groups Furthermore        the association between TBARS levels and liver injury does        not necessarily indicate causality Despite physiologic        evidence that ROIs play a central role in tissue injury        during inflammation it is possible that elevated TBARS        occur secondary to other mechanisms of hepatocellular        injury    Larger longitudinal andor interventional        eg antioxidant administration studies will be necessary        to determine whether there is a causal relationship between        lipid peroxidation and TPNinduced liver disease in preterm        infants                    Key messages         Serum transaminases are elevated in preterm infants         weeks gestational age with cholestasis and        prolonged administration of total parenteral nutrition        TPN indicating that cholestasis is associated with        hepatocellular injury         Urinary levels of thiobarbituricacidreacting        substances TBARS which are proportional to lipid        peroxidation and oxidant stress are correlated with serum        transaminase levels Our findings suggest that oxidant        stress is associated with hepatocellular injury in preterm        infants         Urinary levels of TBARS do not differ significantly        between infants with cholestasis and control infants         Our findings suggest that cholestasis in preterm        infants receiving TPN is induced in large part by        mechanisms that are not dependent on oxidantmediated        hepatocellular injury                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        ALT  alanine transaminase AST  aspartate
