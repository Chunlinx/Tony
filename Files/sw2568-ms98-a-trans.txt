            okay   okay   whats whats your most recent one that youve seen   well actually what i do i havent been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months   uhhuh   so i havent really seen any movies in the movie theater but i rent probably four or five movies a week   really i used to do that too but i havent been doing it lately but   weve got a good video place out here and uh uh oh gosh uh im just trying to think of all the movies ive recently seen uh oh Air America   no see i havent seen that one uh   have you seen Wild Orchid   no is it good   well it depends do you like uh steamy movies   uh no not yet i know that sounds funny coming from a woman but usually i dont   oh okay what type of movies do you like   um um action  i i guess one of my favorite well two of my favorite movies is probably like Lethal Weapon and Lethal Weapon Two and those are those are like two of my most favorite i mean theyre just really good movies and i liked Bird on a Wire   okay yeah   and movies like that   do you like suspense movies or do you like uh just action or   um yeah some i guess like what do you mean like like are you talking about movies like Die Hard Two or   oh Jagged Edge Jagged Edge was a suspenseful one or uh Fatal Attraction   okay yeah i liked that that was pretty good um that was okay i i dont i guess i thought it was too far fetched but so many people said oh no it wasnt you know but i guess   oh  well i hope i dont run across them   really thats true because i dont know i just didnt find that one to be real i i just thought it was too far fetched   what was your favorite all time movie   um oh gosh i dont i cant think off my head do you know which one yours was   i i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most uh that i was really the most in shock with was probably uh Star Wars   oh yeah well thats   when that first came out i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that i mean   right   i guess uh out of all the movies ive ive never been as excited to go back i was ready to go back and see it again you know   really yeah yeah youre right about that but that thats really like an all time classic i mean i dont think anybody anything could ever beat that   now i i also liked uh oh Gone with the Wind or some of the classic like The Lawrence of Arabia   see ive never seen that   oh you havent   no should i rent it should i go rent it tomorrow   oh yeah no thats uh thats a thats a real interesting movie and its got a good historical perspective to it   thats probably something i need to see right now because im taking history in school  so itd probably be a good thing for me to see   oh yeah actually i just saw a movie uh called The Lost Capone     oh   and its about Al Capones brothers   oh really   primarily one of his brothers and i wont give the the whole plot away but its its really a good movie uh Al Capone had three brothers   uhhuh   and one of them was lost for many many years and uh he actually he turns out to be a law man   really   yeah its really interesting it   oh you just gave it away i guess i cant go see it no i just kidding   no thats okay i didnt give away the whole thing i just gave away just enough to get you interested     that does sound good is it one i guess its a rental   yeah it is   okay i may have to do that go see it or go rent it   and a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress   yeah   and seeing like all ive seen all of James Deans movies   uhhuh   uh all of Mae Wests movies and just kind of kind of go out and uh rent all the movies and uh uh you know just kind of go i guess you could do that you know get all of David Carradines movies or uh um Segal to whats his first name   uhhuh um   i cant remember his first name   its not David is it   is it David Segal i dont know he was on uh on uh uh Arsenio   oh i dont i dont watch that  um   just recently it was really kind of interesting because Arsenio was asking him about uh   really   what he thought of uh one of the other action guys God i cant even remember the name he said well he wouldnt really talk about it didnt want to talk about him because he didnt think he was such a uh a good action guy   huh   it wasnt Stallone it was uh i cant remember shoot i cant remember the guys name but i like all the the Rambo movies   oh see i didnt really care  thats thats one side of the action i guess that i didnt really care for but see i dont really like Sylvester Stallone   yeah   i dont think hes really a very good actor i know that sounds awful because so many people think hes so wonderful but i just have never been a Stallone fan   yo Adrian   hey thats pretty good no i guess like i say i just have i dont know i just have never seen any interest in him but     no we we actually rent uh probably a good good combination of movies with the exception of horror films   oh   dont watch really very many horror films at all   yeah i dont either   you know i dont know theres something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something you know its just you know     yeah youre right   coming out of the TV that just doesnt make my day you know     well its so i guess im a real im a realist and so when i watch movies like that its like this can not happen so i just dont enjoy it you know because its just like come on give me a break you know i mean i just and so many of them are done so poorly   yeah yeah   you know that it just doesnt even give you the effect i mean some of them are done good and they do scare you but um so many of them are just done real i dont know im not really into those   i just saw uh uh a really interesting movie called uh Flatliners   oh that was one of my favorites       yes i thought that was a very good movie   yeah   i was really impress ed with that one i mean it was what i liked about it was that it was a new subject nobody had ever touched it before   yeah   you know and it was just it was done so well you know it was just   it was just crazy enough for the you know students might try to do it you know i mean and its not like theres a lot of scientific data on it   right well thats probably true but it was a very good movie it was done real well too i mean there wasnt any part of it that you really felt like no this cant happen it seemed real it seemed real you know it was really good   yeah   that that was one i mean its not my all time favorite movie but it was good it was really good   yeah   and um i dont know if you like this kind but i thought Pretty Woman was a really good movie too   oh yeah that was a great movie   yeah ive weve seen that two or three times we waited and we rented it you know but but it was really good   yeah uh have you seen Shrimp on the Barbie   no i havent i dont know if ive even heard of that one it must have uh whats his name in it     yeah its got no   no it doesnt   no uh Hogan yeah no no   really yeah Paul Hogan no really im surprised   no its got uh uh Cheech Marin   oh really  that must be pretty good then was it good   yeah yeah it is its kind of uh kind of a poor mans Pretty Woman in reverse   oh   but it was kind of cute actually did you see Dirty Rotten Scoundrels     yes yes   i though that was a really cute movie i enjoyed that   yeah it was Twins was good too  because when i thought of that i thought of  anyway um   yeah   oh there was another one whats the one that just oh Dances with Wolves have you seen that yet oh youve got to see that one   no i havent i hear thats the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video   its really right thats probably true thats probably true its its very very good very good thats another one that i was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it   uh well my wife uh has got a uh a picture from Kevin Costner and he signed it its from Dances with Wolves yeah and he signed it he he happens to be uh a friend of one of her her business associates   really oh wow thats impressive   and all right not not a friend a cousin   oh neat   a cousin so uh uh but anyhow we got uh we got a nice uh picture and it came in an envelope that says Dances with Wolves so weve got to uh try to get out there and see that one   oh yeah its really worth it i mean its a very good movie and yes i would suggest seeing it at the theater i know that theyre still playing it and they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until like August   huh   i think because they were they were scheduling a video release of it in July and then when it won all those awards uh they pushed it back to August so but yeah that one is definitely worth seeing its really good   now did you see uh Driving Miss Daisy   yeah and you know i didnt think that one was near as good   okay   you know i guess it was okay i mean it was all right but um when i compare like the winners of this year and last year it it just i dont know maybe its its not
