                                 Life on the Western Frontier            The Olympic Peninsula sitsperched on the northwest corner of Washington like a small state an expanse ofmountains rivers and coastlines wrapped by an arm of the Pacific andseparated from the urban swath of Greater Seattle by the inland sea of PugetSound If peeled from a map the peninsula would neatly cover my old home stateof Connecticut like a wet green stamp But its population strung along acluster of small coastal towns and Indian reservations would barely fill oneof Connecticuts midsize towns            When Ifirst arrived here  years ago a few pulp mills logging fishing andfarming fleshed out the economy The millionacre wilderness of OlympicNational Park at the peninsulas heart caught my imagination as did theregions keenedged inhabitants Seen in cross sectionsay from PortTownsend a Victorian seaport of brick shops and cupolas on the peninsulasnortheast shore west to the logging capital of Forksthe human landscapehas become incredibly diverse But essential peninsula characteristics thetics and quirks that make us who we are have only deepened            Port Townsends transformation from fishingport to Sausalito North was well underway when I arrived Even then the townslow rents and tolerance for writers liveaboard sailboat dreamers and smallentrepreneurs held the seeds of its destruction I place the blame for todayswoodenboat festivals summer arts programs galleries and cafes on th century ethnologist James G Swan Collecting Northwest Coastartifacts for the Smithsonian and scribbling his wonderfully astute monographswhile his fellow townsmen were out stumping for commerce Swan introduced theidea of the absorbed eccentric It clung to the citys mossy foundations like alimpet But even Swan went to his paupers grave still hoping for a railconnection to Seattle and Seattle remains Port Townsends undesignated homeport            This Ifear has cast a permanent shadow over the towns cultural identity When anarts patron bequeathed a quartermillion dollars to the city for a work ofpublic art in the s the fledgling arts commission invited bigcity curatorsto jury the competition The result is a sterile concrete tidal clock thatcollects whatever flotsam the tide brings in and a waveviewing terrace moresuggestive of an industrial boat haulout than a Japanese pavilion Meanwhilea proposal by local sculptor Tom Jay that drew on the natural heritage of thepeninsula and its Native American roots became part of a commission for theSeattle suburb of Bellevue At a party to send off the piece Salmon Womanand Raven a friend offered this toast No tears Tim weve still got theTyDBol            Nearby Sequim brooks no such separation fromits past Murals of farm buildings and country stores decorate downtownbusinesses even as the last Dungeness Valley farmland is paved over withblacktop One of the hottest retirement communities in Puget Sound Sequimknows precisely where it wants to go and how many more new golf courses it willtake to get there            But even in this town of souls and  realestate offices the past has a way of rearing upunbidden A recovering herd of Roosevelt elk has developed a taste forexpensive landscaping in the towns recently developed highlands The elk beddown in hayfields alongside US  where traffic conditions have come toresemble the bear jams of Yellowstone Complaints were heavy until theWashington Department of Fish and Wildlife announced a hunting season on theallbuttame elk just beyond city limits Elk lovers and the Sequim chief ofpolice expressed outrage even some rose gardeners voiced distress Buthunters from all over Puget Sound rushed to apply for permits Life where wildand tame collide will get even more interesting this fall            Meanwhile a wave of roses and golf carts pushes slowly west from Sequim likea second settling of the peninsula The frontier retirees riding lawnmowers onone side loggers wielding chainsaws on the other is continually in fluxRight now I place it six miles east of Port Angeles at the Port AngelesSpeedway Not long ago some newly arrived speedway neighbors petitionedClallam County for an ordinance regulating the tracks excessive noise Thecommissioners frontiersmen all were unmoved Speedway was here first theydecreed and dismissed the proposal            One peninsula community hasnt changed much inthe past  years Port Angeles County seat business center pulpmanufacturer logshipping port it remains stolidly practical working classand Democratic and the recent closure of one of two large pulp mills hasprecipitated an identity crisis Those clinging to the old economic order wantnothing more than another large mill Others envision a conference center anaquarium and a performingarts center to complement the already existingfinearts center Meanwhile money to retrain workers flows into the communityfrom the state and federal governments feeding a cottage industry that mayprove one of the peninsulas most enduring economies            Nowhereon the peninsula is federal largess more central to the economy than in Forksand nowhere is the populace more critical of the government From the free landdoled out to the original settlers through various subsidies like bounties andtimber giveaways to the big bucks of Forest Service deficittimber sales Forkshas supped mightily at the public trough            Last week the Forks city clerk determined thetown was getting stiffed out of its share of federal aid for communities hurtby cutbacks in federal timber sales So the city pulled out of the programPeriod Federal grant applications for improving the towns industrial parkitself a federally subsidized project upgrading

scheduled but I have no doubt how this will end Forkswill receive funding for its entire wish list probably with Port Angelesconference center thrown in for good measure            The peninsula may be on the take but it stillbelieves in hard work During the s and s I packed up each February andheaded west to work replanting clearcuts and thinning young trees in the rainywoods around Forks Most any personal frailtybe it a penchant for Celtic harpmusic Oriental poetry even moderate environmental sentimentscould beoverlooked if a body isnt afraid of work It is the common glue that bindsus            A few years ago I washelping a neighbor thread tracks back onto his bulldozer He had disassembledthe steel pads welded new cleats on each one and strung them back togetherHe was  at the time We
