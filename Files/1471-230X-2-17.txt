                    Background        In the United States about four million people have        active peptic ulcers and about  new cases are        diagnosed each year and approximately  deaths per year        in the US are due to gastric ulcer     The primary        therapeutic approach to gastric ulcer remains the        inhibition of gastric acid secretion to produce symptom        relief acceleration of crater healing and the prevention        of relapse or recurrence      since gastric ulcer can        lead to hemorrhage perforation obstruction and death                    It is established that the H KATPase or proton        pump participates in the final step of acid secretion            and all the peripheral parietal cell stimuli converge        to activate it     Therefore blocking the final        process in hydrogen ion secretion reduces acid secretion        and this is the mechanism of action of the substituted        benzimidazole agents known as proton pump inhibitors PPI        Currently five PPIs are marketed rabeprazole omeprazole        esomeprazole lansoprazole and pantoprazole each with a        different pharmacokinetic profile tissue selectivity        binding specificity and potential to interact with the        cytochrome P enzyme system       For example        rabeprazole and esomeprazole achieve more rapid and        profound inhibition of acid secretion than do older agents            It is unclear however if these pharmacologic        differences lead to distinctions in the clinical efficacy        of healing gastric ulcers and controlling ulcer symptoms        To address this question we undertook a metaanalysis of        all randomized clinical trials that compared at least one        of the newer PPI with either ranitidine or placebo                    Methods                  Statistical analysis          The healing rate ratio RR was calculated for each          trial by dividing the healing rate of the PPI by the rate          with the comparator at the specified time point          Chisquares and  confidence intervals CI were          calculated using the exact method described by Miettinen                       The appropriateness of combining results from          individual studies was examined using the Wald  for          statistical homogeneity We considered a           p value less than  to be          significant for all statistical tests There were no          adjustments for multiple comparisons          As there was no statistically significant evidence of          heterogeneity the healing rates for each treatment were          pooled across trials by time point Overall healing rates          of PPIs at four and eight weeks were estimated by pooling          the rates for the recommended daily doses  mgd for          lansoprazole  mgd for omeprazole  mgd for          pantoprazole Rabeprazole was pooled using dose of           mgd at three and six weeks Individual trial results          were weighted using the inverse of the variance of the RR          estimated for each trial The overall RR was then          estimated by dividing the weighted average healing rates          for each treatment with the estimates for placebo          ranitidine or omeprazole These overall RR were assessed          using the MantelHaenszel  test and  CI were          calculated using the exact method              To assess the possibility of publication bias the RR          point estimates were plotted against year of publication          and sample size To identify any studies that exerted a          disproportionate influence on the summary treatment          effect we deleted individual studies one at a time To          investigate the possible consequences of including          abstracts for which we could not obtain full reports we          excluded these data in secondary analyses                            Results                  Clinical symptoms          It was not possible to pool these results because          different symptoms were reported in each study at          different time points and also the method used to          collect data varied Table  However individual trials          showed more improvement or resolution of pain day pain          and night pain was found with the new PPIs rabeprazole          pantoprazole and lansoprazole compared to omeprazole For          example  of patients with pain improved with          rabeprazole compared to  with omeprazole at  weeks             Table                           Healing rates          Healing data are presented for the intentiontotreat          analyses as similar results were obtained with the per          protocol analysis For lansoprazole pantoprazole and          omeprazole the results were reported at four and eight          weeks and the rabeprazole studies did so at three and six          weeks Therefore the overall healing rate was obtained          at three four six and eight weeks          Healing rates varied between the studies but were          consistently lower with placebo treatment For the          majority of patients receiving placebo treatment the          ulcer did not heal during the course of the trial and the          maximum recorded as healed was just over a third of the          patients  in any of the trials Whilst higher          healing rates were observed after treatment with          ranitidine by the end of the trials the ulcers remained          for at least half the patients  In contrast by the          end of the trial the ulcers were healed in at least          twothirds of the patients receiving proton pump          inhibitors           As would be expected when compared with placebo          treatment the PPIs lansoprazole and omeprazole          improved the pooled healing RR at each time point In          relation to ranitidine the pooled healing RR of PPIs          lansoprazole omeprazole and pantoprazole was also          increased at both four and eight weeks There were no          studies versus rabeprazole The healing RR in each trial          of the newer PPIs was found to be comparable or better          than omeprazole at each time point Figure                           Publication bias          The healing RR was plotted against sample size but          there was no trend with increasing size small studies          had healing RR similar to large studies with the same          comparator Figure  There was one abstract    with          data obtained at  and  weeks which is not          included                            Discussion        In the absence of active treatment the majority of        patients continued to have a gastric ulcer at the end of        the trial A much higher healing rate was observed when        patients received treatment with a PPI when compared to        either a placebo or ranitidine This is consistent with the        results obtained for treatment with PPIs when compared to        ranitidine for both duodenal ulcers and gastro esophageal        reflux disease      We also found that there is some        evidence of an advantage to prescribing two of the newer        PPIs lansoprazole or pantoprazole compared to omeprazole        for gastric ulcer since there was a  increase in        healing rates at  weeks In addition the newer PPIs        rabeprazole lansoprazole and pantoprazole have all been        show to produce superior improvement in clinical symptoms        compared to omeprazole at both  and  weeks                     Relatively few randomized controlled clinical trials        have been published on the efficacy of PPI for treating        gastric ulcers when compared with gastro esophageal reflux        disease or with duodenal ulcers      This could be        due to gastric ulcers being less frequently diagnosed than        duodenal ulcer     or the importance of clinicians        confirming a differential diagnosis between gastric ulcer        and gastric cancer Some authors have also argued that the        classification of gastric and duodenal ulcers is        artificial since ulcers could be driven distally or drawn        proximally across the arbitrary boundary of the pylorus            Furthermore some clinical assessments may be        complicated as  of patients with gastric ulcers also        have duodenal ulcers However given the severity of the        symptoms generally associated with a gastric ulcer there        no longer appears to be a clear justification for        continuing to conduct placebocontrolled trials in these        patients        Recent observations have suggested that the duration of        treatment with acid secretory inhibitors is more important        than the degree of acid inhibition per hours     We        could not test the longterm effect of PPIs on ulcer        relapse rates since there was not enough information        published More research into maintenance therapy is        clearly required because the relative longterm efficacy        of different treatments particularly the combination of        PPIs with antibiotics and the effect of dose variation on        the relapse and complications from gastric ulcers is not        well studied Other factors known to have an impact on        gastric ulcer healing are smoking alcohol and ulcer size        but the papers did not report the healing results for these        subgroups of patients or by those variables Unfortunately        the researchers reported different clinical symptoms and        methods to collect the data and so we could not pool these        results                    Conclusions        This study suggests that the firstline drug therapy for        patients diagnosed with gastric ulcer should be a PPI in        preference to an H antagonist This study indicated that        compared with ranitidine the PPIs provide faster onset of        action greater relief of symptoms and increased healing        rates However there is also clearly a need for additional        studies to determine the appropriate maintenance doses and        understand the factors influencing healing and relapse        rates                    Abbreviations        PPI Proton pump inhibitor        HA Histamine          receptor
