                                 Jazz Democracy            In the mids Miles Davismet a teenage drummer who said to him Man why dont you practice If thedrummer Tony Williams hadnt been such a Wunderkind ormotherfucker Davis preferred term Davis who was an amateur boxer mighthave taught him another kind of lesson Instead Davis listenedand followedhis advice Davis tells this story in his autobiography Miles  and itspeaks volumes about his rapport with Williams and the other members of hismids quintet Its a commonplace that jazz is the musical expression ofAmerican democracy The unfortunate truth is that jazz more often resembles thedaytime talk show Everyone gets his or her say before the floor passes to thenext soloist The Davis quintet was the rare exception a luminous example ofparticipatory democracy in jazz            Columbiahas just released the Davis quintets studio work in a sixCD box set and itsremarkable how well the music has aged Here is group improvisation at its mostglorious a conversation between five artists respectful of each othersvoices listening and responding to one another as equals in interplay as denseas a Bartk string quartet yet still somehow managing to swing Click for acouple of small quibbles with the way the box set was put together            When Davis formed this band he had racked up an enviableseries of accomplishments He had performed alongside Charlie Parker led amarvelous quintet with John Coltrane and collaborated with Gil Evans on suchjazz orchestral arrangements as Sketches of Spain and Porgy andBess  Davis  sextet recording Kind of Blue  became with itshaikulike lyricism synonymous with cool and provided a soundtrack for nearlyevery party with intellectual pretensions More than any other jazz musician ofthe day Davis captivated the paparazzi  which faithfully reported onhis goingson his taste for Italian suits and his richly cultivated contemptfor whites who didnt get it            But Daviswas in a creative slump in the early s He couldnt keep a band togetherand he was being outpaced by younger players such as pianist Cecil Taylor andsaxophonist Ornette Coleman who wanted to liberate jazz from harmonicconventions Unlike his former sideman Coltrane who aligned himself with theavantgarde and ultimately became its prophet Davis sought a middle groundbetween improvisatory freedom and adherence to form            He found it with the young musicians who formedhis quintet in  With Wayne Shorter on tenor saxophone Herbie Hancock onpiano Ron Carter on bass and Williams on drums Davis had a dream team andthe quintets music is as much a display of their talent as it is of DavisWilliams who had played on landmark sessions with reedmen Eric Dolphy andJacky McLean accented the backbeat in the drums and played just a little aboveeveryone else creating a polyrhythmic vaguely African template for his bandmates Shorter an alumnus of Art Blakeys Jazz Messengers complemented Daviswith his elegantly fractured bagatellelike style of phrasing Hancock afavored pianist in Blue Notes stable was the most versatile of keyboardistsHe could play in a hushed romantic style then plunge at a moments noticeinto fiery Latinflavored syncopation And Carter supplied the group with aharmonic center becoming in Williams words its checkpoint Charlie            Thequintet released six studio recordings between  and  ESP Miles Smiles  Sorcerer  Nefertiti Miles in the Sky  and Filles de Kilimanjaro  Water Babies and Circle in the Round  which were alsorecorded in this period were released in the mids It is stirringcomplex music as exploratory as any of its era Incredibly hardly anyonerecognized this until the late s when the quintets work was adopted as amodel by young musicians such as Wynton Marsalis The reason is simple In therevolutionary age of free jazz with its joyful defiance of form and radicalembrace of pure sound the Davis quintet seemed just a bit too polishedDespite Davis wellknown militancy he didnt care to set his music to civilrights poetry or to compose preacherly anthems in the manner of Coltrane            That said the music bears the unmistakable imprint of thes The hierarchy separating the leaders and the led teachers and studentswas dissolving in Davis music as it was everywhere else Davis apprenticeskept their master on his toeschallenging him to take risks and to experimentwith more open forms Davis all but scrapped the traditional boundary betweenforeground improvising soloists and background rhythm section Thequintets music was built from the bottom up assertively declaring jazzsAfrican lineage Williams is the busiest of the musicians dusting every cornerwith percussion confetti On the gorgeous title track of Nefertiti  forinstance he is the leading soloist Davis and Shorter repeat the pensive themehypnotically without soloing making this tune arguably one of the firststatements of American minimalism Inspired by Williams Davis adopted a morepercussive style of improvising throwing aggressive staccato darts at therhythm section Theres an edginess a tough guys melancholy to Davis soundGone is the balladeer of earlier years            Thematerial was also new Everyone in the group was composing especially Shorterwhose strangely floating Moorishinflected melodies are among the mostmesmerizing in jazz Shorters compositions are like caramel cages They soundso fragile youre amazed they hold together But in fact theyre quitepliable lending themselves to dramatic shifts in tempo and voicing Listenfor example to the haunting Masqualero from Sorcerer  a  measurecomposition in which Hancock and Carter adapt the songs shape to the soloistsDavis and Shorter Its form as a living organic process            Within a few years Davis grew tired ofacoustic jazz and his final sessions with the quintet are restlesstransitional works that point the way ahead After the release ofNefertiti  Davis began experimenting with the electric instruments thatwould consume the remainder of his careerto the horror of many in the jazzcommunity He invited guitarists George Benson and Joe Beck into the studioand he had Hancock perform on a Fender Rhodes electric piano and even oncelesta Davis writing assumed a pared down pop sensibility on tunes likeStuff from Miles in the Sky  Its a cocky funk tune that wouldnt beworth its  minutes if the soloists werent Miles Davis and Wayne Shorter            WereDavis electric instruments and simpler forms an opportunistic concession topop Its true that some of his later work sounded like the desperate effort ofan aging star to sell records to rock fans But the quintets foray intoelectric jazz was a natural extension of Miles studio experimentation and ofhis voracious search for new colors and textures If Davis was losing interestin the tricky harmonies of bop he was acquiring a more painterly and no lessmodernist approach to sound Listen for instance to the  minute Circle inthe Round in which Hancock plays celesta and the band is joined by guitaristBeck and imagine it being played on FM radio Sure it drags a bit without thevolatile repartee of the earlier albums On the other hand this druggyundulating succession of ostinatos is as difficult as dissonant and woollyas anything the quintet recorded suggesting both the psychedelia of KingCrimson and the minimalism of Steven Reich            Whats more the bands final album Filles deKilimanjaro  on which Hancock and Carter perform on electric instrumentsproduced one of Davis indisputable masterpieces the majestic  minute Toutde Suite Its a spacey sort of blues with Davis and Shorter playingfuriously against the ethereal Rothkolike shadings of Hancocks Fender Rhodesand Carters electric bass and the anxious pulse of Williams ride cymbal Atonce lush and frightening Tout de Suite literally vibrates with intimationsof Davis future explorations beyond jazz The subtitle to Filles deKilimanjaro was telling Directions in Music by Miles Davis In Davis ventured into the lugubrious brooding funk of Bitches Brew  Thequintet was Davis last remarkable tango with jazz
