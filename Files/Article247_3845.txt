                                 Are Some Languages Dangerous                        Jesse            Yes its ironic but predictable that people expressambivalence toward second or heritage languages They attack languages such asSpanish that they perceive as a threat while defending cute languages likeBoontling you and I are may be the only ones in the audience who know whatthat is or antique languages like Cornish            Yet even that picture is not so clear If Anglo parentsin New York are choosing to have their very young children begin the study ofSpanish as the article in todays New York Timesindicates does this mean as the Times suggests that they have cometo value multilingualism or does it mean they are just being practical Andhow does that stack up against research indicating that secondgenerationLatinos and Latinas are often monolingual English speakers Ive collected lotsof anecdotal newspaper stories in which employers in Miami for example claimthey cant find Spanish speakers let alone bilinguals to hire to deal withtheir Spanishspeaking clientele            Navajo has long been touted by sociolinguists as alanguage whose speakers maintain a great deal of language loyalty that is theNavajo are reluctant to give up their heritage language Yet the need toestablish a highschool Navajo class suggests that off the reservation that isexactly what young Navajo speakers are doing The Hasidim of New York and theAmish are two other groups known for preserving their speechwhen that isthey maintain their social isolation from the mainstream But once thatisolation is gone language may soon follow            Culturalloyalty movements like the class in Navajotend to spring up when cultural preservation is in danger and their record ofsuccess is not impressive Here at the University of Illinois we run specialsections of first and secondyear Spanish for Spanishheritage students andthe reason is that their Spanish is too weak to meet academic requirementsThat in turn means they may be able to speak Spanish even that is often notthe case but they cant read it well or write it fluently and their grasp ofits grammar may be weak since they havent actually studied it as a languageThey may speak some Spanish but they cant pass a test in it Students alsouse college language classrooms to try to recapture the heritage languages theymay have lost for example Hindi or Urdu or ones they may never haveacquired Yiddish            What interests me about these minority language anddialect matters is why ebonics was perceived as so great a threat when thewhole issue arose in late  in Oakland Calif We are living in a time whenEnglish serves as an international language Furthermore living as we do in alargely postcolonial world we tend to recognize that each national varietyof English that of the United States of Canada of Australia of India ofNigeria of Ireland has its own local standards and we that is linguistshave begun talking about world Englishes not simply world English toemphasize this fact Yet within a community group variation in standards stilltends to be rejected or regarded with suspicion Hence ebonics was seen by theAmerican public at large as a declaration of independence in need of quashingan internal threat a wild mistake while American English itself a partlyrevolutionary postcolonial product is seen as simply the way things arethat is unless youre Prince Charles            Someone posted an email response to your morning essayasking whether its true that ebonics speakers cant do math because theirlanguage isnt capable of rendering the subtleties of math Sometimes it seemsto me that every language except my own is capable of rendering thosemathematic subtleties and my colleagues in math sometimes insist that thesubtleties of math cannot be rendered into English or at least English that isunderstandable by anyone unfamiliar with math A highenergy physicist oncetold me when I asked her what she was working on I couldnt possibly put itinto wordsyet she continues to receive NSF funding which suggests someoneunderstands what she is up to on her grant applications The math case mayreally be what the computer folks call COIK clear only if known But this isthe kind of thinking about language that pervades our society How would youanswer that question about ebonics and math Language varieties are flexibleand adaptable But they also exist in contexts and while these contexts dontnecessarily bind them they do affect them So if the context that some ebonicsspeakers exist in is one that does not bring them up against the differentialcalculus what follows Low math scores for one thing But thats not the sameas saying ebonics speakers cant do math because they cant speak math            Dennis
