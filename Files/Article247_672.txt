                                 Russian to Sell            Everybody leads with yesterdays bad day in the financial markets Theheadlines speak of a world crisis and USA Today the Washington Post  and the Los AngelesTimes headers refer to the Dows drop of  points The New York Timesheadline opts instead to state that the DJ was off  percent But none of thebig type mentions what USAT has in its second paragraphthis wasnteven in the Dows top  bad days So one wonders why that paper still frontsits business section with such lines as Crisis Hits Home and World EconomicTroubles Arrive On Our Doorstep In the same Chicken Little spirit theWP lead delays until the sixteenth paragraph the news that the day alsosaw the release of strong figures on the US labor market and on housingstarts            Everybody duly notes all the overseas financial setbacks USATreports Japanese stocks were down  percent Mexican stocks down  percentBrazilian shares down  percent Russian stocks down  The papers have aword for the cause of all this Russia Except for the NYT  the paperspass up the usual trading floor desperation pix in favor of shots of fullcontact banking on Russian streets Everybodys front describes the mountingpressure on Boris Yeltsin to quit and report that without the support ofRussias central bank the ruble has continued to fall The mostlynonRussian institutions that had purchased the countrys debt now findthemselves says the NYT  holding only  percent of the value they hadlast week            The papers agree that investors fear that Russian chaos could spread toother emerging market economies such as those in Latin America USATsays Russias influence in the world markets is due to its nuclear stockpileThe NYT notes this reasoning but still wondersafter all the Russianeconomy is only the size of Denmarks But the NYT notes at least oneclear cause of the metaRussian acceleration Russias troubles have made itclear to other countries that IMF bailouts are probably not in the offing forthem and might not work anyway The Wall Street Journal observes that the dubious record of IMFrescue packages in the past year probably deepens the rift among Republicans inCongress over whether to give the organization a fresh infusion of federalbillions Democrats are mostly for that as is Newt Gingrich Dick Armey isdeeply opposed            Perhaps the scariest feature of the market turmoil served up by the papersis the realization that for all their new analytical tools those in thebusiness are no more capable of cognitive significance than in the days ofticker tape Thus the WP quotes one chief equities trader saying Ifyou can withstand the pain and youve chosen good stocks you should come outokay and USAT has another strategist saying We could rally fromthis but a lot of damage has been done            Everybody has the same offlead that federal authorities have brought intothe US and charged a suspect in the African embassy bombings The suspectMohamed Rashed Daoud alOwhali was injured in the Kenya blast and hasreportedly confessed his role to the feds He is said to have admitted that hewas trained at Afghani terrorist camps run by Osama bin Laden A secondsuspect Mohammed Saddiq Odeh is still in Kenyan custody but is expected inthe US soon USAT says he will arrive here today The NYT andWP run frontpage pictures of the menwith alOwhali smiling TheLAT quotes Janet Reno saying that the turn in the case came as a resultof the most extensive criminal investigation in US history If convicted thebombers could get the death penalty            The WP has an interesting detail about the alacrity of theextradition to the US Apparently the Kenyans were worried that prosecutingany bombers would expose them to further terrorism Youd think the paperquotes one US official theyd want first crack at these guys TheWP adds that under a strengthening of US jurisdiction overseas passedby Congress in   suspected terrorists have been returned here fromoverseas But the Post doesnt tell us what then happened to them in thecourts            The WP runs an AP report about a recently concluded study of sevenyears worth of HIV tests given to  Job Corps participants Findingsthe rate of infection among women age  is  percent higher than that ofmen in the same age bracket And the highest rates of infection were amongblack
