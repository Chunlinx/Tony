        hi Debbie how are you   oh just fine   what do you think of this weather   oh its been beautiful here lately   oh i love it   yeah i was i was glad that Easter was nice because sounds like you have a child too   yeah yes you can hear her huh   yeah ive ive got a two year old and we hunted Easter eggs yesterday and the weather was really nice   uhhuh yeah i have a four year old and a one year old   umhum   so uh yeah im glad it was nice too i   we had a   got a chance to to go outside and   yeah   just have a nice day       the um i remember last year wasnt it raining a lot this yeah all that flooding and everything   it was raining last year we had uhhuh we   im glad we dont have that this year so far   oh oh it was awfully rainy last year it was a it was a very very wet spring remember how they had all that flooding down uh south of downtown all those people got flooded out   uhhuh we live just north of Trinity Mills and it floods there you know   oh did it   quite a lot um its not it doesnt usually damage any businesses or anything but you cant get off of thirty five to um   oh really i did   to go to Home Depot and thats a problem   yeah oh gosh yes uh the  a lot of people go there     yes or Target for that matter now   yeah im im were not from Texas were from further were from Missouri so its its   uhhuh   the weather down here is a lot different than than it is uh uh at home  yeah   oh yeah yeah were not from Texas either um were i grew up in Pennsylvania so   oh so youre really   yeah it its not like this in Pennsylvania   no i like the winters but i dont like the summers down here it   its awfully hot   its terribly hot in the summer here i just   yeah   when we moved down here our we had a our vehicle didnt have an air conditioner   oh youre kidding   im not well we didnt well i we really really dont need it very much in Missouri where were from   sure   but um oh we suffered that first summer we traded that thing in  as as soon as we could because it just its indispensable down here to have air conditioning   oh im sure i i think you would probably     it would be terrible     down here yeah id just i think its a necessity we um we have i guess we bought that my car in Colorado thats where we we moved from and uh   umhum oh   so we we had a feeling wed be coming back this way and again there they dont sell all the cars with air conditioning its you know its really a not   yeah its   its almost a luxury   oh it is you know uh   we didnt have air conditioning in our house or anything   oh yeah that would be nice oh i i get the the our electric bill in here July and August is just about kills me its because its so hot   oh yes it does   because i dont think they build them as energy efficient down here as they do up in the north i just really dont     no i dont think so either no   because of the winters winters  i kind of miss winter since it it didnt do anything down here this winter   oh no we didnt even have any of the famous Dallas ice storms   no we didnt no we didnt did we   no isnt that surprising   that was that is surprising       and i i it was uh really odd but we went home to Missouri at at at Christmas and i we had well we ran into town and in the ice   uhhuh oh   as we were coming into town and then it snowed a half a foot   oh my gosh   so we got our fill we went home at Christmas     well you know we lived in Colorado for       four years i guess   umhum   so and we you know we had a lot of snow and i i really dont miss that   yeah   my husband says he certainly doesnt mind shoveling missing the shoveling i mean we had a big sidewalk and  he didnt like that at all but   yeah yeah   i dont know   id rather have the snow than the ice   yeah oh definitely   because in Missouri we have a we have a lot of ice   uhhuh   and snow but uh but the the ice is really bad       because it knocks out power lines and and you just you just absolutely at least when youve got snow just about everybody has four wheel drive vehicles   thats right   so the ice you know thats thats a whole you dont you dont need a four wheel drive vehicle you sit and spin  uh   it doesnt matter right Colorado wasnt bad for that because um it so at least in Colorado Springs where we lived it was so sunny most of the time   uhhuh   that at right after it snowed it would almost always be a bright sunny day   thats a   and all of the roads would be clear youd still have the snow on the yard   yeah   the kids could play in it but itd be a bright sunny day and you know it would it would melt and you could drive around and it was really no big deal   thatd be nice did you all work at TI uh TI Colorado Springs   yeah yeah   oh okay we got we had a lot of people from my husbands old group that moved out there   really   yeah and theyre still theyre still out there though uh   thats good  they scaled down quite a bit they have a lot of changes out there lately     did oh theyre they are everywhere they   thats true  certainly not localized there   no     but we i dont know i i dont really miss the snow i miss the change of seasons myself   yes uhhuh   the fall is what i really miss from Pennsylvania   it just everything just kind of gives up and dies here   yeah it just turns brown and makes a mess       nothing pretty about it   no it just the the trees just go to about the first of December and then just oh well its time to die  so it just its just an ugly mess      umhum    my folks dont live in uh Pennsylvania anymore but for a long time i would purposely go back and visit in October   yeah   just so i could see the trees and the fall and such a pretty time   yeah my grand my grandparents took a tour of the oh of the northeast this past Fall and they really enjoyed it they said that the color was just fantastic   uhhuh it really is and i think you dont   this year   i growing up there i just assumed thats how it was all over the country i never really realized it was such a local   well yeah   thing i   yeah well the maple tree the maple maple trees have a lot to do with it maples make a lot of nice color   yeah   which there are none down here   nope   its too hot for them we have a lot of Maple trees in Missouri so we have a lot of nice color too but uh the northeast really has the corner on that   yeah they they do   on the on the real nice color but uh i i like spring i like i like the reason its i like that spring comes quickly here   yeah i do too im ready to get outside and get the kids outside and   yes uh yes   and seems to just even my one year old it really changes her temperament she can be in here all grouchy and   oh   put her outside and hey shes fine   oh definitely oh my my my two year old she hates to be put in indoors anyway and just   umhum   well i think long winters would really mess up mess her up  uh   my my son born he was born in Colorado and when we first moved here um he was three i guess just turned three   umhum   and for the first week we were here it was over a hundred every single day it was in July   oh whew yeah   and he was lethargic he really he wasnt used to the heat at all he   yeah huhuh   would go outside and hed turn into a zombie  and walk around like he didnt know what was going on but hes used to it now i think hes i mean   i know   he certainly doesnt like the heat but he doesnt become lethargic anymore   yeah well when we moved down here it was it was June and and it was just like a shock   uhhuh   how oh being its just so much different i mean the heat when it gets hot in Missouri it it itll get hot for a couple of days in the in the in the mid to upper nineties and people think its terrible and then it  and it always just goes away   uhhuh   it just i just couldnt it was just oppressive the heat down here   thats a good word for it   and i just couldnt       um  make my family understand this is hot uh     really hot     so   well its been good talking to you   well nice talking to you too   hopefully well have some more good weather but   oh yeah   well see   okay take it easy byebye     all righty byebye
