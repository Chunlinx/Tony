                                 The Unfairway            Increasingly I fear thatgolf has become auto racing What makes it so riveting are the crashes Thepsychological breakdowns The spasms of selfdestruction The carnage            We sawthat a year ago at the Masters Tournament with the Greg Norman debacle Normanhad always dreamed of winning the Masters and something had always gone wrongThis time Norman went into the final round with a lead so commandingsixshotsit seemed to be even Normanproof What ended up happening was that hemerely raised the standard by which other blown tournaments will now be judgedWatching Norman that day was sickening like seeing Swede Savage crash at Indyor Lawrence Taylor break Joe Theismanns leg I remember calling old friendsthat night people I hadnt spoken to in a long time In a world of painpeople need friends            Until this past weekend Norman was the No  golfer in theworld according to the Sony rankings Hes won more money on the PGA Tour thananyone else in history yet he will go down in history as a man ofextraordinary misfortunenot so much a failure as a fatality a victim ofgolfs surgical ability to bring to the surface a mans mental weakness Istill root for Norman but I also think of him as a cadaver He looks a mitegaunt and has been prone to fits of rage lately He screamed at a volunteer atthe Kemper Open for making a joke about President Clinton blowing out his kneeat Normans house At another point he misheard a fans comment thought he wasbeing heckled and gave the fan the finger Then at the US Open Championshiphe played two rounds in  over par a repulsive performance Our hero            Twoweekends ago at the Kemper Mark Wiebe had the tournament pretty well wrappedup It was  years since he had won a tournament With a oneshot lead Wiebeplayed the  th hole perfectly hitting safely over a pond to thefat part of the green He lagged his putt to within about twoandahalf feetHe had a straight uphill putt for par He could make a thousand such putts in arow on a practice green But golf is about the torture of the weak Wiebeyanked his putt left and lipped it out His wheels had come off Hed hit thewall There was nothing left but shards of metal and the wails of the doomedHe was still tied for the lead but that didnt matter since the devastationof missing that putt ensured that on the  th  facing an almostidentically easy putt three feet straight uphill he didnt even catch anylip missed it wide left game over The world is a dark cruel place A fewdays later at the US Open Wiebe had a fiveputt green something so awfulyou almost never hear of itfive putts on a single green before the fuckingball went in the fucking hole            How did golf become a sport of woe and miseryIt may be that the media spotlight is that much more intense and golfers knowhow many cameras are trained on their quivering hands Maybe it is thepursesa missed putt now can cost a golfer a couple of hundred thousanddollars Or maybe it is that the competition is so stiff that no single playercan dominate like Arnold Palmer or Jack Nicklaus or Tom Watson did in theirheydays No one out there has a prayer of winning  major tournaments likedid Many golfers win just one tournament in their entire careersome minorKmart Classic sort of thingand even the golfers who are good enough to winthe majors tend to win only one or two The window of opportunity is small andthey all fear having it slam shut on their fingers            The antidote to the recenttrend of golf tragedy has been Tiger Woods Coming into the US Open he hadnever lost anything that mattered to him Hed won six USGA championships insix yearsthree junior titles and then three consecutive US Amateurs Hedwon his first major as a pro the Masters in April and had done so with suchrecordsmashing brilliance that hed actually exceeded the hype that had beenbuilt up around him When he arrived for the US Open it was as though JackieKennedy had showed up            Lets goover there and get Tigers divot I heard a fan say one day referring to thetiny chunk of grass and dirt that Woods had scraped from the fairway on one ofhis shots            The US Open is the sports biggest event The BritishOpen has a longer history and the Masters is more familiarits played on thesame course every year and some of us can recite the yardage from tee to greenon the back ninebut the US Open has the strongest field the toughestconditions Everyone was buzzing about the rough the dreaded rough theheinous and monstrous rough  inches officially but sometimes looking morelike a dozenravenous insatiable rough a form of grass so severely impairinga golf swing that it was more like an animal            Woodsnever got close to leading the tournament much less winning I followed himsome on the first and last days and he was spectacular No one has as muchclub speed and when he strikes a ball it whistles rockets out into space ona line and then astonishingly rises as though hitting another gear somekind of warp drive before parachuting to Earth uncannily close to where Woodswants it to go His problem was that the US Open particularly CongressionalCountry Clubs blue course rewards conservative riskaverse players The wayto win is to shoot parson the fairway on the green twoputt for par go tothe next hole Woods played conservatively rarely using his driver but forall his genius hes not the straightest golfer in the world and he ended upin the spinach isnt it fun to use sports clichs too often That he didntputt well ensured that he wouldnt be a factor He finished tied for th  and then told the press that the sufferings over that thecourse had humbled me big time He was still a superstarin fact the Sonycomputer bumped him to No  past the fading Normanbut you could imaginethat he was on his way to becoming just a golfer And eventually a brokenman            The final day I was appalled that the onlypeople leading the Open were plodders and mopers and grumpers and nobodiesThey were men without color literally wearing gray and beige and brown Thefinal four of the day were tied at  under par going down the back nine and itwas obvious watching them labor away unsmiling that this was just anendurance test to see who could avoid crashing and disintegrating on nationaltelevision You had to root for perennial niceguy Tom Lehman whod led afterthree rounds of the Open for the third consecutive year I could not bringmyself to root for Jeff Maggert as his name bothers me sounding too much likea tauntMaggert Maggert Also hed committed the sin of winning a pile ofmoney on tour  million while winning only a single tournament Ernie Elsalone among the final four had won an Open but was a vanilla manplainlooking and apparently without any emotions whatsoever And finally therewas Colin Montgomerie a multiple failure in major tournaments surely the bestplayer in the world never to have won one of these things            First Maggert destructedHe got on a bogey run that wouldnt quit and he grimmed his way right out ofthe tournament Then Lehman hit into the rough by the  th green andlost a stroke The next hole the  th  we all watched ingutwrenching horror as Lehman hit his approach shot into the pond Nice guysfinish third            Lehmansaid afterward I feel an incredible amount of pain            Just before Lehmans disaster Montgomerie had made thecrucial mistake of the tournament He and Els were on the  thgreen tied at  under Montgomerie had a fivefoot putt He waited for thegroup on the nearby  th green to finish He waited and waitedMinutes passed Sometimes a person in life is faced with a crucial decision alife choice a yesorno question a moment when action must be takendecisively without pause or excessive contemplation Everyone watching thoughtHit the putt Just walk up and hit it Montgomerie wandered around the greenwaiting for total silence Tommy Tolles a golfer finishing on  made somegestures as though he was going to throw his ball in the lake and the crowdcheered him on which got Montgomerie flustered again The man just did notwant to hit the putt Because he knew it wasnt going in He knew he was aboutto crash            Finally he walked up andalmost halfheartedly tapped at the putt which missed and he lost and whenit was over he cried
