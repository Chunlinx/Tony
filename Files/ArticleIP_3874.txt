in Right and Huang to alterthe meaning of immunity to allow for the fruits of immunized testimony to beused against a criminal defendant            All attorneys have anobligation to represent their clients to the fullest extent allowed by law IfProfessor Amars proposal became law I would be obligated to force allinvestigation targets to testify just so that I could obtain the fruits of thetestimony It would be an excellent investigative tool            Unfortunately it would be an excellent investigative tool precisely because itwould eviscerate the constitutional right to avoid selfincrimination While itwould make my job easier it would also make this country a less desirableplace to live             JordanFinegold Bexley Ohio                           AuralHex                        There are apparently noboundaries to the misleading psychologizing of human experiences Now inTysons ChoiceJeffrey Itell claims that Mike Tyson may be  afflicted withmanicdepressive illness as evidenced by his having bitten off part ofEvander Holyfields ear            Part of Itellsunintentionally hilarious evidence for his conditional diagnosis is the allegedhistoric connection  between mania and artistic achievement which theauthor claims has been known since ancient times From this dubious premiseItell spins to his more preposterous conclusion that there may well be asimilar relationship  between manic depression and sporting achievementItell points as evidence to two athletesone of whom was depressedand apsychiatrist who muses that there are many other cases            But the authors exculpatorycoup de grce is Tysons claim that a psychiatric illness caused him todo things to Robin Givens his former wife that he would normally never doThen finalizing his ode to non sequiturs Itell analogizes Tysons allegeddisease to a fatal disease and even recommends that Tyson take psychoactivedrugs and undergo a medical clearance on his behavior            None ofthis nonmedical and simply silly analysis should blind the public to whathappened in reasonably clear terms An irresponsible boxer motivated by fearof losing took the easy way out which entailed he

     Herbert Steins On Being aJew reveals more about Steins survival tactics in the face ofantiSemitism than it does about the centrality of the Jewish experience Steinobviously chose to remember on which side his bread was buttered rather thanaddress the larger issue of the Jew in a Christian world            Of Richard Nixonsdisgraceful antiSemitic utterances made public in recently revealed tapesStein can only meekly remark Apparently Mr Nixon said some things that Iwish he had not said Surely an entry for the understatement of the year            As reported in the press atlong last President Nixon in the privacy of the Oval Office said to histrusted aide John we have the power Are we using it to investigate theJews  I can only hope that we are doing a little persecuting FurtherPlease give me the names of the Jews And How about the rich Jews The IRSis full of Jews Bob            Even such a staunchsupporter as William F Buckley Jr squirmed in embarrassment as he defendedhis hero Nixon calling him paranoid and dismissing his antiSemitism as allfoam no teeth pointing out that Jews like Henry Kissinger William Safireand Herb Stein continued to support him although it was unlikely that theywere unaware of his antiSemitic tendencies            Yet Stein can now writeBut I know of nothing in his behavior to me to my family to Israel or toJews in general that entitles him to anything less than my total loyalty            LoyaltyTo a president who can mouth and therefore think such dangerous antiSemiticdynamite Steins posture is that of one who puts selfinterest aboveprinciple opportunism above ethics In so doing he fails the Jewish peopleand does a grave disservice to the sense of fairness and decency to all             MeyerRangell Bloomingburg NY                           HerbertStein responds What was in Mr Nixons heart and soul and whether thatwas represented by the offensive things he said to some people I do not knowI can only reflect my own experience and observation I never had any reason tothink that Mr Nixon was antiSemitic I never heard him make a remark that wasin the slightest degree suggestive of such an attitude He was unfailinglyfriendly and sympathetic not only to me but also to other members of my familyAs is well known he appointed and relied upon a number of JewsKissingerBurns Safire Garment and me His longtime political mentor Murray Chotinerwas Jewish He defended Israel when it was in the greatest danger of itshistory in  and the Israelis regarded him as their friend            The statement in my articleI know of nothing in his behavior to me to my family to Israel or to Jewsin general that entitles him to anything less than my total loyalty is quiteprecise It said neither more nor less than I meant and I stand by it            MrRangell attributes despicable motives to me which can be summed up asopportunism Since Mr Rangell does not know me I think it inappropriate forhim to make such judgments

on race thatfocused on ways of lessening de facto segregation would be a good thingHowever unless I am mistaken this is not the conversation that PresidentClinton has proposed It seems that we are in for a conversation about race assuch isolated from specific problems and specific policy proposals Thus theresults are more likely to be those of Sheldon Hackneys illconceivedmulticultural conversations which disintegrated predictably into the type ofentrenched obscurantistindeed segregationistidentitypolitics posing thatis so familiar to those of us who have spent time on the campuses of eliteuniversities            Preliminary local conversations on race have already been held in NorthCarolina and they have gone nowhere They have been as they will be at thenational level conversations about racism These make some people feel good byencouraging them to feel angry and they make others feel good by letting themfeel guilty but they make the rest of us feel a distinctly tight sensation inour chests as our hopes for a rational discussion are systematicallydisappointed And they dont begin to address the concrete socioeconomicproblems that exacerbate racial strife in

can only speculate how executives of a company called CombinedInsurance explained to themselves their decision to adopt the name AonActually anyone who knows anything about the insurance business understandsthe reason for the change Combined Insurance Company still exists and writesinsurance under that name The parent company recently acquired by merger theworlds largest insurance broker Alexander  Alexander Services Inc andalso a large British broker called Bain Hogg Group plc which does substantialbusiness in Asian countries Alexander  Alexander was known to allinsurance professionals as AA which was a name with considerable brandvalue So the newly merged company had several problems how to announce to theworld that it was now not only an insurance underwriter but also a broker howto keep the AA brand value without appearing simply to be gobbling upBain Hogg and how to do this with a name that is easy to say in European andAsian languages            The answer Aon is to mymind quite elegant It keeps the initial capital A and the first two syllablesof AA pronounced A n A it puns on eon which implies longevityand stabilitya desirable connotation for an insuranceservices companyespecially one that has just undergone a major and disruptive change it has aremote but perceptible similarity in sound to Bain and it gives the companya unique legally protectable and memorable name unlike the generic CombinedInsurance moniker The switch to Aon is very similar to the process thatStandard Oil of New Jersey whose main subsidiary marketed in most places underthe same Esso went through when it switched to Exxon Although I have noway of knowing I wouldnt be surprised if the Aon people modeled their choiceon the Exxon example            Youllnotice that in my last sentence I idly speculated on the Aon companys use ofthe Exxon example Thats all right for me Im just a lettertotheeditorwriter But Surowiecki is a professional He should at least make a minimaleffort to find out about his subject companies before he makes fun of them Ilearned quite a bit about Aon at wwwaoncom which is more than Surowiecki did             Joe Ruby

in the trade balance with Europeancountriesarent of equal concern The United States runs a relatively smallmerchandisetrade deficit with Europe relative to its deficit with Japan insome European countries eg the United Kingdom the United States runs asurplus Although a strong dollar relative to several European currenciesnotably the German mark and the Italian lira is worrisome it is nowhere nearas serious as the huge  billion in  trade deficit with Japan            Another point to consider isthat for much of the s US productivity growth has far outpaced that ofits major European trading partners This means that there is potential for theUS dollar to grow relative to the European countries without giving rise toa further significant worsening of the US trade balance with Europe            Inclosing while I agree with you that a rising US currency relative to itsEuropean partners may not be a positive development it is certainly not ofequal concern with the persistent trade deficit with Japan             Doug Heath                                       SummaryFudgement                        In the interest of veracitya couple of corrections to your rather inaccurate synopsis of Richard RussosStraight Man in SummaryJudgment which naturally makes me wonder about that features synopsesof those books movies etc that I havent read             The synopsis infers thatthe narrative is propelled by an incidentthe protagonist loses his jobwhichin fact does not occur until the last  pages of the novel And he is offereda better job Which he turns down             The protagonist in no waycommandeers a television station In fact he becomes the inadvertent subjectof a taped remote at the college campus            OKseemingly small details But such are the delights of every Russo novel so youmight as well get them right             Harley Peyton                                       Addressyour email to the editors to lettersslatecom Please include your address and daytime
