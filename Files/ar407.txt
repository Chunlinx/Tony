                    Introduction        Rheumatoid arthritis RA is characterized by synovial        tissue leukocyte infiltration and angiogenesis     The        neovascularization process in RA is dependent on the        balance between angiogenic mediators and inhibitors The        angiogenic mediators include growth factors cytokines        chemokines adhesion receptors and proteolytic enzymes            These factors which are released by endothelial cells        and macrophages have been shown to play an important role        in the pathogenesis of RA            Tie receptors constitute a family of endothelial        tyrosine kinase receptors      There are two members        in this receptor family termed Tie and Tie also known        as Tek Tie is an orphan receptor whereas the ligands of        Tie receptor have been identified as angiopoietin Ang        and Ang      Ang has been shown to be responsible        for recruiting and sustaining periendothelial support cells            It has been reported that Ang disrupts blood        vessel formation in the developing embryo by antagonizing        Anginduced autophosphorylation of Tie            Transgenic mouse models of TieAng result in embryonic        lethality due to absence of remodeling and sprouting of        blood vessels      The physiologic roles of the Tie        receptor and its ligands are limited to angiogenic        processes that occur subsequently to the earlier        vasculogenic and angiogenic actions of vascular endothelial        growth factor VEGF and its receptors     VEGF and the        Tie family orchestrate optimal blood vessel formation                    Little is known about the role of Tie receptors and the        ligands Ang and Ang in RA synovial tissue To determine        which of these angiogenic factors may play a role in RA we        investigated both the distribution and the levels of mRNA        for Tie Tie Ang and Ang in synovial tissue obtained        from RA patients compared with that from subjects with        osteoarthritis OA and normal tissues                    Materials and methods                  Antibodies and immunohistochemistry          Synovial tissues  m were fixed in cold acetone for           minutes Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by          treatment with  H            O            for  minutes Synovial tissues were          pretreated with either  horse or goat serum for one          hour at C before application of primary antibody          Indirect immunoperoxidase staining was performed at C          for one hour using Vector Elite ABC kits Vector          Burlingame CA USA and diaminobenzidine Kirkegaard and          Perry Gaitherburg MD USA as a chromogen               The polyclonal antibodies goat antihuman Ang and          Ang and rabbit antihuman Tie and Tie were purchased          from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA USA          Additionally goat antihuman Tie and Tie antibodies          were purchased from RD Systems Minneapolis MN          USA Antibodies did not crossreact with other members          of the Tie family          Macrophage identity was

western blot analysis are          detailed in the supplementary material                            Results                  Ang          Ang was expressed on synovial lining cells in RA          patients  to a significantly higher degree than in          OA  and normal  cells            P   Fig  Ang          staining on macrophages was also significantly higher in          RA  compared to OA  and normal cells             P   The Ang staining          present on vascular endothelium was upregulated in RA           compared to OA  and normal synovial tissues           The inflammatory and vascularity scores were higher          in RA synovial tissue in comparison to OA and normal In          accordance with the staining data RA synovial tissue          demonstrated significantly higher Ang mRNA expression          compared to OA and normal tissues Ang mRNA expression          was not detected in RA fibroblasts Fig                           Ang          The expression of Ang was detected on synovial          lining cells macrophages and vascular endothelium Fig           The data demonstrate that Ang was expressed on          macrophages  and the vascular endothelium  in          synovial tissue of RA patients more strongly than in the          tissue of OA patients macrophages  endothelium           and normal subjects macrophages  endothelium           Additionally Ang was detected in the synovial vascular          smooth muscle cells  from RA patients only          The Ang mRNA expression pattern was similar to Ang          immunostaining on vascular endothelium The Ang mRNA          expression in RA synovial tissue was similar to that from          OA patients and both were significantly higher than          normal Interestingly in RA synovial tissue fibroblasts          Ang mRNA was expressed at low levels compared to that          found in whole RA OA or normal synovial tissue Fig                                    Tie          Tie expression was found to be significantly higher          in RA and OA synovial tissue lining cells RA  OA           and macrophages RA  OA  compared to normal          synovial tissue lining cells  macrophages  using          antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Fig  Tie          immunostaining on endothelial cells was significantly          higher in RA synovial tissue  in comparison to OA           and normal  synovial tissue The Tie positive          immunostaining on vascular smooth muscle cells was          similar in all test groups RA  OA  normal           Additionally all disease groups demonstrated minimal          percentages of Tie cell staining on synovial tissue          lymphocytes RA  OA  normal  and fibroblasts RA           OA  normal           Immunohistochemistry studies using the goat antihuman          Tie antibody purchased from RD Systems showed          predominantly endothelial cell staining and minimal          staining on macrophages and fibroblasts Tie mRNA          expression was significantly higher in RA synovial tissue          compared to OA synovial tissue fold normal synovial          tissue fold and RA synovial tissue fibroblasts          fold Western blot analysis also confirmed the same          pattern of expression                          Tie          Tie was significantly upregulated in RA and OA          synovial tissue lining cells RA  OA           macrophages RA  OA  and smooth muscle cells RA           OA  compared to normal synovial tissue            P   using the Santa Cruz          antibodies Fig  Endothelial cells showed relatively          high Tie positive staining in all disease groups RA           OA  normal  Only synovial tissue from RA          patients demonstrated positive staining for Tie on          lymphocytes RA and OA patients had similar patterns of          Ang on cell lining and endothelial cells Tie on          lining cells macrophages smooth muscle cells          lymphocytes and fibroblasts and Tie on lining cells          macrophages endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle          cells expression on various synovial tissue components          The antiTie antibody from RD Systems demonstrated          positive staining mainly on endothelial cells and minimal          staining on macrophages and fibroblasts Tie mRNA levels          were significantly higher in RA synovial tissue compared          to OA synovial tissue fold normal synovial tissue          fold and RA synovial tissue fibroblasts fold          Tie protein expression by western blotting followed the          same pattern as the mRNA expression Fig                             Discussion        The Tie receptors and the ligands Ang and Ang appear        to be involved in the later stages of vessel growth and        remodeling      Transgenic mice with gene deletions             or overexpression of Ang    exhibit early        embryonic lethality secondary to defects in the developing        vasculature        Ang was more highly expressed in synovial tissue from        RA patients than in either OA or normal synovial tissues        expression in OA tissue was similar to normal Positive        cells included lining cells macrophages and endothelial        cells In RA Ang was most upregulated on endothelial        cells The results obtained from RTPCR analysis confirmed        that RA synovial tissue had significantly higher Ang mRNA        expression than OA and normal synovial tissue Hence no        Ang mRNA expression was detected in RA fibroblasts Fig         The Tie receptor family is known to be expressed on        endothelial cells     Otani         et al    reported Ang and Ang        positive staining on macrophages and endothelial cells in        choroidal neovascular membranes Macrophages are key        angiogenesis effector cells that produce a number of growth        factor stimulators and inhibitors proteolytic enzymes and        cytokines that can activate one or more steps in the        angiogenesis cascade       Recent studies have        shown that angiopoietins promote postnatal        neovascularization by potentiating angiogenic cytokines        such as VEGF                     In situ hybridization and        immunohistochemical analyses of RA synovial biopsies        revealed that VEGF mRNA and protein localized to        subsynovial macrophages lining cells vascular smooth        muscle cells and fibroblasts within the pannus which are        the putative target of this cytokine      The        localization of Ang is similar to that of VEGF which        further supports the crucial role of the interaction        between these two pathways Ang modulates VEGFstimulated        reorganization of endothelial cells and promotes vascular        network maturation      Additionally both Ang and        VEGF are chemotactic and are involved in recruiting        endothelial cells to initiate and accelerate        endothelialization of blood vessels             We detected Ang immunopositive cells in synovial        lining macrophages and vascular endothelium Vascular        smooth muscle immunostaining was found only in RA In        agreement with our finding it has been reported that        primary cultured macrophages and precursor macrophage cell        lines mainly express Ang mRNA     In contrast to        Ang Ang was distributed in a similar pattern in RA and        OA compared to normal synovial tissues Fig  The        dominance of Ang over Ang mRNA and protein in OA        synovial tissue are in agreement with the inactive VEGF        receptor  pathway angiogenic pathway in OA     The        Ang mRNA expression pattern correlates with the Ang        immunostaining detected on endothelial cells In RA        synovial tissue Ang showed a lower percentage of        staining in all the cell types compared to Ang Low Ang        mRNA expression was also detected on RA fibroblasts        Interestingly Ang acts as an agonist for Tie receptors        expressed on fibroblasts     Since the        neovascularization process is dependent on the dominance of        angiogenic mediators over inhibitors the higher Ang mRNA        and protein expression compared to Ang in RA synovial        tissue is of importance It has been shown that increasing        amounts of Ang can block the chemotactic activity of        Ang in endothelial cells     Ang alone did not        stimulate corneal neovascularization but the combination        of Ang and VEGF resulted in longer vessels with greater        circumferential extent than those seen with VEGF alone            This suggests that Ang expression in the absence of        VEGF leads to vessel regression whereas expression of        Ang in the presence of VEGF potentiates angiogenesis        Using the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody Tie        expression was detected on all cell components examined        including a percentage of synovial lining cells        macrophages and smooth muscle cells in RA and OA Synovial        tissues from normal subjects and those with OA had        considerably lower positive immunostaining on endothelial        cells compared to RA tissues Immunohistochemical analysis        performed with antiTie from RD Systems in synovial        tissues supports its expression mainly on endothelial        cells However western blot analysis for Tie also        performed with an antibody from RD Systems showed        higher relative abundance of Tie in whole RA and OA        synovial tissue homogenates compared to RA fibroblasts        Fig  In accordance with the protein data the mRNA        levels of Tie in RA synovial tissue were upregulated        compared to OA synovial tissue normal synovial tissue and        RA fibroblasts Since the ligand for the Tie receptor is        not known it is difficult to speculate if there is any        correlation between this receptor and Tie and its ligands        In agreement with previous studies the Tie receptor was        detected on vascular endothelial cells     and        recently on synovial lining cells     It has been        shown that tumor necrosis factor and VEGF activate        membraneassociated metalloproteinases that release soluble        Tie from the cell surface of endothelial cells and thereby        decrease membranebound Tie expression     The        upregulation of Tie mRNA and protein expression in RA is        not consistent with these findings and this may be due to        the fact that the inflammatory milieu in RA synovial tissue        is far more complex than the         in vitro system        Using the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody we showed        that Tie expression was significantly upregulated both in        RA and OA synovial tissue lining cells macrophages        endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle compared to        normal synovial tissue In accordance with Otani         et al    and Uchida         et al    we detected Tie        immunostaining on endothelial cells and fibroblasts in all        disease groups Tie immunostaining using antibody from        RD Systems confirmed the expression of this antigen        mainly on endothelial cells Tie mRNA and protein        expression followed the same pattern of expression as Tie        There are some possible reasons why the        immunohistochemistry studies performed with Santa Cruz        BiotechnologyRD Systems antibodies differ The Santa        Cruz Biotechnology antibodies detected epitopes on the        carboxy terminus whereas the RD Systems antibodies        recognized the extracelluar domain N terminus or the        ligand binding domain of Tie and Tie There is also some        variability between individual RA patient samples however        we attempted to use the same RA patient samples in        performing immunohistochemistry with the two different        antibodies Additionally the results obtained from the        RTPCR and western blot analysis confirm our findings                    Conclusion        It is noteworthy that the activating ligand Ang is        exclusively higher than Ang at the mRNA and protein        levels in RA synovial tissue compared to that from patients        with OA and normal subjects Hypothetically in RA synovial        tissue the dominating Ang induces the Tie pathway        whereas in normal synovial tissue higher Ang presence        blocks Ang binding to Tie and inhibits its        autophosphorylation        In conclusion the dominance of Ang over Ang        expression favors active neovascularization in RA synovial        tissue Multiple pathways are probably required to regulate        angiogenesis It may be that the inhibition of the VEGF and        Tie pathways might be an effective therapeutic modality in        RA                    Abbreviations        Ang  angiopoietin BSA  bovine serum albumin
