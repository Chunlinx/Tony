                all right Clarice uh whats your favorite basketball team   well Mavericks probably the one that plays here   the Mavericks yeah   the Mavericks uh theyre not doing the greatest that ive seen them play before but uh well theyre doing okay   yeah they didnt quite make the playoffs though   but but no no i i think without uh Roy Tarpley theyre he he added something to the team but uh i think they need to let him go maybe   but yeah   he doesnt seem to course i have a lot of players that i think are really super i think Isaiah Thomas is just great and uh i think uh he   yeah   he does really well i like to watch him play he just has a really good moves and uh  i dont know i i guess uh   uhhuh   uh i guess i like to watch the Mailman play for the the Utah team uh when he delivers he does okay and uh uh   yeah uhhuh     i cant think of the name of the team that has Larry Bird on it oh the Celtics i like to watch them play the whole team i like their whole team   oh the Celtics the they are a team is whats really good about them   yeah yeah   they just uh work the ball and uh pass around and make each other look good   yeah umhum i you know like i said i like Isaiah Thomas but i think sometimes that uh that uh he he sometimes ends up being a one man team uh whereas the Celtics like you said they play more as a team um   yeah makes it little more fun to watch at times   yeah i like Michael Jordan a lot too hes really good uh   yeah   Danny Ainge he plays i like Danny Ainge okay   you like Danny Ainge why do you like Danny Ainge that thats i mean youve named like four of the top names in the game and then you come up with Danny Ainge   well i well i guess because he played at at my alma mater  so i i kind of watch him every now and again   did he play BYU oh you went to BYU huh okay   yeah yeah yeah and he played really well when he was there so   yeah   uh its its hard to uh name him with some of the very top players i think sometimes but im glad hes playing in the in the pros yeah hes a   yeah hes uh well i have nothing against him i just uh   you just wondered why i named him huh   i wondered yeah i wondered everybody has their their favorite you know maybe not the the big name player but uh yeah hes playing a vital role he hes playing for Portland hes playing for Portland hes i mean hes coming in and doing a good job hes it was a great trade how they got him   Portland umhum right now yeah they yeah i i liked when he uh he was playing with Celtics and then he traded to Portland   umhum   and uh it was a good trade so   seems like uh i dont know if its mainly because of him but it seems that he plays for top teams and uh you know contenders uh he might have uh did he go straight from Boston to Portland or did he hit another team on the way   um i dont remember i really dont it seems like he went straight there you know because i dont remember him playing for another another team other than straight through   but uh yeah yeah   yeah   but uh yeah hes uh i i like to watch him play because hes a yeah hes pretty tough you know hes hes a scrappy guy   so whats your favorite team   hes a competitor   do you have a favorite team yeah   oh do i have a favorite team uh well im from Indiana so i like the Pacers and uh   uh   i like Larry Bird because hes from the home state also   uhhuh   i just likewatch him play anyway uh   yeah   lets see i like the Bulls because theyre from the Chicago area and uh theyve uh suffered through many a hard season before they got Jordan   yeah yeah yeah   and uh even then once they got him they didnt make the playoffs for a couple years they had to gradually build up a supporting cast because you cant just win with one player in the NBA you have to have a a you know a good solid team   umhum   even though one player can carry a bulk of the of the scoring load you know you have to have the other players there to complement him and finally with uh Pippen and some of the Horace Grant some of the other guys are coming right along   i watched uh well i didnt watch them but i i saw in the newspaper and in on the news the playoff teams and and without Larry Bird and and Michael Jordan when they got injured you know it was interesting i think then how their teams did um   uhhuh   how it it it brought the scoring down a little bit but their teams stayed relatively together you know and so   yeah   you know i think sometimes its interesting we we really watch the big name players and but they have to have a solid team underneath or else they really dont dont go anywhere   uhhuh   so i i think thats kind of the Mavericks problem they have okay players but sometimes the strongness of the team isnt together   yeah   you know every once in a while they click during a a game and then it works for them but then its just not always there   yeah   so i i guess thats   well they made a couple trades this this year that uh well Fat Lever was hurt most of the year   yeah   and that so they didnt get to reap any benefits from that and uh i dont know how well Alex English did but   English did okay he did okay   okay   but uh   see see we dont have a TV so i didnt get to watch any of the Mavericks i think i got to watch probably one game all year so   oh i think Adubato as the coach of their team uh has done a lot a lot for them   yeah   i think he hes uh brought some strength to that team um um he hes really trying hard hes a nice guy i like him as the coach of the Mavericks so i dont i dont know a lot of coaches in the in the NBA though   well they move around so much   yeah thats true   cant hardly keep a one coach where hes at for very long enough to get know who he is   yeah thats true  thats true   yeah i think uh like you said i mean Tarpley if he was had his life straightened up he could really help a ball club but you know the way well hes operating now hes more of a detriment than anything else   yeah i think theyre i think theyll let him go   they should   anyway i i uh i like basketball its a fun sport i i like to watch it i like to um   yeah   i guess i like it because of of the quickness of it um and and i like it because it takes the players have to be you know its not a game where you can just not practice i mean they have to be on the top of their game to be i n the NBA i think   uhhuh right   yeah or else   top physical condition too   yeah yeah   so do you like college basketball high school ball anything like that   i dont watch much of that i watch our town Plano uh Plano East is where my children will go i have an eleven year old son and he plays basketball and my son my husband coaches his team   uhhuh umhum   and uh they uh i think they were one off one loss to the playoff   oh   and uh i like to watch our Plano East Senior High boys play they are they did really well so yeah   good   i like yeah i do like um the the games not only basketball but the other ones too that the high schools play i keep up with that   yeah   so   yeah i i its fun watching basketball at all different levels i mean there are benefits and and bad points of watching it each each different one i mean you may not see a spectacular Michael Jordanish move from a high school player but you know its more of an accomplishment if if they hit   yeah   you know some three pointers or something the game is you know its just a different game pretty much but thats sort of what makes it fun   yeah yeah well you know what i think is you know like Spud Webb i mean   umhum   you can really even if youre short like that you know in basketball today they get these huge tall players that   uhhuh   that just are you know if you want to do it bad enough i think its a possibility in anybodys life   yeah   hes he really goes for it and hes a good little player you know so   oh yeah hes   i think if if any of these boys want to do it they really can if thats really their dream   yeah yeah   so  takes work though thats the big yeah yeah   takes a lot of working well Spud was just gifted with a exceptional vertical leap and thats what helps him out more than anything else   yeah yeah   plus you know hes like you said hes worked hard at it im sure   well i just think that basketballs a fun game and and i guess i still have to stick with the Mavericks i guess as far as   yeah
