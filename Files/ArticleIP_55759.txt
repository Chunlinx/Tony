                                 Jokes on You            Eightyears ago Al Gore and his fellow Democrats had great sport with the gaffes ofVice President Dan Quayle You remember the jokes Quayle misspelled potatobotched the United Negro College Fund slogan What a waste it is to lose onesmind etc A few months ago Republicans turned this tactic on Gore mockinghis suggestion that he had helped create the Internet Now Gore is applyingthe same derision to George W Bush All three episodes illustrate an importantprinciple of negative campaigning If you dont have something nice to sayabout someone say it with humor            In aCNN interview eight months ago Gore asserted During my service in the UnitedStates Congress I took the initiative in creating the Internet A day laterHouse Majority Leader Dick Armey RTexas told the Associated Press he hadcracked up over Gores claim If the vice president created the Internetthen I created the interstate highway system In a satirical press releaseRep James Sensenbrenner RWis exclaimed I had no idea my friend Al Gorecreated the Internet The Republican Leadership Council aired TV ads linkingGores Internet claim to similar assertions that he lived on a farm andundertook the task to reinvent the Federal government The ad accused Gore oftrying to reinvent reality            TheGore jokes like the Quayle jokes poisoned their target without projectingmalice They seized on a single misstatement exaggerated it and inflated itinto a comprehensive critique of the candidate In each case the statement wasuseful to the candidates enemies because it touched on a weakness that  wassimilarly reflected in other comments by the candidate and  directlyundermined his campaign rationale In Quayles case the rationale was nationalsecurity and the weakness was stupidity In Gores case the rationale iseconomic progress and the weakness is taking undue credit            IfGore had called Quayle a fool Gore would have looked mean and swing votersbeing suspicious would have doubted the charge If Armey had called Gore aliar these voters would have assumed that Armey was lying about Gore Theway to slip the accusation past this barrier of incredulity is to pose the ideaindirectly through satireto savage your enemy with a smile Once the idea isplanted in the voters head this way the voter thinks it was his idea to beginwithand he begins to embellish it The next time Quayle makes a mistake thevoter thinks to himself There goes that Quayle again What a moron            Bushhas gradually applied this lesson to his criticism of Gore In his campaignkickoff speech last June Bush was too heavyhanded Some in thisadministration think they invented prosperity But they did not inventprosperity any more than they invented the Internet By October howeverBush had lightened his touch If what Clinton and Gore have done isreinventing government it makes you wonder how this administration was everskilled enough and efficient enough to create the Internet            Thisweek Gore returned the favor Tuesday morning radio talk show host Don Imusasked Gore whether Bush should have been able to identify the leaders ofTaiwan India Pakistan and Chechnya when Bush was quizzed about thosecountries a week ago In the quiz Bush had failed to name three of thoseleaders and had asserted that the leader of Pakistan a general who hadoverthrown the countrys elected government recently took over office  isgoing to bring stability to the country and I think thats good news for thesubcontinent Heres how Gore answered Imus question            Isympathize with those who say that thats not really a fair test I think thatit is troubling that he didnt know that its important to stand up fordemocracy and that a military coup overthrowing a democracy is not good newsAnd I think its important  and troubling that he didnt know its in ourinterests to stop the spread of nuclear weapons with the Comprehensive Test BanTreaty I mean this is a part of the world where its probably most likelythat youre going to see serious problems in the future unless somethingsdone            Gorewent on But not knowing the names  I think thats kind of understandable Imean the other day I was talking to Otkir Sultonov You know the primeminister of Uzbekistan And he asked me Did you send a birthday card toHamed Thats of course Hamed Karoui the prime minister of Tunisia I hadjust been talking about him with Ion Sturza the prime minister of MoldovaWere old friends We actually met through a mutual friend Lennart Meri thepresident of Estonia of course            Imusribbed Gore over the joke and the media have been playing with it ever sinceWITH TONGUE IN CHEEK AL GORES BUSH roared the New York Post  GORETHROWS IMUS A RADIO FUNNY BONE agreed the New York Daily News             Goresjoke may look funny but as a political kidney punch its dead serious Bushscampaign rationale is that hell keep America strong and make Americans proudHis weakness is that hes ignorant of world affairs Grecians Kosoviansetc and has a track record as a bad and indifferent student By criticizingBushs answers to the world affairs quiz Gore is trying to inflate Bushsweakness and discredit Bushs rationale And by following up his seriousaccusation ie that Bush showed indifference to the Pakistani coup andignorance of the regions nuclear importance with a lighthearted recitation ofthe leaders of obscure countries Gore is sugarcoating his indictment of Bushso that listeners will laugh swallow and absorb it            Its true that Democratscynically oversimplified Quayles blunders Its equally true that Republicanscynically oversimplified Gores statement about the Internet And its truethat Gore is now doing the same to Bush But its also true that in every casethese cynical charges have stuck You call this tactic outrageous Cmonlighten up
