                     OK         Um were going to talk about today childhood stories and what Im wondering is what are the stories you remember as children                     I recall a number of stories         My mother read a great deal to me         Ah Uncle Wiggly was a favorite                     Uncle Wiggly         What was that about                     Thats about a rabbit and about a farmer that used to chase the rabbit out of his uh carrot patch and uh all the characters that were associated with that                     Was that your favorite story                     I think thats one I remember a lot because when I was in st grade I was sick a lot of the year and I was out of school a lot of the year         And uh because of that my mother read to me a lot you know to help me me feel better                  So she uh she read a lot of Uncle Wiggly stories to me         But I think the story that was was a favorite was one that my mother made up herself utilizing characters from you know like Bugs Bunny and and Thumper and Bambi and all that         And ah she she made it up a story about a me and my cousin Phil ah going on this trip to the Canadian Northwest to hunt and meeting these little characters uh while we were there         Of course it cant be published because all those things are copyrighted but my mother made up the story and I thought it was very nice and I still have it uh handwritten uh in our file here                     OK how about you Mom                     I remember uhem Peter Cottontail and the farmer chasing him under the wire and Peter Cottontail getting out just in time         and I remember Mickey Mouse stories         I liked those Disney World things         Of course who knew about Disney World a hundred years ago but um Mickey Mouse was a favorite         And um Little Women that was and now I had three older sisters and I always kind of envisioned us patterned after Little Women and because         there were four girls in that family and I loved that story read it over and over again         I fact I took you to Louisa May Alcotts home in Massachusetts and we ah umm         Lets see other stories         Oh I hated I well Ill just tell you that later         Um uh I I I just um I guess Im drawing a blank here         I cant think anymore                     Well what was your favorite story         If you had to pick out of all of them                     My favorite story um oh Cinderella         I just loved Cinderella                  I also saw my sisters as the wicked stepsisters sometimes          and I was Cinderella running around waiting on them                              What ah story in your childhood had the most impact on you         Ill ask you first Mom and then Dad                     Ohum most impact on me                  I think Oh Heidi         I loved Heidi and that in fact I wanted to name one of my children Heidi         because I loved Heidi of the Alps         Um as far as having an impact on me I guess uh being a good girl and doing all the right things         Those were the stories I read OK Dad want to tell                     Whats your favorite                              Well Ill tell you there was a record Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes and I still quote it today when Im when Im being funny         And it had to do with the description of all the cowboy paraphernalia that was ah existent at the time         Like tapaderos that were on the the uh place to protect your boots in the saddle Laughs and reverts to normal voice and all that sort of thing         So I remember silly things like that that were a lot of fun                  I read uh the story that I dont this isnt ah I think the first real story that I read was uh The Red Badge of Courage         Uh more serious and that was that was a very interesting story because it was the first time I came upon a character who was real who was afraid who ran away who uh then came back and uh and conquered his fear which is something that we all have to do from time to time                     What are your least favorite stories         When youre thinking of stories that affected you and really you abhorred         What are those stories                     Well Aladdin and the Lamp         That genie that came out of that lamp scared me half to death                     Was that told to you or did you read that                     Um that was told to me and I saw that genie coming out of the bottle in the picture in the book was not about a kind and loving genie         It was kind of scary looking and I thought Ooh         I dont think Id like to meet up with that genie                     Well who told you that story                     Ooh one of my three older sisters         Probably Lois your Aunt Lois                     I cant think of a story that uh had a real negative impact on me         Umm I guess Ill leave it at that                     Um when youre talking about your favorite stories what was your favorite part of the story                     Remember I told you about the story my mother wrote and I can remember at the time and in some ways its still true today         Ah the favorite part of the story was the fact that I had somehow bought an old Model T Ford                              How appropriate                              That was the favorite part of the story                     Well I think all the happy endings we read as children Pollyanna you know and uh everything always seemed to turn out right                     So these were your favorite parts                              Stories I liked yeah                              What were your least favorite parts of the story         What parts of the story were boring                     Oh         In Little Women when Meg died Oh dear         That was so traumatic and ah Swiss Family Robinson         Uh I loved the part where they would you know make things out of nothing         They made a home out of out of things they found on the island fashioned things oh uh implements uh out of coconut shells and whatever stones and whatever they could find         I liked that part                     Did you identify with any of these characters         And whats the one you identified with the most                     Well I think I identified with Jo         She was kind of headstrong and she was um kind of artistic maybe and uh uh liked to have a good sense of humor                     Yeah the main I The Red Badge of Courage the main character at first I had never you know all of the cowboy stories that I saw or read it was uh uh you know the good the bad and the good were very good and the bad were very bad         And this was the first occasion where the good person had some some flaws         So I didnt like that at first and then of course you know as the story unfolded you would uh relate that to your own experiences of being afraid and and learning to conquer those fears and that kind of thing         So I thought it was uh uh it was at first a part of the story I didnt like but afterward uh you know it certainly taught a lesson                     Were talking a lot about childhood stories and stories that um were read to you and what were the first what did you start reading when you were first allowed to choose what you read         What did you choose                     Well I chose to read the ones that had been read to me         We had a great big book of Grimms Fairytales and looking back on that they were grim         They were scary throwing a child in the oven and all that sort of thing         However it didnt seem to be so horrifying         It was a story and I you know you knew it was fiction but I would go back and read when I could read myself I read everything         I read the backs of cereal boxes         I read everything I could get my hands on                     I didnt do a lot of reading         I guess I read a lot of classic comics                     Classic comics yeah                     Uh well yeah and I remember Ivanhoe and uh The Disinherited Knight and all that kind of thing         I was always into those kinds of heroic things um so I read a lot of those things                     I forgot about comic books         Oh Archie and oh I loved Archie comics                     Oh yeah superheroes like Captain Marvel Superman Batman and all of them                     Im talking to you as your you know my Mom and Dad and uh what were if you know what were your Mom and Dads favorite stories                     My father read uh liked history and read um a lot of historical uh factual things not into fiction at all         Uh my mother was probably so busy running around taking care of all of us         I guess she read um I think she read biographical things rather than um novels                     My father didnt read anything in terms of what youd call a book uh but he was analytical of the Sport of Kings and so would peruse the paper to check on that                  But uh my mother uh you know didnt read a whole lot but spent a lot of time reading to me uh my being an only child         Uh so yeah I took up a lot of her life and she read a lot of childrens stories to me as a result of that but I dont believe she read a lot for her own amusement                     At that time and now later on she she lives at the library just about                     Absolutely does                     So its like she uh and the education wasnt the same back in those days         So um you know it was different people would read for different reasons and I think your mother has um you know shes educated herself at the library                     Yeah thats true                     Were talking a lot about stories and um novels and childrens books was there any poetry that was your favorite                     Golly I never really got into poetry         Yeah I had to take it as children         Or high school         I just really didnt ever love poetry for some reason                     I still recall and Im sure your mother does too Whose woods these are I think I know His house is in the village though and I wont go beyond that but uh you recall that Gail when we were when I was in college and we were first dating that was a a favorite poem of uh us and our friends                     Was that selfwritten                     Oh no         That was Robert Frost                     OK I thought so         Um and were talking about childhood and middle school what about high school         What about high school into college into adulthood what are some of the books that you read                     Oh gee         Um         Can we turn that off while I think         One in particular I read while in college that we just howled over and that was Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger         Um Peyton Place was had um kind of a fascination because I was at summer camp in NH near Gilmanton Iron Works where that woman the author lived         So that was such a racy and shocking book at that time and so of course we had to read it         I I liked uh oh gosh go ahead Dave youve got                     Well I remember another book that you read that that I didnt read but that uh painting was made                      Oh Ayn Rand         Yeah um                     And I remember that being appearing to be so far in the future                     Atlas Shrugged         Oh yes and George Orwell books I read uh uh um  and whats the other one         Animal Farm and they yeah it was so far in the future and my gosh now its the past         Whew                     Into adulthood what books do you like now                     I like uh political nonfiction and Ive read The Making of the President series from  on up         I I like uh uh those kinds of things that talk about why people do what they do when theyre in positions of political power or aspiring to positions of political power         I also like to read things about the Civil War                     Ive read all the the lawyer books Grisham and Turow and a lot of the um current uh writers novelists         Um oh gosh Anita Shrever is one um Rosamunde Pilcher Maeve Binchy um I like all of that type of reading                     Have you ever read any books from foreign authors         Somebody who obviously that English was not their first language but they wrote a book                     Um Im sure I have I just cant think of what         Um I just cant think of what one         You know what         I should have remembered back as a freshmen I read An American Tragedy         And and years later we ended up living in the place where that took place and the uh and it was not something that was uh not a subject that people liked to talk about because many of the people in town knew the young man who was charged with that murder         And so that was really interesting uh in retrospect                     I cant remember reading anything foreign authors         As I say American political nonfiction doesnt exactly lend itself to that                     Dostoevsky         I mean Im sure I have read I just cant even remember what Dr Zhivago I read that                     Did you notice any differences between an American writer and someone of foreign descent                     Oh well the cultural differences would come through in the writing yeah sure         Um I wish I could think more         I just cant remember         Go ahead                     Well Im going to ask a final question that um I mean youre my parents and you imparted a lot of uh a lot of the love of reading to me         Uh how important it was to read and were all English majors I think that has something to do with it my brother sister and I are all were all English majors in college         So what I am going to ask you is what was your philosophy behind that         Why is reading so important                     I cant imagine not reading         Reading is the basis of all learning         I cant imagine not reading and for pure enjoyment and uh for growth broadening your knowledge base         Um reading is fundamental as they say and it truly is         What a sad thing if people cant read         If I had if I was retired I would definitely be working in aliteracy um you know volunteer literacy capacity         I think its so important         Its such a handicap not to read                     I think uh that intellectual stimulation is very important I think thinking is very important I think reading is a part of that         And I uh too often much too often see people um feeling superior somehow because they dont read they dont think they dont experience other ideas         And so uh those things come about through the work of reading rather than through listening to some person on the street corner or uh gazing on TV                     Well thank you for being part of this study                     Our pleasure                     Thank you
