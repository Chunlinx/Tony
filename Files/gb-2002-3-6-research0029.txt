                    Background        The scientific community has recently witnessed the        publication of several large eukaryotic genomes in various        stages of completion including the human genome           the nematode         Caenorhabditis elegans   the        fruit fly         Drosophila melanogaster   and the        model plant         Arabidopsis thaliana    Each of        these genomes contains over  genes and as scientists        attempt to study these genes more closely the need for        accurate gene models becomes increasingly apparent For        highthroughput genome sequencing projects equally rapid        highthroughput genome annotation is necessary and        bioinformaticists use a variety of computational methods to        generate this annotation Despite many improvements in        recent years these computational methods still fall short        of producing correct models for every gene In order to        improve the annotation and facilitate further research it        is essential that we develop methods to identify genes        correctly        Annotation of a gene model should include a precise        description of where the genomic DNA sequence is        transcribed into messenger RNA the positions in the mRNA        of any and all introns and the translated protein sequence        of the gene If alternative splice variants are present        these should be annotated as well Computational methods        for genome annotation have several shortcomings that result        in the following errors in annotation        Gene prediction programs predict exon boundaries        correctly only about  of the time even for the most        intensively studied organisms     Thus a gene with        five exons will be completely correct only    of        the time and genes with more exons will be even less        likely to be correct Gene prediction programs also tend to        merge and split gene models Thus two real genes may be        merged into one predicted transcript or vice versa In        addition programs to align genomic DNA to protein        sequences often miss small exons especially when the        homologous proteins are not well conserved Annotation        protocols also tend to miss short genes For example        recent work has shown that at least one large family of         Arabidopsis genes encodes a short         amino acid protein similar to a secreted        polypeptide ligand for a receptorlike kinase that        functions in meristems   Most of these were missed in        the original automated annotation of the         Arabidopsis genome Alignment        programs also make mistakes when genes occur in tandemly        repeated copies Finally alignment of protein sequence to        genomic DNA cannot predict untranslated regions UTRs and        the leading         ab initio gene prediction programs        Genscan   GlimmerM   GenemarkHMM   have        great difficulty predicting UTRs most of them predict only        the coding portion of a transcript        The solution to many of these problems is to identify        the complete sequence of the transcribed portions of the        genome Sequencing the mature transcripts spliced mRNA        solves three major problems first it permits accurate        identification of the  and  UTRs Second in        conjunction with complete genomic sequence it enables        alignment software to identify the precise locations of all        introns Third it aids in the discovery of new genes                    Results and discussion                  Reannotation of the Arabidopsisgenome          The alignments generated from the cDNA sequences were          used to create new gene models for the corresponding          genes in the           A thaliana genome Many of the          genes have been manually curated but many others were          created by automated scripts    Manual curation is          still ongoing          We used the cDNA alignments to create new gene models          automatically according to the following criteria As          described above there were  cDNAs for which all          alignment programs agreed on the positions of all          introns Using a majority voting scheme for the remaining           cDNAs did not always give a correct answer as          discussed above therefore we used these only after          manual inspection We assume the proteincoding region is          the longest ORF on the forward strand and required it to          span at least  of the cDNA length This allowed us to          create  gene models automatically leaving  cDNAs          that were inspected manually to determine if they          represent RNA genes pseudogenes or other types of          sequence In one case cDNA Ceres  the          proteincoding region was actually on the opposite          strand corresponding to expressed protein Atg and          Ceres  matched the correct strand supporting the          gene annotation This could be explained in several          ways as an example of antisensemediated translational          control as two separate proteins on opposite strands          perhaps expressed in different cell types or simply          erroneous data In most of the other cases the          problematic cDNA is either an RNA gene or a likely          pseudogene          Using the alignments from the  gene models we          updated the annotation of the genome and evaluated how          this had changed the previous annotation For the vast          majority of genes  and  UTRs had not been annotated          previously and these were added with the incorporaton of          the cDNA data More interesting is how the proteincoding          regions changed Of the gene models  contained          identical proteincoding regions to what had already been          annotated and required only UTR refinements but           were adjusted yielding more accurate protein sequences          Some of these contain very short microexons that are          usually missed by           ab initio gene prediction programs          Perhaps most significant was the addition of           completely novel genes not previously included in the           Arabidopsis genome annotation Of          the  novel genes  have significant homology to          known proteins and the rest do not match any previously          described proteins In summary we found that  of the          matching gene models further validated the existing          exonintron structure for the gene  needed to be          corrected and  represented previously undiscovered          genes                          Microexons          We also used the cDNA alignments to detect          microexons very short exons that are typically missed          by both genefinding programs and alignment algorithms          Using new software protocols we developed we found           microexons ranging from  to  base pairs bp in          length distributed evenly across all five          chromosomes          To find microexons we analyzed the results of sim          alignments using all  Ceres cDNAs Sim identified           cDNAs encoding exons of  bp or less In an effort to          identify additional microexons sim alignments          containing imperfect intronexon boundaries were          examined We selected only those cases with nearperfect          alignments requiring that all but one or two exons have           identity We then checked to see if the  exons          with slightly lower identity were misaligned as the          result of the presence of a small undetected exon We          used the  bp segments at the boundaries of the exon as          probes If these  bp probes mismatched in the original          alignment we searched the adjacent intron that is the          intron identified by the initial alignment for short          exons that would produce a perfect match with the cDNA          We also required that any new exon would generate introns          with a standard GTAG consensus on either end This          procedure therefore yielded valid exonintron structures          that always improved the identity of the alignment          between cDNA and genomic DNA Figure shows an example of          the cDNA alignments before and after inserting a          microexon          Using this method we were able to identify           additional microexons all shorter than  bp An          extraordinarily short exon of only  bp was identified          corresponding to exon  of diseaseresistance gene           RAR Atg A listing of          these microexons from all chromosomes is shown in Table           Note that in some cases the length of the microexons          is not a multiple of three for these one of the          preceding or following exons had its boundary realigned          to maintain the reading frame In comparison to the other          alignment programs examined GeneSeqer proved to be          highly competent in identifying microexons  of the           microexons were identified by GeneSeqer using the          default settings After lowering the minimum exon length          cutoff to  bp all  were identified          One indication that these microexons are correct in          addition to the identity with the cDNA is that many of          them are homologous to exons in other           Arabidopsis genes For example a          search of GenBank in late  revealed that the          microexon of Ceres  is homologous to exons from          five different cDNAs accession numbers gi           gi gi gi and gi          The consensus sequence of these exons ATCCTAATCG has          been previously characterized as a microexon in the          potato invertase gene                            Splicing anomalies          Analysis of cDNA sequences can help to estimate the          frequency of alternative splicing in a species          Alternative splicing appears to be relatively common in          animals    in plants this phenomenon has been          less frequently observed possibly as a result of the          smaller collections of ESTs compared with mammalian          systems Recently some reports have appeared documenting          a small number of cases    We examined the          alignments of cDNAs to the genome looking for examples          where more than one cDNA aligned to overlapping locations          on the same chromosome in such a way as to predict a          different splicing pattern The working hypothesis was          that if two cDNAs mapped to the same locus but presented          distinct sets of exons this would constitute evidence of          alternative splicing or possibly another type of          splicing anomaly We broadened the search for splicing          anomalies by including in this protocol all the complete          cDNAs available from GenBank including the Institute for          Physical and Chemical Research RIKEN collection          described below A total of  Ceres transcripts          overlapped another transcript of which  overlapped          a sequence from the RIKEN set          This protocol identified  genes with apparent          splicing anomalies each of which was inspected manually          They fall into many different classes representing          different genetic events as follows  alignments          indicate an alternative  acceptor site for an intron           alignments indicate an alternative  donor site for          an intron  alignments indicate that one or more          introns remained unspliced In some cases more than one          intron was unspliced for example in one interesting          case only one intron was spliced in the RIKEN transcript          gi  whereas four introns were spliced from          the corresponding Ceres transcript Ceres          corresponding to gene Atg These unspliced          transcripts may arise from nuclear rather than mature          cytoplasmic mRNA sequences Six alignments indicate that          an internal exon is missing in one isoform presumably          the adjacent introns are spliced as a single intron          containing the exon sequence Fiftyseven alignments          suggest possible alternative transcription initiation          sites For  of these transcripts the putative          initiation site was shifted far enough in the           direction to move past the first donor site making it          impossible to splice out the first intron producing an          additional  exon in one of the transcripts Many of the          other transcripts contained one or more additional           exons as a result of alternative initiation sites          Thirteen alignments suggest alternative           polyadenylation polyA sites that affect splicing The          prediction of polyA sites can be confounded by          misannealing of the oligodT primers used for reverse          transcription for example the presence of multiple          adenines within the  UTR can be mistaken for a polyA          site Misannealing cannot explain the presence of          unspliced intronic sequence found at the terminus of           of these  transcripts suggesting that these putative          polyA sites are genuine and have an impact on splicing          We have found similar evidence for the occurrence of          multiple polyA sites in RACEPCR experiments directed          at cloning cDNAs from hypothetical genes Finally           alignments display multiple splicing anomalies falling          into more than one of the categories above          Table lists many of these alternatively spliced          genes the complete list with graphical and textual          alignment data is available online   and is also          provided as Additional data with this paper online          Figure highlights several interesting examples In          Figure a the alternative  splice site on the second          intron leads to a shift in the reading frame producing a          different protein sequence In Figure b alignments of          several cDNAs indicate that the last intron is unspliced          Figure cshows that different  ends lead to differing           introns and exons while not changing the protein          sequence in this particular example Figure dshows a          centrally located exon that is spliced out along with the          surrounding introns Figure econtains three different           transcription start sites three different  termination          sites and two unspliced introns in the middle          transcript The unspliced introns occur within exon  of          GI which corresponds to three exons and two          introns in both the other transcripts Note that some of          the alternative splicing events occur within the same          ecotype          Neither collection of cDNAs can be considered a random          sample of transcripts and therefore the number of          examples of alternative splicing discovered in this data          approximately  of the overlapping transcripts should          not be used to extrapolate to the entire genome The          discovery of transcripts with different introns spliced          out raises the question of whether the different spliced          products are translated and whether the splicing          differences reflect programmed developmental variation or          simply splicing errors It is not possible to answer          these questions now but incomplete splicing and          consequential variants in plants have been noted          previously to be associated with gene silencing and were          postulated to reflect the regulated production of          aberrant RNA products not destined to be translated            One clear conclusion is that alternative splicing          can be discovered via analysis of cDNAs and genomic          sequence and that a fuller collection of cDNAs will          provide a valuable resource for more discoveries about          splicing and gene regulation                          Are the sequences fulllength          An independent project to sequence complete           Arabidopsis cDNAs is ongoing by the          SPP consortium   using clones created by K          Shinozaki at RIKEN in Japan These sequences are publicly          available from GenBank search for RIKEN cDNA          Arabidopsis These data provided the opportunity to          compare the two sets of cDNAs and measure independently          how many of them appear to cover the entire length of the          predicted mRNA transcript The sequencing of the RIKEN          cDNAs generated  sequences as of October  we          compared these to the  cDNAs from Ceres and found           sequences that are contained in both data sets Of          the  sequences  alignments yield the same          exonintron structure for the underlying gene We then          asked for each of the sequences containing identical          introns do the  and  ends match and if not how          large is the difference The results are illustrated in          Figure           Several observations can be made about these results          First it is important to note that the Ceres clones were          selected for fulllength sequencing from among a large          number of clustered  sequences see Materials and          methods whereas the RIKEN clones were sequenced on the           end followed by clustering and selection of a clone          for sequencing   The methods for creating the          fulllength cDNA sequences at both centers involve          multiple sequencing runs followed by assembly of the          overlapping sequences Second we observed that in the          Ceres data many mRNAs appeared to have two or more          putative alternative transcription start sites This          became apparent when different cDNA assemblies were found          to overlap exactly except for an extension on the  end          on one or more clones It is interesting to note that          when the RIKEN clones were longer or shorter on the           end clones of the equivalent length could often be found          in the Ceres collection Multiple clones with the same           end provided strong validation that these were truly          representative of alternative transcription initiation          sites or repeatable artifacts of the cloning process          Overall there were  Ceres clones that were   bp          longer on the  end and  RIKEN clones that were          longer on the  end If alternative transcription          initiation is the correct explanation then it is          relatively common It is worth noting that in almost all          cases both alternative cDNAs contain complete ORFs          On the  end the Ceres and RIKEN databases each          contained  sequences that were  bp longer than          their match from the other set If these represent          alternative polyadenylation sites or stabilized ends of          RNA that get polyadenylated then these are quite common          Further investigation will be necessary to determine if          the  end of transcripts truly varies at such a high          frequency          In summary work described in this study on           Arabidopsis illustrates the utility          of fulllength cDNAs for finding alternative splice          variants short exons UTRs short genes and alternative          transcription start sites The annotation of eukaryotic          genomes is currently an inexact and developing science          and the results described here demonstrate the power of          fulllength cDNA sequences for improving the quality of          multiple aspects of genome annotation                            Materials and methods                  Preparation and sequencing of cDNA          Starting material for cDNA synthesis was polysomal RNA          isolated from the topmost inflorescence tissues ecotype          Wassilewskija and from roots ecotype Landsberg erecta          RNA from roots of Landsberg erecta was used to construct          the libaries because of the availability of highquality          RNA Nine parts inflorescence to one part root as          measured by wet mass was used to make three          sizefractionated libraries Because the ecotypes were          mixed before library construction we cannot determine          the source ecotype for any individual cDNA Polysomal RNA          was isolated from a detergentgenerated supernatant on a           M sucrose cushion To capture fulllength cDNAs an          oligonucleotide is first attached to intact  ends          taking advantage of the cap After first and          secondstrand synthesis the fulllength cDNAs were          selected size fractionated and cloned into pBluescript          The ligation mixture was transformed into bacteria          selected on appropriate antibiotics and picked into          well microtiter plates In repeated rounds of          sequencing several tens of thousands of clones from the          three libraries were sequenced from the  end the          sequences clustered and the clone with the longest           end in each cluster selected for complete sequencing          The number of clones sequenced in each round depended          on the percentage of new fulllength clones that could be          obtained from each of the sizefractionated libraries As          the clones reported in this study came from          nonnormalized libraries only three rounds of           sequencing were employed  in the first round           in the second round and  in the final round          Following each round of  sequencing all sequences were          clustered using a clustering algorithm that forms          separate clusters if there are more than  nucleotide          differences in any nucleotide window of the match In          this way clones would not fall into separate clusters          simply because of ecotypic differences different          putative transcription start sites or sequencing errors          However they would cluster separately if alternative          splicing occurred in the first approximately           nucleotides and involved more than  nucleotides          Following clustering the clone that was longest on the           end was selected for fulllength sequencing If clones          were of comparable length on the  end the clone to be          sequenced was selected from the library with the highest          percentage of fulllength clones Sequencing of  ends          was performed on capillary sequencers Molecular          Dynamics fulllength sequencing was done on ABI          sequencers using primer walking The  clones          analyzed in this study were selected from all fulllength          clones based on length   nucleotides          nonredundancy eliminating alternatively spliced          clones and length of the putative ORF relative to          overall clone length                          Alignment of cDNA sequences to the A          thalianagenome          Four programs were used to align all  Ceres cDNA          sequences to the           A thaliana genome as follows          First each program was used to align each cDNA sequence          to the genome Some programs cannot efficiently handle a          search comparing a cDNA to a   Mb eukaryotic          chromosome and to compensate for those programs we          created a modified procedure that first used BLASTN to          identify and extract a region of  bp surrounding          the gene Each cDNA was aligned to the corresponding           kb genome sequence segment using all four programs with          default parameter settings The resulting alignments were          then compared automatically to generate the comparison          data appearing in the main text The programs are sim          available from   ddsgap available from            GeneSeqer available from   and estgenome          available from            Gene models were constructed by first recreating the          cDNA sequence using the           Arabidopsis genome sequence          employing the longest alignment for which all programs          predicted identical splice sites The longest ORF was          identified along the forward strand of the cDNA followed          by a division of the ORF into proteincoding exon          segments and untranslated regions of exons These          constructed gene models were then compared to the          existing gene annotation at the mapped genomic region          Previously annotated gene structures that disagreed with          the cDNAs were replaced by the cDNA alignmentbased gene          models and new gene models were created where          preexisting gene annotations were lacking                            Additional data files        Additional data corresponding to anomalous splicing
