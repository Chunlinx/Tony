Local Attorneys Lend a Free HandJane D AlbrittonUpon admission to the bar every Colorado lawyer must recite theLawyers Oath which states in part I will never reject from anyconsideration personal to myself the cause of the defenseless orthe oppressed To that end attorneys are expected although notrequired to contribute  hours a year pro bono  free  for thecommon goodHowever the  Report of the Legal ServicesPre BonoCommittee of the Judicial Advisory Council found that the abilityof low and middleincome Coloradans to obtain equal access to thelegal system has been limited by the number of lawyers availableand willing to serve them and by the growing complexity of thelawThe law in Northern Colorado remains as complex as it isanywhere else but the willingness of attorneys to take on pro bonowork in defense of the defenseless or oppressed appears to beexemplaryGenerally speaking there are three routes to equal access forthose who cannot afford legal counsel the public defenders officefor criminal cases legal services federally funded and thelocal bar associations that coordinate pro bono work Both legalservices and the bar associations complement each other in waysthat provide a fairly broad net of support Despite the populationgrowth in the area and the uneasiness in the economy theresilience of this net has proven remarkably strongThe advantage of our program is its predictability said AmyRosenberg chair of the Pro Bono Project for Larimer County EveryWednesday we have review and intake in Fort Collins everyThursday we have review and intake in Loveland It is always atthe same time and in the same placeLong history in LarimerThe work by the Larimer County Bar Association has been going onfor  years and in that time several thousand clients have beenserved During the week period between June  and May  individuals came through intake in Fort Collins Of those got the advice they needed and  received attorney referrals InLoveland  were assigned attorneysRosenberg explained that the Pro Bono Project does not take oncriminal cases bankruptcies dependent or neglected children orfee generating cases such as personal injuryIn personalinjury cases an attorney can work for acontingency fee she said Most of our cases involve domesticlaw This is an area where we have seen an increase in a need forhelpIn addition to the referrals made through the bar associationLarimer County conducts bar clinics and classesOnce a month I instruct a divorce class and every other monthI teach a class in parental responsibility custody or the singleparent said Kris Merkel pro bono and legalaid coordinator forthe Larimer County Bar Association We provide all the forms andteach people who come how to handle the process pro se on theirownMerkel has noticed that there has been an increase over the pastyear in domestic cases She attributes part of this increase to thefact that people have been moving to Colorado in hopes of findingthe promised land as outlined in Money Magazine What they havefound instead is a minimumwage job market and outofsight realestate prices To make matters worse the economy hasflattenedWhen the economy goes bad families that are already strugglingtend to fall apart she observedFederally funded legal services in both Larimer and Weldcounties have also felt the pressure of increased domesticdissolutionMario Rivera managing attorney in the Greeley office notedthat his staff of six has handled  more cases in  than inThe highest number of cases for us are domestic he saidGiven our resources we can only handle the most pressing casessuch as restraining orders We are also being inundated bybankruptcies but in those cases we can only take on cases ofworkers whose wages are being garnished and who cant take care oftheir basic needs with what they have leftRivera pointed out that helping clients many of whom are notnative English speakers becomes problematic as demands increaseand funding to the Legal Services Corp remains stagnantThe Reagan administration cut back funding by a third in and then the Contract with America cut funds again he said Sowe continue to work with a budget that is twothirds of what itwasDavid Bye Riveras counterpart in Larimer County works with astaff of seven He faces the ongoing quandary of seeing a need formore outreach in the community but lacking the resources toimplement itIf it had not been for Warren Rudman RNew Hampshire theLegal Services Corp might have disappeared altogether Bye saidAs it is we are restricted in how we can proceed We cannot bringclassaction suits and we cannot ask for attorneys fees when wewin a case Those restrictions take a big bite out of ourpowerWork often challengingBoth Rivera and Bye added that despite the pinch in federalsupport the generosity of their local bar associations and theLegal Aid Foundation keep the neediest in Northern Coloradowellrepresented But representing this group a group that oftenlacks education and legal sophistication can challenge even themostdedicated attorney Some clients have no phone and no otheraddress but the one at the shelterMany of those who come to us do not understand the implicationsof communications from the court said Rosenberg So by the timewe get the case it is a crisis Sometimes it is difficult to talkto a client directly The attorneys who take on these cases oftendo so on extremely short noticeShe also noted that while an attorney might be taking on a casepro bono the implications of handling the case poorly remainconstantIf you handle the case wrong you are exposed for damages shesaid And once youre on a case you stay on unless you can getthe courts permission to withdraw Very few realize what a serviceattorneys volunteer to the communityIn part grants from the Colorado Lawyers Trust AccountFoundation defray some of the costs associated with maintaining astrong pro bono program These funds cover the salary of theparalegal coordinator Kris Markel in Larimer County telephonesoffice supplies and malpractice insuranceThe work that our attorneys do is remarkable said RosenbergSometimes our clients are not the most agreeable in the worldbut this year when I put out forms asking for pro bono work theystarted coming back by fax almost immediatelyWhile the will to assist the low income population has notabated in Northern Colorado those involved with federally fundedlegal services must wait to see who President Bush appoints to theboard of the Legal Services Corp And they hope the spirit ofWarren Rudman will prevail
