paper oak leaves acorns andno kiddingokraThe only thing Martha has not gilded is the lily But wait till its back inseason            Martha has proved thatalchemy is not impossible Brush enough gold paint on enough flora andeventually youll make real gold Tuesdays initial public offering for MarthaStewart Living OmnimediaOmnimedia has there ever been a more perfectnamekilled on Wall Street rising from  to  before settling at She arrived at the stock exchange that morning toting a tray of brioches Sheleft that evening holding  billion in stock not dough Investors boughta brilliant company Omnimediaa Web site mailorder operation two TV showstwo magazines Kmart partnership and  booksnetted  million last yearfrom the gospel of Martha Kmart sold more than  million worth ofMarthabranded products in  Her  decision to divorce Time Warner andgo soloa split that cost her more than  millionhas never lookedbetter            What was missing from Marthas IPO was the sniping andmockery that has dogged all of her ventures Traditionally Martha has beenbattered by three criticisms First she is simply ludicrous You could notimagine better comic material than her ideas of living the midnight omeletdinner for  the fruit baskets the size of a Chevy the advice in thismonths magazine to make your own envelopes out of wood veneer folding themwith a bone knife Parodies barely exaggerate when they imagine Martha turningwater into wine a lovely Merlot or manufacturing condoms from her own lambA second and more thoughtful batch of critics has charged her with encouragingclass division promoting soulless domestic conformism and undermining workingwomen by making them feel domestically inadequate            The final criticism hasbeen personal As her unauthorized biography Just Desserts  contendsMartha is an icy horrible person who abused her now ex husband ignores herdaughter belittles her mother sues her gardener for pennies plagiarizesrecipes from better cooks and humiliates her staff Her fabled Rememberingcolumns are a hash of bunkum and hyperbole The persona she cultivatesthewarm welcoming hostess with a closeknit familyis a fraud            These criticisms have subsided partly because of Americasculture of financial idolatry Anyone whos worth a billion on paper is worthsucking up to Martha is benefiting from parody fatigue as well She has been afigure of fun since Entertaining was published in  so all the jokesare old And the vitality of the economy is inoculating her Fripperies thatseemed obscene during the early s recession are quite modest by thestandards of             But the critical silencemay also represent a longoverdue recognition that Martha is as she would saya Good Thing In a Tuesday TV interview she called herself a teacher  Weare offering information highquality wellresearched howto informationThat is a fair description What she does is not silly at all or at least nomore silly than most advice magazines Her magazines and TV shows retain justenough nonsense to make them irksome sew your own pashmina from homeraisedllamas and the like but she supplies valuable instruction about the mundanetasks of life Martha Stewart Living may be the most useful magazinethis side of Consumer Reports  This months issue for example offersexcellent advice about making spicy popcorn snacks cleaning ovens and storingrugs and china among other subjects Her weekly CBS morning segment packs morehelpful cooking information into six minutes than most cooking shows do in anhour It is not false consciousness that makes tens of millions of peoplefollow Martha every month It is her good advice            But the great achievement of Marthas domestic gospel isnot practical but moral She has a puritanical sensibility She believes in theuplifting power of work She instructs you so that you will know how to createobjects yourself  grow plants yourself  learn home repairyourself  cook food yourself  Doing something well is good andliberating and fulfilling It strengthens friendships and families When I sawher making waffles the other day it made me want to make waffles this SundayIf I make waffles on Sunday I will invite the downstairs neighbors up to eatthem and that is undoubtedly a Good Thing            Martha practicesmaterialism but not consumerism She believes rightly that it makesyou wiser and happier to cook your own applesauce than to buy it Well you maysay its easy for her to make homemade applesauce Thats her job But she didit when it wasnt her job too Even if most viewers rarely practice anythingMartha preachesshe calls such slackers Martha Dreamers as opposed toMartha Doersshe is still a worthy goad            Her DIY credo makes Martha democratically snobbish Shehews to a countryhouse sensibility but anyone can follow it Itdoesnt cost much because you do it yourself If a middleclass Polish girllike Martha can blossom into an affected Breckgirl fauxWASP you cantoo            The final and mostimportant reason Martha is escaping criticism is that Martha Stewart theperson has been separated from Martha Stewart the brand The principal topic ofdiscussion about the Martha Stewart Living IPO was Martha Stewarts deathAnalysts speculated what would happen to Omnimedia if Martha were hit by a busor cab or succumbed to an accident in the potting shed as the New YorkObserver s Christopher Byron nicely put it There were two answersFirst the company has bought a  million lifeinsurance policy on herSecond Martha Stewart the brand can survive without Martha Stewart the personas Ralph Lauren the brand survives without Ralph Lauren selling every shirtMartha does not appear at all in the current issue of Living  Thezooming stock price is evidence that Wall Street can distinguish Martha fromher product            We should do the same Critics have savaged her fraudulentpersona and monomaniacal perfectionism for a long time There is a subtlesexism in that The female domestic tycoon is obliged to behave better than theguys This is why Oprahs private life is examined more carefully than DavidLettermans            Fortunately commerce has trumped personalityMartha is finally being treated as the CEO of a company called Omnimedia notas a bitchy hausfrau In the age of the divine entrepreneur no one cares howbadly you treat your kid We admire perfectionist monomania in Internettycoons so why not in Martha Politicians get away with advertising bogusfamily bliss Martha should too On television Martha shows us how to make aromantic dinner for the husband she doesnt have host a party for the kids shedoesnt like bake muffins for the neighbors who hate her But those are hertragedies not our business or Wall Streets The muffins are still tastyand thats what matters
