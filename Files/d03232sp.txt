December GAOs Agency ProtocolslmnoAGAOSP United States General Accounting OfficeWashington DC December  This document contains GAOs Agency Protocols that we arelaunching in a pilot phase starting in December  Theseprotocols are intended to govern the US General AccountingOffices GAO work with executive branch agencies and to provideclearly defined and transparent policies and practices on how GAOwill interact with agencies in the performance of its work As youknow GAO supports the Congress in meeting its constitutionalresponsibilities and strives to help improve the performance andaccountability of the federal government for the benefit of theAmerican people While GAOs primary client is the Congress weseek to maintain constructive working relationships with theexecutive branch conduct our work in a professional objectiveand nonpartisan manner and help improve government In fact thevast majority of GAOs recommendations are addressed to executivebranch officials for action I firmly believe these protocols willhelp to ensure the consistency fairness and effectiveness ofGAOs interactions with the agencies and thereby enable GAO tobetter serve the Congress and the American peopleWe provided an opportunity for  federal departments agenciesand entities subsequently referred to as agencies including allof the agencies with presidentially appointed chief financialofficers and the Presidents Council on Integrity and Efficiencyto comment on a draft of the protocols The majority of theagencies that responded appreciated GAOs initiative to develop theprotocols and said that they were comprehensive and provided aframework for meaningful communication We received and consideredmore than  comments the majority of which we addressed Many ofthe comments sought clarification of what we expected of theagencies and what they could expect from GAO For example we wereasked to clarify communication procedures between GAO and theagencies associated with meetings agency comments andrecommendation followup The protocols have been revised in thoseareas to reflect the followingFor agencies that designate a central GAO liaison wewill communicate to the agency liaison when executivelevelmeetings are scheduled provide the liaison with a notificationletter and coordinate the entrance exit and agency commentmeetings with the liaisonTo the extent possible at the entrance conference GAOwill provide the agency with an estimate of how long the work willtakeTo the extent appropriate GAO staff will hold a closeoutmeeting at field locations with agency officials who areresponsible for the operations of the field location and the worksobjectivesThe purpose of the exit conference is to confirm that thecritical facts and key information used to formulate GAOs analysesand findings are current correct and complete This informationmay be provided in writing However GAO did not revise theprotocols to require that such written material be provided Adraft of the written report is provided subsequent to the exitconference when agency comments are solicitedIn keeping with GAOs values of being fair and balancedin its work with all agencies GAO has articulated its criteria fordetermining the amount of time available for agency comments onGAOs products In addition the protocols have been revised torecognize that in using these criteria GAO will generally give anagency from  to  calendar days to comment on a report The exacttime will vary depending on the nature of the engagement and theneeds of the Congress Recommendation followup is a shared GAO and agencyresponsibility The revised protocols describe GAOs implementationof this process in further detail including how toward the end ofthe fiscal year special attention is directed to theidentification of recommendations that are still openIn addition to seeking clarification of various operationalissues some agencies raised questions concerning the statements ofour audit and access authorities cited in the protocols Weprovided additional references in some areas to clarify ourposition However a few of the issues raised by the agencies arethe subject of litigation Walker v Cheney No CVDDC filed February   therefore we made no changespending the outcome of that litigationI look forward to pilot testing these protocols from December  and lasting through June   After this phase we willmake any needed refinements based on feedback received and finalizethe protocols I along with members of the GAO team look forwardto using these protocols to continue to serve the Congress and theAmerican people while maintaining a professional constructiveworking relationship with the federal departments agencies andother entities that are stakeholders in GAOs work Questions orcomments about GAOs Agency Protocols may be directed to Mr GeneL Dodaro Chief Operating Officer at   or via emailat AgencyProtocolsgaogovDavid M Walker Comptroller General of the United StatesContentsLetterGAOs Agency ProtocolsGAOs Agency ProtocolsPrefaceThis document contains the protocols governing theUS General Accounting Offices GAO work at federaldepartments agencies and entities subsequently referred to inthis document as agencies The protocols are the generalprinciples governing GAOs relationships with federal agencies whenGAO conducts its work eg financial audits program reviewsevaluations analyses and investigations at these agencies Theyare intended to enhance GAOs working relationships with agenciesby building on practices that have proved successful in the pastand by establishing a framework that will supersede priorarrangements with the agenciesThe purpose of these protocols is to set forth clearly definedand transparent policies and practices on how GAO carries out itswork at these agencies The protocols identify what the agenciescan expect from GAO and what GAO expects of the agencies They areexpected to cover most situations that arise during the course ofGAOs work Furthermore the protocols will help to ensure theconsistency fairness and effectiveness of interactions betweenGAO and the agencies with which it works The protocols reflect theframework of GAOs engagement and audit activities Theseactivities include communication between GAO and the agenciesinteractions during the course of GAOs work and followup onGAOs recommendations GAO follows modified protocols in workleading up to congressional testimony and during investigations offraud abuse or misconduct conducted by its Office of SpecialInvestigations These modified protocols are articulated in thesections of this document entitled Testimony and Office of SpecialInvestigationsThese protocols are not applicable to the work GAO conducts insupport of its legal opinions and decisions GAOs General Counselissues legal opinions in response to requests from the Congress andits committees GAO also has statutory authority to renderdecisions on matters such as bid protests and the availability anduse of appropriated funds Further information about this work canbe found in Bid Protests at GAO A Descriptive Guide and Principlesof Federal Appropriations Law Volumes I II III IV which areavailable on GAOs Web site wwwgaogovIn addition these protocols are not meant to govern GAOsrelationship with the federal Inspectors General IG communityGAO and agency IGs are all part of the accountability communitytherefore the relationships between GAO and agency IGs areconsidered additional to and separate from these protocols GAO andIG interactions are intended to underscore a constructive workingrelationship that effectively leverages resources builds a mutualknowledge base and maximizes the oversight of federal programsoffices and activities For example GAO relies on the work of theIGs and other auditors to meet the requirements of the ChiefFinancial Officers CFO Act for audited financial statementsThrough successful working relationships between GAO and the IGsagencies have consistently met the CFO requirements Also throughthe IGs active participation in the Comptroller Generals AdvisoryCouncil on Government Auditing Standards the Domestic WorkingGroup and the activities of the Intergovernmental Audit ForumsGAO and the IGs share information identify emerging issues andachieve broad coordination Furthermore at agencies where GAO hasa substantial ongoing audit presence as a professional courtesyGAO meets periodically with representatives of the agencys Officeof Inspector General to  coordinate work between GAO and theOffice of Inspector General  achieve efficiencies and minimizeduplication and  identify specific issues that might benefitfrom a collaborative effort between GAO and the Office of InspectorGeneralGAOs Mission GAO examines the use of public funds evaluatesfederal programs and activities and provides analyses optionsrecommendations and other assistance to help the Congress makeeffective oversight policy and funding decisions In thiscontext GAO works to continuously improve the economy efficiencyand effectiveness of the federal government through the conduct offinancial audits program reviews evaluations analyses legalopinions investigations and other services GAOs activities aredesigned to ensure the executive branchs accountability to theCongress under the Constitution and the federal governmentsaccountability to the American peopleGAO supports congressional oversight in several ways Forexample it oversees government operations through financial and othermanagement audits to determine whether public funds are being spentefficiently effectively and in accordance with applicablelawsevaluates federal policies and the performance ofagencies and programs to determine how well they areworkinganalyzes financing for government activitiesconducts analyses to assess needed actions and theimplications of proposed actionsconducts investigations to assess whether illegal orimproper activities are occurring andprovides legal opinions to determine whether agencies arein compliance with laws and regulationsFurther information about the general principles governing

including as factsand circumstances warrant meetings between GAOs ComptrollerGeneral or Chief Operating Officer and the heads of agencies ortheir designees at the presidential appointee with Senateconfirmation PAS level to discuss areas of mutual interest andconcernOther forms of communication include periodic meetings with anagencys leadership and executives and specific communications withan agency pertaining to planned and ongoing work SpecificallyAt least annually at agencies where GAO has asubstantial ongoing audit presence GAO senior executives andleaders responsible for managing and coordinating GAOs workgenerally known as GAOs agency executive liaisons will meet withagencydesignated senior executives such as an Assistant Secretaryfor Administration an Associate Administrator for ManagementSystems or an Assistant Secretary for a particular program Theseexecutivelevel meetings will help build an understanding of keyand emerging issues provide an opportunity to discuss GAOs shortand longterm work plans as well as the general workingrelationship between GAO and the agency including the agencys useof GAOs work and facilitate the discussion of issues associatedwith particular work For the agencies that designate a central GAOliaison once an executivelevel meeting has been scheduled as aprofessional courtesy GAO will notify the liaison that the meetinghas been scheduledWhen GAO initiates work at an agency the agency canexpect GAO to designate a primary point of contact who will beavailable throughout the engagement to respond to the agencysrequests for information on the status of work and to any concernsabout the works scope or approach In turn GAO expects the agencyto designate a point of contact who is knowledgeable about theagencys relevant programs and organization and is able tofacilitate GAOs ability to complete its work in a timely mannerFurthermore the agencydesignated central liaison or point ofcontact should be able to among other things set up necessarymeetings suchas entrance exit and agency comment meetingsidentify and ensure that GAO meets with theappropriate agency representatives help resolveproblems and coordinate agency comments on anydraft product that may result from the workIn response to inquiries from agencies not involved in aparticular ongoing review GAO will provide information only aboutthe objectives scope and methodology of the review the source ofthe work ie mandate name of the congressional requesters orlegal authority allowing GAO to undertake work on its owninitiative that is intended to support the Congress and theexpected completion date when known For congressionally requestedwork further information may be shared after consultation with thecongressional requestersNotification of Before beginning any new engagement thatrequires GAO to seek information data or both from anagencyGAO WorkGAO generally notifies the agency of the work to be undertakenHowever when GAO conducts an investigation it does not notify theagency of the work because to do so might jeopardize theinvestigation GAOs modified protocols for investigations aredescribed in detail in the Office of Special Investigations sectionof this document To the extent practical the notice to an agencywill identify theengagement subjectengagements unique identification number ieengagement codesource of the work  objectives or key questions of theworkagencyies and when possible anticipated locationsto be contactedestimated start date for the worktime frame for holding entrance conference between GAOand the agencyGAO team performing the engagement andGAO points of contact name telephone number faxnumber and email addressIf the objectives of the work to be performed changesignificantly or if the location of the work needs to be modifiedGAO will notify the agencydesignated central liaison or primarypoint of contact of these changesGAO will generally provide written notification to the agenciesinvolved in the work electronically in an agreedupon format thatprotects the files from alteration GAO will provide thenotification to the agencydesignated liaison or agencydesignatedpoint of contact If an agency has not designated a centralliaison GAO will provide the notification to the responsibleagency management official In some instances GAO may ask anagency liaison to distribute the notification to the agencysrespective major components In addition if applicable thenotification letter will be accompanied or followed by a notice ofvisit form that includes the appropriate security clearanceinformationFor certain types of work to be performed at an agency GAO mayinitially provide only telephone or email message notificationSuch work includes congressional requests for quickly developed testimony basedon new work  work that is to be completed within a short timeframe and  requests for information on the implementationstatus of recommendations made in issued reports GAOsrecommendation followup process is discussed in detail in theFollowup on GAO Recommendations section of this document When GAOnotifies an agency of work by telephone or email message it willsubsequently provide a notification letter in instancesEntrance Conferencewhen the work is on an issue with widespread nationalimplication or is resource intensiveAn entrance conference is a meeting that GAO holds with agencyofficials at the start of an engagement GAO anticipates that anagency will attempt to arrange for its personnel to be availablefor an entrance conference no later than  calendar days afterreceiving a request for a meeting At the entrance conference GAOwill discuss the  source of the work  roles andresponsibilities of the GAO staff  information needs egdata and access to agency officials  key objectives researchquestions  sites where GAO expects to conduct its work whenknown and  need for any precautions to protect the data andinformation such as special clearances To the extent possibleGAO also will provide the agency with an estimate of how long thework will take During the entrance conference GAO will also askagency officials to designate a key contact to assist asapplicable in obtaining temporary office space in agencies whereGAO does not already have office space as well as fax and telephoneequipment needed for GAO to complete its work at the agency Inaddition GAO staff will request that agency officials identifyknowledgeable agency personnel and discuss the kinds of informationthat would be useful to carry out the works objectives such asavailable studies or electronic filesThe attendance of key agency officialsthose responsible forwork related to GAOs key objectives at the entrance conferenceenhances the opportunity for a substantive exchange of informationIf the review includes work at separate agency field locations orif requested by the agency GAO will consider holding additionalentrance conferences when work is begun at field locationsCloseout Meeting at Field LocationsIn certain cases GAOs work involves crosscuttinggovernmentwide reviews at more than one agency including reviewson such issues as performance management and budgeting Forexample GAOs work on how well agencies are incorporating aresults orientation into their budget decisions and resourceallocation process involves all major agencies For such agovernmentwide review an entrance conference is generally heldwith applicable central agencies such as the Office of Managementand Budget OMB or the Office of Personnel Management Ifrequested GAO will consider either including all of the agenciesunder the review at a single entrance conference or holding aseparate entrance conference with specific agenciesGenerally GAO will not hold an entrance conference in thoseinstances when it is  responding to congressional requests fortestimony based on ongoing or recently completed work performing work that is to be completed within a short time frameand is closely related to ongoing work or  updating theimplementation status of recommendations made in issuedreportsAfter conducting work at a field location to the extentappropriate GAO staff will hold a closeout meeting with agencyofficials who are responsible for the operations of the fieldlocation and have oversight for issues related to the worksobjectives The purpose of the closeout meeting is to ensure thatGAO staff have been provided with a full understanding of theinformation they have gathered at a field location and itsrelevance to the engagements objectives In deciding on whether ornot a closeout meeting will be held GAO will consider thepreferences of the agency officials and whether the work hasinvolved interviews with numerous people over a significant periodof time at that particular locationExit Conference with AgencyAt the closeout meeting GAO staff may discuss the implicationsof the information gathered at that field location Suchdiscussions may identify additional relevant information and thuslead to further data gathering at the location In addition asappropriate the closeout meeting may cover the extent to whichdata and documents were made available and access to relevant fieldofficials was provided Generally work undertaken at individualfield locations provides only locationspecific information thatneeds to be evaluated in the context of findings from otherlocations Therefore GAOs preliminary conclusions orrecommendations are not discussed at the closeout meetingGAO holds an exit conference with an agency after completing itsdata collection and analysis The purpose of the exit conference isto confirm that the critical facts and key information used toformulate GAOs analyses and findings are current correct andcomplete GAO officials responsible for the completion of theengagement will participate in the meeting Agency officials whohave oversight of the issues related to the engagements objectivesare also expected to attend the meeting Written material ifprovided will be used to confirm that the critical facts and keyinformation used to formulate GAOs analyses and findings arecurrent correct and complete Observations preliminaryconclusions and potential recommendations that flow from thefactual information collected may be discussed but are not providedin writingAgency Comments As required by generally accepted governmentauditing standards GAO provides responsible agency officials andother directly affected parties with an opportunity to review andprovide comments on a draft of a report before it is issued Theamount of time available for thePage  GAOSP GAOs Agency Protocolsagency to comment is determined on a factsandcircumstancesbasis However GAO will not seek comments from an agency oraffected party whendisclosure of an investigations results could pose risksto individuals and their confidentiality orpremature disclosure of information could compromise theresults of the work GAO follows modified protocols for workundertaken by its criminal investigators These modified protocolsare described in the section of this document entitled Office ofSpecial InvestigationsIn keeping with its values of being fair and balanced in allits work with all the agencies it reviews GAO when determiningthe amount of time available for comment will consider  thetiming needs of the requesterthe extent to which substantive discussions have alreadybeen held between GAO and the agency  the length of time spenton the engagement and  the amount of resources GAO and theagency have expended to answer the engagements objectives Usingthese criteria GAO will generally give an agency from  to calendar days to comment on a report unless otherwise required bylaw See  USC a for a list of financial institutionsthat by law must receive  days for comment The exact time willvary depending on the nature of the engagement and the needs of theCongress In rare cases the Comptroller General may grant anextension beyond  calendar days if the agency shows that anextension is necessary and will likely result in a more accuratereport See  USC bGAO reserves the right to issue the report to the congressionalrequesters if the comments are not received within the timeallotted In such cases the reason for not including the agencycomments will be stated in the report GAO will usually not solicitagency comments if a report summarizes information from a recentlyissued GAO report In addition testimony statements generally arenot provided to agencies for comment As previously noted GAOfollows modified protocols for testimonies which are describedseparately in the section of this document entitled TestimonyGAO prefers that agencies provide written comments and GAO isrequesting that the written comments be provided electronicallyHowever GAO will accept comments provided in hard copy orally orin an unsigned email message GAO is requesting that the agenciesprovide their written comments electronically in order to complywith Section  of the Rehabilitation Act This act requires thatpersons with disabilities have access to and use of information anddata that are comparable to the access and use provided to personswithout disabilities See  USC d GAOs goal is to provideits products in a format that is compatible with assistivetechnologies such as texttosound screen reader softwareSubmitting an electronic file ensures that an agencys comments areaccurately reproduced in GAOs accessible product format ContactGAOs Director for Publications and Dissemination at  for specific information about how to electronicallytransmit agency comments to GAO Comments on classified orrestricted reports should be transmitted in the manner agreed to byGAO and the agencyGAO expects an agency to provide  a single position on GAOsfindings conclusions and recommendationsincluding a resolutionof disparate agency views if necessaryand  the rationale forany disagreement with GAOs draft report When an agencysdesignated senior official provides oral comments GAO willsummarize these comments and give the designated official anopportunity to respond to GAOs characterization of the agencysposition The GAO senior executive official responsible for thecompletion of the engagement along with the staff thatperformedProcedures for Soliciting Agency Commentsthe work will participate in this meeting In addition forgovernmentwide work GAO will generally request that comments beprovided by the agencyies with whom the entrance conference washeldConsistent with GAOs Congressional Protocols the congressionalrequesters will be notified before a draft report is provided toan agency for comment and will be offered a copy of the draft forinformational purposes when the draft report is provided to theagency for comment Furthermore under  USC b theSenate Governmental Affairs and House Government Reform committeesmay request copies of any draft report generated under GAOs legalauthority to undertake work on its own initiative research anddevelopment work when the draft report is sent to the agency forcomment GAO will advise these committees when such a draft is sentto the agency for commentGAO does not have classification authority for its productsTherefore for those products that contain national security orsensitive information GAO will request that the agency perform areview for this type of information and that the reviews resultsbe communicated in writing to GAO When a product requires aclassification review upon written receipt of the results of theagencys review GAO will notify the congressional requestersthat the agency has completed its classification review Consistentwith GAOs Congressional Protocols GAO will then offer therequesters a draft of the product that is with the agency forcomment Both the agencys classification review and comments onthe product must be completed within the time frame identified inGAOs letter transmitting the draft productGAO transmits most draft reports for comment to agencieselectronically in an agreedupon format that protects the filesfrom alteration GAO will provide the draft report to theagencydesignated liaison or agencydesignated point of contact Ifan agency has not designated a central liaison GAO will providethe notification to the responsible agency management officialClassified or otherwise sensitive draft reports are transmittedthrough other means A transmittal letter accompanies each draftreport to inform recipients of GAOs request for written or oralcomments and the time frame within which the comments are due Thetransmittal letter also states that the draft report is not finalis therefore subject to change and must be safeguarded to preventits transmittal to unauthorized personnel alteration or prematurereleaseDraft GAO products are at risk of being prematurely releasedonce they leave GAOs control In some limited circumstances whenthere is concern that a draft product may be prematurely releasedGAO will take extra precautions in obtaining agency comments Forexample GAO may decide not to transmit a draft reportelectronically and instead provide limited printed copies of thedraft to the agency In addition GAO may determine that theparticular sensitivity of a draft reports information orrecommendations requires restrictive comment procedures In theseinstances GAO may request that agency officials review the draftreport in the presence of GAO staff and that these officialsprovide the agencys consolidated comments at that time In suchcases the draft report will be available for review only at ameeting with GAO staff Although agency officials may take notes asthey review the draft at the conclusion of the meeting all copiesof the draft report will be returned to GAODisposition of Agency CommentsAfter receiving agency comments GAO considers their substancerevises the draft report as appropriate and indicates in theissued report whether the agency agreed or disagreed with GAOsfindings conclusions and recommendations If the agency disagreeswith GAOs findings conclusions and recommendations GAO willaccept further explanations from agency officials in support of theagencys position However any available documented evidencesupporting this explanation must be provided simultaneously toallow for verification if it materially affects the content of thereport When the agency disagrees with a finding conclusion orrecommendation GAO identifies the disagreement and states its ownposition in the issued report An agencys electronic or hardcopywritten comments are typically reproduced in an appendix to theissued report Unsigned email describing an agencys comments willnot be printed in the issued report However GAO identifies thedisposition of this email message in the Agency Comments sectionof the report just as it does for oral commentsOn occasion the congressional clients who requested the workmay ask to see the agencys comments before GAOs final report isissued Copies of written comments on a draft GAO report may beshared with the requesters if the requesters specificallyasks GAO for the comments and GAO has evaluated the comments anddeveloped its position on them Comments will not be shared withanyone else including congressional staff not associated with therequest the media or other external parties until the report isreleased and posted on GAOs Web site wwwgaogovTestimony Congressional committee or subcommittee Chairsfrequently request that GAO prepare testimony statements and thatGAO witnesses appear at hearings GAO is required to follow therules of the Senate and thePage  GAOSP GAOs Agency ProtocolsHouse and relevant committees or subcommittees in connectionwith any such testimonies Accordingly GAOs Agency Protocols aremodified for these requirements as described in this section Forexample because most hearing appearances are requested andstatements are delivered within short time frames or are based onwork that is new and quickly developed ongoing or alreadycompleted GAO generally does not hold an entrance conference withagency officials When agency officials need to be contacted forinformation that was not previously obtained or was not part of aprevious review GAO will notify the agencydesignated centralliaison generally by telephone or email message If the agencyhas not designated a liaison GAO will provide notification to theresponsible agency management officialFor testimony based on new or ongoing work regardless ofwhether it is a preliminary or a final product GAO will obtain theviews of agency officials on the information collected from theagency tovalidate the accuracy of the data gathered anddiscuss the implications that flow from the datagathered The agencys views are generally obtained through ameeting with the official designated to speak for the agency orthrough other means such as a telephone conference call The viewsof the agency official will be considered in the development of thetestimony statement If the agency is unable to schedule a meetingto provide its views within the time frame specified by GAO thetestimony statement will reflect that GAO was unable to obtain theagencys views Generally when the testimony statement is based onrecently reported work GAO will not seek agency viewsAdditionally when GAO testifies on investigations it conducts itdoes not obtain testimony statement views because such actionscould jeopardize future proceedings GAOs modified protocolsrelated to investigations are explained in greater detail in theseparate section of this document entitled Office ofDisposition of WorkSpecial Investigations GAO will distribute its writtentestimony statement in accordance with the rules of the Senate orHouse including the applicable committees or subcommitteesrulesConsistent with generally accepted government auditingstandards GAO prefers using published products to communicate thefinal results of its work because they communicate the results consistently to all interestedparties  make the results available to the public  build areadily available subjectmatter record for future use and facilitate followup to determine whether appropriate correctivemeasures have been taken when needed However an oral briefing maybe used for example when GAO  determines that further work isnot warranted  provides information that is readily availableto the public such as that in Inspector General reports or develops a summary of previously issued GAO products that does notcontain any new findings conclusions or recommendations In theseinstances GAO will notify the agencydesignated central liaison orpoint of contact that the engagement has been terminated without awritten productGAO will provide electronic copies of reports to agencies uponissuance or release GAO teams responsible for the engagement willprovide to the agency contact via email the final electronicversion of the report and the transmittal letter However GAO willprovide the agencies with hard copies of the report if requestedIn addition to providing copies of the product to the agenciesinvolved GAOs goal is to post written products on its Web sitewwwgaogov within  hours of release All congressionallyrequested products will have a targeted issue date that isdetermined through negotiations between GAO and the requestersHowever the congressional requestersFollowup on GAO Recommendationsmay ask GAO to restrict the release of a product for up to calendar days beyond the targeted issuance date GAO reserves theright to release any product that has been issued to thecongressional requester but is under restriction if the productscontents are made public prior to the expiration of the restrictiondate GAO products that contain classified or restricted data arenot posted on the Web site Classified products are distributedonly to those with the appropriate security clearances and a needto know Restricted versions of products that contain sensitiveinformation are distributed only to recipients who are authorizedby statute or regulation to receive the products have a need toknow or bothGAOs recommendations are intended to improve the economyefficiency and effectiveness of an agencys operations and toimprove the accountability of the federal government for thebenefit of the American people Consequently GAO monitorsagencies progress in implementing these recommendations Toaccomplish this monitoring GAO maintains a database of openrecommendations As new products with recommendations are releasedtheir recommendations are incorporated into the database Thisdatabase serves both GAO and the agencies by helping them meettheir record maintenance and monitoring responsibilitiesGAOs goal is to remove all closed recommendations from thedatabase on an ongoing basis However toward the end of eachfiscal year special attention is directed to this effort GAOremoves a recommendation from its database after determining that the agency has implemented the recommendation or has takenaction that in substance meets the intent of the recommendation or circumstances have changed and the recommendation is no longerrelevant The open recommendations database is available to thepublic on GAOs Web site wwwgaogov Specific recommendations canbe identified because the database is searchable by agencycongressional committee and key words Congressional oversight andauthorization committees as well as the Appropriations Committeescan use the database to prepare for hearings and budgetdeliberationsAgencies also have a responsibility to monitor and maintainaccurate records on the status of recommendations Theserequirements are detailed in two OMB Circulars OMB Circular provides the policies and procedures for use by executive agencieswhen considering reports issued by GAO and Inspectors Generalother executive branch audit organizations and nonfederal auditorswhere followup is necessary and OMB Circular A addressesinternal management control systems Among the requirementsincluded are that the agency  appoint a toplevel auditfollowup official  maintain accurate records on the status ofrecommendations and  assign a high priority to following up onaudit recommendationsAdditionally when GAO issues a report containingrecommendations to the head of an agency  USC  requiresthat the agency head submit a written statement of the actionstaken by the agency on GAOs recommendations to the SenateCommittee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee onGovernment Reform not later than  days after the date of thereport The agencys statement of action shall also be submitted tothe House and Senate Committees on Appropriations with the firstrequest for appropriations that is submitted more than  daysafter the date of the report If the congressional requester hasasked that the distribution of the report be restricted asprovided by GAOs Congressional Protocols the day period willbegin on the date the report is releasedOffice of Special InvestigationsBecause agency personnel serve as the primary source ofinformation on the status of recommendations GAO requests that theagency also provide it with a copy of the agencys statement ofaction to serve as preliminary information on the status of openrecommendations GAO will follow up by discussing the status ofrecommendations with cognizant agency officials obtaining copiesof agency documents supporting the recommendations implementationand performing sufficient work to verify that the recommendedactions are being taken and to the extent possible that thedesired results are being achievedThe Office of Special Investigations OSI is a specialized unitwithin GAO that is staffed by criminal investigators OSIs missionis to improve the performance and ensure the accountability ofgovernment by conducting oversight investigations concerningallegations of serious wrongdoing that may involve potentialviolations of criminal law When OSI investigations disclosepotential violations of law the information is referred to theappropriate law enforcement agency such as the Office of InspectorGeneral or the Department of Justice OSI investigations typicallyfocus on allegations of corruption fraud misconduct contract andprocurement improprieties conflicts of interest and ethicsviolations in federal programs or activitiesOSI also engages in proactive operations that test the securityof agencies systems controls and property These operations arecoordinated with appropriate authorities such as the Department ofJustice OSI will inform the agency of any serious security issuesdiscovered during these operations shortly after the operationshave been completed and before any of the related findings are madepublic In addition OSIs work involves law enforcementrelatedissues or programsOSI also utilizes GAOs FraudNET an automated system thataffords the public an opportunity to report allegations of fraudwaste abuse and mismanagement of federal funds Typically OSIrefers this information to the appropriate agencys Office ofInspector General or another law enforcement agency for action GAOexpects to receive a report from the agency on the results of theactionOSI conducts its investigations and other work in accordancewith the standards established by the Presidents Council onIntegrity and Efficiency as adapted for GAOs work In accordancewith these standards all OSI work is conducted by personnel whocollectively possess the required knowledge skills and abilitiesto perform it and who exercise due professional care egthoroughness appropriate use of investigative techniquesimpartiality objectivity protection of individual rights andtimeliness in the performance of their work OSI seeks evidence ofwrongdoing either in conjunction with or independently of auditsand evaluations It focuses on physical testimonial documentaryand analytical evidence that is relevant material and admissiblein criminal and civil proceedings To ensure admissibility insubsequent judicial proceedings OSI performs its work inaccordance with the requirements of the US Constitutionstatutes and court decisions applicable to obtaining evidence incriminal and civil casesLike GAOs other units OSI expects that an agency will promptlycomply with requests for access to its records and to agencypersonnel directly involved with the matter under investigationFurthermore there should be no interference with an investigatorsability to obtain relevant information concerning an investigativematter When OSI becomes aware of an ongoing executive branchinvestigation pertaining to a matter OSI is currentlyinvestigating OSI will coordinate its work with the lawenforcement agency involvedAccess to Agency InformationInvestigations by their very nature do not support the use ofentrance or exit conferences Nor do the standards of thePresidents Council on Integrity and Efficiency require theseconferences Revealing information at the start of an investigationmay lead to the destruction or concealment of evidence thusjeopardizing the investigation However in investigations thatwill result in a public report or testimony OSI will brief agencyofficials after the investigation has been completed and before theinformation is made public On occasion OSI works jointly withother GAO units or independently on compliance or evaluationissues In those cases the provisions of GAOs standard agencyprotocols are applicableThe Congress relies on GAO to examine virtually every federalprogram activity and policy as well as institutions that rely onfederal funds Generally accepted government auditing standardsmake GAO analysts and financial auditors responsible for planningconducting and reporting their work in a timely manner withoutinternal or external impairments to the work These standardsrequire that analysts and financial auditors promptly obtainsufficient competent and relevant evidence to afford a reasonablebasis for any related findings and conclusions Therefore promptaccess to all records and other information associated with theseactivities is needed for the effective and efficient performance ofGAOs work While for the most part agencies have provided GAOwith requested information within agreedupon time frames thefollowing sections describe the steps GAO is authorized to followif it believes it is experiencing unreasonable delays in obtainingthe requested accessHandling and Disclosing InformationThe Congress has given GAO broad statutory rights of access to awide range of federal agency documents The basic access authorityis established in  USC a which requires each agency togive GAO information the Comptroller General requires about theduties powers activities organization and financialtransactions of the agency GAO is also authorized to inspect anagencys records to secure the required information This authorityincludes access to inter and intraagency memorandums andelectronic files as well as sensitive information includingbusinessconfidential or proprietary data While the Freedom ofInformation Act the Trade Secrets Act and other statutes maygenerally protect certain categories of information from disclosureby an agency to the public this protection does not justifywithholding the information from GAO GAO has a statutory right toaccess predecisional and deliberative documents unless thePresident or the Director of OMB certifies that certain standardsare met under  USC dC as added by the GeneralAccounting Office Act of  For further information see SenateReport No  Feb   pp  Aside from the generalaccess statute various forms of special legislation govern GAOsaccess to certain types of agency records and information such astax social security financial institution and employee benefitplan records and information In addition under certaincircumstances GAO has the authority to access information fromother entities receiving federal funds such as the District ofColumbia state and local governments and private sectorcontractorsGAO secures all information obtained during the course of itswork When GAO needs access to classified proprietary orotherwise sensitive information it will comply with all applicablestatutory requirements including obtaining the necessary securityand other clearances for assigned GAO staff Under  USCe GAO is obligated to give the information theObtaining Access to Informationsame level of confidentiality and protection required of theagency Because of its statutory access authority GAO generallydoes not sign a nondisclosure or other agreement as a condition ofgaining access to sensitive or proprietary data to which it isentitledWhile GAO is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act itsdisclosure policy follows the spirit of the act consistent withGAOs duties and responsibilities to the Congress It is GAOspolicy not to provide records to the public that originated inanother agency or a nonfederal organization Instead GAO refersthose who request such records to the originating organizationFurther information on the public availability of the documents anddata that form GAOs workpapers can be found in  CFR partGAO will grant congressional Members upon their writtenrequest access to its workpapers at the GAO site or will providecopies of selected workpapers only after a product that resultsfrom the workpapers in question has been made publicly availableThis access is subject to legal and privacy considerations such asthose concerning taxpayer return information protected bankinginformation grand jury information and credit card accountinformation listed in travel vouchersGAOs work involves different collection approaches to meet theevidence requirements of the generally accepted government auditingstandards Such evidence falls into four categoriesphysical evidence eg the results of direct inspectionor observationdocumentary evidence eg information created by andfor an agency such as letters memorandums contracts managementand accounting records andResolving Disputes Over Accessother documents in various formats includingelectronic databasestestimonial evidence eg the results of facetofacetelephone or written inquiries interviews and questionnairesandanalytical evidence developed by or for GAO throughcomputations data comparisons and other analysesGAO expects that an agency will promptly comply with itsrequests for access to the agencys records so that it can obtainall categories of needed evidence Such access generally includesthe ability to make and retain copies of the evidence GAO alsoexpects that it will receive full and timely access to agencyofficials who have stewardship over the requested records toagency employees who are responsible for the programs issuesevents operations and other factors covered by such records andcontractor personnel supporting such programs issues events andoperations In addition GAO expects that it will have access tothe agencys facilities and other relevant locations GAO willendeavor to conduct work related to requests for information withminimal interruption to the agencys operationsTimely access to information is in the best interests of bothGAO and the agencies GAO needs to efficiently use the timeavailable to complete its work to minimize the impact on the agencybeing reviewed and to meet the time frames of the congressionalrequesters Therefore GAO expects that an agencys leadershipand internal procedures will recognize the importance of andsupport prompt responses to GAOs requests for information For themost part agencies have provided GAO with requested informationwithin agreedupon time frames However if GAO believes it isexperiencing unreasonable delays in obtaining requested access GAOofficials will contact the agencys leadership for resolution andnotify the congressional requesters of the work affected asappropriate Consistent with GAOs reporting standards when thereis difficulty in obtaining timely access to information thatadversely affects either the completion of an engagement itsscope or both GAOs product will reflect that GAO had thisdifficulty In addition unreasonable delays in gaining access toan agencys information can reduce the time available for theagency to provide its views or comments on GAOs workTo ensure GAOs access to information maintained by federalagencies the Congress provided in  USC b forenforcement actions to compel the production of a record Firstthe Comptroller General sends a written request to the agency headfor the record that has not been made available to GAO within areasonable time after an initial request The agency head then has calendar days to respond either by providing the record forinspection or by explaining why it is being withheld If the agencyhead does not provide the record the Comptroller General may filea report describing the access issues with the President theDirector of OMB the Attorney General the agency head and theCongress If the agency head does not provide the record within calendar days of the reports filing the statute authorizes theComptroller General to bring a civil action in federal districtcourt to enforce GAOs access rights If the Comptroller General issuccessful in this action the court will issue an order directingthe agency head to produce the recordExtremely limited exceptions to the authority are established in USC b for a civil enforcement action to compel accessto a record The most notable exception is if the President or theDirector of OMB certifies that  the record could be withheldunder either of two Freedom of Information Act exemptions in USC b deliberative process and b lawenforcement records and  disclosure could reasonably beexpected to impair substantially the operations of the governmentarequirement that as the legislative history of Section  makesclear presents a very high standard for an agency to meet Aspreviously noted the fact that materials may be exempt from publicdisclosure does not justify withholding them from GAO MoreoverGAOs statutory right of access to an agencys records is notdiminished by the certification provisions of the legislationRather the certification simply allows the President or theDirector of OMB to preclude the Comptroller General from seeking ajudicial remedy in certain limited situations In the event thereis a certification generally accepted government auditingstandards require that the limitations to GAOs access to recordsbe identified in the product and that the audit findings beadjusted
