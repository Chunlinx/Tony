Microsoft                                       Journalistically youranswer almost has to be yes but Ive noticed an underlying love for allthings rendered unto Gates What is your opinion of the

the parent companyshould she ever findsomething of which to be critical As for the antitrust matter Prudie isalways in favor of trust            Prudie Microsoftly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I have started dating aguy with wonderful qualities and think he has real possibilities for the longhaul There is only one glitch Isnt there always                                       He is almostpathologically cheap when it comes to eating out To make this less of anissue I have taken to cooking dinner for us at my place or drumming upoccasions for dinner to be my treat                                       I am starting to wonderhowever about his choice of restaurants leaning heavily to pizzerias andjoints specializing in burgers What do you think of all this                                       We areboth in our mids and have good jobs                                       No FourStarFlorence                        Dear NoFour            Prudie knows the type Youveallied yourself with the kind of man who will always opt for the Road KillCafe            There are many ways toapproach this You can try to get to the bottom of his aversion to betterrestaurants Perhaps he was traumatized at Le Cirque  You can laugh itoff if he is in all other ways wonderful You can let him know you would love aslight modification of this particular behavior            But bear in mind that womenare not reform schools There is an old saying A woman hooks up with a manexpecting he will change but he doesnt A man hooks up with a woman expectingshe wont change and she does            Prudiethinks overall that if this is the young lads only negative you shouldlearn to roll with the punches or burgers in your case and hope that hismaturing will ameliorate your problem            Prudiegustatorially                                             DearPrudie                                                      Nowthat I am moving in with my significant other I dont know what to do with themementos mostly notes of a torrid affair I had after the current significantother and I became involved but before we were very serious I dont want herto find about the affair I also dont want to get rid of the notes yet Whatto do                                       Anywhere inEurope                        DearAny            Prudiethinks you are wise not to stash the mash notes in your sock drawer Discoverywould not be healthy for your current relationship Since you dont wish todiscard the sizzlers you have the option of storing them in a safety depositbox If there is a large quantity of billetsdoux then a storage bin at anappropriate facility would do A friend is also an option but Prudie thinksnot a great one  too much room for errors of different kinds Prudie oncehoused the jewelry of a divorcing friend and was very uncomfortable            Prudie secretively                                             Prudie                                                      Harking back to yourletter from the man whose wife insisted on writing notes rather than talkingyou wrote Dear I Prudie will pass up the chance to point out what would beseen by some as your good fortune A more common question might surely be Howcan I get her to stop talking                                        Ohdear While claiming to pass up the chance you take it Is thatpolite                                       Mikeinquiringly                        DearMike            Prudiedoes not think the quote you mention is polite or impolite but simply ajournalistic conceit to state the obvious Actually it was a quip pro quoaretort Prudie could not resist And she definitely didnt mean to sound like atraitor to her gender            Prudie politely
