        the home that uh we bought back in the early eighties was uh was was typical tract home and we were uh trying to find something that would would get us into the housing market as it were thinking that someday wed move on uh the economy however changed that a little bit and looks like were going to be in this home for a while but uh its not too bad   umhum     some of the things that we didnt uh think about when we bought it turned out uh worked out all right for us was we bought on a top of a hill and some of our neighbors down the the lower part uh get their yards flooded every once in a while doesnt get up into the house but it just makes a bit of a mess in the in the yard itself a little bit of debris and a little bit of runoff on the   uh yeah   on the uh grass area its kind of hard to keep grass in certain areas and id never really thought about that but but were pretty much at the very top of this little hill and all the runoff from from the concrete uh the shopping center near us and the alleyway all that goes down to our neighbors so so that was a little thing that id never really considered and was fortunate that it worked out that way   yeah   uh another uh calamity i guess that befalls some purchasers that i didnt uh think about when i first purchased this house was what can happen right immediately behind you we are on the edge of a development that has a little retainer wall that separates us from the rest of the from a street and a little little uh business area and uh some friends of ours moved into a house and a couple of years later a a uh shopping center built up behind them and it was a grocery store that had that stocked at night at about three am every night   oh oh no   they would run the trash compactor and it was so loud it would wake them up and they never got used to it and they finally had to move they just couldnt stand that noise then oddly enough after that they uh uh it it it closed down now that grocery store isnt there and hasnt been there for about six years now so       uh its kind of a a bad thing to happen but we happen to have landed again in a very lucky spot there is a little business development behind us thats a bit of a a a little bank and a couple of dry cleaning things and little strip shopping center but its several houses down because the property thats the other side of our little wall is a triangle shape and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to do anything more than put some grass and trees there theres not even a parking lot so it its a nice uh two or three houses on either side of us is nice grass and trees and   oh good   and then across from that is a a major four lane street and then across from that is is uh the parks of the city that we live in has some soccer fields and some baseball fields and that completely goes on to the horizon so as far as we can look out over our little retaining wall is grass and trees and parks   oh thats really nice   and we really didnt didnt uh i mean that wasnt our consideration when when we bought it it was a complete blank lot they hadnt even built the house yet and we were new to the this whole process and all we knew is that it was a the cheapest house that this this tract development uh sold so it turned out to be pretty good and   where do you what area do you live in oh okay i live in Dallas uh Rowlett   Dallas yeah its uh its a nice area as it were about the only two things that uh didnt work out too well for us well one of thems nice in in a way were on the beginning of a corner we live on a on a U shaped drive and were the first house that they actually started turning to make for a turn on a on a culdesac not a culdesac but a turn on a ninety degree turn on the street which meant that were not jammed right up against our neighbors house   uhhuh oh thats really nice   theres theres like twelve or fifteen feet on one side but on the other side theres over sixty feet before the next house because they they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways so our houses begin to to turn to to make this turn as it were so were real far away and we have a really large lot we have a bigger lot than all the rest of the the ones down the street but uh as it turned out we decided we learned that neither one of us really likes taking care of all that grass so it it was a bit of a drawback but uh itll probably make for a good selling point if we ever give it to someone that does like all that grass   oh yeah it probably will   and uh we did also end up in a in an area that we didnt we didnt realize when we bought it that uh the soil is that uh black clay and it   yeah we have that   it tends to uh go to the extremes of being dry or being moist and it its done a little bit of a foundation damage that uh most of these houses get no matter how much watering we do   uhhuh   so we have to contend with doors that sometimes sometimes the during the year dont uh just close just right and uh things of that nature   right i guess thats just Texas though you have to live with that   yeah thats true there are there is a little segment little segment up near McKinney and up near um uh they said out near Wylie theres some some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it it uh goes back into the black gumbo around it   hum uhhuh   but there are some housing developments that uh the guy that came out and inspected our damage was saying that there are some little little pockets of neighborhoods that dont have these problems at all and had i only known you know maybe id have looked over there   really   uh what about your house   well we bought uh our first house at the end of eighty six and like i said its out in Rowlett and its its real nice its four bedroom and its kind of a tract area too weve got people behind us and on both sides of us i dont really like that too well i keep telling my husband that our next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land       but uh its a its a good size and its something we can stay in and grow in for quite a while i guess uh hopefully till the real estate market turns around like you we we bought when it was down a little bit but weve had so many repossessions in our neighborhood that we couldnt sell for anywhere near what weve got into it so   umhum   it uh hopefully itll turn around   its true that theres always that chance i guess   sometime yeah oh i think it will eventually out here theyre building more new houses all the time though and people can go and buy a brand new one thats never been lived in for less than they can get a used one so i guess thats what they would choose   hum   but there uh well as a first time home buyer i know what you mean theres a lot of things youre not sure about what to look out for the only really trouble weve had with our house is the seals breaking between the double panes and water moisture   umhum umhum   gets in there and you can hardly see out of them now theyve got so much and the builders gone bankrupt and the glass companys gone bankrupt so we dont really have any recourse and just hope they break or something   umhum nothing you can do thats right theres nothing you can do   yeah but other than that we havent had any problems   yeah weve got weve got one thats done that uh weve been pretty fortunate most of our neighbors have had many more um   umhum   i dont know that weve done anything different to prevent ours from doing that but most of our neighbors have ended up replacing them uh buying some nice Anderson windows or some some uh name brand windows uh one neighbor went with whatever Sears installs and they have the the different kind of window that the kind that you can tilt out either pane and and raise or lower you know lower the top down or the bottom up or tilt it in both of them tilt in so you can clean them or and its a real strange   oh uhhuh   mechanical beast but uh they havent lost their seal yet so its i guess theres a quality some quality in it     yeah we we had um our insurance our home owners insurance actually covered some of it because i told them it looks like somethings eating into the glass it turns like a milky white you know so i said well how do we know it wasnt some kind of chemical or something thats eating into that which would be covered under a glass rider so   so umhum   they replaced like seven of them and we just had to pay the deductible but   hum   they wouldnt that insurance company went out of business in Texas because they had so many claims that they couldnt make a profit and so now none of the other insurance companies will will consider covering that   goodness yeah thats   which i can understand its really not   thatd be hard to hard to cover all the ones that go bad   damaged oh yeah   its true   but i bet weve got at least seven more now that are bad   goodness   just about every window in our house i guess eventually is going to have to be replaced   yeah and itd be nice to do it with with all the same kind too   yeah well what they did is just they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more glass in   hum   thats over a year ago and its it hasnt had any problems yeah seemed to   and those held thats interesting i didnt know they could do that   somebody told me that they thought that too was caused by just a little bit of shifting in the foundation puts a little pressure on that seal and makes them pop open   yeah that could be but once you get that moisture in there it it can fog up and not go away quickly enough   right   well i hear my kid calling me i better go see what he wants  okay bye     okay well it was good talking to you  bye
