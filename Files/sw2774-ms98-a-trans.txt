        all right i guess our i were in the process of a home repair right at this point because were were painting the outside of our house i dont know i guess thats you would consider that a home repair certainly uh   umhum   uh and interesting enough this time were changing the color which makes uh an addition uh weve  what does your most recent   oh we just barely did that too   you did that recently too huh make does it make a big difference   yes oh yes we have brick on the outside and uh it the colors that were there changed the and the colors we painted changed the entire look of the house completely   thats neat isnt it nah   yes it was really exciting it was fun   i was really uh really tired of the color and its its its helping were not quite through but its it really is looking good uh we went through a process of of uh home repairs on a on a rental house we had probably the most uh extensive and uh the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do um didnt have very much money and so we had to to do it ourselves in a kind of a slow process but we learned how to do uh retile bathtubs and and um oh just all kinds of things that are kind of unusual   umhum well the other thing that we did was the roof of our house and uh we did that a different color also of course uh   ah yeah   being a woman most of these things were done by uh the men and uh so i wasnt directly involved but uh   umhum   they really were helpful i know to our house   its nice to not have a drip through from the ceiling from the roof isnt it   yes yes   thats awful um uh Howard and i were talking about home repair the other night in uh in connection with Scouting you got a Scouter uh coming up and uh uh i think its neat for for young people to learn how to uh take care of their of of a household you know like uh fixing faucets and drippy faucets and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that   thats right well as a matter of fact one thing uh i have a young son and one thing we did was we had paneling on the inside of our uh front of our house or the hallway of our house rather and we were repainting the the front room in the hall there and we took down that paneling and he helped me and and uh he was it it was fun to work with him   umhum   and uh and help putty up the holes together and and do things like that he was a     how did the how did the paneling paneling looks lots better do you do you like it better   oh i like it so much better it makes it so much lighter you know it really um   yeah yeah yeah   you know and people who have been to my house before and and then now really have liked it much much better too so its been fun   yeah thats nice isnt it nice to have it come out to uh uh positive and look look good   yeah yeah exactly   yeah well we have a lot that needs to be done we have uh we have uh carpeting and and uh we did have a a new uh floor put in our kitchen and um i have my mother living with us and so she was in a a room with a carpet and course shes quite aged shes ninety three now so that meant she had problems now and then and it it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a a linoleum down so it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was and  so that was a really positive uh uh it was fairly expensive though im i was impressed i think that uh we we had somebody do it and and it was it seems to me like its probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet   hm thats interesting   kind of depends on the on the quality of carpet i suppose but   yeah   uh in in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and and fix the floor so its uh i dont know whatever but they have to put stuff on the floor and its uh kind of a process so   oh i bet it does   well it sounds like youve had some pretty good experiences with uh with uh um home repair   uhhuh we have its been really fun   yeah all right happy home repairing okay byebye   well okay you too byebye
