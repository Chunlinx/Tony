                    Background        The cytokine interleukin IL has been used        extensively as a single agent for immune modulation of the        host in cancer therapy    Clinical regression of        metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer resulted in        longterm cures and IL has been approved by the Food and        Drug Administration for standard therapy Systemic IL        administration also appears to dramatically increase the        frequency of tumor regression in specific immunization        against cancer   It has been postulated on clinical        grounds that the anticancer effects of IL are mediated        through         in vivo expansion and activation of        cytotoxic lymphocytes   andor promotion of their        migration within target tissues   but it has become        apparent that IL at the doses used therapeutically has        broader immuneproinflammatory effects    In        addition IL may have a role in activationinduced Tcell        death therefore causing peripheral tolerance    IL        administration is also associated with potent systemic        toxicity that limits its therapeutic usefulness   and a        relationship between toxicity and clinical effectiveness        has been observed suggesting a common effector pathway          Most peculiarly the extent of ILinduced        thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia is associated with        increased frequency of clinical responses   Reversal        of ILinduced toxicity by corticosteroid or antitumor        necrosis factor TNF antibodies also blunts its        therapeutic efficacy further indicating the mandatory        nature of this association    The ability to        distinguish the effects of IL in target tissues from its        systemic effects may yield important insights for the        development of improved anticancer therapies        With the advent of functional genomics   it has        become possible to study complex biological behaviors in        concert in order to obtain a panoramic view of downstream        events resulting from pathophysiological alterations of        entire biosystems Thus various aspects of the immune        response can be analyzed         in vitro   To our knowledge        however little information is available about the effects        of IL in controlled         in vitro conditions   and none        about the effects of         in vivo administration We have        therefore characterized the effects of IL administration         in vivo on the transcriptional        program of circulating cells as markers of its systemic        effect and on the tumor microenvironment as a marker of        its effect on target tissue        We compared the time course of gene induction after         in vitro exposure of peripheral blood        mononuclear cells PBMC to IL  IUml with         in vivo exposure to a dose regimen         IUkg every  hours which is associated with        fairly high systemic toxicity and clinical effectiveness          The changes in expression profile induced by IL in        the tumor microenvironment were monitored by repeated        fineneedle aspiration FNA biopsies Amplified antisense        RNA aRNA obtained from         in vitro or         ex vivo samples was fluorescence        labeled and hybridized to spot cDNA arrays as        previously described          Test samples consisted of gradientseparated PBMC        exposed either         in vitro or         in vivo to IL labeled with Cy        red and cohybridized with reference samples labeled with        Cy green Reference samples for PBMC consisted of        corresponding material for each experiment obtained before        IL exposure For         in vitro experiments for example        reference samples were PBMC cultured in the absence of        IL For         ex vivo experiments references        consisted of PBMC obtained from the respective patient        before IL administration For test FNA samples obtained        during the course of IL administration reference        material consisted of FNA from the respective lesion        obtained before IL therapy This unusual strategy was        selected to emphasize the differences between pre and        postILexposure expression profiles while minimizing        differences related to individual lesion andor patient        heterogeneity The complete data set was filtered letting        through only genes expressed at ratios   or          compared to the reference in at least one experiment A        parameter was applied to the filter that selected genes        whose fluorescence intensity was above  in one channel        at least in one experiment This arbitrary threshold was        chosen to exclude genes whose fluorescence intensity was        close to background fluorescence To recover possibly        useful information this filter was removed if the same        gene demonstrated high intensity of fluorescence in the        other channel   in at least one experiment A        total of  genes out of the  clones were selected        for subsequent analyses                    Results                  Technical challenges          Administration of IL in humans induces dramatic          changes in the frequency of different subsets of          circulating cells These changes need to be addressed          when considering the more specific and minute changes          induced at the transcriptional level by this cytokine          Perhaps the most perplexing effect of IL administration          is a rapid within  hour and paradoxical clearance of          monocytes and lymphocytes from the peripheral blood          Figure a IL may directly eliminate mononuclear          cells through activationinduced death    Contrary          to the           in vivo observation however           in vitro stimulation with IL           IUml of PBMC obtained from apheresis of melanoma          patients did not alter mononuclear cell counts          suggesting that cell death is not a direct effect of IL          Figure b A substantial difference between          gradientseparated PBMC and circulating cells           in vivo is the lack of plasma          platelets and polymorphonuclear cells as a result of the          apheresis process This may directly or indirectly          contribute to mononuclear cell death           in vivo in response to IL          administration However IL  lUml stimulation          of lepirudintreated Aventis Pharmaceuticals Kansas          City MO fresh blood did not alter mononuclear cell          number data not shown suggesting a limited role for          lymphocyte apoptosis as the cause of their rapid          clearance from the circulation          Whatever the reason the dramatic changes in the          proportions of different subsets of circulating cells          during IL therapy introduce a strong bias into the          interpretation of the           in vivo data Observed variations          in geneexpression profile could be due to differential          gene expression in individual cells shifting proportions          of different cell subsets or a combination of the two          The effect of proportional shifts in cell subsets could          not be overcome by           ex vivo mechanical separation of          these subsets because of the limited quantity of material          obtained from blood draws  ml However density          gradient separation of PBMC almost totally compensated          for these shifts by eliminating polymorphonuclear cells          eosinophils and basophils Figure c and leaving a          mononuclear cell population comparable with preIL          treatment samples PBMC from apheresis used as reference          for           in vivo studies and as source of          cells for           in vitro studies are highly          enriched in monocytes and lymphocytes as seen in Figure          b Therefore both           in vivo and           in vitro studies reflected similar          starting populations of mononuclear cells This at least          in part mitigated the variation in geneprofile pattern          due to shifting cellsubset proportions           in vivo           It has been suggested that rapid clearance of          mononuclear cells after IL administration is due to          increased permeability of vascular endothelium            facilitating cell migration into extravascular spaces          including tumor sites   However the level of genes          constitutively expressed by various subsets of          mononuclear cells did not change significantly within the          tumor microenvironment Differential display of          precompared with postIL specimens detected changes          only in circulating cells that is of genes for CD          CD CD and CD green and gray bars in Figure d          These most probably reflected proportional shifts in cell          subsets rather than altered gene expression because the          level of expression of the same genes remained constant          in the           in vitro time course data not          shown No changes could be detected in FNAs obtained          preIL administration compared with FNAs obtained           hours after one lightblue bar or four darkblue bar          doses We could not confirm the aRNAbased results by          immunohistochemistry because the material obtainable by          FNA was not sufficient for both analyses However we          have previously shown good correlation between transcript          detection of cellular markers in aRNA total RNA and at          the protein level            We further evaluated the effects of IL on          endothelial cell permeability as a possible factor          mediating migration of circulating immune cells into the          tumor site IL had no direct impact on the permeability          of human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC Figure          e The addition of PBMC enriched in lymphocytes and          monocytes by gradient separation increased the          permeability of HUVEC within  hours Treatment of the          enriched PBMC with IL  IUml increased HUVEC          permeability compared to PBMC alone only after  hours          Student           t test           p   This finding suggests          that IL affects endothelial cell permeability through          activation of PBMC The delayed effect of IL on          endothelial cell permeability observed with this          functional assay was supported by gene profiling IL          alone had minimal effects on HUVEC Supernatant from PBMC          cultures in serumfree medium had extensive effects on          HUVEC transcriptional profile data not shown However          supernatants from PBMC conditioned for  hours with IL           IUml induced differential expression in six          additional groups of genes Figure f that could not be          induced with supernatants conditioned for  hours These          results suggest that the effect of IL on endothelial          cells is predominantly mediated indirectly through          activation of immune cells and occurs at a later stage          of IL treatment This conclusion is in line with the          clinical observation that fluid shifts and vascular leak          occur in the later phases of highdose IL therapy          Taken together these results suggest that immediate          migration of mononuclear cells to the tumor          microenvironment is not the primary effector mechanism of          systemic IL administration This observation of          course does not exclude the possibility that at a later          time mononuclear cells might migrate or proliferate at          the tumor site The reason for the clearance of          circulating cells immediately following IL          administration remains unsolved and may be related to          their sequestration in the reticular endothelial system          a hypothesis that could not be evaluated by this          study                          Timecourse analysis of ILinduced gene          expression in PBMC in vitro          To assess the direct effect of IL on mononuclear          cells without the experimental noise caused by          proportional shifts in cell subsets we first determined          the transcriptional changes occurring on exposure of PBMC          to IL           in vitro IL has direct effects          on immune cells carrying the IL receptor which in turn          release soluble factors andor activate other cells by          cellcell interactions Thus to match as closely as          possible the           in vitro conditions with those          occurring           in vivo we stimulated          lymphocytemonocyteenriched PBMC preparations with           IUml IL in serumfree medium This concentration          approximates the pharmacokinetic distribution of IL          following intravenous bolus administration with mean peak          levels around  ngml corresponding to approximately           lUml   This timecourse analysis identified           genes expressed more than threefold over preIL          samples Figure  According to their kinetics of          expression the large majority of genes were identifiable          approximately  hours after IL exposure with the          exception of a subgroup including transcription and          regulatory factors cFos MKP which underwent early          and shortlived upregulation An overview of the genes          most consistently affected by IL therapy revealed a          large array of transcripts with functions ranging from          regulation of cell division and apoptosis to the          secretion of immunestimulatory andor proinflammatory          factors In addition several surface activation markers          in lymphocytes and monocytes that may influence migration          and interaction with other cells were induced Thus the          effects of IL on PBMC span as expected a broad range          related to the function of several different types of          mononuclear cells                          Timecourse analysis of lLinduced gene          expression in PBMC in vivo          A similar timecourse analysis was performed in the          patient who donated the PBMC for the           in vitro time course by obtaining          blood at intervals following intravenous administration          of the first dose of IL  IUml The blood was          separated by density gradient which left a population of          cells enriched in lymphocytes and monocytes In the           in vivo time course  genes          displayed differential expression  fold change in          at least  of the samples with IL treatment We then          compared the expression profiles in the           in vivo time course for the           genes differentially expressed as a result of IL          exposure during the           in vitro timecourse analysis          Differences between the two data sets could be due to          shifts in cellsubset frequencies           in vivo andor true alterations in          the geneexpression profile of individual cells We          hypothesized that expression profiles concordant           in vitro where no change in          cellsubset frequency is observed and           in vivo may represent with most          confidence the pattern of gene expression induced by          IL A set of  out of  genes concordantly expressed          in the           in vitro and           in vivo experiments were identified          Figure abcde by cluster analysis of the          combined           in vitro and           in vivo timecourse samples Genes          for chemokines and cytokines related to inflammatory          processes IP MIP MCP MCP          GMCSFILILR IL receptor showed a concordant          early upregulation           in vitro and           in vivo Downregulation of growth          factorscell cycletranscription factorrelated genes          for ERF CDC LMyc occurred in a similar fashion           in vitro and           in vivo As the majority of genes          appeared to be concordantly expressed           in vitro and           in vivo we postulate that for          these at least the effect of IL on gene expression          overrides its effect on population shift Although          variability in the kinetics of expression of individual          gene was noted           in vivo as for the           in vitro time course the hour          time point appeared to yield the most comprehensive view          of alterations in geneexpression profile following IL          administration Thus this data point was used in a          larger cohort of patients to identify genes consistently          modulated by IL administration                          Genes whose expression is consistently altered in          peripheral blood following IL administration          The expression pattern of the  genes identified by          the           in vitro time course was evaluated          in PBMC samples obtained  hours after IL          administration in a larger cohort of patients Figure           A first node including  genes consistently upregulated          at least fold change in   of samples was          identified Of these genes all but  were included among          the  genes coordinately expressed in the           in vitro and           in vivo time courses Figure  A          second node included  genes consistently downregulated          most of them represented among those coordinately          downregulated in the timecourse studies These data          suggest that the genes identified were highly          representative of the effects of IL administration on          circulating cells          For some genes it was possible to extrapolate a          potential cell subset responsible for their expression by          testing different mononuclear cell subsets separated by          negative selection after           in vitro exposure to IL          monocytes CD T cells CD T cells total          lymphocytes and neutrophils respectively under the          orange bar Figure  Several were selectively expressed          by either monocytes or CD andor CD T cells          Interestingly IL also appeared to stimulate the          expression of some of these genes in neutrophils which          however could not be accounted for in the analysis of          PBMC samples enriched in monocytes and lymphocytes and          almost completely depleted of neutrophils                          Genes specifically expressed in the tumor          microenvironment in response to IL          administration          The genes whose expression was consistently altered in          PBMC following IL administration were analyzed in a set          of FNAs obtained from the same patients plus an          additional group of patients Figure  Because there          are practical limits on the number of FNAs that can be          carried out in the same lesion without causing excessive          disturbance of its structure we sampled lesions  hours          after one dose first four samples in the array and four          doses remaining six samples of IL The fourth dose           hours after the administration of the first was          selected as a later point likely to be reached by all          patients before treatment was discontinued because of          limiting toxicity   The postIL FNA material was          cohybridized with reference RNA obtained preIL from          each lesion as previously discussed Only a small          proportion of these genes were consistently upregulated          in FNA samples and belonged to a closely related          subcluster consisting of genes for inflammatory          chemokines MCP MCP IP LD and interferon          IFNrelated genes guanylatebinding protein          IFNinducible MxA IP Analysis of mechanically          separated subsets related their expression to activation          of either monocytes or T cells          Whereas the previous analysis was based on a pool of          genes identified by studying the effects of IL on          circulating T cells an independent analysis was carried          out by selecting from the complete data set genes whose          expression was preferentially altered in FNA samples          following IL administration Genes were ranked          according to their median ratio of expression among all          FNA samples FNAs obtained after one or four doses were          pooled together to identify genes associated with IL          administration independent of dose number The  genes          with the highest median ratio and the  with the lowest          were selected Figure  The expression of most of these          genes seemed to be specifically modulated by IL and not          by the trauma of needle aspiration as only a few          differentially expressed genes in parentheses in Figure           were detected in control FNA samples obtained at          hour intervals in the absence of IL          administration          Eisens hierarchical clustering analysis   was          applied to this data set to compute relatedness among          transcriptional profiles of different FNA samples This          was done to evaluate whether FNAs obtained sequentially          after one or four doses of IL from identical or          different lesions would cluster according to time of          sampling or tissue of origin According to this data set          based on the most consistently expressed genes samples          from the same lesion clustered together independently of          time suggesting that profiles of ILinduced genes tend          to be lesion specific throughout IL therapy The          relationship among the samples independent of time of          treatment was even more robust when the alldata set was          queried data not shown Different functional subsets of          genes were identified that included those for several          chemokines GRO MIG MCP MCP MIP MIP          PARC IL cytokine receptors CCR ILR ILR          antagonist ILR transforming growth factor receptor          TGFR IFNR  chain adhesion molecules associated          with mononuclear cell migration CDL VCAM CD          CD cytotoxic proteins in granules produced by          activated monocytes grancalcin and calgranulin and          several genes associated with IFN activity such as HLA          class II molecules and IFNregulatory or responsive genes          such as those for MxA MxB and IRF Interestingly no          genes associated with apoptosis or cell proliferation          were identified In addition no evidence of migration of          various immunecell subsets was observed by analyzing          changes in frequency of genes constitutively expressed by          such cells that is CD CD CD and so on see          Figure  Thus the early effects of IL administration          are more associated with an inflammatory modulation of          the tumor microenvironment rather than with specific          migration activation andor proliferation of immune          cells at the tumor site          To identify genes whose upregulation in the tumor          microenvironment was time andor dose dependent we then          queried the FNA data set by selecting genes          differentially expressed between samples obtained  hours          after one or four doses of IL unpaired sample           t test           p            value   The cutoff           p            value of   was arbitrarily          selected and was not corrected by the number of          hypotheses tested genes Thus the genes identified          should be considered more as an exploratory finding than          a definitive proof of differential expression according          to dose number Ratios were shown according to the          central method for display using a normalization factor          that emphasizes differences in expression between the          experimental groups analyzed by resetting the equality          parameter ratio   to the mean of all the experiments            In this fashion  genes were identified Figure           Interestingly among them we noted a further          upregulation of MHC molecules and other          interferoninducible factors          Among the lesions analyzed one underwent partial          regression Figure a To explore possible markers          associated with immune responsiveness we queried the data          set for genes expressed differentially in the responder          lesion after one MF  and four MF  doses of          IL Two           t tests twotailunequal          variance were carried out comparing MF  and MF           respectively with the rest of the FNA samples Also in          this case a cutoff           p            value of   was arbitrarily          selected and was not corrected by the number of genes          studied Thus the findings have only exploratory value          In this fashion  and  genes were identified          respectively Figure b of which four were overlapping          two expressed sequence tags ESTs a nuclear protein          CHD and a sphingosine kinase type  isoform When a          similar analysis was carried out by comparing each of the          nonresponding lesions to the rest the average of genes          differentially expressed was    after one dose and             after four doses From the group of genes          differentially expressed in the responder lesion after          four doses of IL  were identified with the highest          ratio of expression Among these  genes those for          NKG Tcell receptor  chain and HLA class II related          transcripts appeared of particular interest because they          have been found to be upregulated in the context of acute          rejection of renal allografts    In addition          three were associated with ILdependent NKcell          activation NK CD Pselectin and galectin  as          recently observed when purified NK cells were exposed to          IL S Mocellin MCP and FMM unpublished          observations                            Discussion        The goal of this study was to dissect the events        following administration of highdose IL for therapeutic        purposes In particular we were interested in comparing        the systemic effects of IL as reflected by the        transcriptional profile of circulating mononuclear cells        with the effects observable within the tumor        microenvironment This was achieved by serial sampling of        blood and tumor samples to follow the dynamic changes        occurring during the course of IL administration The        results suggest that IL exerts a broad range of effects        on circulating cells These systemic effects have        downstream repercussions only a few of which were        reflected in changes in gene expression at the tumor site        Analysis of the genes identified as affected by IL        administration suggested that IL exerts its effect at the        target site by causing activation of monocytes This could        be best explained by the secondary release of        proinflammatory substances such as IFN and IL by        circulating or intratumoral lymphoid cells as most of the        genes identified are known to be responsive to the effect        of either of these cytokines        These proinflammatory cytokines are probably        responsible for the direct activation of monocytes as        suggested by the upregulation of CD and ILR Figure         In addition gene profiling identified genes whose        expression is most probably dependent upon IL and IFN        rather than IL genes for MHC molecules HSP MxA MxB        and other IFNinducible proteins It is possible that        macrophage activation is followed by release of        proinflammatory chemokines such as IL MCP MIP        MIP and MIG These indirect effects of IL within the        tumor microenvironment seem also to affect the activation        of dendritic cells DCs through the expression of        PARCMCP Finally activation of macrophages results in        the upregulation of the expression of molecules with lytic        activity such as calgranulin and grancalcin Although it        is possible that the downstream effects noted after IL        administration could be attributed to stimulation of tumor        cells exposure of three melanoma cell lines LFTU         and A to supernatant from ILconditioned PBMC        identified transcriptional changes only in a small        proportion of these genes for IFI IFNR and        TGFinducible protein data not shown The results        therefore suggest that IL exerts its primary role at        tumor sites through the release of proinflammatory        cytokines On the basis of the transcriptional profile        identified we postulate that IL and IFN are the most        likely cytokines responsible for this phenomenon These in        turn activate a local inflammation probably through        induction of monocytes and macrophages This inflammatory        process can subsequently help recruit immune cells from the        periphery andor activate locally infiltrating cells This        hypothesis is appealing because it converges on IFN as a        central mediator of immune regulation within the tumor        microenvironment Recent murine experiments have shown that        IFN may be the central mediator of immune surveillance in        the immunocompetent host   This cytokine could        possibly also have a central role in therapeutic settings        It may have broad downstream effects that according to our        findings can be best summarized as activation and        maturation of monocytesDCs in concert with the release by        these cells of chemokines capable of attracting lymphoid        cells to the tumor These in turn may complete the        activation of cells of the monocytic lineage which can        then switch their function from crosstolerization to        crosspriming          A particular subset of genes whose expression appeared        to be associated with a clinical response was noted        Although this observation was based on a single lesion we        were surprised to observe among them the genes for NKG        MHC class II which was upregulated beyond the level noted        in nonresponding samples and Tcell receptor which have        all been recently associated with acute rejection of renal        allografts    and M Sarwal unpublished data The        phenomenon of allograft rejection and ILinduced tumor        rejection may not only be characterized by the induction of        a vigorous inflammatory response but share a common        cytotoxic effector mechanism NKTcell degranulation that        is ultimately responsible for direct tissue destruction        This observation agrees with the suggested synergistic role        of IFN and effector T cells in controlling tumor growth        in experimental models           In vitro studies are presently        ongoing testing whether the changes in expression profile        noted in tumor samples following IL administration can be        directly ascribed to the effects of IFN andor IL on        monocytes                    Conclusions        The results of this study suggest that IL        administration induces inflammation at the tumor site with        three predominant secondary effects activation of        antigenpresenting monocytes a massive production of        chemoattractants that may recruit other immune cells to the        tumor site among which are the chemokines MIG and PARC        specific for T cells and the activation of lytic        mechanisms ascribable to monocytes calgranulin        grancalcin and NK cells for example NKG NK Figure         In practical terms these results suggest that systemic        IL administration may facilitate Tcell effector function        in the target organ not by sustaining their proliferation        as presently believed but rather by promoting their        migration and by providing a milieu conducive to their        activation         in situ through activation of        antigenpresenting cells If this hypothesis is correct        then adoptive transfer of effector T cells should follow        rather than precede as at present administration of        systemic IL                       Materials
