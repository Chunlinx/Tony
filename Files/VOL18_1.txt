is a case in point  The words are notunrelated and they have not been selected at randomfor they all have one thing very much in commonnamely they are all Hindi loanwords  To besure Hindi is not the ultimate source in all cases butit was at least the final stopping point in the journeyof the words into the English lexicon  In this articleHindi is used to cover loanwords which etymologistsattribute to either Hindi or Urdu  The two arebasically the same language except that Hindi iswritten in Devanagari characters and Urdu inPersianArabic script  Hindi has in fact been amore

nowhere have I foundmore abbreviations and acronyms in use than in theUS particularly in the medical field  In the smallcommunity hospital where I teach and practice hematologyand oncology I frequently struggle to decodethe abbreviations and acronyms used by housestaff and medical students  While this process isfrustrating at times certain abbreviations and acronymsadd humor to the atmosphere of busy andstressful daytoday medical practice  For examplewhile we often say that a patient needs lots of TLCTender Loving Care at times we end up seeing theresult of another TLC Total Lack of ConcernMany of us including me use WNL for Within NormalLimits to describe the results of various xrayand laboratory tests however at times we find thismay well mean We Never Looked When NMRNuclear Magnetic Resonance which is now betterreferred to as MRI Magnetic Resonance Imagingwas first introduced to the medical communitymany consumer advocates and insurance peoplefearing the escalating healthcare costs associatedwith this expensive diagnostic procedure thought abetter translation would be No More RadiologistsDRG Diagnosis Related Group the term UncleSam uses to describe prospective payment to a hospitalcould mean Damned Regulatory Governmentto the medical profession or De The RevenuesGone to the hospital administration            For those of us in medicine we all carry a titleMD   Doctor of Medicine  When I was drafted intothe US Army as a Medical Officer my title wasDal Yoo MD USA United States Army and Irecall my Master Sergeants morbid joke that MD USA could stand for Many Die and U Shall AlsoSpeaking of various titles MDs are not the onlyones who get the bad names  BS Bachelor of Sciencecould well mean bullshit MS More of theSame and PhD Pile Higher and Deeper etc            In the field of medical laboratory testing youmay remember a test called the SIA for detectingabnormal macroglobulin in the serum  The test isperformed by putting a drop of serum into distilledwater producing a grossly visible white precipitatein patients with Waldenstroms macroglobulinemiaand other dysproteinemic disorders  Dr Waldenstromsome years ago told me that he had an opportunityto meet Dr Sia a Chinese physician who firstintroduced this simple bedside technique to medicineHowever when I was in West Germany thisSIA test was labeled as Serum In Aqua  Anotherexample comes from VIP Vasoactive Intestinal PolypeptideThis assay was quite variable from laboratoryto laboratory when first introduced thus itmeant Very Inconsistent Polypeptide to some ofthe gastroenterologists and surgeons who were ponderingthe possibility of pancreatic surgery in patientswith high levels of VIP             These abbreviations and acronyms are generatinglaughter in daytoday life as well as in the medicalfield  Some time ago I heard that PresidentBushs budget proposal was DOA Dead On Arrivalon the congressional floor  However PresidentBushs interpretation of DOA was Defining Opportunityfor America  More recently during the warin the Gulf we saw both pro and antiwar demonstrationsthus generating SMASH Students MobilizedAgainst Saddam Hussein as well as SCUDSadly Confused Unpatriotic Demonstrators  Attimes abbreviations or acronyms get upsidedown aswell as backward meanings  In President Cartersdays when inflation was sky high Democrats usedthe slogan WIN Whip Inflation Now Republicansturned the WIN button upside down making it NIMNo Immediate Miracle  For the backward exampleI saw the sign for DAM which is supposed torepresent Mothers Against Dyslexia            When I first visited Philadelphia to plan my futurepostgraduate training a local acquaintance gaveme a quick city tour which included the worldfamousPhiladelphia Museum of Art  The windowsof the museum gave some nice views of downtownPhiladelphia  The visit was in early summer whenongoing road pavement work was generating strongsmells  From the museum window we could see aneon sign with PSFS in bright letters on one of thehighrise downtown buildings  The letters stood forPhiladelphia Savings Fund Society but on that day Itold my local guide that they stood more appropriatelyfor Philadelphia Smells Funny SometimesHowever I later fell in love with this city of brotherlylove not only for its excellent medical trainingbut also for its rich metropolitan atmosphere            Speaking of smells we have the organizationcalled NOSE in the Washington suburban areawhich as you may have guessed stands for NeighborsOrganization for Stench Elimination  NOSE isfighting for the beautification of residential housingdistricts  Like everything else the meaning of certainabbreviations or acronyms could vary dependingon the observer  The Belgian airline calledSABENA could stand for Such A Bad ExperienceNever Again but also could mean Such a BeautifulExperienceNever Alone  Indeed we do not seemto be able to get away from numerous abbreviationsand acronyms every day of our lives because newspapersmagazines and TV newscasts love to comeup with new and innovative ones  The latest scandalof the television ministry concerns the organizationknown as PTL  which is supposed to stand for PraiseThe Lord or People That Love others think itmeans Pass The Loot  In this era of the litigationpronesociety including the high rate of malpracticesuits I noted an organization called HALT HelpAbolish Legal Tyranny I welcome any means ofbringing laughter into bedside medicine which weall think of as the last place where one could everfind any decent humor  When the medical practicegets tough particularly for those truly complicatedcases where I have no idea what the patient has Iapply my favorite of all the abbreviations GOK syndromeGod Only Knows

     Once again the myth of GermanreplacingEnglishbyonlyonevotehas surfaced this time in thepages of VERBATIM XVII   The myth began itslife in midth century histories attempting to documentthe contributions of Germans to Americanculture and history  But it is no more than a myth            There was a languagerelated vote that may bethe ultimate source of the myth but that vote hadnothing to do with choosing an official language  Itdid not take place in  as is often maintainedbut on January   when the House of Representativesdebated a proposal not to give Germanany official status but merely to print copies of thefederal laws in German as well as English  An ad hoccommittee reported favorably on the proposal butduring the debate a motion to adjourn failed by onevote  The failure of the motion to adjourn probablyrepresents a vote of no confidence in the committeereport  After some further debate which focusednot so much on translation as on the means by whichcopies of the English versions of the federal statuteswere to be furnished to the individual states a newcommittee was appointed to study the matter andreport to the House  In the final vote which tookplace one month later the proposal for translationwas defeated  The ayes and nays of the final vote arenot recorded  It is from the close interim vote noton an actual bill but on adjournment that the socalledGerman vote legend has been built            There is a further bit of embroidery to themyth it is often claimed that F A MuhlenbergSpeaker of the House and member of a prominentassimilationist German family stepped down to castthe deciding vote damning German in the US foreverto minoritylanguage status Muhlenbergs detractorsgo so far as to assert that his own Germanwas pretty incompetent  But while Muhlenbergsvoting record in the Third Congress did not seem toannoy his German American constituents they didreact quite strongly when as Speaker of the FourthCongress he stepped down and cast the decidingnegative vote against the Jay Treaty  This actioncaused his brotherinlaw to stab him and it cost himhis congressional seat in the  election as wellThis significant tiebreaker soon became confusedwith the earlier adjournment cliffhanger convenientlyfleshing out the myth of the German vote                               A helpful letter from Colyn L Phillips of FrederickMaryland provides three possibly useful referencesfor those who might wish to document this issue further American State Papers Volume  Class                         MiscellaneousNumber  Laws published in German

Mr Phillips adds             During this same Congress there were also proposalsto adopt the metric system of weights andmeasures as the official American standard  Theseproposals also failed as I remember from longagoreading by a close margin                              Americans are frequently guilty of nonsenseabout the German language but it is regrettable tosee it spilling over into your pages  Thus in Redundancyin Natural Languages XVII Mr SteveBonner cites two German nouns Autoreparaturwerkstattand Haupthandelsartikel  as being simplylonger than they strictly need to be  These two arealleged to mean garage and staple  But a garage isnot necessarily an auto repair workshop and a principalstock in trade is not necessarily a staple exceptin the loosest sense  Actually the German nounStapel is used much more precisely than its Englishcounterpart as in such terms as Gabelstapler forklifttruck and more poetically as in Hochstapler swindlerThe immense combinative resources of theGerman language may lead to the creation of ponderousnouns but seldom to redundancies                              William H Doughertys article FrenchLeave XVII  concerning the difficulty of translatingsatisfactorily the title of the movie Au Revoirles Enfants  reminds me of a conversation that as anundergraduate at Princeton I had in the s withProfessor Maurice E Coindreau who was engagedin translating Hemingway into French  As an exampleof one kind of difficulty that translators faceCoindreau cited the title of Faulkners The Unvanquishedand asked Is it plural or singular  Masculineor feminine  He said that the translators R NRaimbault and CP Gorce had put those questionsto Faulkner who only laughed  Knowing that any ofthe four possibilities would considerably narrow

VERBATIMS readerslallaperuser a worldclass editor                                          Upon reading Adrian Rooms Dont Get YourTitles in a Twist XVI  I was happily surprised tosee reference made to the tiny misspelled but spellbindingnovel by Daisy Ashford The Young Visiters I have been an ardent admirer of Miss Daisy eversince  when I had the good fortune to be castin a dramatization of her novel presented at theStrand Theatre London in January of that year  Itwas a special matinee under the auspices of theStage Society with a cast drawn exclusively fromchildren of prominent theatrical families  We wereall between the ages of seven and fifteen which wasentirely appropriate since Miss Ashford had writtenher novel at the age of nine            My father Ernest Truex had been appearing inLondons West End for several years and was currentlystarring in Good Morning Bill  by PGWodehouse thereby assuring my brother Jim andme of an invitation to audition for James WhaleWhale was a brilliant man of the theater who worethree hats on this occasion donating his services asdirector producer and scenic designer  After theauditions it was announced that I had been cast asthe Prince of Wales the future Edward VII and Jimwas to play an old crony of his the Earl of ClinchamThis was pretty exciting stuff            The program proclaimed that Miss Daisy Ashfordsfamous story dramatized by Miss MargaretMackenzie and Mrs George Norman will be actedby the following promising juveniles  Therefollowed a list of more than thirty names  The leadingcharacters were played by Christopher Cassonson of Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson as MrSalteena and Dorothy Hyson daughter of Dorothyand Carl Hyson as Ethel Monticue Christopherssister Ann Casson read the passages whichlinked up the various scenes            I still remember the enthusiastic reception wegot from the audience but better still I can quotefrom the glowing review we got from St John Irvinethe eminent critic for The London Observer who observed that Christopher displayed all thesigns that denote an accomplished comedian  Asfor Dorothy Mr Irvine called her a very beautifullittle girl and at the risk of turning her head she hasthe makings of a very good actress  And our narratorAnn Casson read the passages with a clearnessof utterance that was remarkable Towards the endof the review Mr Irvine added Mr Ernest Truexstwo sons Philip and James were extremely divertingin their parts and I was greatly touched by thespectacle of Philip Truex in the part of the Prince ofWales solemnly removing his crown during thesinging of the National Anthem  I decided thenand there to go on the stage                           The Young Visiters lent itself readily to dramatizationexcept that one loses the special sort ofcharm inherent in Daisys quaint spelling  But thereare other things to charm one in a stage version  Weall had the pleasure of getting to know Daisy a littlebit at rehearsals and felt very much at home withher which wasnt surprising since she was onlyabout eighteen herself            I was totally entranced by Dorothy Hyson andbefore we had to return to school I persuaded ourmothers to take us to the circus  There I had thethrill of winning a canary by rolling a penny down aslide into a tiny bullseye  With a flourish I presentedit to Dorothy  Soon after that my father got agood offer to return to Broadway and I didnt seeDorothy again until a number of years later whenshe came to New York in a play titled Most of theGame   Well sure enough Mr Irvine was right shewas a beautiful womanand a good actress  Butalas she was married  She did however confide tome that our canary was still in good voice            In  Doubleday wisely reissued The YoungVisiters  and it got a rave review by Alan Friedmanin The New York Times   He called it a tiny novelthat begs comparison with giants Tolstoys War andPeace  Flauberts Sentimental Education  and LawrencesWomen in Love may be bigger but TheYoung Visiters too manages to contain and displaymore gracefully than the giants an entire civilizationHe added that Daisy Ashford is as ambitiousas George Eliot and as innovative as Gertrude Steinand Virginia Woolf  Well as Beatrice Lillie used tosay You could have knocked me over with afender  I really had not thought about The YoungVisiters in that context  That is to say in  webudding thespians looked on acting in the play assimply a joyous lark  We loved the story and thecharacters but we had never heard of Flaubert orTolstoy  At this stage in my life I could see thatFriedman was on to something I knew for instancethat some readers suspected that JM Barrie whohad written the Introduction had written the novelhimself and I had sneered at that theory  But Friedmanwent further than that  He insisted that Nothingin Barries fiction can match Ashfords chefdoeuvreBut most of all even though sheshows us a world of buffoonsfor no one escapesshe causes us to love them  And I say Amen tothat                              Though my Chinese is rudimentary I cannothelp commenting as my eyes fall on the first page ofVERBATIM XVII  that Bonners statement Chinesehas no notion of tense is erroneous  As in thecase of the future tense in English tense in Chineseis indicated by an auxiliary verb or a particle not byinflection of the verb  One would translate the CaesareanVeni video vincam into Chinese somethinglike Wo laide kan yao desheng                              The Bummel is a German river Dont GetYour Titles in a Twist XVI   If so neither theRand McNally nor the Times atlas has noticed itNor do the etymologies in Duden and Langenscheidt If my memory is reliable Jerome was rhapsodizingabout the experiences of three friends on a footloosebicycle tour  Take away the bicycles and it is asnear to the meaning of ein Bummel as one can getThe German usage is worth comparing with the obsolescentAmerican bummer and with bummle inBritish dialect  Could your contributor notwithstandinghis correct identification of the backgroundto Three Men on the Bummel  be confusing it withthe betterknown Three Men in a Boat  where thescenery is decidedly fluvial            Both German and English employ the definitearticle where the indefinite would be equally appropriateMight not Jerome who knew Germany welland spoke German fluently have simply chosen theslightly more forceful of the two alternative titles                               In all fairness it must be said that Mr Room wroteas soon as he realized his slip in

will be unhappy with a reviewthat begins  The Surname Dictionary  in particularbecomes the best available work on the subjectseveral points in Leslie Dunklings remarks on ADictionary of Surnames XVII  require comment            He writes the awkward fact is that a greatmany people will consult it in vain for informationabout their own names  He is right that the dictionaryconcentrates on the more frequent namesthough it is not limited to these yet that is inevitablein a first attempt at a panEuropean dictionaryEven so the book contains almost seventy thousandfamily names which is nothing to sneeze at in a pioneeringeffort  Future editions will of coursecontain more            The authors say that if they came across reliableinformation about rarer names they wrote entriesIn other words if someone else had done theresearch in what appeared to be a scholarly waythey took advantage of it  One should not thinkthat the book is a scissorsandpaste job  The compilerswrite the number of reliable referenceworks on family names is remarkably small pxlvii  After mentioning these few they concludeAt this point the list of honourable exceptions beginsto run out p xlviii  Therefore to compensatefor the scarcity of reliable secondary literaturethe compilers turned to many specialists  From thefive pages of personal acknowledgments as opposedto a mere two pages of bibliography it should beclear that the dictionary rests largely on original researchAs special consultant for the Jewishnames I can say that all of my explanations are originalwith me  How the Jewish names were

with its metalanguageciting lines which contain several abbreviationsand technical terms  With fortyone pages ofIntroduction and two pages devoted to the resolutionof abbreviations the task is not as hard as hemakes it out to be            He writes genealogical information is occasionallyadded but only when the families concernedare important according to a very traditionaldefinition of that word  Yes and that isbecause genealogical information is most abundantfor such people what for instance is known aboutthe ancestry of Frankie Vaughan  Also if anyoneinfers from later remarks in Mr Dunklings reviewabout the noble theme that only noble familiesare the subject of genealogical notes that assumptionwould be wrong there are genealogicalvignettes for George Washington John AdamsAbraham Lincoln the Roosevelts and many othercommoners            What I missed in Mr Dunklings remarks ismention of a major innovation in this dictionarynesting  The family names are not listed as in a telephonedirectory merely in alphabetical order withno articulation between one entry and the nextrather if names are etymologically related to oneanother they are all listed under the same entryFor example over  names appear under George Moreover within each entry the names are brokendown according to form and structurefor examplevariants cognates diminutives augmentativespatronymics and patronymics from diminutiveswith further classification according to languageand comment  A page alphabetical index guidesthe user to the location of the names  A Dictionaryof Surnames is thus

HYMANKAPLAN  which appeared in the late sand early s and which dealt with the amusing difficultiesof a Jewish immigrant from the Russian Paleof Settlement in coping with what we now call Englishas a second language  Rostens articles weregoodhumored and there was no intimation of negativeor hostile feeling toward an ethnic minority  Tobe sure as it was fiction Rosten exaggerated a bitbut the reallife models were then extant and I canvouch for at least one from my own experience            In the s my father a certified public accountantin Boston acquired a client named MorrisKaplan an

accent and intonation Mr Kaplanhad a knack for transmogrifying the AnguishLanguish into levels of meaning scarcely intendedby its users  I can cite two examples            One noontime Mr Kaplan and my father wentout to lunch from my fathers office on DevonshireStreet  Within a few paces they encountered an acquaintanceof Mr Kaplans  Mr Pincus said KaplanI want you should meet mine

Websters College Dictionary            This dictionary might be said to be the grandsonof The Random House Dictionary of the English Language College Edition   of which I was editorin chief with the late Stuart B Flexner as managingeditor and the greatgrandson of the American CollegeDictionary  ACD   of which Clarence LBarnhart was editor in chief  There are naturallymany resemblances among the three and to the CollegeEdition Revised Edition   reviewed in VolumeII Number  pp ff in VERBATIM VolumesI  II   Before discussing the content I may be alloweda comment on the title            It is taken as given in the dictionary business inthe US that if a dictionary bears the name Websterit magically attracts sales far beyond those of adictionary that tries to rely for its success on qualityalone  Compared to the softdrink business that islike saying that all cola drinks ought to be calledCocaCola though one would be legally enjoinedfrom doing so  Not so with Webster  for owing to abit of folly in the s G  C Merriam Companyof Springfield Massachusetts successors to the lineof dictionaries originated by Noah Webster publisheda synonym dictionary and called it a Webster World Publishing Company of Cleveland had thewit to see that Merriam had in effect forsworn itsbirthright for Noah had never published a synonymdictionary  World called its dictionary WebstersNew World  Merriam sued and lost confirming thatthe appellation Webster had fallen into the publicdomain  That is why virtually every American dictionaryof any shape size provenance comprehensivenessquality and lexicographic persuasion islikely to be called a Webster these days            When I was director of the reference departmentat Random House during the s at meetingsheld with Bennett Cerf Donald Klopfer andLew Miller sales director we often touched on thematter of what the new dictionary successor to theACD  was to be called  It was pointed out then thatincluding the name Webster in the title would belikely to increase the sales by a measurable amountbut Bennett and Donald staunchly independent andproud of the successes gained in the name of RandomHouse  would not hear of it  It was I who proposedthe original title for the series of dictionariespublished from  onwards The Random HouseDictionary of the English Language  UnabridgedEdition College Edition School Edition  and anyother subtitles that might come along  From what Iknow of Bennett and Donald the decision to includeWebster in the title of this book has probably setthem spinning in their graves            There is another aspect to this change lamentablyit emphasizes the abiding ignorance and gullibilityof the dictionarybuying public  Anyone whocompares the multifarious dictionaries bearing theWebster name cannot help observing the differencesin quality quantity and treatment offered the namehas become meaningless made inferior by its universalapplication to virtually any kind of dictionary            While I am making general observations Imight add for the record that my review of the edition of the Random House College was notfavourable because it was based on an examination ofthe entries mentioned in Jess Steins Preface I hadout of a feeling of sympathetic and loyal associationwith the books  edition which still constitutedmore than ninety per cent of the  edition selectedfor analysis the words mentioned in the Prefaceon the premise that they were showcase entrieswhich the editors were especially proud of  Asit turned out I was compelled to point out severalglaring errors in most of those entries and Jess Steinnever spoke to me again  I must confess to beingdispleased at Steins having removed my name fromthe title page of a book only slightly changed fromits first edition so that he could insert his own aseditor in chief but that was nothing new for him ashe had deleted from later editions of the ACD thename of its editor in chief Clarence L Barnhart toinsert his own  So much for De mortuis             The present work contains  entriesfully  more than the  edition and more than the  edition  It would be a waste oftime to go through the editions noting the differencesin most cases the editors followed the wisedictum If it aint broke dont fix it so little hasbeen done to the basic information in the originaledition  The  edition of Websters Ninth NewCollegiate introduced the practice of giving in theetymologies dates of earliest occurrence datapresumably derived from the Oxford English Dictionaryfor while Merriam and Random Housemaintained a citation file for the tracking of newwords and senses there was no point in duplicatingwork done long ago by Murray et al  It is questionableto what purpose users of dictionaries are toput this information  Naive usersby far the majorityarebound to misinterpret the dates as meaningwhen the word first appeared in the languagerather than as the date of the earliest recorded evidencefound at press time  Moreover the datecannot be associated with any particular definitionso it is a bit misleading for an entry like log  whichhas several definitions to show it as having enteredthe language  In which sense  Andwhat is to be made of the following  All numbers from one through twelve arelisted as having entered English before  exceptfive for which bef  is given  Are weto conclude that people got along without thenumber five for a hundred years before someoneperhaps feeling that something was missingawoke one morning to invent it  If one looks up the ordinals the

the assumptionthat the names of the numbers emerged in numericalorder from the primeval ooze of language butone might mistakenly conclude that the very firstordinal to be talked about in English was eightieth and this at a time when only a small percentage ofthe population had a life expectancy of half thatAnd it might be imagined that in giving directions toget to ones hovel one would say Go to the fifthhovel and mine is the next one for sixth did notcome into being till the sixteenth century  Onewould expect the editors to have signaled the truthof the matter under Using This Dictionary despitethe reluctance of users to refer to such things  Butno here is the only commentwhen and how the word entered our languageincluding the date that it first appeared and itssource or relatives in other languages                        The redundancy of when and the date that is confusingenough but to describe the date as when theword first appeared is grossly misleading and inaccurateit is the date for the earliest written evidenceof the form  That might seem a nigglingpoint but dictionaries dwell and thrive on nigglingpoints and such misstatements are unforgivableThe editors would have been on safer ground hadthey simply followed the wording in the RandomHouse Unabridged  to witMost dates are expressed as a spread of yearsgiving the time within which the earliest documentcontaining the main entry was written orpublished  In many cases a term may haveexisted in the spoken language long before it firstappeared in texts and in any event earlier writtenevidence may exist that has not yet been discoveredor reported  p xxxiv                        The publication of college dictionaries in theUS provides an outstanding textbook demonstrationof the principles of competitive free enterpriseat work and of what used to be called supply anddemand but is now dubbed market forces  Thereare five major dictionaries of approximately thesame size competing for buyers in the market  It isimpossible to get an accurate figure for the totalmarket which has been estimated at two millionsales a year  Publishers steadfastly refuse to revealtheir sales figures because of the highly competitivenature of the business though it is generally acknowledgedthat Websters Ninth New Collegiateoutsells its nearest competitor by about two to oneThat nearest competitor is probably Websters NewWorld rd Edition  with the Random House Collegeoccupying a niche to be filled by the book underreview and the American Heritage nd Edition neckand neck for third place and Websters II New Riversidebringing up the rear in this horserace  Theseare only guesses            The fierce competition among the dictionariesresults in what must be regarded as the greatestbook bargain in the history of publishing taking theRandom House Websters as a typical example itcontains  million characters say  millionwords for which one pays  which works out toabout  words per dollar  The average novelof  words for  works out at  wordsper dollar  This is all the more astonishing when oneconsiders that the publishers maintain fulltime staffsof skilled lexicographers and editors to keep theirdictionaries up to date by continuously monitoringboth the language and other kinds of data like populationfigures for geopolitical entries death dates forbiographical entries etc  Consider too that thequality of the paper printing and binding of suchdictionaries is far superior to that of most otherbooks available creating a cost per copy of about  Were all these factors taken into consideration innormal pricing procedures in the industry a collegedictionary ought to retail for about  a copy  Oneis given to wonder how manufacturers of other stapleconsumer products manage to come up withidentical packaging say  pint  fluidounces or pounds  ounces and identical pricing on supermarketshelves without being in collusion even themost cursory view of college dictionary publishingat once reveals a most extraordinary example of theworkings of market forces no publisher wants tobe the first to break the  barrier the Indexededition of the Random House is the first to touch thatmystical figure            Random House dictionaries from the ACD onwardhave always been known for their ease of useand the clarity and understandability of the informationpresented  The book at hand supports that reputationNotwithstanding people who use dictionariesregularly become accustomed to one whichbecomes their favorite for any number of reasonsfor purposes of utility and for philosophical reasonsI prefer geographical and biographical entries to beinterfiled with other entries in one alphabetical listingothers prefer to have them separate  To be sureif one is going to spend  or so the dictionaryselected ought to be the most up to date and havethe largest number of entries a bit of reasoning notlost on the crowd at Random House  Besidesalthough publishers seldom get into such detail inthe publicity about their dictionaries the more entriesa dictionary has the more definitions it hasThat is not the truism it appears to be as lexicographersadd entries increasing the depth to which thelexicon is being probed they must add definitionsproportionally increasing the coverage of existingentries which often accomplishes little or nothing toincrease the entry count            Some dictionaries offer more information thanothers about the entries they cover  Thus on averageWebsters Ninth New Collegiate and the RandomHouse Websters College contain at least fifteen percent more information per entry than American Heritageand Websters New World  A copy of WebstersII Riverside was not available for this comparisonbut is unlikely to come up to the last two            In all this talk about entries it must be rememberedthat the accepted practice in countingdictionary entries in the US and becoming thestandard in the UK as well is to count not onlyheadwords or main entries but inflected forms variantschanges in part of speech runon words likecunningly and cunningness under cunning  and listwords like reaccuse and reacquire  which need nodefinition  A dictionary with say  entries islikely to have no more than  headwords            Other desirable or desired features might influencethe purchase of a dictionary according to acomparison chart provided by Random House itsdictionary has  illustrations Websters Ninth Websters New World  and Webster IIRiverside   But the American Heritage has  Most British dictionaries have traditionallyhad no illustrations at all            I must admit that I have not been watching verycarefully the admittance of the naughty bits of thelanguage into dictionaries but I am pleased to seethat their omission so long a sop to the Cerbereanselfstyled guardians of the language chiefly struthiousprovincials in the Bible Belt Texas andbelieveit or notCalifornia has ended  I do objecthowever to the label Vulgar given to such entries  Iam sure that the label is the product of endless hoursof agonizing discussion but I think they came upwith the wrong solution  Vulgar still carries thestrong denotation exemplified in the first hence themost frequently encountered sense characterizedby ignorance of or lack of good breeding or tastevulgar ostentation  It has congeners like vulgariana vulgar person vulgarism   the state or qualityof being vulgar   something vulgar as an act orexpression vulgarize   to make vulgar or coarselower debase   popularize Vulgate   lc  commonly used or accepted common  Theproblem in reviewing these sets of definitions is thatone can never be sure which definition of vulgarought to be applied to its use in the definitions of theancillary entries for the word has a spectrum ofmeanings  I often think that it would not be untowardfor a dictionary to add to its entries for wordsthat also serve as labels eg Colloquial InformalSlang  etc definitions that begin As used for labelsin this dictionary In the event a usermight well be confused about seeing the label Vulgarapplied to fourletter words when its definitionsseem to indicate that it means merely in badtaste  My own choice for a label is Taboo  which isincisively denotative  Its main definition in the RandomHouse reads proscribed by society as improperor unacceptable taboo words  which I believeis a lot closer to what the editors were seekingthan Vulgar             I cannot conclude this review without commentingon an element of dictionary marketing thatI think may be infra dig these days namely the attemptat hoopla  Dictionaries are generally consistentproducts of superior scholarship and care atthis stage of the game trying to change what MadisonAvenue calls brand loyalty is like gettingsomeone who has been driving a Ford all his life toswitch to a Toyota  As Ford and Toyota know that isfar from impossible but manufacturers find it verycostly to effect the change  Publishers grasp at anythingthey think might catch the fancy of the dictionarybuyer  Random House has come up touting itstreatment of entries like gal and girl  as in Gal FridayIll get my girl secretary to type up this letterright away   The treatment is good and it might beunique among the deskcollege dictionariesIdont waste my time checking such triviabut it is ashame to see publishers relying on such undignifiedapproaches  On the other hand pecunia non oletand todays market might need just such an incentiveto choose one dictionary over another            Another ploy has been to get major newspapersand other media to acknowledge their reliance on aparticular dictionary to decide spelling mainly andI suppose other language matters  Unfortunatelythat leads to inconsistencies for dictionaries reportwhat they find and are not intended as sources ofprescriptive decisions  Thus a given dictionarymight hyphenate thickskinned thickskulled  andthickwitted but not thickheaded eg the RandomHouse nd Unabridged   We know that the languageis inconsistent and there can be nothing wrong inreporting that fact the dictionary merely reflectsthe practice of the majority of written citationsavailable to its compilers  But it must be said thatspace is at a premium in these expensive books andif say a dozen citations are found for each of thespellings thickwitted and thickwitted  one can besure that no lexicographer thrifty of space will displaythe variant whichever he perceives that to beBut publishers are not bound by such variety neatnessis a virtue in publishing newspapers magazinesand books and no publisher who produced a stylebook that required all such compounds to be consistentlyspelled with or without a hyphen could besubjected to criticism for yielding randomness tologic  I would be the last one to stake anythingworthwhile on the statistical base used for determiningthe preferred spellings in dictionaries  Thuswhen a dictionary is touted as the one used by suchandsucha newspaper readers should think back tothe number of times that paper has been cited inSIC seldom for the kinds of things that dictionarieshave much bearing onand discount the claimsfor adoption as so much hype  After all the use ofa hyphen in adverbadjective compounds is a matterof style which can be described in a rule in positionbefore a noun compounds with well indeed anynot ending in  ly like wellheeled wellknownwellthoughtout  are hyphenated as in wellheeledgambler wellknown manabouttown a wellthoughtoutplan  but when they are in predicativeposition as in Is she well heeled enough to sit in onour game His peccadillos are well known to his wifeThe plan was well thought out  or if they end in  lyin any position they are two words as in That ischiefly British usage this usage is chiefly AmericanWhy then list thousands of hyphenated well wordsWith such a simple rule would anyone needto look such words up in a dictionary            To sum up the Random House Websters Dictionaryis an excellent dictionary containing uptodateinformation about the English lexicon inAmerica and to a limited extent elsewhere  Indeedwhile I was writing this review an acquaintancephoned to say that he had to replace all theaging dictionaries in his office and asked me to recommenda replacement  I recommended this bookwithout hesitation or reservation  It might be

admired VERBATIM I cannot recall anarticle on the language of public speakingor ifthe reader insists oratory  That being the case andbecause I am a longtime professional speechwriterI feel it incumbent on me to remedy the deficiency            I will concede that there may not be anotherreader who is the least bit interested in speechwritingper se indeed many might well disdain it becauseafter all it is one of the most lucrative formsof writing  But my guess is that many will be variouslybemused enchanted and appalled by some ofthe rules for good speech writing that run quitecounter to the rules for good writing for print            One widely acknowledged tenet for speechwritingis to use simple and direct sentence structureand to keep sentences as short as feasible  There isnothing remarkable about that but the fact is thatsentence structure that is commonly accepted inwriting for printthat in fact is not only stylisticallyimpeccable but is virtually indispensable to expertwriterscan be taboo to speechwriters            I refer for example to something along the followinglines Although the economy is in extremelypoor shape my company has been reporting excellentfinancial results  That is what we speechwritinggurus call bassackward sentence structure            What is wrong with it  The same thing essentiallythat makes homophones horrendous nonos inspeeches  Whereas a document is read a speech isheard   Yes of course everyone knows that but perhapsthought is seldom given to its implications ofwhich there are many  Homophones can be purepoison in a speech  A hapless auditor might conceivablyspend several minutes thinking the speaker isdiscussing say roles  when hes actually discussingrolls  By the time the light of comprehensionflashes the listener might have lost the thread completely            As for convoluted and backsideto sentencesthe problem is that the point of a statement shouldordinarily come first  If your company is reportingexcellent financial results say so right out then addthe impressive fact that this success has beenachieved despite a weak economy  Serve the entrefirst let the other courses follow            This is even true of the proper treatment ofmodifiers  Suppose one wants to brag that his companyhas just completed a new stateoftheartmillion completely computerized footlongreverberating furnace  It should never be putthat way  A long string of modifiers in advance of anoun is frustrating and confusing to listeners theywant to knowright offwhat the speaker is talkingabout  Good speech style calls for My companyjust completed a new stateoftheart reverberatingfurnace  It cost  million  Its feet long  Itsetc            The speaker should get to the point and getthere with maximum effectiveness which is why signalingis an indispensable technique in any speechwritersbag of tricks  While one would never writeWould you like to guess how much our new reverberatingfurnace cost my company  No takersWell listen carefully and Ill tell you that isexcellent speechwriting style if only because challengingthe audience in a sprightly conversationalmanner tends to awaken snoozers and invigorate thelethargic  On a more positive note there cannot beany question of the value of alerting audiences thatinformation worth listening to is forthcoming            While on that particular subject how about restatingsomething important that has just been saidGood form  That furnace cost us  millionThats right I said a cool  million  Consider ita rule that facts and figures that a serious readerwould reread in a printed text should be repeatedorally in a speech  If he thinksor looksbackover a few of the points I have made the reader willrealize that speech textsor at least important passageswithin such textsoften are longer and wordierthan comparable writings for print and necessarilyso  After all speakers have to rely entirely onaudience comprehension through hearing and aspeakers words skitter by so swiftly            Can a speaker reasonably expect his audience toremember anything at all about that big furnace ifhe has spent only a few seconds describing itSpeakers who want to impress their audiences knowthey have to telegraph key points and facts thenannounce them then repeat dramatize explainand embellish            Finallyand this may come as the most unkindestcut of all to puristsmost speeches call foruse of conversational colloquial English  Mostspeakers on most speaking occasions should soundnatural not pedantic  Were going to do it ismore natural and sounds more natural than Wewill do it  Similarly Weve got to do it is morenatural than We must do it  I would hazard aguess that scores of words and phrases in virtuallyevery one of the  or so executive speeches I havewritten through the years would be criticized bymost highschool English teachers            I have not given the whole story there aremany other differences

correctly derives hawser fromthe obsolete verb hawse which had indeed thesense of to hoist but is really a derivative asshown of the Latin altusBut as the NED says there was an earlyconfusion of course by popular etymology withthe Scand  hls a neck and its derivative hawseholebut we ought not to be misled by such aspecious bit of guesswork  I speak feelingly for Iwas caught once in this particular trap as shownby the article on hawser in my Etymological Dictionaryfor which I was promptly rebuked byMr Wedgwood in  twentyseven years agoand that is why I so fully recanted my heresy inthe Supplement  We are now invited to entangleourselves once more in the old mesheswhich I decline to doThe verb to haul has nothing whatever to dowith either hawse or hawser

of phoneticdecay because it pleases Prof Skeat to saythat whenever a writer uses the word corruptionwe may safely assume him to be guessing  Itis the one word that is prized above all others bythose who prefer assertion to fact                        Here is Skeat fuming at a correspondent whohad the gall to suggest that the origin of the Ox  inOxford  long a bone of etymological contentioncould be traced through Usk to a connection withGaelic uisque water as in uisquebaugh literally waterof life from which we get whiskey etymologicallyspeakingNot only fifty years ago but even at thepresent time there are people who are ignorantof the commonest principles of language and refuseto admit any phonetic laws or to take anytrouble to discover the historical sequence offorms  Their only idea is that etymology is aquestion of assumption and assertion founded onguesswork and proclaimed by reiteration andbluster  They will never cease to repeat that Oxis a corruption of Ouse or Ose or Usk orsomething else that is completely ridiculous  Themore corruption there is in a guess the deeperis their conviction of its truthNotes  Queries th S X July                          In an issue of N  Q  not two weeks later incommenting on a correspondents plea for help intracing the form irpe  Skeat wroteAs to its origin there is nothing but to guess                        He might be seen to have got his final comeuppanceat the hands of one correspondent whowrote at length as follows about the etymology ofCambridge               In the present instance I am concernedwith Prof Skeat alone  I have already hadoccasion to allude to an unfortunate habitwhich Prof Skeat has of writing important noteswithout first consulting the full and accurate Indexesof N  Q and I am very sorry to beobliged to renew my accusation  On the formeroccasion the consequences were annoying to mebut of no great importance  Now the matter ismuch more serious for Prof Skeat has therebybeen led to attribute to himself entirely a derivationfor the word Cambridge which I propoundedboth in N  Q and in the Athenumso far back as                         One could forgive Prof Skeat for his note onCantabrigia th S ii  because twentythreeyears had then elapsed since my first note appearedHe had no doubt seen and read mynote which was the first in that number of N Q  and filled seven columns and a half for hewas even at that time a constant reader of N Q  as is shown by his having contributed nofewer than fifteen notes to the volume in whichmy note is to be found and very likely he hadcarried off an impression which in after years hecame to regard as an idea that had originated inhis own brain  Still as the interval between myfirst note and his first note was so great I do notknow that any great fault beyond that of carelessnesscan be attributed to him  At the sametime I thought it advisable in my note under thesame heading  Cantabrigia  to point out to himthat he had no doubt inadvertently been poachingon my preserves and I took advantage of theopportunity and filled up the lacunae in the stepsof the derivation which from want of evidencehad been left in my first note  I then naturallyenough looked upon the incident as closed  Butno Prof Skeat just three years lateragaintrusting to his memory which seems to be particularlyfaulty with regard to the contributions ofother correspondentsreturned to the chargeand this time under the heading of Cambridge wrote a longish note to the same effect as beforeand yet did not even once mention my nameAnd not only did he do this but he afterwardsmuch expanded this note and this expansionwas printed with the title Cambridge and theCam in the Cambridge Review   Jan It was not there however that I saw it but in AStudents Pastime  which has just been publishedby Prof Skeat in which the expanded note is reprintedin full and fills eight pages pp             Now I defy Prof Skeat or any one else whowill take the trouble to read the four notesquoted at the beginning of this note togetherwith the article in the Cambridge Review  andwho will compare what I have said with whatProf Skeat has saidI defy either the one or theother I say to find any material difference betweenus  Prof Skeat does indeed in his last andlongest note I mean the one in the CambridgeReview  go into the question as to how it came topass that the a in Cambridge is pronounced longas in came a point which I had not consideredandhe also differs from me in attributingwithout any apparent evidence the change of theGr of Granta into the C of Canta to the AngloFrenchscribes of the twelfth century for I wasand am still disposed to attribute it in part atleast to the undoubted confusion between theold forms of Cambridge and of Canterbury whichI have pointed out in both my notes  But neitherof these points can be regarded as of any greatimportance            It is indeed just possible that in this secondcase of forgetfulness the substitution of Cantabrigiaas a heading for the original Cambridgemay have had something to do with the matterbut if Prof Skeat had taken the trouble to consultthe Indexes as I have done his eye would certainlywhilst looking for Cambridge  have beencaught as my own was by Cantabridga  whichstands very near to it I think therefore thatthis time as the offence was repeated at the endof three years only there is hardly any excuse tobe found for Prof Skeat  At all events he seemsto me to have got into a very serious hobble atleast I should consider it so if I had as is thecase with Prof Skeat appropriated a derivationlong before made public by another personeven though I had done so in the most utterunconsciousness            In conclusion I trust that Prof Skeat will not inthis case ignore this note and repeat the offenceat some future time  I hope he will for once offersome little explanation and perhaps evensome words of excuse             Notes  Queries  th S X Nov

phenomena to haveemerged during the last hundred years or so is theacceptance of the notion that an important step insolving problems lies in naming them  Although itsphilosophy has been taken over by the field of psychiatryin which I include psychoanalysis the ideaof shriving oneself of fears and other besetting difficultieshas its rootsas far as Western culture isconcernedin the confessional though it seemslikely that reflexes of that procedure could be discoveredin profound Eastern religions if not in shamanisticpractices  In some ways the fields of psychologyand psychiatry can be said to rely on theability of the practitioner to give a name to a conditionwhether it be normality schizophrenia paranoia or some other term  Naming is a reverse formof defining in that the process calls for determining adiscrete set of differentia and giving the set a uniquetitle  The next time that set of differentia is encounteredit serves to identify the problem in much thesame way that a physician encountering a combinationof chest rash high fever Kopliks spots diagnosesfor which read names an affliction as measlesOnce identified the procedure for treating measlesis well established  The difficulty that arises withmental and psychological afflictions is that the proceduresare not well establishedindeed might besaid to be quite chaotic ranging from putting patientsinto straitjackets to having them lie down tofree associate or otherwise try to relieve themselvesof their burdens or to administer tranquilizersor other drugs that alter the chemistry of thebrain  That is not to say that such procedures cannotbe helpful in some cases but their results are not asuniformly predictable as they are in many establishedmedical procedures            We are all familiar with the naming processwhether it be with the great relief at hearing thedoctor say muscular strain instead of rheumatoidarthritis as he examines the xrays with the Sundaysupplement newspaper article
