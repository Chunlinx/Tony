                    Background        Gene entrapment has provided effective strategies for        insertional mutagenesis of mammalian cells in culture The        mutagens permit direct selection of clones in which        cellular genes have been disrupted and simplify the        characterisation of genes associated with recessive        mutations     Mutagenesis of embryoderived stem ES        cells coupled with in vitro genetic screens has been        widely used to analyse gene functions in mice     These        have included screens for mutations in developmentally        regulated genes        in genes regulated by        extracellular agonists      and in genes encoding        secreted and transmembrane proteins      Characterized        mutations include genes involved in intracellular        trafficking     transcriptional regulation             signal transduction          neural        development    and neural wiring     and axial        patterning      The rapid expansion of the nucleic        acid databases has had a tremendous impact on the        identification of genes disrupted by gene entrapment This        has led to the development of tagged sequence mutagenesis        a process by which genes disrupted in ES cells are        characterized at the nucleotide level prior to germline        transmission                Gene trap retroviruses developed in our laboratory        contain a selectable marker in the U region of the long        terminal repeat LTR of a replicationdefective Moloney        murine leukemia virus Selection for U gene expression        generates clones in which the provirus is positioned in or        near exons of actively transcribed genes and is expressed        on transcripts originating in the flanking cellular DNA            The vectors appear to be effective mutagens        Singlegene mutation frequencies are  fold higher        in cells isolated after gene trap selection than in cells        containing randomly integrated retroviruses     These        targeting frequencies also support the idea that retrovirus        can integrate throughout the genome and that most if not        all expressed genes can be disrupted Finally        approximately  of inserts selected in ES cells result in        obvious phenotypes following transmission into the mouse        germline       In the four cases examined the        virus appeared to induce null mutations                      In order to best utilise gene traps in genetic studies        it is necessary to understand the factors that allow        expression of the entrapment vectors and that determine        whether expression of the occupied gene will be disrupted        This is particularly true for tagged sequence mutagenesis        where one would like to predict by sequence alone the        effects of the targeting vector on cellular gene        expression For this a representative number inserts must        be characterised including those not associated with any        discernible phenotype Most previously analysed mutations        were selected because of phenotypes observed after germline        transmission and thus are unlikely to reveal mechanisms        that could allow expression of the entrapment vector        without disrupting expression of the occupied gene        The present study characterized a mutation in the B        cell line induced by the UNeo gene trap retrovirus            This insert was selected for study because the provirus        inserted into a widely expressed gene and yet no phenotype        was observed in mice homozygous for the provirus Further        analysis revealed that the provirus integrated into an        intron of murine homologue of the human hnRNP AB gene        The gene encodes two related nuclear ribonucleoproteins        hnRNP A and hnRNP B members of a large family of RNA        binding proteins found associated with mammalian        heterogeneous nuclear RNA                        Results                  The B Provirus integrates into the hnRNPAB          gene          The B cell line was isolated by infecting D ES          cells with the UNeo gene trap retrovirus and selecting          for G resistant clones     B cells contain a          single intact provirus as assessed by Southern blot          hybridization data not shown Sequences flanking the          virus isolated by inverse PCR hybridized to a          transcript of approximately  Kb and were used to          screen a PCC embryonal carcinoma cell cDNA library A          total of  positive plaques were identified among             plaques screened Further analysis of ten cDNAs revealed          two overlapping clones covering the entire  Kb          transcript The composite cDNA contained an open reading          frame encoding a polypeptide of  amino acids Figure           Comparison of the translated sequence to the GenBank          database using the BLASTP program    revealed a          significant match with human hnRNP AB     The          human and mouse proteins are identical except asparagine           in the human sequence was replaced by a threonine          Figure  The mouse cDNA sequence has been deposited in          GenBank accession number AF          In order to determine where the provirus inserted          within the hnRNP AB gene genomic DNA flanking the B          provirus was sequenced The flanking DNA isolated by          inverse PCR extended to a HinfI site  nucleotides          upstream and downstream of the provirus Figure           Sequences matching the cloned cDNA and the human hnRNP          AB cDNA extended  nucleotides downstream of the          HinfI site while the remaining  nucleotides did not          match the cDNA sequence A consensus  splice site was          located at the point where the genomic and cDNA sequences          diverged Therefore the B provirus appeared to          integrate  nucleotides into an intron of the hnRNP          AB gene The flanking sequence has been submitted to          GenBank accession number AF          The fact that the flanking genomic DNA hybridized to a          single genomic DNA fragment suggested that the provirus          inserted into the hnRNP AB gene and not into a related          but uncharacterized gene However since the match was          based on a relatively short stretch of exon several          experiments were performed to confirm linkage between          provirus and the hnRNP AB gene First two primers          complementary to hnRNP AB sequences located upstream          and downstream of the provirus were used together with a          neo specific primer in separate PCR reactions In each          case the size of the amplified product was consistent          with insertion of the provirus into the hnRNPAB gene          data not shown Second cDNA sequences predicted to lie          downstream of the integration site were used to probe          Southern blots The  hnRNP AB cDNA probe hybridized          to a  kB EcoR fragment corresponding to the wild type          gene and to a  kB fragment in DNA from mice containing          the B provirus data not shown The difference in the          size of the wild type and mutant alleles resulted from          the inserted UNeo provirus Finally as described below          UNeo transcripts expressed in B cells are fused to          upstream hnRNP AB sequences                          Provirus integration does not disrupt expression of          the hnRNP AB gene          Of the sixteen U gene trap proviruses selected in ES          cells that we have introduced into the germline six          resulted in obvious phenotypes typically embryonic          death when bred to homozygosity                    In cases where no obvious phenotypes are observed it          is important to determine if the insert did not disrupt          gene expression or if the gene is dispensable          Inheritance of the B provirus followed a Mendelian          distribution and no phenotypic changes were observed          Among the  offspring analyzed after crossing mice          heterozygous for the B provirus  failed to inherit          the provirus while  and  were heterozygous and          homozygous for the provirus respectively Figure  A          representative Southern blot used to genotype offspring          is shown in Figure           To test whether the B provirus disrupts expression          of the hnRNP AB gene RNA from wildtype mice and mice          homozygous for the B provirus were analyzed by Northern          blot hybridization using hnRNP AB cDNA probes derived          from sequences upstream and downstream of the integration          site All tissues from wild type mice expressed a single           kb transcript consistent with previous studies               Mice homozygous for the B provirus expressed the           kb transcript as well as an additional larger          transcript Figure  The size of this larger          transcript approximately  kb as compared to the          migration of S and S RNAs is consistent with fusion          of upstream hnRNP AB exons to the Neo gene Sequences          derived from hnRNPAB sequences downstream of the site          of integration also hybridized to the  kb transcript          in both wild type and B homozygous mice indicating that          transcription of fulllength hnRNP AB transcripts is          not completely disrupted by the B provirus          Mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEF were isolated from          both wild type and homozygous mutant embryos MEF          isolated from embryos homozygous for the B provirus          showed no obvious differences from those isolated from          heterozygotes or wild type embryos RNA isolated from          these MEFs was used to quantify the extent of message          reduction in B homozygous cells by Northern blot          hybridization When using probes derived from cDNA          sequences downstream of the integration site northern          blot analysis revealed a  reduction of transcripts in          mutants compared to wild type using the glyceraldehyde          phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH message as an internal          standard Figure                           Splicing and polyadenylation of hnRNP ABNeo          fusion transcripts          Each LTR of the UNeo provirus contains sequences for           processing and polyadenylation Continued expression          of hnRNP AB transcripts suggests that use of the viral          polyA sites is less efficient than removal of the          intron in which the provirus resides To determine          whether mutation of viral  processing signals was          responsible for continued hnRNP AB expression a           base pair region spanning the polyadenylation signal in          the  LTR was amplified from integrated provirus DNA and          sequenced However the sequence of the PCR product was          identical to the wildtype Moloney murine leukemia virus          LTR data not shown          The question remained as to how hnRNP ABneo fusion          transcripts are expressed Previous Northern blot          analysis found high levels of a  Kb fusion transcript          in B cells     approximately the size expected for          hnRNPAneo fusion transcripts terminating in the  LTR          One possibility is that fusion transcripts may combine          the proximal upstream hnRNP AB exon  splice site          flanking intron and  LTR into a single terminal exon          However this possibility contradicts current models of          exon definition in which exons in premRNA are first          defined by proteins interacting across exons and then          processed as relatively autonomous units Alternatively          the proximal hnRNP AB exon may maintain its autonomy          and splice to a cryptic  splice site located either in          Neo or in the adjacent intron          To distinguish between these alternatives hnRNP          ABNeo fusion transcripts expressed in MEF and ES          cells were analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR          RTPCR A primer complementary to the Neo gene NeoA          was used to prime first strand cDNA synthesis Primers          complementary to adjacent hnRNP AB exon sequences PR          or PR and a neospecific primer NeoB were used to          amplify transcripts extending from the hnRNP AB gene          into the provirus Figure A Transcripts extending          through the  splice site proximal intron and into the          provirus would produce RTPCR products of  and           nucleotides with PR and PR respectively As shown in          Figure B the size of the major PCR product from each          reaction was significantly smaller than expected for          transcripts colinear with the flanking DNA Moreover the          major PCR products did not hybridize to a Uspecific          oligo probe Figure C Three independent RTPCR          products were cloned from separate amplification          reactions and sequenced As shown in Figure D all of          these transcripts spliced from the proximal  splice          site in the hnRNP AB gene to a cryptic  splice site          located in the Neo gene Figure D Characteristic of           splice sites the Neo splice site contained PyAG and a          potential branch point sequence but lacked a          polypyrimidine stretch The  splice site is downstream          of the initiation codon for neomycin phosphotransferase          Therefore hnRNPABNeo transcripts are expected to          encode a fusion protein consisting of the amino terminal           amino acids of hnRNP AB fused to amino acid  of          the neomycin phosphotransferase NPT protein          The U probe also detected several minor RTPCR          products upon prolonged exposure Figure C We were          unable to clone these products due to their low          abundance However they were smaller than expected for          transcripts colinear with the flanking DNA and may arise          from cryptic splice sites in the flanking intron                            Discussion        Several large scale screens of insertion mutations in        mouse embryoderived stem ES cells rely on DNA sequence        analysis to select mutations for germline transmission               The process designated tagged sequence        mutagenesis involves sequencing short segments of DNA        isolated from each mutation to identify genes disrupted by        the targeting vector Sequencebased screens are faster and        less expensive than phenotypebased screens and provide        centralised collections of characterised mutations        available for germline transmission However to maximise        the utility of tagged sequence mutagenesis one would like        to predict from the sequence alone the functional        consequences of the inserted targeting vector on cellular        gene expression Toward this end the present study        characterised a mutation generated by insertion of the        UNeo gene trap retrovirus into an intron of the hnRNP        AB gene Expression of the Neo gene involved splicing of        some hnRNP AB transcripts to a cryptic splice acceptor        site located  nucleotides downstream of the neomycin        phosphotransferase NTP initiation codon Other hnRNP        AB transcripts splice normally removing the provirus        along with other intron sequences Therefore expression of        the hnRNPAB gene was only reduced to about half of wild        type levels and the mutation caused no obvious phenotype        in mice        U gene trap vectors were designed to disrupt cellular        gene function by usurping the promoter of the occupied        genes and by ablating transcription downstream of the two        polyA sites one in each LTR carried by the provirus        Since polyA sites are not usually recognised when located        in introns       U gene traps were expected to        select for clones in which the provirus had inserted into        exons of transcriptionally active genes However in        approximately half of the targeted genes we have analysed            the provirus has inserted into introns        The present study identified a mechanism that allows        expression of a UNeo gene from a provirus positioned        within an intron The majority of hnRNP ABNeo fusion        transcripts utilised a cryptic  splice site within the        NPT coding sequence This places the  proviral polyA        site at the end of an alternative exon that can be utilised        to produce fusion transcripts or excluded to produce wild        type transcripts Since the initiation codon for NPT lies        upstream of the Neo  splice site NTP is expressed as a        fusion protein in which the first  amino acids of hnRNP        AB are appended to codon  of NTP        Because of these results we have analyzed the        expression of  other UNeo proviruses located in the        introns of different genes Transcripts in all but one of        clone splice to the cryptic Neo splice site while the one        exception utilizes a cryptic splice site located in the        proximal intron E White G Hicks M Roshon and H E        Ruley in preparation Thus utilization of the Neo        cryptic site appears to provide the predominant mechanism        by which the UNeo gene is expressed following insertion        into introns        These results are consistent with an exon definition        model in which splicing and polyadenylation require        interactions between factors acting across exons             This model predicts that polyadenylation signals are not        recognised unless they can be defined as part of a         terminal exon Accordingly polyA sites are not        efficiently recognised when positioned between  and         splice sites      and insertion of a  splice site        into a  terminal exon suppresses polyadenylation             Conversely upstream  splice sites can enhance        polyadenylation       We find that the proximal        hnRNP AB exon upstream of the provirus does not lose its        identity rather the exon splices either to the Neo splice        site or to the next hnRNP AB exon Moreover the polyA        site in the  LTR appears to be used exclusively in        conjunction with a cryptic  splice site        Utilization of the Neo  splice site is likely to have        two important consequences with regard to the use of UNeo        vectors for insertional mutagenesis First insertion into        an intron may not disrupt cellular gene expression In the        present study levels of hnRNP AB transcripts were        reduced only about two fold in homozygous mutant cells and        the relative amount of the AB protein in hnRNP complexes        was unaffected G Dreyfuss personal communication This        may explain the absence of an obvious phenotype in mice        Alternatively other hnRNP proteins compensate for reduced        levels of the AB transcripts just as cells can tolerate        severe reductions in the levels of the related hnRNP A        protein             Second since the Neo  splice site is downstream of        the NPT initiation codon its use may skew the targeting to        favor of those genes capable of splicing upstream exons        inframe to produce enzymatically active fusion proteins        The magnitude of the potential bias is difficult to assess        A variety of aminoterminal fusions maintain enzymatic        activity or produce enzymatically active breakdown        products including those fused to codon  of NPT                Moreover selection of resistant cell clones        requires only minimal levels of Neo gene expression            Still genes providing the appropriate introns are        expected to provide larger targets for gene trap        mutagenesis than genes lacking such introns This could        contribute to the fact that  of  inserts characterised        in an earlier study occurred in the same intron of the L        gene            The Neo  splice site contains a potential branch point        sequence and the sequence CAGG across the intronexon        boundary is optimal according to the scanning model of         splice site selection      The Neo site differs from        the typical  splice site in that it lacks a        polypyrimidine tract however this feature is often        missing from alternative splice sites     Both the A        of the branch point and the intronterminal AG dinucleotide        are considered invariant therefore one may be able to        enhance the mutagenic efficiency of UNeo vectors by        altering these nucleotides Alternatively the problem may        be avoided by using other selectable markers assuming        their sequences lack cryptic splice sites or by using gene        trap vectors that rely on splicing to activate the        expression of genes carried by the targeting vector The        latter vectors contain strong splice sites either in front        of     or behind    the entrapment cassette        allowing efficient expression from within introns                    Conclusions        hnRNP A and hnRNP B are members of a large family of        RNA binding proteins found associated with mammalian        heterogeneous nuclear RNA The proteins are thought to        participate in the processing mRNA precursors     and        they can influence splice site selection and promote exon        skipping in vitro       Consistent with a        fundamental role in RNA metabolism the human and mouse        hnRNP A sequences are highly conserved with only one amino        acid difference out of  residues However since the B        mutation did not ablate hnRNP AB gene expression it is        unlikely to be useful for studies of hnRNPAB gene        function While further analysis might uncover phenotypes        associated with this hypomorphic mutation detailed        examination of either cells or mice seemed unjustified in        the absence of any greater effect on gene expression Our        results illustrate the interplay between polyadenylation        and splicing as predicted by an exon definition model        Moreover the B mutation reveals a mechanism by which U        gene trap vectors can be expressed without disrupting        cellular gene expression and suggests ways to improve the        vectors for gene trap mutagenesis                    Methods                  Isolation of cDNA clones encoding the
