                                 Microsoft Kremlinologynbsp            Duringthe Cold War pundits entertained themselves with a parlor game calledKremlinology Every time a Soviet premier was ousted or a new man joined thePolitburo Western analysts spun fresh theories about who was up who was downwhy the chairs were being rearranged and what those wily old Russians were upto The triumph of capitalism spoiled the old game but replaced it with a newone corporate Kremlinology            Themost Kremlinlike of corporate headquarters in the eyes of many conspiracytheorists lies in Redmond Wash Last weeks announcement by Microsoft CEOBill Gates that he is turning over his job to his deputy Steve Ballmerandassuming the new post of chief software architect insteadhas setKremlinologists abuzz Heres how Microsoft is spinning the handover and howcynics are reinterpreting those spins                           Gates is meeting Microsofts challenge At a press conference ThursdayGates and Ballmer denied that the handover was prompted by America Onlinesmerger with Time Warner Instead they linked Ballmers promotion toMicrosofts new strategy of focusing on Next Generation Windows Serviceswhich are supposed to become the platform for all devices that communicatethrough the Internet We have Bill now focused  percent as chief architectof this transformation said Ballmer                           Cynics translation Hes acknowledging Microsofts mess Skeptics dont care whether Gates planned the handover before the AOL mergerThey interpret the next generation strategy Gates assignment to it and hisadversarial references to AOL as a belated concession that AOL was right aboutthe primacy of the Internet Microsoft was wrong about the primacy of the PCand Microsoft now has to play catchup And why is Gates going back tosupervising software development Cynics figure that if Capt Kirk takes overthe engineering room it means Scotty has botched his job                           Gates is doing what he does best On the Today show Gates saidsoftware architecture is a job that draws on my strengths more MicrosoftVice President Jeff Raikes agreed that the new job puts Gates in his elementThe companys overall message is that the next generation project willdetermine the industrys future and that Gates is the genius who can pull itoff                           Cynics translation Hes sinking back to his level ofcompetence  If Gates is better at what hell be doing next then hemust have been worse at what he was doing before Critics link this point tothe Peter Principle which holds that everyone rises to his level ofincompetence They suggest that being CEO was Gates level of incompetence andthat hes going back to the garage where he belongs They attribute allMicrosofts missteps to Gatesbad PR bad legal strategy underestimation ofthe Internetand infer that Gates must have been bad at everything Ballmer isgood at administration finding new revenue sources and avoiding badinvestments                           Gates is psyched up Im returning to what I love mostfocusing ontechnologies Gates said Thursday Steves promotion will allow me todedicate myself full time to my passionbuilding great software andstrategizing on the future On Today  Gates said his new job would bemore fun                           Cynics translation Hes burned out  Again critics invertMicrosofts spin If Gates needs a new job in order to have fun he must hatehis current job Some say he lost interest because he made too much money andhas nothing left to prove Others say the antitrust siege the attendant PRdamage and constant media scrutiny have worn him out A few offer the ultimatemacho corporate insult speculating that he wants more time to concentrate onhis family But the condescension of these illwishers is trumped by thecontempt of those who say Gates is too coldblooded to put his family first                           Gates is getting a puppy dog The media always look for contrasts SinceGates is a nerd theyve cast Ballmer as a frat boy While Gates and Ballmerstress their similarities Microsoft optimists and Ballmer supporters spin thenerdfrat boy dichotomy as a good thing Whereas Gates understands gadgetsthey suggest Ballmer understands people Hes outgoing affabletactile and backslapping Hes a salesman who can help Microsoft byfocusing on customers Hes a dealmaker who can break the ice with JusticeDepartment negotiators and settle the antitrust case Hes the puppy who can gofor a walk with his master wag his tail win over strangers and help Gatesmake friends                           Cynics translation Hes getting an attack dog  Sure say thecritics Ballmer is tactile and outgoinglike a pit bull They call himruthless bombastic inyourface an aggressive hardliner abulldog and a hit man Ballmer played into this critique in Thursdayspress conference calling the notion of breaking up Microsoft reckless andirresponsible and dismissing speculation about such a plan as ludicrousReporters deemed his tone strident and belligerent Gates isnt unleashingBallmer to make friends the cynics argue Hes unleashing Ballmer to fight andintimidate Microsofts enemies                           Gates is taking a bullet for his company Despite Gates and Ballmersinsistence that the handover has nothing to do with the antitrust case dozensof market analysts legal scholars and reporters suspect that it must Theythink Gates is stepping downcontrary to Ballmers insistence that Gates isstepping up to his new jobin hopes of appeasing Justice Departmentwarriors who want Gates head ProMicrosoft analysts spin this as a heroicsacrifice removing the lightning rod whose seemingly disingenuoustestimony has ostensibly driven the DOJ to the verge of demanding thecompanys breakup Many attributed a rise in the companys stock to optimismthat a freshly sated DOJ will back off the alleged breakup plan                           Cynics translation Hes playing dead  AntiMicrosoft analystsspin the same theory the other way Gates having been pulled over by the copsfor aggressive driving is sliding into the passenger seat and giving thewheel to Ballmer whose record is clean so that the cops will go easy on thecompany But Ballmer is just a student driver and as soon as the cops leaveGates will retake the wheel Gates is just putting a new face on thecompanya kinder gentler lookto cleanse Microsofts corporate image andsoften up the DOJ                           Hes calling all hands on deck At the press conference Ballmer outlinedMicrosofts challenges and listed several members of the companys leadershipteam who would work with chief architect Gates to integrate the companysproducts and services Having lost top executives in recent months Gates andBallmer sought to convey that Microsoft has divisional leaders who can worktogether to beat AOL and other rivals                           Cynics translation Hes manning the lifeboats  Conspiracytheorists think Gates is organizing his commanders not to save the ship but toabandon it to the government They are putting their affairs in order saidtech guru Jeff Eisenach If we are going to see the death of Microsoft as weknow it and the creation of something new then they would want to preparetheir most capable people for CEO types of positions The Los Angeles               Times speculates that Gates would run the Windows operating system anda new Internet operating system Ballmer would take control of the applicationsdivision The Chicago Tribune agrees that with Gates and Ballmer attheir new posts if the DOJ breaks up Microsoft at least two Baby Bill CEOswill be in place            Ballmer dismisses such talk as nonsense But when a company spends two decadesimpressing everyone with its ruthless practicality and wily resilience itcant easily brush off rumors of plots One still cant escape the feelingthat Microsoft knows something is coming and is positioning itself said aCNNfn correspondent the day of the handover alluding to a hypotheticalcourtordered breakup It thinks smartly and this change is going to positionit for whatever comes down the road On this Microsoft haters and worshippersagree The only thing of which Bill Gates is incapable is coincidence
