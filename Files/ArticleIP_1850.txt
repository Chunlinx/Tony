                                 Oprah Winfrey            If Oprah Winfrey were a topgovernment officialand a fair bit of America probably wishes she wereshewould be Alan Greenspan When Greenspan speaks he roils financial marketsWhen Oprah speaks she roilswell everything else Consider the trial she isnow enduring in Amarillo Texas Cattlemen claim that upon learning thedangers of madcow disease Oprah uttered a single onair sentenceIt hasjust stopped me cold from eating another burgerthat punctured Americasirrational exuberance for beef Beef prices reeled and cattlemen lost millionsof dollars Oprahs lawyers claim that the beef swoon was the product ofdroughts and high feed prices            Perhapsbook publishers should foot her legal bills in the beef trial Each time Oprahselects a new novel for Oprahs Book Club a publisher blesses her name Aword from Oprah and a novel sells  million copies rather than  OnJan  Oprah picked Toni Morrisons Paradise for the club The novelshot to No  on the New York Times bestseller list just as severalclub selections before it had Three previous picks remain on thepaperbackbestseller list When Oprah went fitness crazy books by her chefand her personal trainer became nationwide hits Marketing experts nowroutinely refer to the Oprah Effect            The effect is felt not only by blessed merchandise but alsoby the star herself Oprah has owned the No  talk show in the country formore than  years Her movie debut in The Color Purple netted her anOscar nomination Shes the highestpaid entertainer in the world worth wellover  million And shes thinner than you            But ofcourse she is a daytimetalkshow host and its conventional wisdom thatdaytime talk shows are deplorable The shows parade freaks in front of theviewing public Ricki Lake and Jerry Springer have hiked their ratings byshowcasing increasingly repulsive molesters abusers adulterers andpederasts all of them eager to tell the world about their loathsomeness Talkshows are the zenith of Americas nauseating confessional culture            Among those righteous folk who dont watch theshows Oprah is lumped with the garbage But she doesnt belong Two years agoOprah stopped booking freak guests It was a huge ratings risk but heraudience stuck with her Springer has resorted to hawking Too Hot for TVvideotapes featuring awkward nudity and grim violence Oprah  sansfreaks continues to win handily in the ratings                           Oprah is Oprah and according to critics this is the problem She isindeed the leading practitioner of confessional television When she lostweight she rolled a representative wagon of pig fat onstage She routinelybreaks down in tears and she never hesitates to let us know when things gowrong with Stedman her longtime beau            So what redeems Oprah How does her confessional televisiondiffer from Phil Donahues and Springers Oprah is the confessor thats howThe Donahues and Springers of the world remain aloof above and separate fromguests Their guests confess the hosts oppress and the audience laughs itshead off The host and audience are judge and jury for the miserable benightedguests Its the zoo theory of television Lets make fun of these stupidanimals            But Oprahdoesnt condescend to guests She couldnt possibly When her show featuredvictims of sexual abuse Oprah revealed that shed been abused too When shetalked to cocaine addicts she admitted to having tried the drug herselfImagine Donahue revealing his drug habit or his scarred emotions Is thecaller there Were talking

abused her Overcoming these obstacles haslent her street cred with guests and fans They make her success alwaysastonishing and rarely begrudged            Oprah lends her fame andfortune to the right causes She mentors girls from the Chicago projects andendows scholarships to Morehouse College and Tennessee State University Someblack female celebs Dionne Warwick shill for phonepsychic scams that exploitpoor black women Oprah She started a book club Her taste incidentally hasbeen impeccable No John Grisham or John Gray lots of interestingunderpublicized novels Alfred Kazin jowled that Oprahs club represents thecarpet bombing of the American mind but even a stuffed shirt like Kazincant complain when  million TV watchers are urged to read Toni Morrison anddo            Despite the ban on

even the cattlemen eventuallyDuring the trial Oprah is recording her show in Amarillo a town supposedlydevastated by her beefbashing Locals have been lining up for tickets
