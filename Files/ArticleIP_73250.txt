                                 Jabberwiney            Whenever I read that a wine is lush and creamyelegant lovely graceful generous luscious or smooth I gagThese days I gag a lot            Ive had cheesecake thats lush and creamy Tequilaand whiskey divide into smooth and rough My wife is elegant lovely gracefuland even luscious But contrary to what you read on the back of some bottlesthese terms are meaningless when applied to wine The label on CastlewoodGroves chardonnay claims that its wine has a superb nose White Oakchardonnay boasts a mouthfilling richness McDowells syrah

Others describe tanninsas polished grapes as rubenesque and fruit flavors as forwardabundant and bright            Most wine critics similarly enjoy gyring andgimbling in the wabe Take this sentence

scientistflavor chemist in theviticulture and enology department at the University of California Daviswould ban from the winetasting lexicon whole pages of words that she deemsimprecise vague or hedonic her word            What the hell is stylish Noble asks me Is aVolkswagen stylish Is a Humvee stylish She hates harmonious disdainsfragrant and despises dense which she says doesnt mean exactlyanything Winemakers she says favor fuzzy terms for a reason The labelsare for marketing an image she says            Having researched how people assess wine Noble nowteaches scientific techniques to describe it precisely To this end she hasdeveloped a lovely impressive and wonderfully balanced tool which she callsthe wine aromawheel The words found on Nobles wine aroma wheel do not make me sick tomy stomach            Noble divides her wheelinto three rings The inner ring has the  specific and analytical wordsthat she believes best describe wine aromas fruity vegetative nuttycaramelized woody earthy chemical pungent oxidized microbiologicalfloral and spicy The middle ring subdivides these  words into  morespecific categories and the outer ring offers  still more precisedescriptions A sophisticated nose might thus distinguish a fruity wine assmelling like citrus berry tree fruit tropical fruit or dried fruit Theouter ring ups the olfactory ante again dividing these terms into such exactdescriptions as strawberry jam vs strawberry            Nobles main aim is not to teach wine appreciation Rathershe strives for a standard terminology that cuts through the babble ofwinespeak Her undergraduate course Sensory Evaluation of Wines is the firststep in this process teaching students how to link aromas to wine Its akindergarten of the nose she says            Nobles Web page contains thenosetraining workout that she uses in Sensory Evaluation of Wines Firststudents pour wine into a bunch of glasses and then drop a different physicalstandard into each one For white wines the physical standards include clovebell pepper brine from canned asparagus and apricot puree The point ofmaking these physical standards is to educate your nose to recognize thesearomas in an undoctored glass of wine Next the students pour samples from avariety of white wines            From this point on anything goes Smell the winesfirst smell the standards start to see which terms describe which winewrites Noble            When I told Noble that Iwas tackling the workout she replied Your nose is going to start to talk toyou because the contrasts really stand out            Following Nobles instructions I put a little cheap whitewine into  glasses and then spiked each one with a different physicalstandard peach puree apricot puree brine of asparagus strawberry jam wetcardboard fresh strawberry pineapple juice soy sauce green olive meltedbutter coffee grinds fresh lime juice cloves vanilla and shaved almonds Iidentified the contents of each glass with a label stretching plastic wrapover the tops to prevent aromas from escaping Into another set of labeledglasses I poured three different chardonnays which I expected to havedramatically distinct attributes one gewrztraminer and one Riesling Afterputting all  of the glasses on the dining room table I enrolled my wife andyearold daughter in the kindergarten of the nose            As Noble instructed we sniffed each standardsmelled the untainted wines and then went back and forth between the standardsand the wines My nose isnt talking to me my wife said Next each of uswrote down descriptions of each wines scent but limited our vocabulary towords that matched the scents wafting from the physical standards            Our daughter who has great character and legendaryintelligence was a bit dense this evening and instead of describing the winesaromas offered blunt descriptors such as I dont like it Fair enoughInterestingly my wife and I listed different combinations of aromas for eachof the five white wines under assessment But when we spoke about the choiceswe made resniffing the  glasses before us we agreed on descriptions forfour of the five wines            As a final exercise weshifted the labels identifying the white wines to the bottoms of the glasseswhere we couldnt read them and then tried to guess which wine was which Savefor the gewrztraminer which I thought smelled of wet cardboard and my wifehad called clovelike we failed the testmisidentifying four of the five winesHad I lost my wine aptitude or was my nose just fatigued An hour later Iretook the test and scored  I had heard my nose loud and clear            Although my anecdotal evidence suggests that Nobles methodworks I dont expect winemakers to begin printing labels that brag about agewrztraminers wetcardboard finish The French will continue to eschew backlabels altogether and the more conscientious American vintners will limit thelabel lingo to useful information about the winerys location the soil inwhich the grapes were grown and the climate And make no mistake a wineryneed not cram a label with absurd adjectives to sell a wine Recently I boughta bottle of Napas Schuetz Oles on the strength of its label alone Planted inthe early s above Calistoga on a rattlesnake infested rocky hillside thisPetit Sirah produces a dangerously red wine the label reads BE PREPARED DONOT DRINK IF
