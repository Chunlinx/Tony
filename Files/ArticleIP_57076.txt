                                 The Trade War            Thousands of demonstrators mobbed Seattle this week to protest the ThirdMinisterial Conference of the World Trade Organization They argued that theWTO a nation club in which membership is voluntary but free trade rulesare mandatory threatens to dissolve human rights labor laws and health andenvironmental protections in the acid of global capitalism Tuesday andWednesday President Clinton and WTO DirectorGeneral Michael Moore fired backThe WTOs advocates belatedly realizing that it has become a political targetare beginning to counter the principal spins against the organization                            Whether to trade vs how to trade The protesters want usto ask first what political terms of trade are being offered and then todecide based on how good or bad those terms are whether or not to trade Bythis logic because the WTO doesnt include labor and environmental regulationsin its trade rules thereby undermining such regulations in many countriesaccording to the protesters the WTO should be suspended Until the WTOaddresses these important issues there will be no support for a major newround of trade negotiations declared AFLCIO President John Sweeney severaldays before the Seattle meeting Hey hey ho ho the WTO has got to goprotesters chanted in the streets In a New York Times ad a coalitionof environmentalists said public interest groups  want the WTO to stop in itstracks  Many feel the WTO can never be democratically reformed            Clinton wants to reverse these two questions He wants us to ask first whethertrading is generally good or bad and thenonly after weve agreed that itsgoodto begin discussing on what political terms we should trade We aregoing to have to listen to people who have legitimate economic concernslegitimate environmental concerns legitimate labor concerns Clinton concededin a speech in Seattle Wednesday But first said Clinton Everybody has todecide Do you think we are better off or worse off with an increasinglyintegrated global economy where productive Americans have a chance to selltheir goods and services and skills around the world I think were better offThats the number one core decision we ought to make up our mind as a countrywe agree about                            What is capitalism destroying The protesters contrastglobal capitalism with enlightened national laws According to theenvironmentalists ad the WTO by promoting and mandating unfettered trade isdestroying standards for safety health and the environment in nations that try to protect the safety of their food their jobs small businesses orNature The AFLCIO says the WTO should be reined in to preserve workersrights and to protect the ability of governments at all levels to use theirpurchasing power to reinforce their values and standards            TheWTO and its defenders argue that the regimes and laws mowed down by globalcapitalism are more often corrupt than enlightenedin short that capitalismis an improvement Clinton says the WTO fosters respect for the rule of lawwhich weeds out corruption and discourages war Francis Fukuyama writing inthe Wall Street Journal  says poor people around the world are dominatedby local companies  interlocked with local political elites in a web ofcronyism and corruption Globalization in the form of foreign direct investmentby multinational corporations not only creates employment but directlythreatens these local elites by exposing them to competition            Addressing the WTO conference Tuesday Moore argued that global capitalism hasreplaced not Marxist utopia but warped Marxist totalitarianism and aggressionFree trade tore down the walls of economic and political oppression saidMoore Our parents learnt from the great depression made deeper and morelethal by rising trade barriers from which came the twin tyrannies of our agefascism and Marxism thus war hot and cold They swore it would not happenagain and they created an international architecture which included the UNIMF World Bank and the GATT now the WTO to achieve that peacefulpurpose                            Does the WTO permit problems or solutions The protesterssay the WTO is bad because it permits oppressive and environmentallydestructive practices and by liberating greed promotes these practices Byfocusing on the free flow of capital WTO leaders are not supporting humanrights and workers rights said a union official in Seattle Clinton sees itthe other way around The WTO is good because it permits discussion ofthese practices It is not wrong for the United States to say we dont believein child labor or forced labor or the oppression of our brothers and sisterswho work for a living around the worldand that we dont believe thatgrowing the economy requires us to undermine the environment said ClintonBut to make those arguments and resolve those issues with other nationseffectively said Clinton You have to have some system to resolve them                            Opening the WTO vs opening world trade Sweeney blaststrade accords negotiated behind closed doors and demands that the WTO becomeopen and accountable The environmentalists call the WTO an invisiblegovernment that was elected by noone and operates in secrecy Moorereplies that the WTO is democraticMinisters are here because their peopledecided so Our agreements must be agreed by Parliamentsbut Clinton goesfurther He frames the issue of openness more broadly arguing that the WTO hasmade trade decisions more accountable and more universally beneficial than theyused to be We do have to open the WTO and the world trading system to greaterpublic scrutiny and to greater public participation says Clinton But whatwe came here to the WTO meeting in Seattle to do is to open markets andexpand opportunities                            Stability vs progress The protesters focus on stabilityand worry that unfettered trade will demolish it Thanks to world capital flowsays Sweeney financial collapses have grown more severe and more frequentBut what the protesters call stability Moore calls stagnation Theleastdeveloped countries are not threatened by globalization They arethreatened by deglobalization falling outside of the world economy andslipping ever further behind Clinton portrays the instability of bigindustrial shiftsfor example the loss of American jobs in steel and thesimultaneous creation of American jobs in softwareas a transition to a worldin which everybody can do what they do best To mitigate that instability hepromises to give people time and support and investment to make thetransitions into the new economy            Humannature puts Clinton at a disadvantage in this debate Most people would ratherkeep what they have than risk it for a hypothetical payoff And while the costsof unrestricted trade tend to be visible because theyre nearby andconcentrated eg the closure of a local factory the benefits tend to beinvisible because theyre faraway or diffuse eg lower prices at the grocerystore or higher wages in Latin America The people that are going to win willalways be somewhat uncertain of their gain whereas the people who will loseare absolutely sure of what they are going to lose says Clinton Thereforeembracing free trade will require  imagination and trust and humility andflexibility                            Bully or protector Former WTO DirectorGeneral RenatoRuggiero once called the WTO a new constitution for a single global economyand protesters have seized on this somewhat presumptuous selfcharacterizationto portray the WTO as a police state designed by rich nations to facilitate theexploitation of poor ones Unlike other global bodies including the UN theWTO enjoys unique enforcement powers the environmentalists warn in their adOffending countries must conform with WTO rules or face harsh sanctions            Mooresees these governmental analogies in a different light He thinks the WTOsconstitution and police powers will protect poor countries not exploit themDeveloping countries need a secure and stable world trading system he saysThey need more openness not less Stronger rules not weaker ones  Im froma small country New Zealand but I dont see what we are doing here as athreat to our sovereignty I see interdependence as a guarantor of oursovereignty and safety                            Imports vs exports Some goods are produced more cheaplyin the United States than abroad Others are produced more cheaply abroad thanhere Unrestricted trade will help US industries in the first category butwill wipe out those in the second category Thats why Clinton talks about thefirst category while the protesters talk about the second Two weeks agoSweeney brought a steelworkers union official to the National Press Club toillustrate how the WTOs prohibition against trade barriers facilitates theloss of US manufacturing jobs to dumped imports and cheap labor abroad            Wednesday Clinton choseto talk about a different industry The typical American eats  pounds offresh apples each year whereas the typical European consumes about pounds said Clinton So America exported  million worth of apples lastyear Lowering trade barriers in China Japan and Mexico means more applesales from Washington and more help for family farmers he observed Clintonjoked that his apple reference was a pander to Washington state but it wasmore than that The national industries that will lose under global capitalismand the national industries that will win areto borrow a selfillustratingrhetorical metaphorapples and oranges And the key to reassuring Americansabout the WTO is to talk about the apples
