A Brief HistoryThroughout the centuriesold history of Mexicos Pacific Coast this region has been both a refuge and an important point for conducting tradeThe regions history has some marked differences from the history of Mexico as a country Although artifacts show that both the Aztec and Olmec preHispanic cultures had a presence in the area ancient civilizations created no notable settlements here This fact coupled with the geography of the region spared it much of the bloodshed and turmoil of the Spanish conquest With the imposing Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range running the length of the Pacific coastline isolating it from the rest of mainland Mexico the Pacific coast was able to develop at a slower more tranquil paceMost preHispanic tribes that inhabited the coastal areas were peaceful traders and fishermen and their trading legacy continued well after the conquest of Mexico by Spain Several of the ports that were important prior to the conquest havein one way or anotherremained on the map as major destinations to this dayPuerto VallartaPuerto Vallarta was launched into the international spotlight when Hollywood director John Huston decided to film the Tennessee Williams play Night of the Iguana on nearby Mismaloya Beach Its history however runs much deeper than that event Recent archeological findings show six different cultures lived in the area with settlements dating back to  bc The most important was part of the kingdom of Xalisco centered in the modern state of Nayarit A marked Aztec influence is also present probably due to the centurieslong migration of Aztecs from the legendary city of Aztln on the Pacific coast to Tenochtitlan presentday Mexico City Remains of these cultures can be seen in the Museo del Ro CualeThe first Spaniard to encounter these Nahuatl settlements was Hernn Cortezs nephew Francisco Cortez de Buenaventura He arrived at the JaliscoNayarit coast in  shortly after the fall of Tenochtitlan He was met by a formidable army of  warriors their bows decorated by myriad colored banners This impressive assembly earned the fertile Ro Ameca Valley just north of present day Puerto Vallarta the name Valle de Banderas Valley of the Banners and the great bay just in front of the valley became known as Baha de BanderasDuring colonial days the bay was visited by both Spanish galleons and pirate ships looking for shelter repairs or supplies It was during this time that foreign navigators referred to the bay as Humpback Bay or Baha de las Jorobadas because of the large number of humpback whales that appearedand still appearevery winterIn the early s gold and silver were found in the Sierra Madre Mountains spurring an explosive growth of mining towns including Talpa de Allende and San Sebastin The mines needed salt to process the ore and an enterprising man named Guadalupe Snchez found the perfect location for this by the mouth of the Ro Cuale He and his family became the salt suppliers for the Cuale and San Sebastin silver mines Others arrived to take part in this lucrative trade and in  the village called Puerto Las Peas was establishedThe village grew steadily and by  construction began on the church in the town center Iglesia de Nuestra Seora de Guadalupe named after the Virgin of Guadalupe patron saint of the town Snchez originally founded the town on December th the anniversary of the Virgins appearanceAs Las Peas grew San Sebastin faded At its peak in the late s San Sebastin was one of the most productive mining towns in all Mexico with a population of over  today it has fewer than  residents In  governmental functions were moved to Las Peas and by  Las Peas was designated as a municipality and its name changed to Puerto VallartaWithout any highways or an airport to connect it to other major cities Puerto Vallarta remained in secluded tranquility for almost  yearsuntil the  filming of Night of the Iguana The Hollywood production attracted the attention of the international media who came looking for gossip about the torrid romances of the films legendary stars Night of the Iguanas biggest star however turned out to be the quaint village of Puerto VallartaThe movies leading man Richard Burton and his new love Elizabeth Taylor were so charmed by the town that they bought homes there as did director John Huston Throngs of tourists followed Many became residents building homes of their own on the hillsides overlooking the river and bay creating what is now known as Gringo Gulch Hustons friend the Mexican architect Guillermo Wulff built most of these homes giving Puerto Vallarta its defining style of white facades and red tile roofsPuerto Vallarta has continued to grow and has become an important art center It attracts an increasing number of visitors to its true Mexican ambiance coupled with a modern resort environmentManzanillo and the Costa AlegreSince its earliest days Manzanillo has been considered an important trading port Legend has it that the ancient residents of the area the Colimans who traded from this portthen known as Tzalaguahad contact with Chinese traders years before the arrival of the SpaniardsWhen this rumor reached Cortez he sent his own men to confirm it The Spaniards named the place Manzanillo and established it as a shipyard and launching point for expeditions across the Pacific Its bay offered safe anchorage and a good shipbuilding site Manzanillo saw considerable growth until the mids when in order to centralize trade Acapulco was declared the only authorized port in MexicoThe port of Manzanillo continued to quietly exist until  when a railroad connected it inland Telephone electricity drainage and potable water services followed These improvements helped transform Manzanillo into the modern port and manufacturing center it is todayManzanillo initially drew the interest of international visitors for its excellent fishing An important annual fishing tournament prompted the construction of modest hotels and condos In the s the development along with the new airport of the Club Maeva and Las Hadas resorts with their striking Moorish design began to bring in a steady flow of tourists Then the movie Ten starring Bo Derek and Dudley Moore and filmed in Las Hadas put Manzanillo squarely in the spotlightThe beaches and coves along the Costa Alegre were also popular with pirates and Spanish traders  years ago Melaque and Barra de Navidad were visited in  by Spanish conquistadors in search of a mythical place believed to have an unlimited quantity of pearls and to be inhabited only by women A select number of tourists discovered Melaque and Barra de Navidad in the s and the towns have grown gracefully sinceIxtapaZihuatanejo From PreHispanic Resort to Modern ParadiseZihuatanejos azure waters caught the attention of tourists long before Mexico became a Spanish colonial empire Legend has it that the Tarascan emperor Caltzonzin built a royal beach retreat on the popular Zihuatanejo beach of Las Gatas somewhere around ad  He turned this already tranquil beach into a virtual wading pool by building a breakwater to keep the waters within it completely calm and crystalline The mysterious Olmecs from the Gulf Coast of Mexico left their unmistakable influence here around  bc evidenced by ceramics featuring jaguarlike and Negroid features Today some of these may be seen in the Museo Arqueolgico de la Costa Grande in ZihuatanejoIn the early s Aztecs conquered the province of Coyuca located between presentday Zihuatanejo and the Coyuca lagoon and established a coastal capital which they called Zihuatlan Place of Women named for the local matriarchal society Residents today claim that the place was named for the beauty of the women and means place of beautiful womenZihuatanejo was claimed for the Spanish crown by Juan Alvarez Chico in  The town and port saw little action during colonial days and it slumbered quietly hosting a few lost galleons and pirate ships that happened to stop for repairs or supplies Local lore tells how one such ship upon returning from its travels to China lost hundreds of rolls of silk The name La Ropa the Clothing was given to the beach where the silk later washed ashoreIt wasnt until over  years later in the mids that this quiet village was awakened with the development of Ixtapa FONATUR Mexicos national fund for tourism development chose this location because of its  km  miles of pristine beaches located near a picturesque village Today Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa meld into a complementary combination that offers the best of both worlds the quirky character of Zihuatanejo and the deluxe megadevelopment of IxtapaAcapulco Colonial Gateway to the Orient and Playground to the Stars Many regard Acapulco as the original Mexican beach resort with its glimmering beaches and glitzy nightlife Yet its history extends far beyond its presentday appealartifacts found here date back to  bc Inhabitants of this zone are known to have traded with several cultures possibly including the Polynesians There is clear evidence of trade with the Tarascan Mixtec and Zapotec empires that extended to the north and south of Acapulco prior to Mexicos conquest by SpainIn  the Spanish Crown claimed Acapulco and established it as the departure point for a trade route to the Orient A later decree gave Acapulco exclusivity as the only authorized port on the Pacific coast and for  years it was the unrivaled trading center of Pacific Mexico The yearly arrival of the Nao de China a galleon that sailed to Manila and back during these years was the occasion for an annual merchant fair that drew traders from all over the colonyBefore long pirates heard about the riches brought to Acapulcothe port was visited both by Sir Francis Drake and the British pirate Thomas Cavendish Cavendish eventually captured the Nao  and got away with  million in gold To guard the port from these attacks the Spaniards built the impressive Fuerte de San Diego in  Although an earthquake destroyed it in  the fort was rebuilt in  and today houses a small but interesting museumThe Nao trade route continued until the early s when Jos Mara Morelos y Pavn a hero of Mexicos War of Independence took over Acapulco and stopped the trade sending the town into a centurylong respite a hiatus that ended only when the Mexican government paved the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco The beautiful beaches of Acapulco Bay immediately lured Mexico Citys elite and the metamorphosis began from slumbering trading port into the Pearl of the Pacific as the media came to know it in the sThe first airplanes from the US began to arrive in the mids and with them came a bevy of notorious visitors from movie stars to presidents writers to millionaires Acapulco became the playground for the rich and famous Glitzy hotels went up in a hurry supported by new boulevards power plants and a superhighway Acapulcos peak was the s to s Celebrated images included Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner sipping margaritas while watching cliff divers at La Quebrada President Eisenhower meeting Mexicos President Lpez Mateos for a summit conference in a new high rise hotel and Johnny Weissmuller swimming laps in the Flamingos Hotel pool overlooking Acapulco BaySince those glory days Acapulco has agedmaybe not quite as gracefully as its fans would have hoped However the Perla del Pacfico still attracts scores of vacationers who are still regaled by old stories about the rich and famous told by seasoned waiters as they serve poolside drinks with a weathered but unwavering smilePuerto Escondido and HuatulcoEven though Puerto Escondido is the more mature tourist destination of the two Huatulco has the deepest historical roots The Aztecs and Chichimecs a Nahuatlspeaking warrior community knew Huatulco as an important trading port long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadorsThe name Huatulco is of Aztec origin and means land where a tree is worshipped reflecting the intriguing legend of the Santa Cruz de Huatulco Sacred Cross of Huatulco When the Spaniards arrived at Huatulco in the late s the local Indians showed them a massive cross by the edge of the shore that they worshipped A legend arose that the cross may have been left by an ancient saintperhaps even the Apostle Thomassome fifteen centuries earlier The cross remained during the Spanish conquest and even survived an attempt to destroy it by the pirate Cavendish In  Bishop Juan de Cervantes took part of the cross to the capital city of Oaxaca and used it as the foundation of a replica which today stands in the main altar of the cathedral Another piece was set in silver and sent to the VaticanFor centuries the bays of Huatulco basked quietly under the sun Then in the mids FONATUR turned its eyes towards the southern coast of Oaxaca and started a megadevelopment scheduled for completion in  on the nine bays of HuatulcoPuerto Escondido was established in  as a port for shipping coffee Its importance diminished as coffee shipments began to be transported by truck In the s tourists discovered the town after it was connected to other coastal towns by Highway  With its renowned offshore break Puerto Escondido became the ultimate destination for backpackers flower children surfers looking for the perfect wave and those attracted by natural beauty and the laidback pace True escapists preferred to continue south and visit Puerto Angel a fishing village that was Oaxacas busiest port for a brief period in the s before reverting back to its peaceable ways
