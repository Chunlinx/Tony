                                 Is the President Impotent            The pragmatists caseagainst President Clintonas opposed to the moralistsis premised on thenotion that hes powerless so disgraced and mistrusted that his presidency isfinished politically if not chronologically But a peculiar little side dramaon Capitol Hill suggests that this conclusion is not as certain as it seems Itoffers evidence that Clintons Flytrap weakness can be in at least one smallcase a perverse source of strength            The dramaconcerns one of Washington DCs dreariest annual rituals the appropriationsprocess Every September Congress squabbles over the  annual spending billsneeded to keep the government operating Every year House Republicans stripfunding from favorite Clinton programs and lard the bills with antiabortionand antienvironmental riders As the end of each fiscal year looms with noagreement between Congress and the president conflict escalates and thepresident threatens vetoes And every year a last minute continuing resolutionprevents shutdown or not as in  both sides make cosmeticconcessions the bills move and everyone goes home            Same story this September The fiscal year ends in twoweeks Only one of  bills has passed and Clinton is threatening to vetoseven of the unfinished ones He objects that the Republicans would defundeducation the International Monetary Fund summer jobs and literacy programsand that they have attached unacceptable language about abortion the censusand the environment Does this mean we are headed for another shutdown            No andthe reasons reveal much about Flytrap game theory At the mere mention of theword shutdown the average Republican politician curls up in a ball on thefloor and blubbers One fretful GOP staffer I spoke to would refer only tothe sword The  budget showdown and shutdown were of course anightmare for Republicans Clinton demonized them revived his own flaggingcareer and guaranteed himself the  presidential election The memory stilltraumatizes the GOP But Republicans may laugh last about that shutdown Itwas then after all that Clinton and Lewinsky began their affair            It is now an article of faith amongconservatives that Clinton wants another shutdown that he will gin up aspending fight to provoke one Republicans fear that if he picks his issuescarefullyeducation or the environment not the IMF too foreignvetoes someof the spending bills and blocks a continuing resolution he could galvanizedisaffected Democrats in Congress and distract voters from Flytrap AWashington Times oped piece last week called this Clintons domestic Wag the Dog strategy Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and HouseSpeaker Newt Gingrich have repeatedly hinted that Americans should not besuckered by a Clintoninduced shutdown            Republican worries are not farfetched Though a Democratic appropriationscommittee spokeswoman and an Office of Management and Budget spokeswomandismiss the idea that Democrats want a shutdown the White House and HillDemocrats are clearly spoiling for a good fight Democrats want to talk aboutanything besides Monica Lewinsky They are looking forward to talking abouteducation says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman Hill Democrats are urgingus to be tough says a White House staffer Democrats who dont have muchelse to campaign on would welcome an appropriations riot Tarring Republicansas antieducation antiabortion polluters is a timehonored Democraticelection strategy            The Republicans dilemma is that they are as alwaysfiercely divided Redmeat conservatives who willfully refuse to learn fromtheir  mistakes yearn to boot Clinton when hes down They loathe him Theweaker he gets the less they are willing to concede in appropriations Leadingconservative Rep David McIntosh RInd told Roll Call last month thatthe GOP would win a shutdown if Clinton forced one because Americans wouldrealize he was trying to distract them from Lewinsky They thought they wouldwin the last shutdown too            Talk ofchallenging Clinton alarms Republican leaders and moderates Clinton is gushingblood Democratic congressional candidates are sinking CongressionalRepublicans are judged in November  They are on a roll and they dont needto do anything that will jeopardize that roll says congressional analyst NormOrnstein And Flytrap makes other political jockeying especially foolhardyRepublicans dont want to seem partisan or malicious now so they canbe partisan and malicious during the postelection Flytrap hearings            So the result weirdly is a nolose forClinton If conservative Republicans are reckless enough to provoke anappropriations showdown Clinton will probably win the public relations warrevive Democrats and ward off Flytrap exactly what Republicans fear most Ifthe GOP doesnt provoke him hell be able to extract concessions in theappropriations bills The latter scenario is far more likely Diehardconservatives are not numerous enough or suicidal enough to force a showdownModerates and the leadership will prevail and give Clinton much of what hewants They will let the enfeebled president win now the better to kill himlater They dont want to give us any chance to recover and distract from theStarr report and unify us So theyll cave says a White House staffer ThisI suppose is politics The GOP will happily concede the substance money towin the symbolism            A backdoor appropriationsvictory is not exactly the strongarming triumph a chief executive is supposedto win over Congress But for the Flytrapped president its better thannothing
