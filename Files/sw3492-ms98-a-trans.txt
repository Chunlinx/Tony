                  they want us to talk about   football   football our favorite football teams and it doesnt sound like to you yours will be the Dallas Cowboys with your accent   it well it is well actually it isnt actually i the New York Giants  but i do like the Cowboys   oh right oh okay where are you   well im in in uh Plano in Texas yeah where are you   Plano im in Dallas   oh well   well what are you doing down here you working   uh well no well my husband was transferred down here   oh is he is he with TI   no huhuh   okay   but anyway they want us to talk about football and uh   right your favorite team is the New York Giants   yes but you know theyre not doing so good this year   well thats true but that happens after the anytime youre the Super Bowl team its its hard to repeat because everybodys shooting for you   yeah yeah thats true but i i dont know they have basically the same team they had last year i just i think the coaching stinks   you dont think that maybe their desire is not there or maybe theyre a year older   well i dont know i just think uh  they got rid of Bill Parcells well they didnt get rid of him he quit and i just dont like the guy thats replaced him hes very conservative in his play calling   yeah   you know i think he uh he could should he could have taken more chances this year   you dont think Parcells saw the handwriting and thought hed be better to go out as a winner   well thats possible but now i hear uh hes been talking with the uh Tampa Bay uh   i know it but see he can only go up from there because theyre so bad   exactly exactly   you know  if you go out on top and then go somewhere else its bad well its its well i dont i dont know i think Phil Simms   yeah   uh do you think Phil Simms might have been treated badly since he got bumped aside for Hostetler   well gee i dont know its hard to say you know you Hostetler Hostetler brought them to the Super Bowl and uh i dont know   yeah but do you do you think its fair because Simms was hurt that he didnt get his job back and then if he didnt do the job put Hostetler in there   well its a its possible you know i whos to say i mean uh i dont know Hostetler hed he had his his right numbers were there i mean you know he he had pretty good numbers but um   thats right it it just seemed to me that everybody was just a half a step off i dont know whether it was age or determination or coaching or what you know because it just somehow they were almost there all the time but   yeah i dont know theyre very disappointing their offense was very  it didnt do anything i mean their their maybe they they i think the most they they scored in any game was like twenty four points or something   uhhuh   you know they really had a  i dont know why because they had the same well you know they had the same offense as last year but they didnt score all that many points last year in each game but they um they have a terrific   one of those things where everything just falls in place for you you know   yeah i guess i guess yeah well how about the Cowboys theyre doing you know great   thats right but look what happened to them the last couple of years   well yeah but now well you know theyre really on the road back you know i mean that that game yesterday was terrific     yeah thats true were you out there   no no i i havent been to a game in a long time   oh well ive had season tickets since um nineteen sixty seven so ive seen a few games   oh really oh thats great were you out there yesterday oh man   yes uhhuh so its uh do well do you think Lawrence Taylor is about had it   i dont think so i mean i hope not anyway i mean hes so good you know   yeah i know hes uh fun to watch yeah hes great to watch and   yeah hes hes real good   yeah well you think yall will fire your coach   uh i dont know uh you know i dont know  i think maybe theyll give him another year     yeah they probably will   you know but um i was disappointed he was too conservative and he just didnt take enough chances   uhhuh   and um i you know id id prefer them to get somebody else id like to see them get Parcells back   well well i think he probably had to had pressure long enough and he wants to go somewhere where he can you know i can see his point it was a good time for him to leave really   yeah he left on top you know two Super Super Bowls in uh what four years that thats pretty damn good   yeah yeah well what what else could you do   yeah you know he couldnt really top it so uh and now im sure hes making more money doing uh you know sports reporting   yeah well what do you think you alls draft choices needs are for next year or do you get into it that deep uhhuh   what the Giants um you know i really dont i guess i guess they can um i really dont know defense and offense i suppose you know ive got theyve got the running backs well they could use a uh i guess they could use some more good receivers you know and   well didnt yall lose your tight end also that uh   yes and Navarro was terrific yeah they could use a a couple of really good tight ends they really they dont really have you know really you know super tight ends   yeah what happened what happened to him did they trade him or did he go somewhere   Navarro he was uh injured and i dont know then he came back and then they released him   is that i couldnt remember what happened to him   yeah yeah   because uh he was good   oh he was terrific he was like uh Novacek Novacek is
