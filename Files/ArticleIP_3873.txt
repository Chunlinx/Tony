                       Quoththe Maven                        Apropos of free speech andresponsible journalism what do we say about journalists quoting people withoutchecking to see if the quotation is accurate Neither Jacob Weisberg inThe Conintern nor David Brock in the Dialogue on rightwing journalism checked to see if I tried tointimidate Tucker Carlson or prevent him from criticizing Grover Norquistalthough they both condemned me for it Had I said it I would have condemnedmyself but I didnt say it I had a conversation with Carlson before hisarticle was published I offered to help he asked questions and I answeredthem I said some positive things about Grover and some critical things but Icertainly didnt suggest a line that Tucker should follow            When the nasty remarks fromWeisberg and Brock surfaced here I was concerned that Tucker might havemisunderstood something I said and taken it as an attempt to intimidate him soI checked it with him just to make sure my failing memory isnt even worsethan I think it is He remembers it as I do            For therecord the one journalist who did have the professionalism to check was HowardKurtz             Michael A

John Patrick Diggins isliving in a world of phantoms when he uses the myth of Lincoln as a hammer tosmash the myth of Thomas Jeffersons record on individual liberty and civilrights in Nothing to Declare his review of Pauline Maiers AmericanScripture             By now we all know thatJefferson was a slaveholder and that he protected slavery as an institution inorder to include the South in the revolution against England and the formationof the United States We also know that he viewed blacks as inherently inferiorto whites and advocated their return to Africa To call these views racist isfair enough in our day and age but it hardly takes into account the liberalmoderation by which Jefferson would have been judged on these issues in his owntime To actually see blacks as ones literal equal was one of the rarest ofvirtues in his time I dont know of many or perhaps any whites who advocatedsuch a view Perhaps Sally Hemings was as close as Jefferson dared to come onthis issue            Diggins forgets in hisdiscompassionate and deluded rewriting of history that Lincoln was no NAACPposter boy himself He publicly declared on many occasions that blacks wouldnever be the functional equals of whites in intelligence ability creativityor social and economic skill but that they must nevertheless be given theirfreedom and some basic legal rights He was never an advocate of integration ofthe races and felt that they would always be separate and unequal as a matterof society He also at times sympathized with the notion of American blacksreturning to Africa So how exactly does Diggins find Lincoln to be such asterling moral example fit to shame Jefferson            Jeffersonmade a huge leap forward in human and civil rights merely by so powerfullyadvocating them as a legal basis for political agreements between men It was ahuge step forward but neither perfect in conception or in deed as thepreservation of slavery proves Lincolns accomplishment was another huge stepforward but likewise imperfect He freed the slaves but had no intention ofmaking them equal Yet the direction of both men is clear and unmistakable andwas brought to an even higher plane of vision and deed by Martin Luther KingJr and many others in the modern civil rights movement To condemn Jeffersonfor his failings you must also condemn Lincoln but to condemn both is tothrow out the progressive historic tradition by which the present civil rightsmovement gains its legitimacy How will we be judged in  or  years whenI would hope our ideals and deeds have advanced beyond their present poorstate I would hope more compassionately and with greater understanding of theunique fabric of our times and the humility to appreciate the giant steps madeby those in the past than such
