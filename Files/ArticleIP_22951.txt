                                  A Taxing Woman            Do taxes really driveAmericans crazy Amity Shlaes thinks so Her new book The Greedy Hand HowTaxes Drive Americans Crazy and What To Do About It  argues that America ison the verge of a civic tax revolt Voters she writes cry out for taxrelief and when tax breaks are given to them they discover the puny size ofthe break and turn angry But the book demonstrates only that taxes havedriven Shlaes crazy The notion that citizens must pay some price forgovernment has rendered her incoherent irrational and convinced thateverybody else shares her obsession            This kind of pathologyis a job requirement for Shlaes who writes on tax policy for the WallStreet Journal editorial page Shlaes book is a longer exposition of theJournal s supplyside theology which holds that tax cuts forupperincome earners can produce almost magical economic results The bookpreaches this now familiar creed to the multitudes Shlaes uses folksy lingoand homespun anecdotes to give her message a warmly populist glow            The problem of course is that the everrising tax burdenis not driving Americans crazy One reason for this disappointing stoicism maybe that for the middle class the tax burden isnt in fact rising All crediblesources the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for instance agree thatthe median tax burden has fallen in recent yearsthat is middleincometaxpayers are paying less And opinion poll after opinion poll shows that onlya tiny minority supports using the budget surplus for tax cuts So like theJournal editorial dogma it recycles The Greedy Hand must resortto distortion hypocrisy and illogic to create the illusion of incipient taxrevolt            To do so Shlaes trots outthe same phony numbers used by antitax members of Congress The book relies ondodgy statistics from the Tax Foundation that supposedly show a rising averagetax burden but are based on inflated estimates and miscounting to review themany egregious flaws in the Tax Foundation study see a previous             In fact Shlaes cites only one nonphony piece ofevidencebut even that doesnt mean what she thinks it does Americans aresuffering she writes from real bracket creep Bracket creep used to be aproblem Before the s tax brackets were based on fixed income thresholdsthat didnt account for inflation So when prices and wages rose quicklytaxpayers were pushed into higher tax brackets even though their real wageswerent rising at all President Reagan fixed this by indexing tax brackets forinflation            So bracket creep doesnt exist anymore But Shlaestries to resurrect it by discussing real bracket creepthe process of peopleshifting into higher tax brackets as their real income climbs This hashappened recently the strong economy and booming stock market have producedbig gains in income and hence in income taxes To dramatize this pointShlaes recounts the Beatles song Taxman written in  just as the groupwas beginning to enjoy its greatest success Their financial situation is arepresentative samplewe are all Beatles now she writes mournfully            But Shlaes doesntexplain why this is a problem  Yes when the Beatles sold a skillionalbums a year they paid higher taxes than they did when they struggled inanonymity And yes some people are paying tax rates they never expected wouldapply to them but only because theyre earning more money than they everexpected Tax rates are marginal When higher income moves you into a highertax bracket you pay the higher rate only on the extra income If Microsoftaccidentally added a few extra zeroes to the end of my paycheck I would end uppaying a higher tax rate than I had anticipated but you wouldnt hear mecomplaining about it            Shlaes analysis is also full of astonishing omissions Shedenounces the payroll tax as regressive which it is But she doesnt mentionthat its effect is partly offset by the Earned Income Tax Credit a tax rebatefor lowincome workers Indeed she takes several swipes at the EITC writingfor instance that it has morphed into a  billion project that shapesmillions of Americans lives It has shaped their lives by reducing oreliminating their taxes Amity this is what youre supposed to be for remember Unless of course she is for reducing taxes on the rich but not onthe working poor and near poor who benefit from the EITC            Shlaes claims that theentire notion of a progressive tax code is a fraud Progressivity shemaintains doesnt do what it says it does tax the rich This is because thewealthy use loopholes to avoid their nominal rates For instance she notesthe superrich can take their salary in the form of stock options which aretaxed at a lower capital gains rate Technically shes wrong about that Inmost circumstances employee stock option profits are taxed as ordinary incomeBut her broad point that special breaks for things such as capital gainsundermine the tax codes progressivity is true enough            This is hardly a sincere indictment of the current systemhowever The Wall Street Journal editorial page lobbies for lowercapital gains rates on an almost daily basis and has been doing so for morethan two decades Shlaes and her colleagues have long championed the loopholesthat have compromised the tax codes progressive structure Despite theJournal s best efforts though the tax code is progressive Thatis the effective ratesthe actual taxes paid as a proportion of incomeonthe rich are higher than those on the middle class            What explains the stunning logical inconsistenciesand misrepresentations in this book Is it hypocrisy Confusion Or just aphilosophy of any weapon to hand Probably a bit of all three Shlaes hatesprogressivity not because it fails but because it succeeds Of course Shlaescould honestly argue what she really believes Making the rich pay higher taxrates than the poor is just not fair dammit But most Americans dont agreeand that is what really drives Amity Shlaes crazy
