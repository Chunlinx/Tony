                                 The Constitution and Campaign Reform            Supporters ofcampaignfinance reform deserve fairly high marks for realism these days Mostof the good government groups like Common Cause Public Citizen and the Leagueof Women Voters have long favored a comprehensive solution based on publicfinancing of congressional campaigns With varying degrees of enthusiasmhowever they all have come around to supporting the halfloaf baked by SensJohn McCain and Russ Feingold and even to rooting for the quarterloaf ofMcCainFeingold Lite the version now crumbling on the floor of the Senate            In oneway however the advocates of McCainFeingold are still being wildlyoptimistic They are counting on the Supreme Court to reverse its longstandingdoctrine on campaign regulation and freedom of speech There are strong FirstAmendment obstacles to various provisions in the bill The court is unlikely toremove these which means that even if reform does pass it will accomplish farless than its supporters intend            He who would wade into this swamp must first immersehimself in Buckley vs Valeo  the  Supreme Court case that madecampaignfinance reform a sadistically complicated and possibly hopelessenterprise Buckley was a review of the  postWatergatecampaignfinance reforms which were supposed to cure many of the very problemsMcCainFeingold is supposed to cure In general Buckley upheldrestrictions on political contributions while rejecting limits onpolitical expenditures  The core issue was whether money equals speechThe court conceded that giving money to a political candidate is a way ofexpressing support But it reasoned that the message I support candidate Xhas little relation to the amount of money you give However when you spendyour money directly communicating the message I support candidate X or Iam candidate X that spending is an exercise of free speech protectedby the Constitution            But this bright line inprinciple between contributions and expenditures quickly gets fuzzy inpractice When is spending to promote a candidate really just an inkindcontribution If I want to spend my salary on an ad saying that Alfonse DAmatois a distinguished statesman and a much underrated thinker Im free to do soBut what if I work out the text of my encomium with his campaign manager Thecourt created a distinction between independent and coordinatedexpenditures Coordinated expenditures amount to an inkind contribution andare subject to all the rules and limits            Evenindependent expenditures are not free of all restrictions if they involveexpress advocacy of a candidate as opposed to a discussion of the issuesthat stops short of explicit endorsement Under current law such expendituresmust be publicly disclosed and corporations and unions are forbidden to makethem except through PACs which raise money from employees and membersostensibly on a voluntary basis and have their own set of financial limitsCorporations and unions however have become adept at devising ways to helptheir favored candidates that stop just short of express advocacy            McCain and Feingold are valiantly attempting tocrack down on the major abuses that have sprouted in the cracks of theBuckley ruling The bill closes the softmoney loophole which is theworst abuse of the current system Soft money is money donated to and spent bythe political parties ostensibly for reasons other than direct support ofcandidates but without limits on who may give or how much Unfortunately theSupreme Court ruled last year that spending by a political party cannotautomatically be assumed to be coordinated with a senatorial campaign Theeffect of this decision was to establish that political parties have the samerights as individuals and other kinds of groups to make independentexpenditures in the vicinity of an election            McCainFeingold says that federal office holders and national party leaderscant solicit softmoney contributions to state parties in order to evade thelimits on hardmoney contributionsas they did so bountifully in  Somesmart First Amendment lawyers who are doubtful about other parts ofMcCainFeingold think this kind of softmoney ban is also OK But it willsurely be challenged            The reformheads run into bigger trouble on the other twoissues wealthy candidates who spend gargantuan sums of their own money andphony issue ads that are barely disguised campaign ads On the first pointMcCainFeingold tries to prevent the Michael Huffingtons of the world fromspending more than  of their own riches by forbidding political partiesfrom making coordinated expenditures on their behalf The device is borrowedfrom the rules for presidential elections in which candidates accept spendinglimits in exchange for government subsidies Buckley said this was OKbecause the limits were voluntary McCainFeingold would forbid politicalparties to aid their own candidates unless the candidate voluntarily acceptedthe personal spending limit This might well strike the justices as being morelike a stick than a carrot making the choice not voluntary at all            The independentexpenditureproblem is the most serious McCainFeingold attempts to rein in politicalspending by corporations and unions through expanding the definition ofexpress advocacy In essence the bill states that any mention of a candidateby name within  days of Election Day counts as express advocacy Thisstandard would make criminals out of the two little old ladies who in theACLUs favorite example took out an ad in the newspaper on the eve of the election to protest Nixons bombing of Cambodia Though promoters ofMcCainFeingold contend that this redefinition is consistent withBuckley  what they really mean is that they hope the Supreme Court willbe prepared to rethink Buckley  Their theory is that the court will lookat the mess of recent elections and decide that the line it drew two decadesago in Buckley is unworkable Well its a theory
