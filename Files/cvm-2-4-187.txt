                    Introduction        MI is a potentially catastrophic event in patients        presenting with acute coronary syndromes In recent trials        of antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapies for such        patients prevention of MI was the primary treatment effect        assessed      Although MI has been considered a        hard endpoint determination of MI endpoints in        clinical trials can be difficult just as in clinical        practice Because of conflicting clinical laboratory and        electrocardiography ECG data physicians often disagree        whether a patient has suffered a MI The importance of        lowlevel enzyme elevations also has been controversial        particularly in asymptomatic patients and in those        undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention PCI          Although such enzyme elevations are defined as MIs in many        trial protocols physicians in clinical practice do not        consistently consider them as such The MI rates reported        by site investigators in recent cardiovascular trials have        differed from rates adjudicated by a CEC      The        reasons for these differences are unclear        CECs are widely accepted to adjudicate suspected        endpoint events in trials but only limited information has        been published regarding endpoint adjudication               In the PURSUIT trial   a central        independent CEC systematically identified and adjudicated        all suspected MIs that occurred up to  days after        enrolment The rationale for CEC adjudication was the need        for a systematic unbiased independent and standard        assessment of MIs in a large international trial In a        previous analysis of the CEC process in the PURSUIT trial        we found that the CEC and site investigator assessments of        endpoint MI disagreed in  of patients   We        retrospectively reviewed these cases to identify reasons        for them and to understand their potential effect on the        trial results                    Materials and methods                  The PURSUIT trial          The PURSUIT trial examined the role of eptifibatide a          platelet glycoprotein IIbIIIa antagonist in patients          presenting with acute coronary syndromes without          persistent STsegment elevation The trial enrolled           patients in  hospitals in  countries in North          America Latin America Western Europe and Eastern          Europe using previously reported inclusion and exclusion          criteria and treatment regimens   The primary          endpoint was a composite of death or postenrolment MI          or reinfarction if patients had a MI at enrolment by           days as adjudicated by a CEC The composite endpoint was          also constructed using the site investigator          determination of MI                          Definitions          The protocol defined MI as an endpoint event based on          clinical ECG and laboratory criteria see Appendix          MIs that occurred before or at enrolment were not          included in the primary endpoint The site investigators          and the CEC used the same MI criteria These criteria          were presented in the protocol at investigator meetings          and in trial materials and newsletters                          Data collection          Data were captured on standard case report forms          Information collected for all patients included cardiac          enzymes ECGs at the time of the qualifying episode at          enrolment at  hours at initial discharge and at           days revascularisation procedure reports details of          ischemic episodes clinical complications medications          and readmission records All enzyme values for each          patient were to be reported and study monitors verified          them against source documents For patients with          suspected MI site investigators were to submit          supporting documents and to include discharge summaries          and additional ECGs during the suspected event An          independent blinded ECG Core Laboratory read the ECGs          and identified suspected MIs defined as new Q waves            s in two contiguous leads                          Clinical events classification process          The structure of the CEC and the event adjudication          process have been reported in detail elsewhere            Computer algorithms systematically identified key          clinical enzymatic and ECG data from the database that          could indicate the occurrence of a MI Each case of          suspected MI was reviewed independently by two physicians          blinded to treatment If the physicians agreed that a MI          had or had not occurred the case was classified as          resolved A committee of faculty cardiologists reviewed          patients about which the CEC physicians disagreed for          adjudication by consensus                          Disagreements between the site investigators and          CEC          A faculty cardiologist KWM RAH BSC rereviewed          patients with disagreement between the site investigator          assessment and the CEC adjudication of endpoint MI to          determine reasons for the disagreement This review          occurred after the main trial results were presented but          the reviewers were blinded to patient treatment          assignment Patients were categorised during the          rereview in clinically meaningful groups MI at          enrolment versus postenrolment MI MI related to the          revascularisation procedure MI related to clinically          evident ischemia asymptomatic cardiac enzyme elevation          postenrolment and clinically significant cardiac event          resulting in death versus sudden death without evidence          of MI          Despite rigorous criteria to define MI some patients          required a subjective assessment by CEC physicians if          cardiac enzyme ECG and clinical information conflicted          For patients with MI identified by the CEC but not by the          site investigator excluding events after PCI or bypass          surgery we therefore assigned a level of clinical          certainty A high clinical certainty was assigned when          all clinicians agreed that a MI had occurred a low          clinical certainty was assigned when only some clinicians          would agree that a MI had occurred                          Statistical analysis          Data regarding the number of patients with suspected          events and those with disagreements between the site          investigators and the CEC were obtained from the entire          PURSUIT study population so the data included patients          assigned highdose eptifibatide lowdose eptifibatide          or placebo Comparisons by treatment assignments included          only patients assigned to highdose eptifibatide or          placebo to maintain consistency with the primary efficacy          analysis in the PURSUIT trial             P values were calculated using the           test                            Results                  Incidence of disagreement          Overall   patients with possible or          suspected MI were identified and adjudicated by the CEC          The CEC identified more patients with endpoint events          than did the site investigators  versus  for          placebo  versus  for eptifibatide The CEC and          site investigator assessments of MI disagreed for  of          all patients enrolled in the PURSUIT trial The CEC          identified MIs in  of the  patients with          suspected MI The site investigator and the CEC          assessments disagreed in   of the  patients          Of these  patients with disagreements  patients          had a MI identified by the CEC but not the site          investigator and  patients had a MI identified by          site investigator but not the CEC The proportion of          patients with disagreement was similar among regions                          Reasons for disagreement          Most often when the site investigator had identified          a MI and the CEC had not the investigator had          misclassified a MI at enrolment as an endpoint MI          although by protocol these were not endpoint events          Table  Recurrent ischemic events without elevated          cardiac enzymes or ECG evidence of MI were also          incorrectly identified by site investigators as MIs          Table  In cases where the CEC had identified a MI and          the site investigators had not onethird of those          identified were MIs defined by enzyme elevations without          clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia or infarction Table           Enzyme elevations after bypass surgery accounted for           of these cases Patients with clinically evident          ischemia reported by the site investigator and associated          with cardiac enzyme elevations were not reported as MIs          by investigators in  of the cases of disagreement          Table  Few infarctions based on new Q waves without          clinical evidence of reinfarction were identified by the          CEC and not by site investigators          Table presents the cardiac enzyme elevation for MIs          that the CEC identified and the site investigators did          not These data exclude MIs associated with PCI or bypass          surgery by definition those types of MI required enzyme          elevations greater than three or five times the upper          limit of normal ULN respectively The ratio of          creatine kinasemyocardial band CKMB to its ULN was          highest in North America median  th  th             Enzymes were similarly elevated between patients          with MIs defined only by enzyme elevations without          symptoms or ECG changes and patients with elevations          associated with ECG or clinical evidence of ischemia          Table presents the level of clinical certainty for          MIs not associated with PCI or bypass surgery as          identified by the CEC but not the site investigators          Overall   of these patients were assigned a low          level of clinical certainty The proportion of patients          assigned a low level of clinical certainty varied among          the regions with the lowest in North America                          Effect of disagreement on outcomes          The day CEC rates of MI and death or MI overall are          presented in Table by geographic region The event rates          are also shown for the analyses in which the  patients          assigned a low level of certainty were reclassified as no          infarction          The lowest mortality rates were in patients for whom          the CEC and site investigators agreed that no MI had          occurred by  days Table  The highest rates were in          patients for whom there was agreement that a MI had          occurred Mortality was high in the group with MI          identified by the site investigators but not the CEC          however many of these patients had suspected sudden          cardiac death as the event identified as a MI by the          investigator Table  The absolute increase in          mortality between  days and  months was greater in          patients with CECdetermined MIs not identified by the          site investigators than in patients with MI identified by          the site investigators but not the CEC                            Discussion                  Event rates          The MI rates adjudicated by the CEC in the PURSUIT          trial were higher than those reported in trials of          similar patient populations      The reasons          for these higher rates have been detailed previously            and include the review of nearly  of patients by          physicians to identify suspected events more liberal MI          criteria and rigorous measurement of cardiac enzymes in          all patients Studies that have used only          investigatorreported events probably underestimate the          true MI rate                          Lack of concordance between site investigator and          CEC event rates          Site investigators underreported MIs A similar lack          of concordance between events adjudicated by a CEC and          those identified by clinical investigators has been          observed in trials in which a similar CEC group          adjudicated MIs    and in other trials             The MI definitions in the PURSUIT trial were          formulated by the International Steering Committee based          on experience and clinical expertise Because of the          broad geographic enrolment planned for the PURSUIT trial          definitions were designed to be applicable in an array of          clinical practice situations The definitions were          detailed in the study protocol in study newsletters and          in study materials so the CEC and site investigators had          the same set of criteria to classify MIs          The reasons for disagreements in MI assessment between          the site investigators and the CEC in the PURSUIT trial          Tables and  are similar to those seen in the Global          Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries in Acute          Coronary Syndromes GUSTOIIb and the Integrilin to          Minimize Platelet Aggregation and Coronary Thrombosis          IMPACTII trials unpublished personal data Many of          the disagreements reflect physician reluctance to          diagnose MI in patients they are treating particularly          when the definition of MI includes events with lowlevel          cardiac enzyme elevations often called enzyme leaks in          clinical practice This reluctance by physicians to          diagnose MI is also apparent for patients undergoing PCI          in which the clinical significance of postprocedural          enzyme elevations is controversial even though such          elevations correlate with worse outcome            The disagreements also may partly reflect the          definitions see Appendix of MI themselves These          definitions were designed to be applied to a broad set of          clinical scenarios including events after PCI or bypass          surgery and to events occurring early after enrolment          which needed to be differentiated from preenrolment or          enrolment MIs Site investigators may have had difficulty          applying these criteria particularly with conflicting          cardiac enzyme ECG and clinical information In          addition the enzyme criteria in the PURSUIT trial          required only one cardiac enzyme value above normal to          provide supportive evidence of MI Substantial clinical          uncertainty exists regarding the need for more than one          elevated enzyme value and whether the CKMB criteria          should specify elevations greater than   ULN or            ULN          The strategy used by a CEC to adjudicate MIs can          dramatically influence event rates and the proportion of          events with disagreements between site investigators and          a CEC Some trials have confirmed only events reported by          the investigators        while other          trials have adjudicated all suspected events identified          by systematic screening of patient data                 When only events reported by investigators are          reviewed by a CEC the reported event rates will be          identical to or lower than the site investigator rates          When events are identified independently by the CEC the          CEC event rates may be higher lower or the same as the          site investigatorreported rates                          Difference in treatment effect          The absolute difference in the MI rates was            for eptifibatide versus  for placebo as assessed by          the site investigators and   versus  as          adjudicated by the CEC The higher event rates in both          treatment arms using the CEC data despite the similar          absolute difference reduced the relative treatment          effect  versus  reduction as expected A          similar decrease in relative treatment effect has been          noted in some trials    but not others                       The MIs determined by cardiac enzyme elevations          without clinical symptoms or ECG changes accounted for           of the disagreements in which the CEC identified a MI          and the site investigators did not The median CKMB          elevation in these events was   ULN About  of          these events were thus defined by CKMB values between            ULN and   ULN with normal median CK values            ULN Table           A retrospective but blinded review of MIs identified          by the CEC but not the site investigator found that            of these patients were assigned a low level of          clinical certainty This was because although the CK or          CKMB elevations met the endpoint criteria the cardiac          enzyme data were considered inconsistent or unreliable          or were associated with conflicting clinical and ECG          data          We noted regional differences in the proportion of          patients with low clinical certainty The highest          proportions were in Eastern Europe and Latin America          where the observed treatment effect using the CEC          definition was negligible Furthermore the magnitude of          the enzyme elevations Table  parallels discrepancies          in the assigned level of certainty The highest enzyme          elevations were observed in North America median CKMB          elevation   ULN median CK elevation   ULN          where the treatment effect was mostpronounced CKMB          elevations in other regions were less striking median          CKMB elevation   ULN  ULN The regional          differences in treatment effect are however complex and          include differences in patient demographics the use of          cardiac procedures medications and revascularisation          and the reliability of laboratory data   These          findings support the hypothesis that including MI          endpoints defined by lowlevel cardiac enzyme elevations          or events associated with conflicting clinical and ECG          data may dilute the actual treatment effect                          Predictive value of CECidentified events          The day treatment effect was reduced using          CECadjudicated endpoints versus site investigator          assessments but patients with events adjudicated by the          CEC but not identified by the site investigators had          greater mortality between  days and  months than did          patients with MI reported only by the site investigators          Table  In addition MIs identified by a similar CEC          process have been associated with worse longterm          outcomes at year followup   These data suggest          that events identified by the CEC alone are of prognostic          importance                            Implications        CEC adjudication of suspected nonfatal MI endpoint        events is important to provide independent unbiased        standard systematic assessment The CEC adjudication does        have certain limitations The criteria used to define MI        must be evaluated The determination of MI may require more        clinical judgment in patients with inconsistent clinical        history cardiac enzyme data and ECG information or        suspect cardiac enzyme data We recognise that this may        decrease the objectivity that is important for event        classification particularly in trials across geographic        regions and clinical practice settings At a minimum        events characterised by a low level of clinical certainty        should not be classified as MIs        Although the absolute difference in infarction rates        determined by the CEC versus site investigators was small        the relative difference was more substantial This caused a        substantial impact on the statistical outcome of the trial        This phenomenon must be considered in calculations of        sample size and power during design of future trials and        also may influence how clinical and regulatory bodies        interpret trial results In addition the CEC process used        must be considered among other factors when performing        comparisons of event rates between trials                    Conclusions        Nonfatal MI is an important clinical outcome and its        prevention is a key measure of efficacy in evaluating new        therapies for acute coronary syndromes The determination        of MI can be difficult in clinical practice due to        conflicting clinical cardiac enzyme and ECG data The CEC        adjudication of MI provides a standard systematic        independent and unbiased assessment of this endpoint in        clinical investigations In the PURSUIT trial the        assessments of MI by site investigators and a central CEC        disagreed more MIs were identified by the CEC than by site        investigators Most disagreements reflected underreporting        of procedurerelated events and misclassification of        enrolment MIs as postenrolment endpoint MIs        Understanding the CEC process used in a trial is important        in interpreting event rates particularly when comparing        rates between trials The type of CEC process also has        implications in calculations of sample size and power Our        review of the PURSUIT trial CEC experience has highlighted        some of these important issues and the need to further        evaluate the strategies used for event adjudication                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        CEC  clinical events committee
