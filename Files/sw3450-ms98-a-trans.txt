        um well um guess its logical to ask do you exercise any     well unfortunately very little uh much less than what i need to     im about the same way i i do a little bit my my job kind of hinders me from exercising im a night operator here at a industry down here and i dont really get out a lot during because of my job to to exercise   well i uh am an assistant teacher  and uh in business technology and ive i think the most exercise ive gotten in the last three or four month is just jumping up and down to go answer the kids questions it keeps me pretty busy but       its not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going and and uh   right   you know really exercise is so important and i realize that   it is umhum thats thats the way i feel im used to being in pretty good shape because when i was in high school i stayed in pretty good shape playing a little basketball and stuff like that but ive gotten now im in college and i go to school during the day and work at night i can tell that ive not really done a whole lot   when you uh exercise what do you do do you do it at home or a club or   well uh i usually im i usually play at home we live out in the country so me and my brotherll play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play or a lot of times were were up at the church well play volleyball stuff like that   i got a hold of uh Richard Simmonss tape uh   oh really   what is it uh i cant even think of the name of it right offhand uh with the oldies   oh the Sweating to the Oldies   Sweating with the to the Oldies yeah and thats not bad   oh really   thats pretty upbeat so you know i every once in a while ill put the cassette in and go with it but   right   not often enough to have a routine   right ill   my little Schnauzer wishes i would get out and walk with her   oh really   but uh i dont know by the time i get home all i wanna do is just collapse or sit down at my computer and my fingers exercise more than anything now   right thats the way i am i just want to sit down and relax too tired to exercise   yes uh do you ever ride a bike or anything like that   i did i started riding my bike about a couple of months ago and id ride about two or three miles a day but but itd last about a couple of weeks and it got real cold for a little while so i gave it up   here about the the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk them   walk around   because theyre enclosed and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter   right right ive noticed people doing that down here too ill be in town or something and people will walk around the mall   and its safe   it it is its fairly safe   thats uh you know inside the mall may be not safe going to the parking garage lot   uhhuh yeah certain parts of it   i know a doctor once told me it it a friend of mine uh suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is   right right i used to do a lot of swimming we have we have a swimming pool and but its an old concrete pool weve been having trouble with it the past few years so we havent got to use it much but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that   the uh swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with and the water takes the resistance   right   right and you dont get the soreness ive ive done some water exercises but our pool is not is not heated so its   right you cant do it year round   summertime only   right thats the way ours is just in the summertime   you dont go out when its twenty some odd degrees and and go out to the swimming pool   no no no its too cold   hot tubs are not not uh not too bad but   i could deal with a hot tub those are nice   so what part of Mississippi are you from   im from Laurel   whereabouts is that   thats  way down towards the south not quite on the coast but were about two hours from the coast   oh and you do have cold weather down there   yes yes maam it well it started about yesterday i believe it started raining and got real cold   ours started Thanksgiving   oh   and uh from there just well today was pretty but uh oh Sunday the snow and ice came in   right   and uh there was no exercise
