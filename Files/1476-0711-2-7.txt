                    Background        Quality of life can be improved by enhancing standards        of medical treatment at all levels of the health care        delivery system Setting standards and assessing the        quality of care through performance review should become        part of everyday clinical practice     The study of        prescribing patterns seeks to monitor evaluate and suggest        modifications in practitioners prescribing habits so as to        make medical care rational and cost effective        Information about antibiotic use patterns is necessary        for a constructive approach to problems that arise from the        multiple antibiotics available     In developing        countries the cost of health care is a matter of major        concern     This is especially true for Nepal a        developing country in South Asia Excessive and        inappropriate use of antibiotics in hospitals health care        facilities and the community contributes to the development        of bacterial resistance In India reports on antibiotic        utilization at an institutional level include both        crosssectional    and longitudinal studies     of        prescribing patterns        The ATC anatomictherapeuticchemical classification        assigns code letters and numbers to drugs      The        defined daily dose DDD concept was developed to overcome        objections against traditional units of drug consumption            The DDD for a given drug is established on the basis        of an assumed average use per day of the drug for its main        indication in adults     DDD will be assigned only for        drugs that already have an ATC code DDD is a unit of        measurement and may not reflect the prescribed daily dose        however they provide a fixed unit of measurement        independent of price and formulation and enable the        researcher to perform comparisons between population        groups DDD beddays provides a rough estimate of        consumption of drugs among hospital inpatients        Information on antibiotic use patterns the illnesses        for which antibiotics are prescribed and the DDD        beddays of commonly used antibiotics in hospitals in        Western Nepal are lacking Hence the present study was        carried out over  months  to  at the        Manipal Teaching Hospital a tertiary care hospital        attached to the Manipal College of Medical Sciences        Pokhara Nepal        The objectives of the study were to         collect relevant demographic information and        information on duration of hospitalization of patients        admitted to the Internal Medicine ward and prescribed        antibiotics during the study         obtain information on the antibiotic prescribing        pattern and the disease conditions for which antibiotics        were prescribed         obtain information on the common organisms isolated        during culture and sensitivity testing and their antibiotic        sensitivity patterns         apply the ATC classification to the commonly used        antibiotics and to calculate their DDDs beddays         calculate the mean  SD cost of antibiotics per        prescription                    Methods        The study was carried out over a threemonth period at        the Manipal Teaching Hospital Pokhara Nepal Patients        admitted to the Internal Medicine ward who were prescribed        antibiotics were included in the study and were identified        manually This may have the potential for bias and errors        Quantitative estimation of the bias has not been carried        out in this study Computerization of the Medical Records        Department is in progress and there is a proposal for        storing the hospital records in a computerized format This        may help in reducing any potential bias        The age and sex of the patients clinical diagnosis        duration of hospitalization antibiotic information name        dose and frequency and the results of culture and        sensitivity testing were entered into the patient indicator        form PIF see Additional file  The antibiotics        prescribed for parenteral use and indications for their use        were also analyzed separately Antibiotics were used for        prophylaxis bacteriologically proven infection BPI or        nonbacteriologically proven infection nonBPI Details        of antibiotic use in BPI were noted        Additional File         Patient indicator form Description of data Format used        to enter information about the patients        Click here for file        The mean cost of antibiotics prescribed during the        hospital stay and on discharge from the hospital was noted        The cost of antibiotics prescribed during the hospital stay        was determined using the price list supplied by the        hospital pharmacy        Patients with a monthly family income less than         Nepalese rupees  US   Nepalese rupees were taken as        belonging to low socioeconomic status those with a monthly        income between  to  rupees and more than         rupees were taken as belonging to middle and high        socioeconomic status respectively The socioeconomic        classification was worked out by Mr Theodore of the        Community Medicine department of our institution with input        from the Statistics department of the Green Pasture        hospital Pokhara The average per capita income of Nepal        was the major consideration while preparing the        classification which had been previously tested during the        field visits by the Community Medicine department Housing        the extent of land holdings and material possessions owned        by the respondents were examined in these field visits        Respondents were also asked about their family income when        interviewed in the ward the limitation being that we were        entirely dependent on the respondents answer and had no        means to cross check the same as in the field visits        The percentage of antibiotics prescribed from the        Essential drug list of Nepal    and from the WHO list of        Essential drugs    and the DDD beddays of the         most commonly prescribed antibiotics in the Internal        Medicine ward was calculated The DDD beddays of the        individual antibiotics were added together to get the total        antibiotic consumption Ciprofloxacin has two DDDs one for        oral use of the antibiotic and the other for parenteral        use The  DDDs beddays were calculated separately and        then were added to measure the total consumption of        ciprofloxacin in DDDs beddays DDD beddays was        calculated by the formula                The institutional review board of the Manipal College of        Medical Sciences Pokhara Nepal approved the study                    Results        Two hundred and three of the  patients admitted to        the Internal Medicine ward were prescribed antibiotics        during the study period Out of the total of  patients          were male One hundred and four patients         were above the age of  years Regarding the        ethnic composition  patients  were Gurungs while         patients  were Brahmins The other common        ethniccaste groups in the study were Chettris  patients         Bishwakarmas  patients  and Newars         patients  One hundred and eighteen patients         belonged to an urban area while the remaining were from        rural areas        Figure shows the number of antibiotics prescribed        during the period of hospital stay Ninetyeight patients        were prescribed a single antibiotic while  patients were        prescribed two antibiotics Twentythree patients were        prescribed  antibiotics while  and  antibiotics were        prescribed to  and  patients respectively        The duration of hospitalization of the  patients was        recorded One hundred and one patients  were        hospitalized for a time period ranging from  to  days        Median duration of hospitalization was  days and the        interquartile range was  days The corresponding figures        for hospitalized patients who were not prescribed an        antibiotic were  and  days respectively        The most common condition for which an antibiotic was        prescribed was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD         The other common conditions were lower respiratory        tract infections LRTI  urinary tract infections        UTI  and pneumonia  One hundred and seventy        three patients were discharged  patients died  patients        were discharged at request and  were transferred to the        Intensive Care Unit ICU Six patients left against        medical advice while  patients were referred to other        hospitals        Sixtyeight patients  belonged to the lower        socioeconomic group while  patients  and         patients  were from the middle and high        socioeconomic groups respectively Three hundred and forty        seven patient antibiotics were prescribed Table shows the        frequency of prescribing of the  most commonly prescribed        antibiotics One hundred and seventy six patient        antibiotics  were prescribed parenterally        Antibiotics were used for BPI in  patients nonBPI in         patients and for prophylaxis in  patients Mean  SD        cost of antibiotics prescribed during the hospital stay was           Nepalese rupees    US Parenteral        antibiotics accounted for  of the total cost        Antibiotics were prescribed at the time of discharge in         patients with amoxicillin  patients being most commonly        prescribed The other commonly prescribed antibiotics on        discharge were ciprofloxacin  patients ampicillin         patients and metronidazole  patients        Of the  patient antibiotics prescribed          were prescribed from the Essential drug list of Nepal           and   from WHO Essential drug list     One        hundred and twelve patient antibiotics  were used in        BPI Ampicillin  amoxicillin  metronidazole         ciprofloxacin  and crystalline penicillin         were the predominant antibiotics Other antibiotics         included norfloxacin cephalexin cotrimoxazole and        cefotaxime Sixtythree  of the  patient        antibiotics used in BPI were prescribed by the parenteral        route        Table shows the ATC codes and the DDDs bed days of        the  most commonly used antibiotics in the Internal        Medicine ward The study was carried out for a period of         days the number of beds in the Internal Medicine ward was         and the average occupancy index during the study period        was         Culture and sensitivity testing was carried out in         patients  and a total of  specimens were sent for        testing One hundred and twenty eight patients had single        specimen sent for culture and sensitivity testing         patients had two specimens and  patients three        specimens Sputum was the most frequent specimen followed        by urine and blood The results were negative in  cases        while in  cases normal flora was grown A total of         organisms were isolated The predominant organisms isolated        were         H influenzae n           E coli n           K pneumoniae n           S aureus n   and         S pneumoniae n   Table shows        the antibiotic resistance patterns of the commonly isolated        organisms Table shows the number of antibiotics to which        the commonly isolated organisms were resistant        The most frequent organism isolated in the sputum was         H influenzae n   These        isolates were resistant to tetracyclines in  of cases        to chloramphenicol in  of cases amoxicillin in  of        cases cotrimoxazole in  of cases and erythromycin in         of cases In the urine         E coli was the most frequent        organism isolated accounting for  of total organisms        from the urine The resistance patterns of         E coli were as follows gentamicin         norfloxacin  ciprofloxacin  and        ampicillin  However  of         E coli isolates were resistant to        most antibiotics but were sensitive to cotrimoxazole The        blood cultures were negative in most of the instances                    Discussion        Antibiotic resistance among pathogenic microorganisms is        a matter of worldwide concern Selective pressure by        antimicrobial drugs is by far the most important driving        force for the development of such resistance Antibiotics        are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in hospitals        and in developed countries around  of the hospitalized        patients are treated with these drugs     The present        study documents that of the patients were prescribed        antibiotics This is very similar to the reports from        developed countries     Antibiotic prescription was        studied over  months the major disadvantage being that        seasonal variations in antibiotic prescribing could not be        taken into consideration over this short period The number        of samples which were sent for culture and sensitivity        testing were small which may also affect the validity of        the conclusions drawn about antibiotic resistance        Among patients admitted to the Internal Medicine ward        there was a preponderance of those above the age of         years This factor may have influenced antibiotic        prescribing as older patients are more likely to be sick        and to have more serious illnesses Also paediatric        patients   years were not included in the analysis        as they are admitted to the Paediatric Medicine ward        Brahmins and Gurungs were the  major ethnic groups        encountered in our study The data on the ethnic        composition of patients gives information on the        utilization of the hospital by the different ethnic groups        in Kaski and the neighbouring districts A substantial        number of Gurungs are exservicemen and our hospital has        tied up with the Gorkha Welfare Society of the British        Gorkhas A Gorkha Welfare Scheme GWS has been introduced        for these exservicemen and their dependents Seven of the         Gurungs were benefited by GWS        Sixtyeight patients  belonged to low        socioeconomic groups The Manipal Teaching Hospital is a        private sector health care provider where most of the        patients have to pay for their treatment and medicines We        have created a Poor Patients Fund PPF in our hospital to        help the economically deprived patients Partial or        sometimes even full concession in hospital charges may be        offered to these patients Thirtyeight of the  patients         benefited from the PPF at our hospital  of these        patients belonged to a low socioeconomic group        The median duration of hospitalization was  days and        the interquartile range was  days The majority of        patients were hospitalized for a time period between  to         days In a previous study    in the Intensive Care Unit        ICU of our hospital the mean  SD period of        hospitalization was    days and economic        constraints were a major reason for seeking an early        discharge from the ICU In this study median duration of        hospitalization for patients receiving systemic antibiotics        was significantly higher compared to patients not receiving        antibiotics This is similar to the results observed in a        Hungarian study            COPD LRTI and UTI were the most frequent clinical        conditions for which an antibiotic was prescribed The        morbidity profile of antibiotic use broadly corresponds to        that observed in an Indian study     In another study        from Israel     antibiotics were most commonly used in        respiratory tract infection and UTI followed by sepsis and        intraabdominal infections However the authors had looked        at the entire hospital patient population            Sixtyseven percent of antibiotics were prescribed from        the Essential drug list of Nepal    and  were        prescribed from the WHO Essential drug list     The        Manipal Teaching Hospital is a tertiary care provider in        the Pokhara valley and due to various reasons it is        sometimes necessary to use antibiotics which may not be        covered in the Essential drug lists The Essential drug        lists are mainly for primary health care and their utility        in our study is more limited        The average number of drugs per prescription is an        important index of a prescription audit It is preferable        to keep the number of drugs per prescription as low as        possible to minimize the risk of drug interactions        development of bacterial resistance and hospital costs            We did not look at the coprescribed drugs here but        concentrated only on antibiotics The average number of        antibiotics prescribed during the hospital stay was         which is similar to the observation in an Indian study            The antibiotics most frequently prescribed together        were ampicillin and gentamicin Three or more antibiotics        were prescribed to patients in whom the antibiotics were        changed either after reviewing the culture and sensitivity        results or due to lack of improvement in the clinical        condition Three or more antibiotics were started together        in seriously ill patients        Mean  SD cost of antibiotics prescribed during the        hospital stay was    US The medicines were        purchased by the patients from the hospital pharmacy the        cost price of drugs in the hospital pharmacy being less        than the open market pricethe pharmacy buying medicines        in bulk and passing the discount on to patients The        difference in cost varied from  to  for different drugs        The total cost incurred by the patients during the period        of hospital stay was    US The cost incurred on        hospital and nursing charges other coprescribed drugs and        laboratory and other investigations were included in the        total cost        Fiftyone percent of the patients were prescribed        antibiotics by the parenteral route In a study reported        from South India      of antibiotics were prescribed        by the parenteral route In the Israeli study             of antibiotics were prescribed parenterally Parenteral        antibiotics in the study were prescribed for a median        duration of  days and the interquartile range was  days        The duration of use of parenteral antibiotics may be        decreased and the patients switched over earlier to oral        antibiotics        In Canada a route conversion program on the prescribing        of antimicrobials succeeded in reducing the frequency of        use of parenteral antibiotics     Parenteral        antibiotics are costly and the cost of drugs is a major        factor influencing treatment in a poor country like Nepal        In our hospital patients are usually discharged once the        antibiotics are changed from the parenteral to the oral        route One hundred and eighteen patients were from urban        areas and their houses were accessible by all weather        roads these patients can either return to the hospital or        visit a neighbouring health care facility in case of        problems after being discharged Early switchover to oral        antibiotics may be more difficult for rural patients as        they may have difficulty in accessing medical care in case        of problems The patients are generally unwilling to stay        in the hospital after injectable drugs have been stopped        Economic considerations may be partly responsible for the        desire to continue further treatment at home The patients        can be educated about the need for remaining under        observation in the hospital even after the stoppage of        parenteral drugs thus a programme similar to the one in        the Canadian study could be implemented in our hospital for        costeffective use of parenteral antibiotics        Antibiotics were used for BPI in  patients One        hundred and twelve patient antibiotics were prescribed The        antibiotics were started in BPI after sending specimens for        culture and sensitivity testing In  patients the        empirical use of the antibiotic conformed to the culture        and sensitivity patterns of organisms isolated and hence        the antibiotic was continued In  patients the antibiotic        was changed after reviewing the sensitivity report In         patients though the organism was resistant to the        antibiotic the patient improved clinically and the use of        the antibiotic was continued Delay in receiving the        sensitivity reports was a problem encountered and may have        delayed switching over the patient to the sensitive        antibiotic Steps which could be taken to quicken the        report availability are        a immediate transport and processing of the specimen        after collection        b constant monitoring of the culture systems to detect        growth        c identification of the organism and antibiotic        sensitivity testing AST to be done at  h        d reading of the AST to be taken  h after putting the        antibiotic disc        e immediate dispatch collection and interpretation of        the results        In our hospital due to logistical problems these steps        cannot be followed strictly within the specified time        period hence the results are delayed by about  to         h        In case of blood culture the biphasic culture system is        used in which growth is observed either by detection of        turbidity in the liquid media or by growth in the solid        media However a continuous automated monitoring system        such as BACTALERT could save a substantial amount of time        This system is not being used at present as the sample load        is less and hence it is not cost effective        Antibiotics were used in nonBPI in  of the cases In        our previous study in ICU patients     of the        antibiotics were prescribed without bacteriological        support In an Indian study     of prescriptions were        therapeutic of which  were therapeutic prescriptions        without bacteriological support while  were on a        bacteriological basis        Ampicillin amoxicillin metronidazole ciprofloxacin        and crystalline penicillin were the  most commonly        prescribed antibiotics In many patients treatment was        started with parenteral ampicillin which later changed to        oral amoxicillin once the condition of the patient        improved The DDD beddays of ampicillin was  while        that of amoxicillin was  These figures are higher than        those reported by Mikic et al     In their study the        DDD beddays of aminopenicillins was  ampicillin        was used in  of patients and amoxicillin in  The        antibiotic use in our study was  DDDs beddays We        have no data on the long trends of antibiotic utilization        in our hospital Castro et al    reported that the use        of antibiotics in a Brazilian hospital had increased from         DDDs beddays in  to  DDDs beddays        in  The introduction of a hospital antibiotic policy        helped to reduce antibiotic utilization at a university        hospital from  DDDs beddays to  DDDs        beddays            The use of cephalosporins in our study was less than        that reported in the literature      However direct        comparisons of cephalosporin utilization may not be        appropriate as one of the studies    was carried out        both inside and outside of health care facilities in Norway        while the other study    was carried in a rural        hospital In the Norwegian study cephalosporins        represented  of the use of antibacterials in hospitals        while in the study carried out at a rural hospital        ceftriaxone and cefuroxime together accounted for  of        the total antibiotic days Antibiotic utilization in        different specialties may have been considered in the above        studies     while our study was confined to the        Internal Medicine ward The isolated organisms are becoming        resistant to the commonly used antibiotics and        cephalosporins may have to be prescribed in resistant        cases Cephalosporins are available in the hospital        pharmacy but more data on sensitivity patterns is required        before they can be more frequently prescribed        A total of  organisms were isolated from the        specimens sent for culture and sensitivity testing The        small number of specimens may however limit conclusions        about antibiotic resistance Carrying out the study for a        longer period of time could partly overcome this lacuna         H influenzae E coli K pneumoniae S        aureus and         S pneumoniae were the commonest        organisms isolated and were resistant to cotrimoxazole        chloramphenicol and coamoxiclav in a significant number of        cases This maybe is one of the reasons for the decreased        use of sulfonamides in the Internal Medicine ward Urine        was the second most common specimen sent for culture and        sensitivity testing In a study reported from Trinidad                    E coli was the most frequent isolate        from urine samples and was mostly resistant to        tetracycline trimethoprim and cotrimoxazole The low        number of samples in our study makes it difficult to draw        firm conclusions but an increasing resistance of         E coli and         S aureus to commonly used        antibiotics is observed        Antibiotic resistance is an increasingly encountered        problem in the Internal Medicine ward of our hospital We        are in the process of formulating an antibiotic use policy        and at present only have antibiotic use guidelines for the        department of Internal Medicine We are working to develop        a system to recognize and report trends in antibiotic        resistance within our institution However a system to        rapidly detect and report resistant organisms in individual        patients should be in place to ensure a rapid response by        caregivers Prevention and control of the spread of        antibioticresistant organisms will require increased        adherence to basic infection control policies and        procedures incorporation of antimicrobial resistance        strategies into institutional goals and development of a        plan to deal with patients colonized with resistant        organisms            In a recent study     a vast majority of physicians         believed that widespread and inappropriate use of        antimicrobials was an important cause of resistance        However only  favoured restricting the use of        broadspectrum antibiotics     Also it has been found        that the public health concern of contributing to the        problem of antibiotic resistance does not exert a strong        impact on physician prescribing decisions for community        acquired pneumonia All these factors may have to be taken        into consideration while developing a programme to reduce        the use of antibiotics                    Conclusions        The high rate of prescription of parenteral antibiotics        is a matter of concern Decreasing the prescribing of        parenteral antibiotics and an early switch to oral        antibiotics will significantly reduce the expenditure        incurred An intravenous to oral antibiotic conversion        program can be instituted Quickening the availability of        culture and sensitivity reports will enable the treatment        to have a sound bacteriological basis Antibiotic        resistance is becoming a problem and formulation of a        hospital antibiotic use policy is a matter of urgent        concern An educational programme and an antibiotic order        form may be useful initiatives to reduce antibiotic use        Guidelines for antibiotic use in the community and        restricting the level of health care practitioners who can        prescribe antibiotics are required                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        PRS planned the study collected the data analyzed the        data
