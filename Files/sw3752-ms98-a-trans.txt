            my name is Ferrell   are you ready      where are you calling from   im calling from Miami   Miami im in Utah   Utah well weve got a long distance connection tonight   yeah yes it is definitely   you ready to start i am   sure go ahead     well you know the first thing i thought about whenever uh i dont have children but i um  have a friend whos a school teacher and uh   uhhuh   she has told me some horror stories but uh other than that i was thinking about um the the fact that uh so many uh kids nowadays cant even identify on the map on a globe where they are   uhhuh   and its just astounding to me   yeah   um   i uh have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years and uh im almost convinced theres a lot of it has to do with environment uh she taught in a poor area poor area here in Utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the S A T scores in all the districts of the state   yeah   and uh the district were presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasnt because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from from home   yeah and i think youre right i think an awful lot of it has to do with uh  the kind of emphasis that uh the children get uh at home on education because um uh this friend of mine whos a school teacher was telling me she said uh you know uh that she has uh uh kids that uh are are Indian and Pakistani uh Oriental you know some of them who uh have only been uh in the United States maybe for two generations   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   that uh she said their English is excellent uh their their social social skills are good and uh you know why is it that uh that they can be such model citizens and uh yet     uhhuh   you know other young kids uh uh kids who have you know been uh born and uh bred here in the US uh just dont seem to get it   uhhuh yeah well you know you see these documentaries on uh on Japan for example and the uh rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week   right   uh to get into college is uh no small feat there i mean just to be accepted im sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than than we do   yeah im beginning to wonder if maybe um year round school would not be a bad uh a bad thing   now we have that to a to a degree here thats only because we have a little bit of a of a problem thats i guess peculiar to Utah and we have a  a high population of young young people young children one of the larger uh uh student teacher ratios  you know average class size is probably thirty five or something like that   yeah   and that poses another problem where the you know just the individual attention thats needed sometimes uh is lacking because of the you know the shear numbers of it  and what theyve gone to is a year round program here where uh in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round but you have uh you go like for uh eleven weeks and youre off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these these four periods rather than than the classic summer vacation   yeah   these are just mostly the elementary grades however   yeah well  i dont know i uh i uh i dont certainly dont have the answer to it i know that uh um in Houston uh for example where im i have some friends who uh uh   uhhuh   were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the school that uh uh they want their kids to go to   oh   and uh   regardless of where they live huh   yeah right and uh  the idea of running a a school   oh   sort of like a business in a way such that if enough people are interested in sending their children there it it gets more funding and those schools that are less successful uh uh uh less successful get less money uh   oh thats thats interesting its kind of like uh turning it over to the private sector to some degree   yeah the   and the the supply and demand works  yeah   uhhuh uhhuh   thats an interesting concept   but i dont know if thats the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way   yeah yeah i i  the stories you read about the competency and the literacy of the high school graduates for example   oh its a nightmare   i cant believe it you   well and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and not and not know how to read or write its scary   uhhuh   its scary   yeah their their awareness of the of the uh current events and geography like you were mentioned early   uhhuh
