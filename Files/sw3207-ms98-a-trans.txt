        um i dont i       i am only twenty eight and i havent had much experience with nursing homes i dont i have never visited any  i dont think ive ever even been in one have you   um actually i have um ive ive been in them but um just visiting and um we used to go when were like in in our teenagers wed go on Sundays and visit you know the older people but um i have a elderly grandmother that lives with us   uhhuh   and shes lived with us for like five years so i kind of know how it is to have to decide if you wanna put somebody in a rest home or um  like we i mean weve had those discussions you know about should we put her in or because shes pretty senile and   and it takes it takes a lot of care like twenty four hours a day someone has to be well like theres someone in my my fiances family his grandmother too and theyre   yeah its really   that his her son his uncle whatever you know anyway  he he has he recently retired and so hes the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke and and all the other children       um are working or whatever theyre all my parents age and uh so hes got you know his retirement though is really twenty four hours a day they have a   umhum   day care  two days a week they call it senior citizen day care but she goes to the senior citizen center   oh really   so she he gets a break two days a week but its only for like two or three hours at a time   umhum   and you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was always a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired hes not able to do now   right   but he refuses to consider any other i i dont know yeah and is that how your parents feel or   to put her in a rest home um  well see its more of my grandma that feels that way she says that when her husband died that he said   uhhuh   oh that my uncle had said that he would never have put her in a rest home so its kind of uh i dont know  i dont think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed its and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so   uhhuh   it gets i dont know its its a hard decision but i dont think i would do it to my parents personally   i know at this i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either you know but i i really feel bad for the people i see that not very im not really really experienced but like i said just have that one family and thats really so bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and than he thought it would be but   when he retired   yeah and hes got you know seven brothers and sisters and and uh hes the one because hes the one that doesnt going to work everyday and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone and   yeah and its worked out good for us just because my uncle and my and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months   i cant say much oh well thats great thats a good idea we ought to   so that that works out good   yeah and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever i dont know what theyre gonna do its really not my family its my fiances so i dont i cant say much but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either and i wonder im gonna be the only   umhum   sibling that isnt gonna have children so if my parents do need to live with someone itll probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for   really   you know and im i thats fine with me  my fiancee i both figure thats whats were gonna end up with both of the parents or whoever if it you know what i mean we feel like its our responsibility and i feel like i would never put them in a home     uhhuh   but i wonder how much you know if one of us is gonna have to quit work someday or retire early or something you think about it and   umhum   its really i dont know this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country and   you think i i im not really familiar with how other countries   its really more of a um like a respect issue and that the older the older people in other countries that ive been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people and and they really seen as wise and and in this country nobody really   theyre seen as senile   yeah nobody really pays attention and they oh the old timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions and you know its i im not saying that i do either but  you know its just funny and and we really dont have any they dont have social security and everything really isnt that much for   right umhum   elderly people to live on you know even if theyre in good health its incredible they dont have any they dont get special treatment and maybe they should you know because were all gonna get old someday   right umhum i know   so its a  its kind of depressing topic though how old are you   um im twenty   so it is yeah and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother   yeah its it really is but and she she drives us crazy
