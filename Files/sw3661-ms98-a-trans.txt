        he likes them   well uh the most ive done so far is like uh landscaping you know bushes and shrubs and stuff like that my wife likes to put out flowers and stuff in the flower beds  so im always having to uh turn the flower beds for her every year she puts the flowers and i try to maintain the bushes and trees and stuff   well i do vegetable gardening i rent a rotortiller once a year in January and turn everything and then i start putting stuff in in third week in January and theres stuff pretty much out there until the freeze hits whenever that is   yeah umhum   so i usually start off with onions and garlic and then i put in beets   hm uhhuh   and then uh put out   green beans   red red red beets but you can eat the tops too   oh i see   and then i usually put out um some kind of spinach or some type of green like that and then in April is when the tomatoes and peppers and   umhum   lima beans and black eyed peas and cucumbers and all that other good stuff goes out   hm yeah   uh each year i try something ive never tried before this year im trying a product called well its called spaghetti basically its a squash like product when you cook it   oh yeah ive heard of that   when you yeah ive never tried that before each year i try something new and so this is the one im gonna try see if it works down here   uhhuh   but my wife has rose bushes and she takes care of those   uh i see id like to do a vegetable garden but i dont have the yard size for it im in a zero lot line home but uh were thinking of moving this year the interest rates are getting so low we cant afford not to   well you know the vegetable gardens dont have to be very big this plot i have is twenty two by eight so thats a hundred and seventy six square feet which is not very big and you know if you have crops in the early spring and then crops in the summer and crops in the fall on the same spot you can put a minimum of two different crops like where i have um   umhum   um onions and garlic sometimes ill put other things you know because the onions and garlics will mature in June or July   umhum yeah   excuse me   sure   hm   so how do your tomatoes tomatoes do down here pretty good   oh they do real well i used the type called Better Boy   really   for several years which did well but it has not done well the last couple years so in this past year   umhum     i tried a new crop called Celebrity   hm   and Celebrity gave me pretty much continuous  tomatoes from the um first week in June until the freeze hit in November   umhum   course i think a lot of it was due to the mild weather and the rain but i had tomatoes on the table every day for five months which is   yeah wow thats pretty good   in the in the past i usually got tomatoes for three four weeks and that would be it and then in the fall id you know get a couple more weeks but this is a very unusual year   yeah uh you try fruit like uh strawberries and   well we did have strawberries a few years ago but we dont do them anymore and we had a peach tree and it was too much hassle you have to spray it and uh   um   cover the fruit from the birds and all these other things and it just proved to be more hassle than it was worth   um yeah so vegetables are much easier then   vegetables are pretty easy i think fruit is has some difficulties of course any  some vegetables are far more work than others the hard part is at the very beginning when you have to   hm yeah   set up the garden and get everything but once the plants get going and then its just a matter of keeping the insects off   yeah yeah well that sounds neat you ever do anything like melons   no never done that   no i remember one year at my parents old house we grew a um i guess a pumpkin a squash plant you know turned out to be a pumpkin and uh it it bore pretty good size fruit and then one year we just let one of the squashes grow out it produced a really huge pumpkin were pretty surprised and they just got lucky because they didnt do anything to it no fertilizing or anything just kind of threw the seeds out there but uh looks pretty neat yeah this was down in San Antonio so i dont know   hm thats strange well you mustve gotten lucky well the climates a little better for that down there for hot weather   i think so too i think so too i you know i noticed here in Dallas well maybe it depends on where you live but its like the shrubs dont do as well they dont grow as fast   well thats sometimes you have hot cold winters but we havent had anything so far this year   yeah yeah ive got a tree that i planted that doesnt its okay but it doesnt you know my dad planted a tree two years after i planted mine and his is like three times as big as mine   wow   i dont know what it is i I think it is uh i have a feeling that the soils not theres a lot of rocks in it   must be the soil   because all around me i can see where the erosion is from from the creek beds theres a lot of rock under me i have a feeling im im probably the roots are probably hitting rocks or something   um its hard for them to go once they have no dirt there   yeah i try to keep it going but its not getting very big i think in five years it grew like three or four feet   maybe you need a   i know i
