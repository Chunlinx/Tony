removal of Pamela Andersons breast implants when he wrotethat line but collapse is everywhere in the tabloid world this month fromcelebrity lives to health to marriages and even to body parts            Former sitcom child actress Dana Plato  diedlast weekend of what is being described as an accidental overdose ofprescription drugs one day after declaring on Howard Sterns radio show thatshe had

forgingprescriptions for Valiumsinger Wayne Newton bailed her out of jail on thelatter charge Plato starred on the television show Diffrent Strokes which went off the air  years ago Both the New York Daily News andthe New York Post say the show had a curse as Platos two childcostars Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges have each found little work buttrouble with the law since the show ended            This week theEnquirer continues to assert its Medusainreverse powers In Greekmythology mortals who looked upon Medusas face were turned to stone In thecase of the tabs they put ailing celebrities on the cover in the apparent hopeof predicting a stars imminent demise According to the Enquirer former Tonight show host Johnny Carson is suffering from irreversiblelung disease and depression which are complicating his recovery from a recentheart attack The New York Daily News reports that NBC Carsons formeremployer is thoughtfully filming interviews with the TV legends friends Avideo getwell

height of his beauty and fame While filming a scene onboard a boat for his next movie The Beach  in Thailand it seems thatthe weather turned treacherous The Star reports that DiCaprio and hiscostar abandoned the boat which promptly sank for a rescue ship But therescue ships engines malfunctioned and DiCaprio and the others were told tojump overboard and wait for yet another rescue vessel Perhaps imagining thetabloid coverage of the death by drowning of the star of Titanic waswhat gave Leo the strength to keep his head above water until help arrived            While not in mortaldanger many celebrities seem to be having trouble staying conscious thismonth The Enquirer reports that during a food fight scene on the set ofhis latest movie actor Ben Affleck slipped on mashed potatoes whacked hishead on a table and was knocked senseless Perhaps imagining the tabloidcoverage of such an ignominious demise Affleck recovered without incident Andat his  rd birthday party the Enquirer says Hugh Hefnerwhile dancing with girlfriends Mandy Sandy and Brande collapsed and had tobe carried to his bedroom In this case its safe to assume that the agedplayboy was able to make a quick recovery because he realized that when hemakes his final exit he doesnt want to be carried to bed he wants to bethere already            Both actor Mickey Rourke and singer Michael Jackson weretaken to emergency roomsJackson because he felt unable to breathe andRourke because he was dizzy according to the Globe  The publicationdoes not report if these attacks were precipitated by the men reviewing thestate of

comedy writer andproducer who wrote a comic speech for her to deliver in Washington reports theEnquirer  Soon afterward the two were violating taboo by taking Tae Boclasses together But its the Globe that shows the marriage was doomedIt reprints a letter Agassi paid to have published in the program for theGolden Globe awards when Shields was a nominee He wrote It is wonderful justto watch you when you dont even know that Im looking and to count how manytimes you smile How humiliating for Shields to know that everyone who readthat thought in unison or watch as you scratch your private parts Hemiscalculated even more when he added In all of my excitement of growing oldwith you I will never forget this day Andre Andre Andre no one inHollywood is excited about growing old            Also over is the year marriage of singer Diana Ross toScandinavian shipping magnate Arne Naess who is worth at least  millionaccording to the Globe  You know theres no hope of reconciliation whenyour husband blurts out the news of your impending divorce on Good EveningNorway  And according to the Enquirer  the marriage of actor NicolasCage and actress Patricia Arquette is kaput But how would

asteroidsized breasts I was getting selfconscious aboutit But Pam isnt having people stare at your chest the reason you getimplants like that in the first place The Star reports that Andersonhas deflated from D to C and says the reason for the reduction was that thesilicone sacs which the publication says weighed   pounds each weregiving her back pain The Globe agrees the actress has gone from D toC but reports that the implants weighed a pound each The publication alsosays that Andersons assertion that shes all natural now is suspect Afriend of the actress told the Globe  Pam got new implants calledshapers Doctors had to do something because she had such big implants thatwhen they were removed her breasts would have sagged            The attention caused by Andersons surgery hassupposedly inspired Jenny McCarthy and Demi Moore to consider having theirimplants removed according to the Enquirer and the Star respectively They may want to consult an astrophysicist as well as a plasticsurgeon Such a sudden collapse of so much mammary matter could possibly resultin some kind of Hollywood black hole Not everyone is deflating howeverBesides the widely reported increase in the
