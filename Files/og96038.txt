SERVICES FOOD ANDDRUG ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED REGULATIONS RESTRICTING THE SALE ANDDISTRIBUTION OF CIGARETTES AND SMOKELESS TOBACCO TO PROTECTCHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS RIN AAi Costbenefit analysisAn analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule was conductedby the Food and Drug Administration FDA and published in thenotice of proposed rulemaking on August   and is containedin the preamble to the final rule The analysis in the final rulehas been revised based on comments the FDA received and now alsoconsiders the costs and benefits associated with a rule issued bythe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services AdministrationSAMHSA on January   governing a program of Stateoperatedenforcement activities to restrict the sale or distribution oftobacco products to individuals under the age of  FDA considersthe two rules complementary and cannot separately quantify thebenefits of the two programs and since both rules work collectivelyto reduce youth access to tobacco products the costs attributableto the SAMHSA program are included in the analysisThe analysis based its benefits on achieving the Healthy People a Department program goal of reducing underage tobacco useby onehalf in order to prevent over  early deaths Theanalysis places a monetary value of these health benefits at a percent discount rate at an estimated  to  billion per yearincluding  billion in medical cost savings  million inproductivity gains from reduced morbidity and  to billion per year in willingnesstopay values for avertingpremature fatalities The analysis states that if the  percentreduction in underage tobacco use is not reached and only  percentof the  million adolescents who become new smokers are deterredthe annual benefits would be  to  billion per yearFDA estimates the overall compliance costs of the rule to befrom  million to  million in onetime costs and million to  million in annual operating costs These costs willbe borne by manufacturers  to  million in onetime costs and million in annual costs retail establishments  million inonetime costs and  million in annual costs FDA  to million in enforcement costs per year and State governments to  million per year in administering various SAMHSA enforcementprogramsGAOOGCFDA recognizes that it could not quantify every regulatory costbecause of significant distributional and transitional effects ofthe rule For example lost sales experienced by suppliers ofadvertising were considered distributional impacts because thedollars not spent on advertising are not lost to the economy butwill be spent on other goods and services Also if State andFederal excise taxes remain at the current levels tax revenueswill decrease over time because of decreased salesIn conclusion the analysis finds that while compliance with therule will bring significant health benefits to the population andalso exact longterm revenue losses on the tobacco industry andshortterm costs on various affiliated industry sectors thebenefits of the rule will greatly exceed the compliance costs onthe United States economyii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and The FDA has concluded that the rule will have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities and aninitial regulatory flexibility analysis and final regulatoryflexibility analysis have been prepared and included in the noticeof proposed rulemaking and the final rule notice respectively asrequired by sections  and  The analyses comply with theinformational requirements of the sections including the classes ofsmall entities subject to the rule and alternatives considered toreduce the burden on the small entitiesThe final analysis discusses the FDAs decision not to exemptsmall entities from the rule because an exemption for smallretailers would shift underage sales to those locations lesseningor eliminating the effectiveness and benefits of the accessrestrictions However a total ban on vending machines and directmail order sales have been deleted from the final rule because oftheir impact on small entitiesThe analyses use both quantifiable and general descriptions ofthe effects of the rule on small entities as required by section and numerous small entities participated in the rulemaking asrequired by section  by submitting comments on the proposedregulation following the inclusion in the notice of proposedrulemaking of the initial regulatory flexibility analysis whichdiscussed the economic impact on small entitiesPage  GAOOGCiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  Based on the costbenefit analysis performed by FDA the rulewill impose an unfunded mandate on the private sector of over million annually and therefore the rule is subject to therequirements of the ActAs required by section  FDA considered regulatoryalternatives to the requirements of the rule but determined thatthe provisions of the final rule constituted the mostcosteffective and least burdensome alternative that would meet theobjective of the ruleThe FDA rejected the regulatory alternative of a total ban onall tobacco advertising Also a more prescriptive requirement formanufacturers to monitor the sales and distribution of retailestablishments was not imposed because it would have imposed anadditional cost of  million per year Finally a requirement toinclude package inserts containing educational information incigarette and smokeless tobacco was not chosen because the FDA wasnot certain the benefits would justify the compliance costsSection  requires that State local and tribal governmentshave an opportunity for input and numerous comments were receivedfrom State and local governments health departments substanceabuse programs and law enforcement agencies These comments werereviewed and considered as discussed in the preamble to the finalruleiv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqThe FDA promulgated the rule under the notice and commentprocedures of  USC   and its own agency regulationregarding the promulgation of regulations found at section  ofTitle  of the Code of Federal RegulationsOn August   the proposed rule was published in theFederal Register  Fed Reg  and in the same issue adocument entitled Analysis Regarding The Food And DrugAdministrations Jurisdiction Over NicotineContaining CigarettesAnd Smokeless Tobacco Products was published and comments wererequested  Fed Reg  The comment period following anextension remained open for  days In the months that followedthe publication of the proposed rule and during the comment periodthe FDA made available to the public over  pages ofdocuments which were cited by the agency or considered in thepromulgation of the rulePage  GAOOGCThe FDA received over  comments in response to theproposed rule While the FDA reports many of the comments were formletters there were over  distinct or unique comments filedwith the FDAThe preamble to the final rule discusses many of the commentsreceived and the action taken by the agency in response or why thecomments did not change the agencys positionPaperwork Reduction Act  USC  The proposed rule contained information collections which wouldhave required the manufacturers and retailers of cigarettes andsmokeless tobacco to use established names for cigarettes andsmokeless tobacco products establish and maintain educationalprograms observe certain formats and content requirements forlabeling and advertising and the submission of labels labeling andadvertising to the FDA The FDA solicited comments on the aboveinformation collections including among other information thenecessity of the collection the accuracy of the estimated burdenand ways to enhance the information collectionFollowing the receipt and evaluation of the comments the FDAhas revised certain burden estimates and has deleted therequirement for the submission of labeling to the FDA and theestablishment of educational programsThe information collections in the proposed rule were approvedby the Office of Management and Budget under OMB No Because of the above noted changes to the collections FDA hasresubmitted the matter to OMB for review and approval and prior tothe effective date of the rule FDA will publish a notice in theFederal Register of OMBs action on the provisionsStatutory authorization for the ruleThe FDA has cited sections       and of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act  USC   h i j   and  as authority for the ruleand in particular the device provisions of the Act including therestricted device authority in section e of the Act  USC jeExecutive Order No The rule was determined to be a significant regulatory actionunder Executive Order No  requiring review by the Office ofManagement and Budget Office of Information and Regulatory AffairsOIRA OIRA approved the final rule on August   ascomplying with the requirements of the Order based on theinformation supplied by FDA including a planned regulatory actiondocumentPage  GAOOGCdescribing the reason for the rule and an assessment of thecosts and budgetary impact of the ruleExecutive Order No  FamilyFDA considered whether the rule would have a significant impacton family formation maintenance and general wellbeing as requiredby the Order and found that the rule would not have a negativeimpact in these areas In the preamble to the proposed rule it wasnoted that the rule would help the significant majority of familiesthat seek to discourage their children from using cigarettes andsmokeless tobacco  Fed Reg  FDA responds in the preambleto the final rule to several comments it received and maintains itsconclusion that the rule does not have a negative impactExecutive Order No  FederalismThe rule was reviewed by the FDA under the Order which requiresFederal agencies to examine regulatory actions to determine if theyhave a significant impact on the States on the relationshipbetween the States and the Federal government and on thedistribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government In the preamble to the final rule the FDA addressesthe various issues raised by commenters in this area including thepreemption of State and local laws which are different from or inaddition to the requirements under the final rule whether there isan infringement on the States right to regulate tobacco andbusinesses within the State and protect the health of its citizensthe allocation of a States resources and the rules possibleimpact on the States economies The FDA concludes that thepreemptive effects of the final rule are consistent with theOrderExecutive Order No  Property RightsThe FDA reviewed the rule under the Order and concluded that theaffect of the final rule would not constitute a taking of privateproperty The preamble to the final rule discusses issues raised byvarious commenters in the areas of the use of selfservicedisplays vending machines restrictions on sponsorship of eventsexcept in the corporate name and loss of employment and maintainsits conclusion that there would be no taking under the Order TheFDAs position is that reductions in personal propertys valueeven prohibitions on all economically viable uses and financialexpenditures to comply with a regulatory requirement do notnecessarily establish a taking citing various court decisions forsupportThe FDA did not identify any other statute or executive orderimposing procedural requirements relevant to the rulePage
