Bloomingdales for a digitalversion of the bridal registry They offered to fax me information I told themI dont do faxes anymore Mike and Ellen the tobewedded parties are truedigerati and have the expectation of electronic invitations with embedded linksto Bloomies for example for this bicoastal event in June                                       Do youthink Im expecting too much of Bloomies Their Web site is lame and theydont seem to understand ecommerce in the eworld I do not want to beimpolite but I do want them to understand the lucrativeness of this burgeoningmarket Mike and Ellens wedding helper needs your guidance                                       Weddeddigitally                        DearWed            Ah yes trouble withcybergifts Prudie is sorry for your frustration with Bloomies being behindthe ecommerce curve Would you feel better to know that they sometimes screwup their plain oldfashioned mailorder business A friend of Prudies orderedan expensive lamp as a wedding gift and the embarrassed groom inquired why shehad sent an embroidered footstool bearing the wrong initials            In defense of some highendretailers steering clear of the Web Saks announced they were aborting theirNet effort because the results were next to nil This the store believed wasdue to the fact that catalogs show the merchandise more clearly and thatselecting things is a touching and feeling exercise            The TishBaldridge part of Prudies brain is a little put off by the idea of imbeddedWeb links to stores This makes the invitation seem a little more like aninvoice than usual But by all means send Prudies best to Mike and Ellen            Prudie festively                                             DearPrudie                                                      My problem is one that Imsure affects many more women than youd believe I was widowed when I was and have been on my own for five years My situation is something of a goodnewsbad news thing The couples who were our friends have been wonderful tome They include me in everythingsomething I know is unusual for a singlewoman The problem though is that not one of them has ever fixed me up with aman And its not that they dont know any Im assuming they never think of mein this context because to them I was the other half of a couple with Roband it would somehow be disloyal on their part to introduce me to othermen                                       I donot wish to seem aggressive but my friends are well connected and I dontknow how to tell them that I am ready for introductions Any ideas                                       JoAnne inMinnesota                        Dear Jo            It soundsas if your friends are keeping you in widows weeds longer than is necessaryIdeally you would be able to include a gentleman youve met independently in afunction involving all the old friends thereby making a statement If no onesuitable has crossed your radar mention to some of the womennot thementhat you are ready to meet appropriate escorts and perhaps they know ofsomeone In other words spread the word And the reason to tell the women notthe men is that its been observed that women cannot accept the idea of anyman being on his own So once youve deputized the women in your groupPrudie predicts results            Prudieprovidentially                                             DearPrudie                                                      I feel so hopelesslyclueless Im seeing an older man who works in the same company I do He ispaid at least twice what I am and is well aware of that fact and dips intohis salary only when he runs short of trust fund money Hes obviously made akilling in the latest stock market boom Yet when we go out we splitexpenses                                       Whenthis man and I first started seeing one another I would offer to split thecheck not being of the persuasion that the man should automatically pay Butits been almost a year now and weve grown close if you get my drift Whatsgoing on                                       Wish I Were MakingThis Up                        DearWish            Whats going on is that yourgentleman is close with a buck To louse up a wellknown Latin phrase he isfui generisin this case meaning Whats mine is mine            Unfortunately to bepolitically correct in the beginning you suggested going Dutch Now that youhave become close drift received and your significant other is way betterfixed than you Prudie suggests you have a hearttoheart An opening gambitmight be I can no longer afford our romance Explain that when you starteddating you didnt know it would lead to something serious and wished to becorrect Now however you think it would be appropriate for him to assume theexpenses incurred when you are a twosome            As ofcourse you know money can be the Bermuda Triangle of relationships If thisis a thorn in your side and Prudie believes it is state your case but beprepared to be disappointed If he doesnt see it your way just email him afarewell at wwwcheapskatecom            Prudie fiscally                                             DearPrudie                                                      Is itmoral for the government to refuse to provide sterile needles to groups ofintravenous drug users in order to prevent the spread of AIDS Does the excusethat needle exchange encourages and condones drug use seem reasonable                                       David WorlRochesterNY                        DearDavid            You havepressed one of Prudies buttons with this one Statistics show that needleexchange programs among other benefits are a way of getting people intorehab The government is being both foolish and cowardly afraid of beingattacked by conservatives for doing anything that might be labeled immoralThe real immorality of course is failing to do whatever is possible to lessenillness and disease To imagine that withholding clean needles from addictswill keep them away from drugs is like telling the tides to stay still            Prudie disdainfully
