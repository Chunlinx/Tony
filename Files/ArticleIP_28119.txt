                                 Unproven Pay Parity                           PayCheck                        I was ratherdissatisfied with Jonathan Chaits  regarding the pay gap for servicemenHe states                           The  percent pay gap represents thedifference in the growth of military versus civilian wages sincethat is civilian wages have grown  percent faster This doesnot mean that soldiers earn less than civilians because it does nottake into account the pay differential from  If my wages have increased by percent during the past five years while Bill Gates have increased bynearly  percent this does not mean that I am earning  percent more thanBill Gates since he was making more to begin with                        Does Chait really mean to imply thatservicemen made a lot more money in  than their civilian counterparts Theonly evidence he offers for this position is that military members got a bigraise in  However if memory serves me the  raise was designed toprovide a catch up to bring military pay back to parity with civilian wagesafter a decade of lagging pay increases It seems to me that military andcivilian pay in  should have been comparable If this is true the militarymay have since lost ground because some of the annual raises since  havelagged the inflation rate            He also cites studies from the Congressional BudgetOffice and the RAND Corp that indicate that enlisted service members makemore money than their civilian counterparts I cant speak about the CBO studybut Ive seen the one from RAND and its conclusions are more complicated thanhe suggeststhat junior enlisted servicemen are overpaid compared to theircivilian counterparts senior enlisted are slightly underpaid junior officersmoderately underpaid and senior officers seriously underpaid So does Chaitadvocate pay table reform rather than an acrosstheboard increase in pay            The bottom line is thatafter reading this article Im no smarter than I was before about whetherthere really is a pay gap since no evidence was offered that addressed theactual salaries of either the military or civilian population A little moreresearch would have been helpful here             Geri Peters                        Chesapeake Va                           Fiddling WithHistory                        In  Chatterbox writes the hallmarks ofLaphams style are a magnificent contempt for mankinds folly and an apparentconviction that the United States is reenacting the last days of Rome AndChatterbox cites Laphams mention of the Roman mob familiar with the expensiveclaques traipsing after the magnificence of the Emperor Nero            Nero was emperor until  AD In that year therewere four emperors Nero Otho Galba and Vespasian and the secret of theRoman Empirethat in a time of turmoil a provincial commander with an armycould march on Rome and become emperorwas revealed but Romes decline was along way off The situation stabilized with Vespasian and the second centuryAD is often considered the golden age of the empire Gibbon himself says thatthe time of Marcus Aureliuslate second centurywas the best time to live ofall in history Around  the empire split between east and west The empirein the west finally collapsed in  In the east it lasted until the th century            So if these times inthe United States are like the time of Nero we have by analogy at least more years including another century of greatness and perhaps anothermillennium This is not a criticism of your amusing article on Lapham but ofLaphams apparently poor grasp of actual ancient history             DavidMargolies                        Oakland Calif                           WrongTurns                        I thought it might be worth attempting to correctsome misstatements and mistakes made in Steve Chapmans  Chapman writesThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that after the repeal ofmph speed limits fatalities rose by  percent on interstate highways wherethe limit was raised            Hopefully Chapman is aware that the IIHS is anindustry group whose members directly benefit from the imposition of a nationalspeed limit Further exploration would have turned up studies by the Universityof Georgia if memory serves and American Automobile Association showingeither no increase or decrease in fatalities on roads where the speed limit wasincreased Looking state by state the same lack of a pattern emerges Theresimply is no good data counterintuitive though it may seem to link speedingwith accidents Although deaths per passenger mile did indeed decline when themph limit was imposed they have declined every year since statistics havebeen kept and are continuing to decline in the wake of the revocation of thenational speed limit            Another innocent mistake is comparingspeedrelated deaths to alcoholrelated deaths Chapman writes But speedcomes in a very respectable second killing  Americans annually Thenational database in which this information is kept allows officers at thescene to code multiple reasons for an accident they do indeed tend to citeexcessive speed for conditions as a contributing factor quite frequentlyHowever if you were to pull the number of accidents where speed was the solefactor cited the number declines precipitously Keep in mind again that thedata are not good to begin with this is simply the opinion of an officer whoarrived on the scene after the fact            The radar gun was invented to allow civil engineersto determine  th percentile speed or that speed that  percentof drivers will maintain on a given piece of road In more sensible timesthats how speed limits were set Build the road time traffic on it determinethe speed most people are comfortable driving at and post that as the limit toencourage uniform speeds which unsurprisingly minimizes accidents Anational speed limit by being completely separated from local conditionsactually encourages unsafe behavior as people will vary in their speedsignificantly On many roads driving at or below the limit puts you well belowthe speed of most traffic thereby greatly increasing the chances of anaccident            So no rigid enforcement of a national speed limitwith draconian penalties for violating it will not save thousands of lives Norwould repealing the freedom of the airwaves act the federal legislation thatpermits radar detectors and any other listeningonly devices be a good ideamerely to protect the various municipalities right to collect revenues frommotorists It may not be sexy or simple but setting speed limits on acasebycase basis at sensible speeds would do much more to reduce speeding andaccidents than any of the measures Chapman proposes Since even the Departmentof Transportation estimates that better than  percent of Americans speed itmight make more sense to look at why rather than simply demanding that theyall stop            Or maybe Chapman thinksthe current war on drugs is a good idea too             SimonKennedy                        Chicago                           Schooled in thePast                        While it is always good to have some historicalperspective on modern trends I think David Greenberg misses a couple of subtledistinctions in his piece on the violence of schoolkids in years past see Lets stipulate that highschool males of yesteryear were a rowdyschoolstoning carriagetipping teacherbeating horsewhippingliquorsoaked bunch of devolved maniacs That is after all about the deepestlevel to which Greenbergs analysis descends and having once reached it heturns and angles for the bright sky of the story he wants to tell            The kids in Littleton Colo murdered theirclassmates in cold blood They found a yearold girl weeping under a tableshouted Peekaboo and killed her At close range And they apparently enjoyedit Look at this black kids brain Awesome man is what one was reported tohave exclaimed They stood in front of another girl asked her if she believedin God and shot her in the head when she answered yes They had no goal noend in mind beyond destruction They werent trying to restrict a rival gangenforce a political ideal or overthrow authority They appeared to revel indeath and blood and hate for its own sake alone            So I ask Greenberg Would you be comfortablelacing up the old athletic club breeches rubbing a bit of pine tar on yourtrusty ball bat and heading down to PS  with a few of your friends toteach these ruffians a lesson            If Greenberg cantdetect the differences in these situations then he is part of the problem Itoo read a lot of history but unlike Greenberg I think you have to go back abit farther to find truly analogous behavior The Dark Ages should provefruitful And by the way its misleading to place the sentence occasionallychildren were put to death at the end of a list of the things teachers did tokeep students in line Does Greenberg mean to suggest this was the tool of lastresort He is referring to the fact that some teenaged children wereoccasionally executed for crimes the crime of murder in the period to which herefers or perhaps for stealing hare from the kings wood in earlier timesNot laudable but definitely irrelevant to his argument Just a bit later inthe piece he makes the point himself that teenagers were considered adults inthe time he is examining Or were we executing yearolds back then             Mark Betz                        Parsippany NJ                                             Slate sWhite
