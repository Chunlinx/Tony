          well im talking to you from Dallas what part of the country are you in   oh boy this is gonna be tough im in Plano   well we can uh complain together or well swear we can complain together about the humidity     exactly i guess the weather hasnt been too different between us   no i dont think so i wouldnt think yeah i north far north Dallas  yeah about a half a mile from Plano  so were in the   what what part of Dallas are you from oh north Dallas well jeez well then youve been getting quite a bit of rain also   yeah its very very rainy i know oh   how about that how does it compare to the years past   um i dont know i havent lived here lets see we moved lived out of state in Wisconsin and we just we lived here ten years ago and when we first lived here we lived we were in Garland East Richardson and um doesnt seem like it was quite as humid   uhhuh oh   and i dont know then we went we lived in uh Madison Wisconsin for five years um for my husbands schooling and graduate schooling and it just its a lot cleaner up there but um its a lot colder too so   huh well what brought you guys down to Texas then   uh his job he came back to start work again for a different company so said here heres a here here we are again it just seems a little more humid than it i dont ever remember   how about that thats great   course you know you only remember the good stuff but um i just dont remember the humidity   right well   this much rain and this humidity   definitely im sure the winters are more mild here   uh yeah they are actually though it was a lot rainier here in the winter uh we came back up August its just a lot rainier than i remember it all the through the seasons you know   uhhuh sure   um   it seems that progressively ive been down here five years just over five years now that every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy   yeah and i think its because its just getting more crowded and more polluted i really do think thats part of it   huh   um  in in Wisconsin and Minnesota when they get winters its um the the winters are bad but not what you hear about its just like down here when you hear when people here think its a hundred and six people up north think its a hundred and sixty down here   a hundred and sixty   hundred im making that up you know when its only like ninety five   uhhuh right sure   um its just like up there when you hear its forty below its probably really only five below   right   um and its so dry that its its like going to Arizona well probably what you Arizona used to be like you know its just dry and cool so its not its not what you think it is   uhhuh true   um no thereve been times though when it gets so frigid that you  you cant stand it where did you move here from     Colorado   well there you could talk about that thats thats a strange state for   oh sure i im uh im very familiar my grandparents and all my relatives are from Wisconsin   oh there you go okay   so im uh quite familiar with how it is up there and if you kind of interesting uh the people down here typically dont think it gets above you know fifty degrees   this is very true   and its always snow you know but uh   yeah right well actually the summers up there we thought were the most beautiful time of the year   oh yes   um in terms of Colorado i know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff i dont like um but id used to go on i worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin and i did a lot of business in uh       um Colorado well Denver and thats thats probably one of the stranger things when you see the air inversions   umhum   and then you go into the mountains and its snowy and cold uh it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado   oh sure my parents just live uh thirty miles south of Denver and it can be sunny and and no problem in Denver and theyll be having snow   is that strange     so its pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance   yeah and then things like tornadoes are there tornadoes in Colorado yes or no i dont     uh its getting to be more and more of a possibility   yeah   it used to be no problem just because it was such a a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere but now as they start to clear more things out   the mountains yeah even i mean im originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and i can tell you that um theyve even had in eastern Ohio and then western Pennsylvania theyve even had im going to say mini tornadoes for lack of a better word and and thats just a part of the country that its rolling hillside   umhum   that was unheard of you know twenty years ago   right   um so i dont know whats happening if its you know we are the greenhouse is i dont really know   yeah me neither   it just  you know   but   its definitely not as um i know i associate the pollution with weather in general so i guess one thing we do miss is thats a smaller town and it was it was just it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know   sure sure well its been good talking to you good bye   you too okay byebye
