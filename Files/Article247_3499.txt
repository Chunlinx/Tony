                                 The Bill Gates KoolAid Test                        Dear Kara            Sorry to get such a late start today I find when Im starting out on a newstoryas has been the case the last couple of daysI have a hard time evenreading the newspapers much less absorbing the information contained withinIm too preoccupied too panicked I always feel as though Im starting way toolate and Ill never be able to pull it off and that this will be the storythat finally exposes me for the fraud that I really am My wife thinks this isan utterly absurd way to go through life for which I can offer no defense buta helpless shrug I used to think that I would get over this feeling now Iknow better            Anyway  I did want to pick up on two threads from your message thismorning First on the question of Bill Gates it strikes me as completelyunarguable that his living icon status has been a tremendous asset toMicrosoftor at least it did until the antitrust trial began First hes afounder who is much more a businessman than a technologisthe doesnt like tohear that but its trueso he gets to command the respect that founderscommand within companies while also having the set of skills rarely seen infounders that are required to manage very big companies It helpsa lotthathis employees will follow him over a cliff The classic example was when hewoke up one day and decided that Microsoft needed to devote all its energies tothe Internet The entire company had to shift on a dime and promising projectswhich people had devoted years to were scrapped because they didnt relate tothe Internet At a typical big company there would have been enormousresistance But at Microsoft there wasnt so much as a whisper of complaintEverybody simply got with the program because by God thats what Billwanted Competitors like to say that Microsoft employees take the KoolAidbut they probably all wish they had at least a little of that KoolAidthemselves            During the antitrust trial though you could see the problem with that lackof independent thinking Gates deposition was a true abominationhe waschurlish and evasiveand precisely because he is so clearly the embodiment ofhis company he hurt Microsofts cause a great deal But no one at Microsoftcould admit that obvious truth Instead they blamed it on the Feds for askingbad questions and the press for writing stories that simply said out loudwhat we were seeing with our own eyes And most of the subsequent Microsoftwitnesses brought to the trial the same set of characteristics that were sovividly on display during the Gates deposition defensiveness arrogance anunwillingness to say anything straightforwardly Fairly or not they all lookedas though they had something to hide just as Bill had Its such an insularculture ultimately that Microsoft people have trouble even grasping questionsthat are posed from a nonMicrosoft point of view The great virtue of KenAulettas New Yorker piece on the trial is that it really illustratedthat point wonderfully Ken would constantly ask Gates simple sensiblequestionsand would get an uncomprehending rant from Gates in returnSigh            Speaking of abominations the Waco disclosure certainly ranks as one on somany levels Not long after the event an old Texas friend of mine Dick JReavis went to work on a book about it He was convinced that the governmenthad behaved badlyan attitude I foolish wrote off as part of his generallyantigovernment bias Boy was I ever wrong and was he ever right Over theyears it has become increasingly clear that Waco was a disaster that shouldnever have happened It gives solace to the off the grid crowd Its scarythat the FBI will tell lies for six yearssix yearsbefore someone withfirsthand knowledge is willing to tell the truth I cant stand people who playto those who view the government as one giant secret conspiracy Oliver Stonefor instance But at moments like this one it is hard to argue with them            Oh and one other thing Isnt this just another reminder that Janet Renoranks among the worst attorneys general of all time Sure seems that way tome
