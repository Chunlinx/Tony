             yeah well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year   there we go i think thats true the uh the Bermuda grass is greening up uh in in March it sometimes doesnt really start doing that until the first part of April so   yeah   so i think were a little ahead uh ahead of schedule on that   yeah i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and i noticed all that grass coming up and i thought ooh weve got to start this mowing bit soon   thats true its been a  a fun break but it the break is over   yeah  well um oh i guess another thing ive noticed too here lately is that even though weve had some pretty warm days its been awfully gray you know just   yeah now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny   yeah but it seems like every time at work i look out my window its gray   well yeah but id rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend so   oh i go for that yeah   yeah   in fact im a little worried about this one coming up here we have a long weekend and it sounds like its gonna be a little bit on the cool side   yeah i hadnt heard whether its gonna rain or not   i think theres an eighty percent chance this evening but its supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the restll be without rain   well thats good   but i think the highs are gonna be in the sixties and the lows in the forties thats getting back to a little bit chillier   yeah thats probably a  a little bit under what it is for this time of year i i think i havent seen the weather the news the weather on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy   yeah im not certain either but youre probably right   yeah   well i like it when its sort of a a medium temperature uh maybe seventy five to eighty somewhere in there i i dont like it when its too cool or too warm im much more apt to get things done when its at that sort of in between temperature   yeah thats true um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high   hm   and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it doesnt vary very much   yeah youre probably right   yeah i mean any other time of year thats not the case because it could be very warm or very cold   yes as a matter of fact i heard the weather the other day on TV and i think it was one day this week a year ago   uhhuh   they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasnt just a super bad storm but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the the late spring time   right right yeah  one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year was a twenty six degree lightning storm   oh wow   i you know i was going into the grocery store and a  a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out   hm   and i thought well gee ive ive never known it to lightning at that temperature   yeah that that is pretty unusual and you really take notice of it too uh   thats right it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees   hm   because the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldnt get away   wow yeah i dont dont like that super cold stuff   nope   i just dont move very well when its that cold   yep i im really enjoying this now well this has been interesting   yeah well   not not too challenging to the brain   not not a real in depth topic but  enjoyed talking to you   nope all right Ellen well you have a good day   okay okay goodbye   byebye
