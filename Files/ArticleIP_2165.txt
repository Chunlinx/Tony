                                 SLATE Update            SLATE will not publishnext week In the great tradition of political and cultural journalism theeditors will spend the week lying on the beach perhaps reading the odd scrapof oldfashioned printonpaper and resting up for the election campaign andother ordeals ahead SLATE is proud to be launching this hoary custom of summereditorial sloth into cyberspace However our computers will be on the jobThey neglected to ask for the week off in their union contract And they willhappily serve up the current issue plus a complete inventory of past articlesand features in The Compost while were gone New material will be postedbeginning noon PDT Monday Aug  with a complete new issue by Friday Aug            SLATEs been online forover a month now and in general were pleased with the reaction Claims aboutreadership tend to be even more dubious in the online world than they are inthe world of traditional paper magazines Counting Internet readers is aninexact science lending itself to exaggeration But heres our count ashonest as we can make it Excluding our launch week when the numbers were muchhigher weve been serving up about  pages a day That would be readers a day or  a week reading an average of  pages each onlineOf course it could also be  people a day looking at one page each andturning away in disgust or it could be  of my aunts uncles and cousinsbusily inflating the numbers by clicking up  pages a day            Thesefigures dont include people who are printing out SLATE directly from the coverpage or getting it by email From anecdotal evidence SLATEs specialprintout edition seems to be a popular option but we have no numbers on itMany people tell me theyre downloading the printout file and reading it onscreen but offline We never even thought of that Soon though well beoffering an offline reading edition that retains some of the Websinteractivity and graphics that arent in the printout file Weve recentlyreformatted the printout edition to make it more attractive and reduce thenumber of pages just  for the whole Thursday Aug  issue Weve alsoadded an Adobe Acrobat version along with the Microsoft Word model Try it outif you havent already            Another surprise Monday is the most popular day forreading SLATE Readership declines through the week and is lowest on theweekends We have designed the magazine to be most current and timelyFridaywhen we update The WeekThe Spin for examplewith the thought thatpeople would like to read it over the weekend But maybe thats wrong In anyevent Monday is the day we update the Horse Race campaign pundits analysisand give you instant reviews of the Other Magazines that come out Mondaymorning  Time  Newsweek  The                New Yorker  etc SoMondays not a bad day either Many people we hear from actually do seem toenjoy popping in every couple of days to see whats new which is a moregratifying surprise            Another measure ofreadership though not necessarily of satisfied readership is response Wevebeen getting between  and  email comments from readers every week OurEveryday Economics columnist Steven Landsburg tells us he got  personalemail messages about his first column When I called our Varnish Removercolumnist Robert Shrum to tell him that some readers were complaining abouthaving a selfdescribed Democrat analyzing both parties political commercialsthough I think hes doing a fine neutral job he said the only complainthes gotten himself was from the White House In a couple of weeks well belaunching our bulletin board The Fray where readers from the White House orany other house can bitch and moan to their hearts content though a kind wordor two would also be appreciated But its already clear that we have just thekind of active engaged readership we were hoping for            Wellknow more about who our readers are when free registration begins in two orthree weeks Were planning to tell advertisers that youre all highlyeducated highincome politically engaged and purchasers of vast quantitiesof automobiles designer clothing books records military aircraft andalcoholic beverages Please dont let us down            This first month has been a learning processWarren Buffett Americas secondrichest man after somebody whose name Iveforgotten has written that hes suspicious of anyone who talks of learningfrom his own mistakes The trick Buffett says is to learn from otherpeoples mistakes Still if youre going to make mistakes you might aswell learn from them SLATEs made a few Initially we were incompatible withtoo many browsersincluding early versions of Netscape We think weve solvedthat And if we havent please let us know at slatetechmsncom Were still a bit slow to downloadcompared with some other sitesabout  percent according to our residenttech gurusbut were working on that too Our original idea of a separatecover and contents page united by theme music has not in our view been asuccess and well be reworking that in the weeks ahead Meanwhile many folksseem to be missing the contents page completely thus missing many articles andfeatures You can skip the cover and go directly to the contents page if youwant at httpwwwslatecomTOCCurrentContentsaspor of course you canspare yourself the gibberish and bookmark it            Amajor screwup to be honest has been our email deliveryIn theory it should be great a file delivered straight to your computerthat you can print out or read on screen as the latest SLATE At last countmore than  people had signed up We knew thered be some problems withmany email systems in receiving this rather large file What we werentprepared for was problems in sending it We apologize and hope thats startingto work right for you Last Fridays delivery went pretty wellSLATE                on Paper  our monthly printed edition to be available byUS Mail and at Starbucks also has been pushed back a month But the firstissue will be out by the end of August Call  to subscribe            Our cover feature a coupleweeks ago Electric Chairs about designing a chair for reading an onlinemagazine was one I was uncertain about It surprised me pleasantly bygenerating a large and entertaining response See a sample in last weeks EMail to theEditors For the next week though the staff of SLATE will beemphasizing comfort above all in our choices of where to sit And should thesebe places from where we cant read a computer screen thats OK too            See you Aug  or soonthereafter we hope            Previous
