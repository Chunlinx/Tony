                            Evidence that calorie restriction CR retards aging and extends median and maximal life        span was first described in the s by McCay et al  Since then similar observations        have been made in a variety of species including rodents fish fruit flies worms and        yeast and although they are not yet definitive results from ongoing longevity studies        in monkeys suggest that CR will also extend life span in longerlived species         There are many theories explaining the mechanisms by which CR extends life span An        early hypothesis was that delayed sexual maturation might be a mechanism However it has        since been shown that CR initiated in older animals also increases life span  Reduced        metabolic ratewith consequent reduction in free radical productionwas another early        leading hypothesis to explain the antiaging effects of CR But there are many other        metabolic effects that have been associated with CR including altered insulin sensitivity        and signaling stress resistance altered neuroendocrine function and changes in nutrient        signaling Any or a combination of these biological changes may retard aging However        recent studies seem to favor a highly conserved stress response that evolved early in most        species to increase an organisms chance of surviving adversity such as CR by triggering        concerted physiological responses                     Nutrient Composition of Calorie Restricted Diets        Previous studies in rodents have shown that the effects of CR on extending life span are        dose dependent with a  reduction in calorie intake producing a smaller increment in        life span as compared to a  reduction in food intake  From this work and others the        reduction in calories was recognized to be of paramount importance in the longevity        response and alterations in the nutrient content of diets were considered irrelevant        However a recent study in         PLoS Biology by Mair et al challenges this longheld concept of CR                            From Fruit Flies to Rodents        In the study by Mair et al the authors examined life span in fruit flies         Drosophila melanogaster  fed one of four different diets  a        combination of yeast and sugar control  restricted in yeast only  restricted in        sugar only and  restricted in yeast and sugar The authors observed that in the        restricted sugar group as compared to the controls maximal life span was unchanged and        median life span was increased by only  On the other hand both maximal and median life        spans were increased substantially in the restricted yeast group and in the restricted        yeast and sugar group Figure  Importantly the authors claim that total calorie        contents of the restricted sugar and restricted yeast diets were similar Thus from this        study it can be implied that restricting carbohydrate is less advantageous than restricting        proteinlipid for mediating the effects of dietary restriction DR on life span        It is of concern that the authors did not directly measure the flies total food intake        but only estimated intake by examining their feeding behavior This method may not take        into account possible differences in the rate of food uptake of restricted flies which        could affect the results                  Investigators have undertaken studies of prolonged calorie restriction in humans                Only a handful of studies have investigated the role of altering nutrient composition on        longevity in rodents The results from these studies have been contradictory with some        studies showing no lifespan extension following restriction of fat only  and others        showing increased life span following replacement of caseinprotein for soyprotein         However the concept that it is not just reduced calorie intake that drives the lifespan        extension effect is not new and the timing of food intake has also been proposed to be of        importance For example when rodents are fed every other day improvements in biomarkers        of aging and increased life span are observed even though measured calorie intake and body        weight were not statistically different from adlibitum or pairfed animals  These        responses were dependent on genotype and the age at which the protocol was implemented        Furthermore animals fed every other day had a better response to neurotoxic stressors as        compared to animals maintained on prolonged CR        The mechanisms behind the differences in restricting carbohydrate vs proteinlipid on        lifespan extension were not examined in the Mair et al study  Such mechanisms        obviously imply the existence of molecular systems in cells that sense        macronutrientssystems that may respond not only to nutrient availability but also to the        hormonal response elicited by these dietary nutrients  For example restricting        dietary carbohydrates increases the plasma concentration of Bhydroxybutyrate that is        ketogenesis a shift that may counteract lifespan extension in mammals However rat        models of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases fed a ketogenic diet exhibit increased        resistance to seizures and have increased protection of neurons  Ketogenic diets are        also prescribed to patients with epilepsy and although there have been no randomized        controlled trials large observational studies some prospective suggest that this diet        does have a beneficial effect on seizures         However it is likely that carbohydrate and protein may differentially alter        nutrientsensing pathways such as Sir and mammalian target of rapomyocin mTOR which are        gaining acceptance as mediators of the lifespan extension effects of CR  Sir the        mammalian homolog is SIRT is a nicotinamideadeninedinucleotidedependent histone        deacetylase that interacts with numerous transcription factors to silence gene        transcription Sir is upregulated by CR and is required for lifespan extension effects of        CR in         Caenorhabditis elegans reviewed in  mTOR is a        serinethreonine kinase that is activated by insulin nutrients and growth factors and is        a central regulator of ribosome biogenesis protein synthesis and cell growth Inhibition        of mTOR increases life span in         Drosophila and         C elegans reviewed in                     Are There Implications for Human Life Span        Obviously invertebrate organisms cannot serve as reliable models for human longevity        and the results by Mair et al  should not be extrapolated to mammals in general But if        this result could be replicated in humans then the prospect of DR to increase life span        would be eminently more attractive than overall CR This would mean that a change in food        patterns could have a similar effect to the dramatic reduction of total food intake        However the lifespan extension effects of CR have not been proven in humans and the jury        is still out on whether nutrient composition will even affect life span in nonhuman        primates        In close collaboration with the National Institute on Aging investigators in Baton        Rouge Boston and Saint Louis all in the United States have undertaken studies of        prolonged CR in humans These studies aim to test the feasibility and safety of different        types of calorie restricted diets in nonobese people and to determine the effects of CR on        risk factors for agerelated diseases psychological factors immune function oxidative        stress and molecular pathways identified in lower species  These kinds of studies        will further help identify the mechanisms underpinning the effect of CR or DR on        longevity
