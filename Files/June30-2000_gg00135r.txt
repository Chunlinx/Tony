Results in BriefAll five of the regulatory agencies that we examined were usingsome form of IT to notify the public about opportunities toparticipate in rulemaking and to facilitate the receipt of publiccomments All of these agencies had web sites that conveyedrulemaking information to the public andor maintained somerulemaking records in electronic form and all of them acceptedelectronic comments for at least some of their proposed rulesHowever the specific features and uses of IT differedsignificantly between and sometimes within the agencies Forexample DOT had established an Internet web site that housedregulatory information for every agency within the department andwas searchable in a variety of ways Other agencies either had nosuch information electronically available or the nature of theinformation available varied from one part of the agency toanother Some of the agencies were beginning to use targetedproactive notifications of forthcoming rules and some wereexperimenting with interactive comment processesThe individuals and organizations with whom we spoke did notidentify any potentially beneficial ITbased public participationapplications that had not been adopted by at least one of theregulatory agencies that we examined However some of themindicated that certain IT practices eg proactive notificationsystems portals and gateways to information for particular groupsand interactive participation mechanisms should be more widelyused Several individuals and organizations suggested that agenciesmove to a more consistent organization content and presentationof information to allow for a more common look and feel toagencies ITbased public participation mechanisms inrulemakingAlthough some of the individuals and organizations that wecontacted said that standardization of ITbased public participationinnovations across agencies could lead to more participation in therulemaking process the agency representatives that we contactedgenerally did not believe that crossagency standardization waseither necessary or appropriate They said that each agency neededto develop systems appropriate for their particular circumstancesand that there were no data indicating that the current lack ofstandardization was a problem or that standardization wouldimprove either the quantity or the quality of the participationthat agencies receive during the rulemaking process They also saidthat standardization would require substantial resources and thatthose resources might be better used in other endeavorsAgencies Differed in Their Use of IT to Facilitate PublicParticipation in RulemakingIn order to participate in the rulemaking process the publicmust first be aware that agencies are considering rules that couldaffect their interests Therefore we examined the agencies use ofIT both to inform the public of opportunities to participate inrulemaking and to facilitate the receipt of public comments All ofthe agencies that we examined had IT initiatives in both of theseareas but the size scope and specific elements of thoseinitiatives differed both between and within the agenciesGovernmentwide IT Applications to Inform the Public ofOpportunities to ParticipateFederal regulatory agencies have used both governmentwide andagencyspecific vehicles to notify the public about opportunitiesfor public comment on upcoming rules Some of the traditionalgovernmentwide notification vehicles are now being offered to thepublic in both paper and electronic forms For example the UnifiedAgenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions is publishedin the Federal Register twice each year by the RegulatoryInformation Service Center RISC  and provides uniform reportingof data on regulatory activities under development throughout thefederal government The activities included in the Unified Agendaare in general those expected to have a regulatory action withinthe next  months although agencies may include activities withan even longer time frame The Unified Agenda contains a wealth ofinformationso much in fact that locating information aboutspecific rulemaking actions can prove daunting For example themost recent edition of the Unified Agenda April  describes rulemaking actions under development or recently completed by federal departments and agencies However IT has demonstrablyimproved access to this information Since October  theUnified Agenda has been published electronically and is searchableeither through RISCs web site httpreginfogov or theGovernment Printing Offices GPO Access web site which can beaccessed through httpwwwaccessgpogovShorterterm notice of upcoming rules is provided by the NPRMsthat agencies publish each day in the Federal Register Agenciesalso publish information on scheduled hearings andRISC is part of the General Services Administration and worksclosely with OMB to provide information to the president Congressand the public about federal regulationsGPO Access is funded by the Federal Depository Library Programand has grown out of the Government Printing Office ElectronicInformation Access Enhancement Act of  P L  Itprovides free online access to over  databases including theCode of Federal Regulations the Congressional Record and theCommerce Business Dailyother opportunities for public participation in the FederalRegister Like the Unified Agenda the printed version of theFederal Register is so voluminous as to be daunting Federalagencies publish thousands of proposed rules each year and findinga particular rule on which comments are being solicited can bedifficult This task has been greatly facilitated by making theFederal Register available electronically and searchable throughthe GPO Access web site GPO Access can be used to search theFederal Register back to  with particular search parameterseg proposed rules issued during December  containing thephrase air quality standardsUsing Agency Web Sites to Identify Proposed RulesAll of the federal regulatory agencies that we examined alsoused their own web sites to disseminate information about theirrulemaking plans and activities However the agencies web sitesdiffered widely in the content and organization of rulemakinginformation the array of tools they offer to facilitate use andthe extent to which they support customized dissemination ofinformation to the public These differences are apparent from thefirst page in the agencies web sitesreferred to as the agencieshome pages Some of the agencies home pages feature direct linksto their rules and regulations For example EPAs home pagehttpwwwepagov has a link called Legislation Regulations which leads to another link entitled Regulations andProposed Rules Similarly DOTs home page httpwwwdotgovincludes a link to Dockets Rules  References and DOLshome page httpwwwdolgov contains a link entitled Laws Regs In contrast neither USDAs httpwwwusdagov nor HHShttpwwwhhsgov home pages had visible information aboutgeneral rulemaking activities in the departmentsThe regulatory links on the agencies home pages did not alwaysdirectly identify rules available for commentEPAs Regulations and Proposed Rules link on its homepage allowed the user to transfer to the electronic FederalRegister on the GPO Access web site The user was then required toexit EPAs site and use the GPO sites search tools to identify EPAproposed rules among those of every other federal agency Althoughthe Regulations and Proposed Rules link also permitted the userto identify Environmental Documents in the Federal Register thesearch tools identified any document related to a date or keywordnot just proposed rulesDOTs Dockets Rules  References link on its homepage takes the user to a second page with other links includingTransportation Legislation and Regulation DOT Legislative andRulemaking Documents and DOT Regulations Orders Policies andRegulation However none of these links provided a listing of DOTproposed rules available for comment Like the EPA site the DOTRegulations Orders Policies and Regulations link directs theviewer to the GPO Access web siteDOLs Laws and Regs link on its home page ultimatelyallows the user to identify proposed rules within each of thedepartments various agencies and offices and provides a hypertextlink that allows the user to view a copy of the proposed rulesHowever some of the rulesThe  Federal Register database is also available through GPOAccess Although it can be searched by keyword it contains nofields or section identifiers to facilitate searchesPage  GAOGGDR Federal Rulemakingthat were listed had been published more than a year previouslyand were no longer available for commentSome of the smaller organizational units within thesedepartments and agencies provided a listing of proposed rulesavailable for comment For example USDAs Animal and Plant HealthInspection Services APHIS web page contained a Regulationslink that provides a listing of recently published rules alongwith text or Adobe Portable Document Format PDF files allowingviewers to read the rules on line HHSs Administration forChildren and Families ACF had a web page on ACF RegulationsCurrently Open for Comment However it was not immediatelyapparent how to locate that page from the HHS home page the userhad to click on HHS Agencies and at the ACF web page use adropdown menu entitled Select a Topic within which theRegulations Currently Open for Comment page is located Other HHSagencies eg the Administration on Aging and the Agency forToxic Substances and Disease Registry did not list rules that wereavailable for comment Similarly EPAs Office of Air and Radiationprovided a listing of proposed rules available for public commentAgain however locating that information from EPAs home page wasnot easy or immediately apparent One route required the user toaccess the Information Sources Dockets and Air and RadiationDocket and Information Center web pages before arriving at a linkto proposed rules available for comment Similar listings ofrecently proposed rules available for comment were not availableusing this procedure for other EPA offices eg Water and SolidWaste and Emergency Response and programs eg UndergroundStorage TanksFeaturing Rules of InterestSome of the agencies featured links on their home pagesnotifying the public about particular regulatory issues ofwidespread public interest For example the home page of both DOLand the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA withinDOL pointed to a separate web site for OSHAs November proposed rule on ergonomics which pulled together in one place allof the electronic information related to this rulemaking eg therule its economic analysis and hearings transcripts As will bediscussed in more detail later the USDA home page identified aseparate web site for the departments Agricultural and MarketingServices AMS proposed rule establishing standards fororganically produced food That site provided a wealth ofinformation about the proposed rule including the text of therule the agencys regulatory impact assessment and how to submitcomments and search the comments that have already beensubmittedPortals and GatewaysSome of the agencies had also developed portals or gatewaysproviding customized information for particular target audiencesHHS supports a number of these gateways and has a Gateways buttonon its home page identifying them which includes both HHSsponsoredsites eg Organ Donation and YouthInfo and other siteseg US State However EPAs Office of Prevention Pesticides and ToxicSubstances home page did have a Laws  Regulations link thatcontains a link to a list of proposed rules available forcommentPage  GAOGGDR Federal RulemakingLocal Gateway The state and local gateway was designed togive state and local government officials and employees easy accessto federal information and includes a link to a LawsRegulationspage that organizes the information by topic egFamiliesChildren or by related links eg FederalLawsRegsPresidential Documents where the user can link to theGPO Access site One such related link entitled ElectronicRulemaking identified several electronic rulemaking initiativesacross the federal government eg the DOT docket managementsystem discussed later and provided links to these initiativesEPA had a link on its home page for particular audience groups Onesuch link was a Small Business Gateway which organizesregulatory information of special interest to small businessesThis gateway guides small businesses to a variety of environmentalinformation sources and provides links to related resourcesoutside EPA such as the Small Business Administrations BusinessAdvisor The EPA Small Business Gateway also provides a link toenvironmental regulations and laws including new regulationsproposed rules important notices and the regulatory agenda offuture regulations However this is a link to electronicdocuments available in the Federal Register through the GPO Accessweb site not EPA specific proposed rules and the viewer is thenrequired to use that sites search tools to identify particularproposed rulesProactive Notification SystemsAll of the governmentwide and agencyspecific resources discussedthus far are passive information systems requiring users to takethe initiative and find out about upcoming and recently proposedrules Some agencies are beginning to use more proactive mechanismsfor alerting the interested public about impending regulatoryactions and opportunities for participation For example HHScreated a web site for the administrative simplification provisionsof the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of that provided information on several related proposed rules Thesite permitted the interested public to subscribe to a list serverthat would notify subscribers by email when NPRMs and final rulesare published or posted Similarly the APHIS web page on recentlypublished rules and regulations allowed users to enter keywords andreceive email when certain key words appear on the pagesUsing IT to Facilitate the Receipt of Public CommentsAll of the regulatory agencies that we examined explicitlypermitted the public to submit electronic comments on some but notall of their recent proposed rules By creating electronicdockets some agencies were expanding the options for public reviewand comment not only on proposed rules but also on regulatoryanalyses and the variety of other materials that make up the publicrecord for the rulemaking Agencies were also beginning to offerthe public more interactive options for participating inrulemaking However there were significant differences in how theagencies had implemented these capabilitiesFiling Comments ElectronicallyNPRMs that are published in the Federal Register havetraditionally instructed interested parties to submit writtencomments on a proposed rule to the appropriate rulemaking docketand have provided a mailing address where such comments can befiled Legislative and administrative initiatives have encouragedand in some cases required agencies to allow the public to provideinformation to them electronically For example the GovernmentPaperwork Elimination Act requires OMB to ensure that federalagencies when practicable allow individuals and other entitiesthe option to submit information to the agency electronically andmaintain records electronically by October  For the five regulatory agencies on which we focused in thisreview we examined the  proposed rules that they published inthe Federal Register during calendar year  to determine theextent to which they explicitly noted that public comments could besubmitted electronically or by facsimile The results presentedin figure  indicate that the agencies varied substantially inthose dimensions EPA and DOL explicitly permitted electroniccomments in more than half of the rules they proposed during while HHS allowed electronic comments in less than  percent ofits proposed rules The agencies also varied in the extent to whichthey explicitly permitted comments via facsimile with EPA notcalling for facsimile comments in any of its proposed rules duringWe excluded from this review proposed rules that were routine oradministrative in nature eg within DOT US Coast Guard rulesestablishing bridgeopening schedules A DOT official said that theDepartment permits the public to submit comments electronically onall of its proposed rulesPage  GAOGGDR Federal RulemakingFigure  Agencies Varied in Percentage of Proprosed RulesPublished During Calendar Year  Explicitly PermittingElectronic or Facsimile CommentsNote Comments were considered electronic when the ruleexplicitly provided for comments to be submitted through theInternet by email or on a computer disk In  of the  DOTrules that did not explicitly provide for electronic comments DOTreferred the reader to its docket management system for moreinformation about the rule In that system users could fileelectronic commentsSource Federal Register via GPO AccessIn some cases the agencies did not allow standaloneelectronic or facsimile comments For example in one EPA rule andfour DOL rules any electronic comments that were submitted had tobe accompanied by paper comments as well In other casesattachments or additional materials such as studies or journalarticles could not be submitted electronically commenters had tosubmit those materials separately in duplicate to the appropriatedocket office In  of the  DOL rules allowing participation byfacsimile commenters had to submit original written comments aswellEPA said that any public comments submitted electronically forthe agencys Superfund Docket must also be submitted as a papercopyPage  GAOGGDR Federal RulemakingWe accessed the Federal Register notices for each of these proposed rules electronically through the GPO Access web siteAlthough many of the NPRMs provided an email address to whichcomments could be filed the current system for electronic FederalRegister notices does not permit the user to provide a hypertextlink to a site where comments could be immediately filed Anofficial at the Office of the Federal Register told us that theGovernment Printing Office was experimenting with upgrading itspublishing system to permit the use of hypertext links inelectronic rules He also noted that any such upgrade would be alarge and expensive effort and that it was unclear when if everhypertext links could be added to the Federal Register Some of theagencies web sites currently provide for such hypertext links butnot for comments on rules For example a button is provided atthe end of each EPA press release that immediately permits theinterested public to file a comment on the announcement Howevernone of the EPA rules that we could access through the agencys website had this feature Some of the agencies rules with their owndedicated web sites provided separate links to both the rules andelectronic comment procedures eg the AMS organic standards rulesite within USDAs siteProviding Access to Regulatory Supporting MaterialsRegulatory agencies are required to prepare supporting materialsfor many of their proposed and final rules including economicanalyses ie the alternatives considered and the costs andbenefits of the alternative selected and descriptions of how theagencies have complied with various rulemaking requirements egthe Regulatory Flexibility Act the Paperwork Reduction Act andExecutive Order  These materials as well as the commentsfiled by the public in response to an NPRM have traditionally beenhoused in agencies rulemaking dockets Access to these materialscan permit public comments filed on rules to be more informed andtargeted to particular issuesSome of the agencies that we reviewed had begun to makesupporting materials and public comments electronically availableto the public DOT had the most extensive docket systemanelectronic imagebased database covering every agency and everyrulemaking action within the department The database containedover  pages of regulatory and adjudicatory informationstored online for research and retrieval via the Internet Theinformation in the docket was searchable by keyword docketidentification number or in other ways For example entering theword airbag in the keyword search box yielded a listing of rulemaking documents including agency reports hearing summariesand comments filed by other interested parties Each of thesedocuments could then be obtained from the DOT docket managementsystem DOT officials told us that the electronic docket has becomethe official rulemaking record for the department enabling DOT tosave over a million dollars each year in administrative costs andfacilitating the rulemaking process in other ways eg permittingagency professionals to review comments at their desks or athomeThe closest to this type of electronic commenting system that wefound was in the Federal Aviation Administration at DOT There auser could read a copy of a proposed rule in Microsoft Word clickon a link for DOTs docket management system and then access thatsystems electronic commenting process However the link did nottransfer the user to a comment box particular to the rule atissueOther agencies either had no such electronic dockets or theirsystems were not as comprehensive or sophisticated as DOTs systemNeither DOL nor OSHA systematically provided regulatory backgroundinformation to the public through their web sites To view mostOSHA rulemaking materials in the official record even if they weresubmitted electronically interested individuals must go to thedocket office in OSHA headquarters and examine the paper files Theinformation electronically available in the agencies rulemakingdockets sometimes varied within the agencies For example the website for EPAs pesticides docket contained risk assessments formany of  organophosphate pesticides The page for just one ofthese pesticides contained hundreds of pages of information aboutthe rule eg health effects assessment environmental fate andeffects assessment EPA correspondence and registrant commentsOn the other hand EPAs Office of Water docket site contained anarrative description of the docket an email address and otherwritten descriptions no electronic rulemaking materials wereavailable EPA officials said the agency recognized that thisvarying level of service was being provided to many of the samecustomers and therefore was in the process of improving thequality and consistency of their electronic docketsAs previously noted agencies sometimes provided electronicaccess to docket information for particular rules For example theweb page for OSHAs proposed ergonomics rule provides fulltranscripts of its public hearings and copies of both its healtheffects and economic analyses for the rule including the expectedeffects on small businesses and other small entities In somecases though this information can be difficult to locate Forexample EPAs web site provided detailed information on its proposed rules on lead and lead compounds and other persistentbioaccumulative toxins However to obtain this information fromEPAs home page a user must maneuver through a series of pageseg Programs a Toxics  Chemicals sublink and ToxicRelease Inventory before arriving at a page featuring links tothe rules and related documentsViewingResponding to Comments of OthersSeveral of the agencies that we examined were using IT to permitthe public to view the comments the agencies had received onproposed and final rules However the extent to which thesecomments were electronically available and the role that thisaccess played in the rulemaking process varied substantially Ineach of these dimensions DOTs docket management system appearedto allow substantial public access and utilityIn some cases comments were available to the public onlyif those comments had been filed electronically However in DOTsdocument management system comments received on paper are scannedinto the system thereby permitting the public to view all of thecomments submitted by others regardless of the medium that wasusedIn some cases the public could view comments only forrules issued by certain agencies or offices or for certain ruleswithin certain agencies or offices However public comments wereaccessible through the DOTs document management system forvirtually all rules issued in the departmentIn at least one case the public could access thecomments filed only after the comment period had closed Howeverin other cases the comments were available while the comment periodwas open thereby allowing the public to respond to the commentsfiled by others For example DOTs docket management systemmaintained all materials submitted during therulemaking in the official electronic record As a result theonline user could review all comments on a rulemaking and file aresponding comment while the comment period was still openOther agencies made comments available electronically forcertain rules or groups of rules For example EPA made an index ofpublic comments and the text of the comments electronicallyavailable for selected regulatory documents as part of a pilotprogram Comments filed electronically in relation to the HHSadministrative simplification initiative were stored automaticallyin a database and the comments were then publicly available viathe initiatives web site Users could search for comments eitheroverall for particular rules or within particular sections of therules USDAs APHIS had experimented with several approaches toaccepting and posting electronic comments on about  differentproposed rules in recent years In one of these approaches userswere asked to answer specific questions identified as areas whereAPHIS most needed comments the answers to the questions wereentered into a database with a web interface and commenters wereallowed to review all the electronic comments posted and to postother comments to the site At the time of our review APHISofficials were attempting to identify the circumstances in whichelectronic comment approaches work best For example they saidthat electronic comment processes for controversial rules on whicha large number of comments are filed may ultimately yield littlemore than a count of supporters and opponents However they alsosaid that electronic comments appeared particularly helpful on lesscontroversial rules with technical elements and on which commenterinteraction was possiblein essence a realtime informal peerreviewUse of IT in Other Forms of Interactive ParticipationAgencies have also used IT to facilitate other forms of publicparticipation in the rulemaking process For example the SmallBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act SBREFA requires thatEPA and OSHA convene a special review panel before issuing aproposed rule that the agency believes will have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities Thepanels are to collect advice and recommendations fromrepresentatives of affected small entities as part of theirdeliberative process An EPA official told us that the agency isusing email as a way to facilitate the delivery of documents to thesmall entity representatives and to receive their comments He alsosaid that EPA had created web sites for several rules that wereused in conjunction with SBREFA panels to pull together informationthat commenters neededThe related literature indicates that some other agencies havebegun to experiment with online dialogs or interactions amongparticipants during the rulemaking process For example as a partof its rulemaking to develop rates that would finance Internetconnections in schools and libraries the Federal CommunicationsCommission sponsored moderated online policy dialogues foreducators and librarians that according to an unpublished reportenabled over  participants from across the nation to learn aboutthe proposed rule share their views with each other and offercomments to the Federal Communications Commission A DOT officialalso indicated that the Departments Research and Special ProgramsAdministration had used a chat room arrangement during some ofthe agencys rulemaking comment periodsMultidimensional Electronic RulemakingSome of the agencies electronic rulemaking systems containedseveral of the innovative dimensions previously discussed As notedpreviously DOTs docket management system permits comments to besubmitted electronically or on paper allows the public to commenton other users comments and permits access to a wide range ofregulatory supporting materials Other agencies had these and insome cases other innovative features However unlike the DOTsystem that is applicable to all of the Departments rules theother agencies multidimensional systems focused on just a fewrules or even a single ruleFor example AMS within USDA has been conducting an electronicrulemaking for nearly  years that encompasses a number ofinnovative design elements The proposed rule was published inDecember  and is intended to establish standards fororganically produced food The program manager for the NationalOrganic Program said that AMS knew that the rule would becontroversial so AMS decided to take advantage of ITs potentialto facilitate the comment process allowing comments to be providedvia mail fax and email Comments were posted for public view andresponse in the agencys web site along with transcripts ofnational public meetings AMS received more than  commentson the rule which were assigned key words to facilitate subsequentanalysis As a result of the comments received AMS changed theproposed rule and it was republished for comment in March  AMSsaid in the proposal that it was the agencys intention to have allcomments regardless of media available for viewing on theprograms home page or at the agencys docket room As previouslynoted USDA maintains a link to this rule on its home page and theorganic standards site contains the text of the proposed rule itsregulatory impact statement and instructions on how to submitcomments and search the comments that had already been submittedThe AMS system also allows users to search the full text of thepublic comments identifies form letter comments and ex partecommunications and provides a list of related government websitesfeatures that are currently not available in the DOT docketmanagement system Although currently limited to this one rule theprogram manager said that AMS plans to use these electronicrulemaking features in other potentially controversialrulemakingsAccording to the AMS program manager the interactive commentprocess changed the dynamic of rulemaking participationPreviously he said commenters typically waited until the lastminute to file comments so that no one could see their views untilafter the comment period was over In the organic standards rulehowever people submitted comments early in the process to have thegreatest influence on the evolving discussion The Under Secretaryof Agriculture for Marketing and Regulatory Programs said thatfullscale Internet access had dramatically increased publicawareness and participation and had saved taxpayers and USDA morethan  in administrative costs associated with therulemakingAccording to AMS form letter comments are separately identifiedbecause they share the same themes and are received by theDepartment in large volumes AMS said an ex parte communication isan oral or written private communication from someone outside ofthe United States Department of Agriculture to a Departmentofficial who is involved in decisionmaking on a pending rulemakingproceeding The ex parte communication is received through channelsnot prescribed by the Department and it concerns the merits ofthat proceedingSeveral Observers Suggested Greater Diffusion of IT Innovationsand ConsistencyThe individuals and organizations that we contacted for thisportion of the review included academicians interest grouprepresentatives and agency officials and staff who wereknowledgeable about electronic government and rulemaking issuesAlthough not inclusive of all such individuals and organizationsthose we contacted did not identify any entirely new categories ofpotentially beneficial ITbased public participation applicationsthat had not been adopted by at least one of the regulatoryagencies that we examined However they noted that the currentuses of IT in rulemaking are often pilot projects of limited scopeand suggested more widespread adoption of some of those innovationsby federal agencies or by the federal government as a whole Theexamples that they cited included the followingOne organization representing small businesses indicatedthat it would be helpful if there was a single portal orelectronic clearinghouse to which small businesses could turn toobtain information about rulemaking activities throughout thefederal government ie similar to EPAs small business portalMore generally one commenter said there should be a singleregulatory portal for all federal rulemaking activityOther commenters suggested greater use of proactive andcustomized regulatory notification systems For example the Stateof Washington has established a list server centrally managed bythe states Division of Information Services which can be used byall state agencies to selectively notify citizens of opportunitiesto participate in government decisionmaking including rulemakingCitizens are able to register to be placed on the listserver forparticular topicsOther commenters suggested greater use of interactiveparticipation mechanisms including online dialogs and meetingsand the use of video For example the State of Washingtoncurrently uses a statewide video network for meetings andcollaboration with videos available over the Internet The Stateof Hawaii is also using networked cameras to conduct legislativehearings through which geographically dispersed citizens canparticipate Although it was not clear whether these video networkshad been used in a regulatory context in these states thecommenters suggested that they could be used to facilitateparticipation in rulemakingSome of the commenters also said that federal agenciesshould more commonly provide access to the economic analyses andother underlying rulemaking information that frequently resides inagencies dockets One commenter suggested that a centralgovernmentwide site be established linking together the informationavailable in individual agencies sites thereby enabling thepublic to drill down into individual agencies as well as obtainsimilar information across agenciesThis observer also said that the fully electronicrulemaking at AMS on organic standards should be replicated inother parts of USDA However he also noted that parts of theelectronic system for the organic standards rule were developed bya contractor using proprietary software and because USDA does notown the application even AMS cannot use it for otherrulemakingsSeveral of the individuals and organizations that we contactedalso suggested that agencies move to a more consistentorganization content and presentation of information to allow fora more common look and feel to agencies ITbased publicparticipation mechanisms in rulemakingOne representative of state governments said thatcoordination or standardization across the agencies in a state isalmost mandatory He said that many states are establishing statechief information officers who are generally responsible forcreating an interoperable infrastructure and common data standardsfor all agencies within the stateSeveral of the federal agency representatives alsoindicated that a common structure or approach for publicparticipation in rulemaking made sense For example one agencyrepresentative said that the use of commonly accepted models forsuch administrative tasks as receiving and logging correspondenceand storing documents could save money and facilitate access Hespecifically cited the DOT docket management system as the type ofmodel that could have broader applicabilitySimilarly a public interest group representative saidthat it would be very helpful to have a regulatory taxonomy orthesaurus relating similar terms which could be used to improvethe quality of searches in different agencies search engines Moregenerally another public interest group representative said that acommon look and feel for regulatory information within federalagencies could make it much easier for the public to locate readand digest relevant information However he cautioned thatagencies have important differences which may suggest that aonesizefitsall approach would not be desirableAgencies Generally Questioned Need for Standardized Uses of ITto Facilitate Rulemaking ParticipationSeveral of the individuals and organizations that we contactedduring this review indicated that standardizing innovative uses ofIT to facilitate public participation in rulemaking could haveadvantages when compared with the current fragmented system Forexample some of them generally indicated that standardizationcould make the current system more accessible to the publicthereby leading to more participation in the rulemaking processOther observers simply indicated that greater standardization madesense Representatives from the agencies included in our reviewalso indicated a few areas in which standardization or at leastmore coordination among agencies in this area could be helpfulFirst they said that standardization is probably a good approachfor resolving legal issues that each agency will have ultimately toface such as the use of copyrighted material and censorship ofcomments received by the public that might be accessible to minorsThey also said that coordination could facilitate informationsharing among the agencies thereby speeding the diffusion ofinnovations that are appropriate and useful within the agenciesparticular context keeping each agency from having to reinventthe wheel Currently they said there is no structured way foragencies to learn about best practices in other agencies Forexample one agency representative told us that she was unawareuntil recently of the DOT docket management systemOverall though the agency representatives questioned the needfor a standardized approach to using IT to facilitate publicparticipation in rulemaking They said that each agency and eachrulemaking is somewhat different Therefore they said theagencies need to be able to design their public participationprocedures to fit the particular circumstances appropriate for eachrulemaking within the parameters of the APA and other applicablestatutes They said that the current system reflects thatdiversity with agencies developing new participation processes andinformation management systems as needed for their individualprograms and communities For example one agency representativesaid that DOTs docket management system could not simply bereplicated at HHS or USDA because of differences in the degree ofmanagement centralization and independence afforded thedepartments constituent agencies Standardization they saidcould decrease the agencies ability to tailor regulatoryapproaches and inhibit further agency innovation by freezing intoplace the particular practices that have been developed so farThey also said that the current flexible arrangement permits agencyofficials to ensure that the use of IT in rulemaking is carried outwithin the agencys overall IT strategic planning effortsThe agency representatives also said that they were not aware ofany data suggesting that the lack of a standardized approach toregulatory participation was a problem to either the public ingeneral or to the regulated entities that are most likely toparticipate in rulemaking Therefore they said determiningwhether there is a problem by gathering information from the publicthrough surveys or other means might be a good first step beforeproceeding to a standardization solution Several of the agencyrepresentatives also questioned whether moving toward a standardelectronic system would enhance public participation either interms of the number of comments submitted or the quality of thosecomments or would improve the quality of the rule underconsiderationThe agency representatives said that standardization of ITbasedpublic participation vehicles would require scarce agencyresources and that any resources provided to the agencies toimprove their IT systems might be better spent in areas other thanpublic participation in rulemaking eg using IT to facilitateregulatory compliance or some nonregulatory area They did notbelieve that every agency should be required to have aregulations link on its home page noting that many differentorganizational units and interests are vying for space on agencieshome pages They also saw no need for agencies to always provide anemail address or web site to which electronic comments on proposedrules could be addressed Doing so for all rules they said couldoverwhelm the agencies systems may be unnecessary for somerelatively uncontroversial rules and may be a less effective useof the agencys resources than more traditional methods egplacing notices in trade publications or setting up a callcenter They also said that once established agencies wouldhave to be concerned about ongoing maintenance of some of thesestandardized systems to make sure that the information therein istimely accurate and completeThe agency representatives also made a number of other pointsthat suggested that standardization of participation processes wasnot needed or could be undesirable Several of the agency representatives indicated that standardelectronic approaches to learning about participation opportunitiesalready existsthe electronic Unified Agenda andOne of the agency representatives indicated that the systemoverload problem could be solved by developing informationretrieval systems ahead of time that would accommodate largetraffic volumes For example he said his agency had developed aformat into which electronic comments could be filed which greatlyfacilitated the subsequent analysis of the commentsPage  GAOGGDR Federal RulemakingFederal Register on the GPO Access web site They said thatanyone could use that site to find out about any upcoming andrecently proposed rulesOne of the representatives indicated that an ITbasedsolution to improving public participation in rulemaking couldunderscore the digital divide that currently exists in thecountry between those members of the public that currently haveregular access to a computer and those that do notOne of the representatives said that differences inagencies current hardware and software systems could make itdifficult to adopt standards and that some agencies currentsystems may not allow them to receive and archive nontextualmaterials such as graphs compact discs or physical items that arepart of many rulemaking records Another representative said thatIT is changing so rapidly that establishing a standardizedelectronic approach to public participation may have some realdisadvantages later on locking agencies into outmodedtechnologiesOther individuals and organizations that we contacted includinga public interest group a business group and an academician alsocited concerns about a onesizefitsall approach being applied toagencies with vastly different missions Also a small businessrepresentative told us that although she believed that there is aneed for more coordination and cooperation across federal agenciessmall businesses are generally skeptical about the benefits ofstandardization because their interests may be neglectedConclusionsParticipation in the rulemaking process requires  the publicto be aware of opportunities to participate and  systems thatwill allow agencies to receive comments in an efficient andeffective manner Agencies can use IT to inform the public aboutparticipation opportunities either through passive systems thatrequire users to take the initiative to discover rules availablefor comment or proactive systems that alert interested individualsor organizations about impending regulatory actions Passivesystems include both governmentwide web sites that allow users tofind out about proposed rules in any agency eg GPO Access andweb sites for particular agencies or offices that have identifiedrules available for comment eg USDAAPHIS HHSACF or EPAsOffice of Air and Radiation However none of the five departmentsand agencies that we contacted had links on their home pages thatidentified all rules available for comment within their entireorganizations Proactive systems permit the interested public to benotified by email when proposed rules are published eg the HHSweb site for its administrative simplification initiative butwere much less common than passive systemsOne relatively simple way for agencies to facilitate the receiptof public comments is to provide an email address at the end ofproposed rules to which the public could respond electronicallyAgencies could also state that comments could be provided byfacsimile However the agencies that we contacted differedsubstantially in the extent to which they explicitly provided forthese modes of comment during calendar year  and none of theagencies permitted either mode of communication for all of theirproposed rules Some of the rules with their own dedicated websites eg the DOLOSHA ergonomics rule and the USDAAMS organicstandards rule provided links to both the rules and electroniccomment proceduresOne way to facilitate the receipt of informed public comments isto permit electronic access to regulatory supporting materialssuch as economic analyses and the comments of others DOT had themost developed electronic docket system of the agencies that wecontacted covering every rulemaking action in the department andincluding all public comments received regardless of medium DOTofficials said the system had saved the department more than amillion dollars each year in administrative costs and facilitatedthe rulemaking process in other ways Some agencies have begun touse IT to facilitate interactive public comments permitting usersto comment on the comments filed by others eg at DOT and in theUSDAAMS organic standards site or to participate in onlinedialogs with rule makers eg DOTs Research and Special ProgramsAdministrationAll of the departments and agencies that we contacted duringthis review were developing the ITbased public participationvehicles that they believed were best suited to their particularneeds As a result the agencies participation vehicles variedsubstantially Several of the individuals and organizations that wecontacted said that the agencies should move to a more standardizedapproach and said that standardization could make the currentsystem of participation more accessible to the public Howevermany of the agency officials and staff questioned the need forstandardization They said that  agencies need to be able todesign their procedures to fit their particular circumstanceseg the degree of management centralization in the agencies standardization would require scarce agency resources thatmight be better spent elsewhere and  a good first step might beto determine whether lack of standardization is really a problemOn the other hand the officials and staff were supportive ofefforts to better coordinate the use of ITbased participationmechanisms in order to avoid each agency reinventing the wheelSuch coordination will require better communication within andamong the agencies The ultimate adoption of particular approacheswithin those agencies will require sufficient resources and anunderstanding of how the approaches will fit into the agenciesoverall IT strategic plansAgency
