            okay   uh go ahead   what are we supposed to discuss again     AIDS research is something that that i think that whether our country is putting enough money into it and actually im concerned that theyre not   more money less   i have a friend who is working with uh who works with uh travel groups and one of the ones that hes worked worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS uh conference in uh California   umhum umhum   and these were from other people from other countries hes a translator   uhhuh   and in talking to the people from France he said you know he says one of the things that really concerns me is your governments not telling you enough about how pervasive and frightening this epidemic is and theyre letting the information out slowly about how   hm   you know how big it is which is scary you know its pretty scary when so many people get it so i guess im im id like to see us spend more i dont know that spending more always gets it   yeah im im ambivalent about it because um uh it uh well it is very frightening and scary i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases and uh i mean whether   you mean more money for that means less for cancer or yeah yeah   yes and uh whether those diseases can you some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research uh didnt uh   umhum umhum   you know but i uh then part of its lack of education i dont know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent   well it i i agree with you there because i know every time that it it something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you dont know whether its still also going to the other or if its a limited pie   umhum   money from money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly or do they both get served uh thats a good point   and im i am concerned a lot about uh im concerned about uh two things one is preventing the spread and the other is for uh for uh treating the illness   umhum   and im not certain i i again this im telling you basically i dont have any opinion but whether or not it would be uh our money would be better spent uh   umhum   teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems uh rather than trying to cure the people that already have it   well and one of the things id and im with you that i dont know is is that really the only way its being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and were going to find out more   yeah well you know the dentist whether my dentist or   uh thats thats the part that   thats the part that scares me you know i mean beginning with this is this is just for homosexuals well no its for homosexuals and gays well no actually its i mean you know did they know that all along   and and i heard something the other day this sounds ridiculous about mosquitoes and you know theyve been saying oh no absolutely not cant get it from mosquitoes and uh and now theyre saying well maybe in the right conditions yes   oh   and i dont know thats true or not i mean i just heard it in passing but so what does that what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and   right and how is it really transmitted et cetera which is i think what they also dont know   yeah   i mean thats i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble   umhum   you know they just as soon not approve of anyway but but that isnt how it was in Africa   no   in Africa was the men and women and and had nothing to do with that and its huge over there so i i you know and its beginning to other countries thats was his point this was an international conference   umhum   where people are saying well but in my country its you know like this and does that mean like flus   oh   i mean i dont know all im saying is i think its scarier than we know uh or maybe they understand but   i think maybe more information should be given out about it   yeah and uh and then the people that have it it does seem that there are are some drugs that are there that you know they keep holding back if you if i were dying im not sure i would care   i i give me cyanide i mean is it   uhhuh   yeah right  ill take anything you know i mean if im dying if i know im dying you can experiment on me go ahead   right exactly and why cant you why cant the FDA say you know if if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them let them do it   yeah exactly yeah yeah and thats i think what theyre saying too
