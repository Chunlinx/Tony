                                 A Little Bit Country            Whats wrong with countrymusic today Once upon a time wildeyed boys high on home brew and dietpills ran amok and plowed the occasional luxury sedan into restaurants justoff Nashvilles Music Row  The women had big hair bigger timestruckstoptrailer park chic and no problem singing songs about the real sexualpolitic This bit of historical camp comes from a recent issue of NoDepression  an infectiously enthusiastic Seattlebased magazine that callsitself The Alternative Country Whatever That Is Quarterly Most journalsabout country music are either oriented toward collectors like the Journalof Country Music  or oriented toward consumers like any number ofNashville publications about commercial country But this is a magazine for anew market young music fans who grasp the absurdism in Dolly Partons act whounderstand that Merle Haggard is a better singer than Garth Brooks who seepunkinfluenced bands like the Waco Brothers and Wilco as a vindication oftheir idea of country music            Alternative country is a reaction against the antiseptic safety of mainstreamcountry music Its retro by necessity so as to avoid the anemic whitesoulpablum that country became in the s It is deprogrammed studiously sloppybadtempered unfit for commercial country radio heavy with the downmarketembarrassment of countrys hillbilly past and mostly made by rockers Itslyrics often caricature oldstyle country songs they sound a lot like badFaulkner June went insane by the time she was nine killed her brother with atire iron sings one alternative country act Moonshine Willy Itsinstrumentation tends toward authenticsounding fiddles and steel guitars butits sources are people like Neil Youngwho shows up in Wilcos and Son Voltsmaundering balladsand the Byrds whose countryrock Sweetheart of theRodeo album appears in nearly everything            The phrase alternative country has become as good as hardcash in the last year so desperate is the white pop industry for anything newThe next  years are going to be wild says Gary Bennett from country bandBR His band was nominated for a Grammy and country radio is slowlypicking up its singles Wilco has sold  copies of its new album BeingThere  the Old s another of No Depression s frequent causes hasjust been signed to the major label Elektra            Alternative country could be prematurely taxonomized as being made up of fourkinds of bands First there are those whose sheer talent makes them appealingto fans These include the Mavericks Dwight Yoakam and strict honkytonkclassicists BR all of whom strike the difficult balance betweenprofessionalism and cool in the hallowed tradition of Merle Haggard and WillieNelson            Next there are the semilegit crossovers betweencountry and rock or folkWilco the Old s Son Volt Iris DeMentwho adornthemselves in the trappings of country but use a studied shambling rawness toappeal to rock fans Wilco the No Depression approved band with thestrongest fan base swings between downhome sentimentality and rockaggression The lyrics to a new song Misunderstood begin with spare pianoaccompaniment and local color Youre back in your old neighborhood where thecigarettes taste so good and end with feedback and tantrums Id like tothank you all for nothing at all            Thenthere are the true eccentrics Catherine Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean are thesingers and songwriters of Freakwater whose recent album Old PaintThrill Jockey is alternative by process of elimination not by designTheir songs sound like starched and nasal Appalachian oldtime country musicunvarnished to a fault and their lyrics are anything but mythopoetic clichFreakwaters badhabit songs My Old Drunk Friend and Smoking Daddy areabout the anxiety and unglamorousness of bad habits and consequentlybelievable as contemporary songs They dont respect religion much either On they sing Theres nothing so pure as the kindness of an atheist asimple act of unselfishness that never has to be repaid Lambchop a veryquiet piece band fitted out with a trumpet baritone saxophone and organas well as the standard country setup has been building a lowbudget andslightly surreal version of Billy Sherrills stringswept s countryproductions Their are slow and graceful with lulling chord cycles shimmeringdynamics and surreal lyrics delivered just above a whisper as on a recentfulllength album How I Quit Smoking Merge            Finally there are the amateur ethnographers from ChicagoSeattle Austin Brooklyn and other centers of bohemia This fourthgroupbands such as Whiskeytown Moonshine Willy and the Waco Brothersusescountry as a shock device a flash of bad taste and seems to view the genre asan oppressive religion The cover of Angry Johnny and the Killbillies albumHankenstein  shows Hank Williams drawn like Frankensteins monster thecover of a Bloodshot alternativecountry anthology called HellBentparodies a famous photo of a grimacing emaciated Williams in an Alabama jailThe drawing is by Jon Langford of the Waco Brothersalso a founding member ofthe Mekonsand it puts arrows through Williams so that hes half StSebastian half drunken starveling            Alternative has famously been defined as meaning that at least one of themusicians in the band cant play BR and the Mavericks place out of thegenre on those grounds On BR Arista the band demonstrates agrasp of s and s country down to the grace notes and details andinvests its songs with so much professionally recycled enthusiasm that alistener can relearn the dynamics of the old stuff The Mavericks in Musicfor All Occasions MCA clearly possess enough knowledge of countryshistory to feel ambivalent toward it but its such a highfunctioning bar bandthat it cant be alternative Freakwater on the other hand often leaves youthinking that it would be great if it just sang its harmonies with amodicum of timing            One thing clearly absent from a lot ofalternative country however is piety Traditional country is a sidesteppingroundabout art fond of coy and cagey divagations Ill believe that you stilllove me when you wear your veil of white Williams wrote in  But youthink that youre above me so therell be no teardrops tonight The educatedbohemian atheists behind alternative country on the other hand have no shameat all The hell with piety they say theyd rather play up countrysselfdestructive side drinking cheating and family crackups            The problem with all this isthat posturing about Southern truckstoptrailer park chic can sometimes belittle more than thatposturing A great country singer is someone whos beenaround the block but cant get to the point in mixed company Being punkbluntin country music usually yields little more than a cheap lampoon Its not asif all this postmodern selfconsciousness amounts to anything new Thecountrymusic business has always marketed a certain nostalgia for itself Theearliest hillbilly recordings had a sort of presentimmediatelybecomingpasteffect They purported to be oldtimey as soon as they were released Contraryto the easily caricatured image of country musicians as the real thing manyhillbilly artists were as selfconscious as their pop and folk counterparts In well before No Depression was launched the Carter Family recordeda song called No Depression in Heaven AP Carter the familys patriarchwas certifiably rural he grew up in southwestern Virginias Poor Valley Buthe was no primitive He was a song collector obsessed with the idea ofrecovering Americas vanishing oral tradition The Old s take their namefrom The Wreck of the Old  a song popularized by Vernon Dalhart in Dalhart born Marion Slaughter was the son of a successful rancher from aTexas port city He enrolled at the Dallas Conservatory of Music and sangGilbert and Sullivan in New York City opera houses before perceiving that therewas a market in hillbilly songs            Not to dismiss this newbreed of country rockers altogether American culture has always fed offhalftruths about authenticity and this is the way in which alternativecountry is a genuine expression of something Hipsters with a sense of ironicdetachment like Chicagos Moonshine Willy have as much claim to the realAmerica as any muledriver Where alternative country runs into trouble is itstendency to ignore whats durable about country in favor of its stereotypicalhaybalesandwhiskeybottles shtick At its worst its become a new refugefor the untalented musician a fact that Ryan Adams from the band Whiskeytownowns up to in the song Faithless Street I had started this damn countryband cause punk rock was too hard to sing
