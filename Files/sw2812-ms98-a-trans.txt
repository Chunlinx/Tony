             women   yeah the changing roles of women how roles changed and what do you see coming in the future   oh okay thats not a broad enough topic   okay yeah  sounds good   im ready when you are   okay hold on   okay     are you there oh my goodness i cant believe i did that okay hold on   yep im here uh thats okay     okay um   okay um i dont know are you in your thirties or do you     no i im twenty three   oh okay well then i can tell you that roles have changed im thirty eight  and theyve changed quite a bit um   umhum umhum uhhuh umhum   i this was my twentieth high school reunion in Chicago and basically um   uhhuh   the choices i mean you know you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that thats kind of um the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies it was sort of just to um go protest and uh   right uhhuh right   just everybody be damned and live with someone and you know social social morals were a little bit lacking   oh i know that uh umhum i know that uh in in the early seventies uh i think women were the first people to to make a move as far as individuals   umhum   um uh before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like uh Black people or you know just large large groups of people but but the   right it was more it was more civil rights oriented or race oriented rather than gender based yeah   right and i think i think the womens movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had womens movements and you had gay movements and just the smaller groups of people and i think since then is is when a lot of the womens roles were started to change   umhum it did it did and some of the other stuff that um i think that changed it you uh when i first got out of college fifteen years ago they were always saying well if you if you were assertive you were a libber or you were aggressive not assertive and independent and   umhum   in terms of the corporate community ive seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote unquote used to women who are in uh controlling positions as higher you know corporate in the corporate hierarchy so i think thats good   umhum exactly umhum i think that uh you know you can just look at home life and see ive been talking a lot of people about education and things and and what what what affects the school system and i think that a big thing that affects it is that the mother is not home anymore   umhum right   um like she used to be she used to be kind of kind of a a rock you know in the house yeah and uh since since everyone   the mainstay yeah   going out and working now whether it be because of finances or just the economy uh the mothers not there anymore and the children are i think i think a lot of society is suffering not to say that women shouldnt   and restructuring stuff families yeah   you know go out and do what they want to do but i think that um societys going to really have to get used to it and theyre not quite used to it yet and thats i   right the schools or the moms the schools or the parents yeah   yes uhhuh   um im trying to think of what else i have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden i went blank       a lot of the things um the demographics too i mean theres more i dont have the numbers in my head right now but a lot of the things that brought feminism i mean there are just more women in in in the demographics just generally in the United States in terms of being   umhum right umhum   i mean im the typical baby boomer i hate that term but in terms of women  women going out i mean twenty three i remember that   uhhuh  yeah     whats it like to be twenty three as a woman today i mean when i was twenty three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married um those were the general issues   speaking of getting married i was talking to someone yesterday on this on the project and uh uh we were talking about child care and he asked me if i had any kids he was about forty or fifty years old and i said no im just twenty and i said no im just twenty three   uhhuh he was ancient yeah uhhuh   you know because i dont think of myself as needing to have children but the the first thing he says is well dont you miss that part of your life and i just i my my mind just went i went what you know because it didnt it really didnt doesnt even occur to me right now to have children because   you didnt know what was there to be missing   i dont have any either and ive been a married for eleven years so huh   yeah and it it just you know i think that ill probably have children when im about thirty thirty five something like just because im not sure if its just if its just me or or women in general that are twenty three right now because um   yeah when its time umhum   im really into my career im trying to go somewhere   yeah you want to establish   and and get there quick and then worry about you know because right now in my career im im really starting out and its going to take me a while to move up and i dont need anything kind of holding me back um   umhum right and and youll find that thats the other big thing that has changed in terms of um women dont feel like they need to get married anymore i was twenty seven when i got married and i just at the time um my husband actually even jokes about it   umhum right uhhuh umhum   he was twenty three when we met and i was at a point where it was like i didnt date i mean i just i went out to have a good time but i didnt have to have male companionship um and a lot of the um   right right right   friends that i had in school at that point who had gone back and gone to law school or MBA programs um which i also had done had just you know they were very sad but then by the time i got married um it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track   umhum umhum yeah yeah   so i guess thats a big change in terms of just um the attachments that women feel like they need to have the dependency their selfidentity is stronger yeah     yeah yeah its its just really not there anymore and that that has to do with you know the women getting out and other women seeing women seeing other women you know out in the corporate world thats like oh i can do that you know maybe i dont need to get married   right umhum right and i i i mean i dont know how how old your mom is shes probably lets see my mothers in her early sixties so     shes about forty umhum   okay  im thirty eight your mothers forty  i just turned thirty eight um  yes im laughing oh my God it does start to creep up no um but its okay dont ever let age i mean i dont think       umhum okay   nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men   i i just turned twenty three uh April twentieth and im still going you know oh my God im getting so old i just because me myself i just like to move really really quickly   uhhuh yeah and   i like to anything i do i got out of school quick im you know im working quick i want to move up quick i want to make money quick i want to retire quick and so anything   umhum yeah   when when the age creeps up where im twenty three and twenty four im thinking my time is running out you know but im actually very very young     yeah you are because what i was going to say is what youll find is my background is in journalism and corporate communications and what youll find is i mean im just now   umhum   finally to a point where i mean i dont know why i didnt didnt do it sooner but this is probably typical of the womens movement too the idea that youre going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school im seriously considering going back to school for law   um   um which is a complete i wouldnt say career change its its a  but its still is a different application and i mean if you think about it   umhum      you know i can i still can have another career i mean ive worked for over fifteen years in what ive done and i mean so when youre saying quick um i think thats probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine is thinking that um   yeah yeah   they have to do everything you know sort of i call kind of i call it a chewing syndrome they have to eat real fast they have they have to rapidity of speech they have to just go through everything   right uhhuh exactly exactly   and youll find that probably by the time youre twenty eight thirty if you havent slowed down something will slow you down do you know what im saying um because its just you find out that youre really not um smelling the roses and i know that sounds trite and all that   umhum yeah yeah yeah i think i think a lot of uh people probably feeling that way i know im probably feeling that way because its everythings geared towards young   umhum   you know and whether i want to realize it or not everything on television is young young young young you cant be a model after thirty you cant do this after twenty you know and every everybody thats in the music business is starting out at fifteen   oh it is thats right umhum   you know and so i feel like im old its like i sing i sing and i would really love to become     umhum   uh a professional singer but i think im too old now and im twenty three because everyone ive seen coming up theyre fifteen   oh youre not no no its true i mean its its   you know and so im going im so old and im i i really have to always tell myself no youre not youre very young and you know so its   no youre extremely yeah its its just well its like us were getting ready to do if possible for an adoption and i have friends that say well why would you do that if you know you havent been able to children which we do know why would you do that now at this part point and um   umhum umhum   its just individual choices i stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had um in my family my brothers children i mean he just turned forty his children will be out of high school before hes forty five um   yeah umhum wow   um i mean thats like your mother look how young she is compared to where you are out of school and everything its just it but what you find is you dont compare the woman because you just get into trouble its all independent and choices   umhum yeah right umhum yeah very true   um but what i was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just wont say it but i mean my mother and her sisters are always saying uh to my cousins and i my female cousins you girls are so lucky because quote unquote you have all these choices you know you went to school you can do this you can do that we couldnt do that then and my cousins and i go well why couldnt you  and they   right umhum yeah thats thats why i say i feel i feel really lucky right now because because im not married and because i dont have children im out of school im twenty three i can do anything i want to do anything and so i mean even some days im looking for another job now but and i get so depressed because not because i cant find a job but because i cant figure out what i want to do   umhum   and thats normal i mean i think thats the world today   and yeah and i feel and im lucky though because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee i dont know what to do i have so much you know not a lot of people but its depressing too what do you what do you do that youre uhhuh   right thats exactly yeah thats how i mean what im right now im im a freelance writer right now and then um what im doing is   oh   working at um a electronics an electronics company for their company newspaper right now on the side and then im also actually im excited tomorrow i have a um   hum oh   luncheon
