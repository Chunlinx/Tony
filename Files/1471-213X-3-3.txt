                    Background                Dictyostelium is one of the simplest        studied eukaryotes that possesses true multicellularity                    Dictyostelium amoebae grow and divide        asexually while feeding on bacteria or within an enriched        broth When the food supply is depleted         Dictyostelium cells shut down growth        and cell division and enter a developmental program        designed to produce and disperse spores Mounds of about         cells form as cells stream together though chemotaxis in        response to cAMP pulses During late aggregation the        initially identical cells differentiate into several        prestalk and prespore cell types sort in specified ways        and form a fingerslug that undergoes transient or        prolonged migration depending on the environmental        conditions Culmination eventually ensues resulting in a        fruiting body with a sorus of spores held several        millimeters above the substratum by a vacuolated cellular        stalk and thus situated for dispersal        The initiating events of development of         Dictyostelium include sensing        starvation and cell density which in turn result in the        dispersed cells acquiring the ability to aggregate The        mechanism of sensing the density of starved cells insures        that aggregation occurs only when there are sufficient        numbers of starved cells to form aggregates and subsequent        structures of appropriate size for optimized spore        dispersal       Hence starvation and a threshold of        cell density are the two known prerequisites for the        transition from growth to development        Two secreted proteins or protein complexes are involved        in sensing cell density     Prestarvation factor PSF        is a glycoprotein that is secreted when cells are growing        and accumulates as an indicator of the ratio of cell        density relative to the supply of food      When the        ratio of         Dictyostelium cells to nutrients is        above a certain threshold PSF induces the expression of        several early developmental genes including discoidin I        lysosomal enzymes and some components of the cAMP pulsing        system      Once nutrients are depleted PSF        production declines and a second cell densitysensing        pathway is activated Conditioned medium factor CMF is a         kDa glycoprotein that is essential for early development              CMF is sequestered in vegetative cells and is        secreted upon starvation     A critical concentration        of extracellular CMF is required for subsequent development        as CMF is involved in regulating aggregation cAMP pulsing        and early developmental events              Recently several secreted protein factors were        identified that control the size of aggregates and        subsequent developmental structures A large protein        complex counting factor was purified from conditioned        medium and shown to be involved in causing streaming cells        to break up into groups of cells in order to generate        mounds and subsequent developmental structures of the        desired size      One of the subunits of counting        factor was identified and characterized and cells that are        null for the Countin subunit lack counting factor activity            The result is massively large mounds and        subsequent structures with fruits that are too large to        maintain their normal upright posture Recently another        protein factor countin was identified as a regulator of        the minimum size of aggregates            Although recent investigations have revealed several        components involved in regulating the initiation of        development        little or no information        exists on how the cells sense starvation and in particular        amino acid deprivation Early studies indicated that        depletion of amino acids and not other nutrients is        essential for initiation of development       Upon        amino acid starvation among other events there is a        substantial decrease in the rate of initiation of protein        synthesis resulting in a reduction in size and amount of        polysomes and accumulation of free ribosomes              It is believed that the decrease in protein synthesis in        response to starvation occurs posttranscriptionally since        adding back amino acids rapidly restores protein synthesis        and does not require new mRNA synthesis            In yeast and mammalian cells GCN is a protein that        senses amino acid starvation and brings about altered cell        physiology in response to such starvation      GCN        is a protein kinase that phosphorylates the  subunit of        the translation initiation factor eIF     The GCN        protein from yeasts         Drosophila  and mammals is composed        of three domains a pseudokinase domain that may function        as a regulatory domain a kinase domain and a HisRS domain        that shares significant similarity to histidyltRNA        synthetases        Studies of yeast GCN        revealed that the HisRS domain binds uncharged tRNAs that        accumulate when cells are starved for amino acids             As a result the kinase domain is activated and        phosphorylates eIF at Ser Investigations with yeast        GCN also suggest that that Cterminus is required for        ribosome binding and facilitates GCN dimerization and        activation              During initiation of protein synthesis the ternary        complex eIFGTPmethionyltRNA         i  is an obligate intermediate in the        binding of the initiator methionyltRNA         i to the S ribosomal subunit        Phosphorylated eIF competitively inhibits the guanine        nucleotide exchange factor eIFB which is responsible for        the recycling of eIF by catalyzing the conversion of        eIFGDP to the active form eIFGTP     Thus the        overall initiation of translation is inhibited when eIF        becomes phosphorylated Although the overall rate of        initiation of translation is reduced by eIF        phosphorylation the translation of some specific mRNAs is        greatly enhanced under these conditions      The        characteristic feature of mRNAs whose translation is        enhanced by GCN phosphorylating eIF are several upstream        open reading frames uORF within the  untranslated        region UTR of the mRNAs The uORFs are involved        mechanistically in the enhanced initiation of these mRNAs                   We reasoned that a GCNlike protein might be involved        in sensing amino acid starvation in         Dictyostelium and in regulating the        growth to development transition Searches of the         Dictyostelium sequence databases        revealed two potential GCNlike genes that we named         ifkA and         ifkB initiation factor kinase The        two Ifk proteins possess all of the hallmarks of typical        GCN proteins including the characteristic kinase domain        and the HisRS domain IfkB is unique among GCNlike        proteins in that it does not possess the amino terminal        pseudokinase domain The findings presented herein indicate        that neither of the         ifk genes is involved in initiating        development However disruption of the         ifkA gene resulted in several defects        during the first few hours of development         ifkA null cells aggregated earlier        than normal due to a more rapid establishment of the cAMP        pulsing system Cells lacking a functional IfkA protein        also formed larger mounds and subsequent developmental        structures This defect was linked to a reduced        extracellular level of Countin Efficient translation of         countin mRNA required increased        phosphorylation of eIF by IfkA The increased        phosphorylation by IfkA normally occurs from  to  hours        after the onset of development resulting in a secondary        shift from polysomes to free ribosomes for bulk mRNA                    Results                  Sequence of ifkAand ifkBgenes          Using the yeast GCN amino acid sequence as a query          sequence searches of the           Dictyostelium genomic and cDNA          sequence databases revealed two ORFs with significant          identity to GCN proteins of yeast and mammals These          were named           ifkA and           ifkB  for initiation factor          kinase The           ifkA ORF contains  amino acids          and the           ifkB ORF contains  fig A          The predicted IfkB protein is a shortened version of the           ifkA sequence it is missing the          first  amino acids found in IfkA and it shares           sequence identity at the DNA and amino acid level for          the remainder of the sequence Several primers were          designed to amplify and sequence the upstream          sequences of the           ifkA and           ifkB ORFs The results confirmed          the sequences in the databases RTPCR followed by          sequencing was also employed to confirm the predicted          translation start sites          The overall sequence identity between yeast GCN and          the predicted           Dictyostelium IfkA protein is           Within the amino terminal sequences yeast and other GCN          proteins have a degenerate kinase domain of unknown          function     There is a  amino acid long sequence          in IfkA that has  identity to the V and VI subdomains          of the IfkAB kinase domain indicating the presence of          an amino terminal pseudokinase domain in the           Dictyostelium protein fig B          The sequence identity within the HisRS domain of IfkAB          and yeast GCN is  with strong conservation within          the M M and M motifs that are characteristic of          class II aminoacyltRNA synthetases     The          similarity between the kinase domains is much higher          with IfkAB possessing  identity with yeast GCN with          high conservation of all of the kinase subdomains A          significant difference between the Ifk kinase domain and          yeast GCN kinase domain is the length of the insert          sequence between subdomain IV and V which is around           amino acids in the           Dictyostelium Ifk protein and           amino acids in yeast GCN                          Expression of ifkAand ifkBmRNA during growth and          development          Oligonucleotides were designed that when used in          RTPCR reactions would detect both genes or would be          specific for the           ifkA gene RNA was isolated from          the parental or wild type strain Ax and the           ifkA null strain BS described          below during growth and at various times after the onset          of development Panel A of fig represents the additive          mRNA levels from both genes in Ax during growth and          development while panel B reflects           ifkB mRNA levels and panel C          reflects           ifkA mRNA levels The results          indicate that both genes are expressed during growth           IfkB mRNA expression remains          constant as development proceeds while the levels of           ifkA mRNA dramatically drop soon          after the onset of development and remain at a low level          for the remainder of development No           ifkA mRNA was detected in BS          the           ifkA null strain not shown                          Disruption of the ifkAgene          To examine the function of the           ifk genes we attempted to disrupt          each gene individually To date several disruption          attempts using several different disruption constructs          have been made for           ifkB  However no disruptions have          been obtained indicating that perhaps the           ifkB gene is essential Attempts to          disrupt           ifkA were carried out using a          plasmid that contained a blasticidin resistance cassette          flanked by two fragments of the           ifkA gene each about  bp long          and derived from the pseudokinase and kinase domains The          blasticidin resistance cassette replaced a  bp          fragment that includes the first four subdomains the ATP          binding site of the kinase domain As only the           flanking sequence of the blasticidin resistance cassette          is found in           ifkB but not the  flanking          sequence the disruption construct should be specific for                    ifkA           Several independent blasticidin resistant colonies          were obtained and were initially screened using PCR Four          colonies were indicated as being disrupted in the           ifkA gene and these were examined          by Southern analysis All four showed an expected  kb          shift compared with the parental strain Ax resulting          from the presence of the blasticidin resistance cassette          Fig  RTPCR using oligonucleotides specific to           ifkA revealed no           ifkA mRNA in these strains not          shown The strain used in lane  was termed BS and          this           ifkA null strain was used in          subsequent work Some of the results below including the          morphology during development were confirmed in the          other independently isolated null strains                          Disruption of the ifkAgene results in earlier          aggregation and formation of larger than normal          mounds          BS cells possessing a disruption of the           ifkA gene grew slightly slower          than the parental Ax cells in axenic broth doubling in           hour instead of  hours data not shown Growth on          bacteria however was similar for both strains BS          and Ax cells were grown on bacteria and plated under          standard conditions of development after removal of the          bacteria BS cells were able to develop and form          fruiting bodies indicating that if IfkA is involved in          sensing amino acid starvation to initiate development          this involvement is nonessential However development of          BS cells was atypical in several ways The           ifkA null cells aggregated earlier          than the parental Ax cells fig  BS cells formed          ripples the first visual sign of aggregation as early          as  hours and the tight mound stage was attained by           to  hours after the onset of development Ax cells          began rippling by  to  hours and formed mounds by           hours          In addition to precocious aggregation BS mounds          were significantly larger than those of the parental          strain The size of BS mounds was more variable than          Ax but the majority of the mounds and subsequent          structures were much larger than those of Ax fig           Attempt to determine cell numbers in BS fingers were          hampered by apparently stronger than normal cellcell          adhesion and thus incomplete dispersal of the cells for          counting Based on the number and volume of the mounds          relative to those of Ax we estimated that most BS          mounds were more than  larger than Ax mounds          The timing of the conversion of mounds to fingers was          normal for BS cells Fingers that formed from the          smaller mounds went through a transient slug stag of          about  hour comparable to what occurred with Ax          fingers However most of the larger fingers fell to the          substratum and underwent extended migration as slugs           hours During migration more cells than normal were          sloughed off and left behind in the slime trail Although          this reduced their size after culmination which was          completed with normal timing many of the fruiting bodies          of BS possessed thickened stalks and large sori fig           Several fruits were unable to remain upright          Germination of BS spores was examined and found to be          similar to that of Ax          When developed at low cell density in monolayers             cellscm instead of    cellscm  the          ability of BS cells to form large aggregates was more          evident As shown in fig  BS cells formed a few          large fruiting bodies with thick stalks and a few small          fruits while Ax formed over  typically proportioned          fruiting bodies of small but uniform size Development of          the cells in monolayers in buffer or in conditioned          medium from BS or Ax cells    indicated that          secreted factors were involved in causing both the          earlier aggregation of BS cells and the larger size of          the resulting multicellular entities not shown One          secreted factor that is involved in regulating          aggregation cAMP pulsing and early developmental events          is CMF      CMF mRNA levels were normal in BS          during growth and development not shown In addition          CMF protein levels both cellular and secreted also were          normal in growing and developing BS cells fig          B                          Precocious aggregation of BS cells reflects          earlier than normal establishment of the cAMP pulsing          system          To examine at the molecular level the reason for the          earlier aggregation of           ifkA null cells the mRNA levels          were examined for two proteins involved in the cAMP          pulsing mechanism of aggregation and chemotaxis The cAMP          cell surface receptor Car            carA gene is responsible for          sensing secreted cAMP and activating adenylyl cyclase            acaA gene which in turn results          in the production and secretion of cAMP in order to relay          the cAMP pulses     Normally both of these genes are          expressed at very low levels in growing cells and their          expression is induced during the first few hours of          development including a stimulation of expression by the          cAMP pulses themselves              RTPCR was carried out on RNA isolated from growing          cells and at various times after the onset of development          of BS and Ax cells fig  Both           carA and           acaA mRNA were detected at least           hours earlier in BS cells in comparison to Ax cells          Additionally higher levels for both mRNAs were found in          developing BS cells The decrease in           carA mRNA that is normally not seen          until  hours or so in Ax cells was occurring by           hours in BS cells Discoidin is another gene that is          induced early but is repressed by cAMP pulses once they          are established In BS cells discoidin mRNA was          induced reach maximum levels at  hour and rapidly          decreased by  hours the time mounds were formed not          shown Both the induction and subsequent loss of          discoidin was  to  hours ahead of that in Ax cells          The findings of earlier induction of these genes and          ealier repression of discoidin are consistent with the          observed early aggregation of BS cells They indicate          that in the absence of a functional IfkA protein the          proteins involved in the cAMP pulsing system are          precociously produced resulting in earlier cAMP pulsing          and hence aggregation                          Disruption of ifkAleads to reduced eIF          phosphorylation and altered polysome profiles          The predicted amino acid sequence of IfkA has all the          hallmarks of being a kinase for eIF eIF          phosphorylation in Ax and the           ifkA null strain was examined          Protein was isolated from growing and developing cells          and subjected to western analysis using antiserum          specific for phosphorylated eIF In the Ax parental          strain there was a basal level of phosphorylation of          eIF found in growing cells and the level was higher          from  to  hours after the onset of development fig           This was followed by a slow decline back to the basal          level over the next  to  hours In contrast eIF          phosphorylation in BS cells remained at the basal          growth specific level throughout the times of development          that were examined the first  hours Several          independent repeats of this experiment were performed          and in each instance the small yet noticeable increase in          eIF phosphorylation in Ax and the lack of an increase          in BS were observed For Ax the increase in          phosphorylated eIF was found to be  greater than          the level in growing cells while the levels in BS          were found to vary by   among all time points          examined These findings imply that IfkA is responsible          for phosphorylating eIF during the preaggregation          period          In           Dictyostelium  a major shift in          the polysome profile occurs as a result of starvation and          initiation of development      The percentage of          mRNA associated with polysomes drops from about  in          growing cells to  within several minutes of removal          of the food source This reduction was shown to be due to          a decreased initiation rate for translation One possible          mechanism to account for the decreased initiation rate is          phosphorylation of eIF However the earliest we could          detect a reproducible increase in phosphoryation in Ax          cells was  minutes to one hour after starvation The          previous cited results showed that the shift of ribosomes          off of polysomes occurs earlier and indeed we found that          the shift occurred within both Ax and BS cells table           This initial shift off of polysomes was of the same          magnitude in both strains and it was detected within          minutes prior to when we observed increased          phosphorylation of eIF          However at two hours and four hours after the onset          of development evidence was found for a second smaller          magnitude polysome shift This was revealed when the          polysome profile of Ax cells was compared to that of          BS cells at these later time points fig  table           From several independent experiments we consistently          found a larger free ribosome peak and a reduction in the          polysome regions of the gradients for Ax compared to          BS The increase in the free ribosome peak and          decrease in the polysome region were each about  to           when compared to the BS profile or to the profile from          Ax cells several minutes after starvation The time          period of this secondary shift corresponds to the time          when we observed an increased phosphorylation of eIF          That neither the increased phosphorylation nor the          secondary polysome shift occured in BS indicates that          IfkA is responsible for both of these events Although          the initial decrease in translation is a result of a          different mechanism we conclude that phosphorylation of          eIF by IfkA from about  to  hours after the onset of          development results in a further decrease in overall          translation initiation and thus in a secondary shift of          polysomes to free ribosomes                          Disruption of ifkAresults in misregulation of          countin          Counting factor is a secreted large protein complex          that regulates the number of cells within and thus the          size of mounds     One of the polypeptides of the          counting factor complex is Countin Disruption of the           countin gene results in extremely          large mounds and fruiting bodies     As noted above          one of the phenotypes associated with disruption of the           ifkA gene was large aggregates and          fruiting bodies and these aberrations appeared to result          from a secreted factors Thus the expression of           countin was examined in the mutant          cells          In the parental strain Ax the level of           countin mRNA gradually decreased          with time after the onset of development fig A          consistent with previous findings     In contrast          the decrease of           countin mRNA was much more dramatic          in BS with little detectable mRNA present by  hours          To study the synthesis and secretion of the Countin          protein BS and Ax cells were removed from the          bacterial food source and shaken in normal starvation          buffer for varying times Samples of both cells and          conditioned medium were processed for western analysis          using antiserum specific for the Countin protein fig          B In both Ax and BS cells Countin remained at a          constant level within cells with time after starvation          At each time point however less countin was found in          BS whole cell lysates relative to the levels in Ax          lysates Cell panels          Analysis of the conditioned medium from Ax cells          indicted that extracellular Countin increased with time          as was expected fig B CM panels However for BS          levels of secreted Countin were reduced relative to those          of Ax and by six hours only modest amounts of Countin          had accumulated that were roughly equivalent to the          accumulated level after  hours for Ax CM panels In          contrast to the findings for extracellular Countin          levels of secreted CMF were the same for Ax and BS          cells CMF panels thus ruling out a general decrease in          sectreted proteins in the mutant strain Although          extracellular Countin did appear to accumulate with          starved BS cells its concetration was reduced and          accumulation was slower compared to Ax cells These          findings suggest that the increased size of mounds and          fruiting bodies characteristic of the           ifkA null strain may be a result of          decreased production and accumulation of extracellular          Countin                          Disruption of ifkAresults in altered translation          efficiency and stability of countinmRNA          An examination of the  untranslated region UTR          of the           countin mRNA revealed  short          upstream open reading frames uORFs A hallmark of          mRNAs including the yeast GCN mRNA that are          specifically regulated by GCN of yeast and mammals is          the presence of several uORFs within the  UTR               The uORFs of           countin mRNA along with those of          yeast GCN mRNA are shown schematically in fig A The          similarity suggests that Countin expression may be          specifically regulated by IfkA phosphorylation of eIF          To examine this possibility the distribution of           countin mRNA within the polysome          profiles of Ax and BS were examined before and after          the onset of development          RNA was extracted from the fractions collected after          sucrose gradient centrifugation of cell extracts isolated          four hours after starvation The distribution of           countin mRNA was determined by          RTPCR Fractions  through  represent polysomes with          decreasing numbers of associated ribosomes going from          fraction  to fraction  while fractions  through           represent free ribosomes fig  In both BS and Ax          developing cells           countin mRNA was found mostly in          the polysome fractions fig B However in BS in          comparison to Ax the relative abundance of           countin mRNA was reproducibly less          in the high polysome fractions and greater in the low          polysome and free ribosome fractions fig Band C The          shift in relative abundance of           countin mRNA within the polysome          profiles of the two strains is opposite the secondary          shift identified above for bulk mRNA and for the shift          seen for H mRNA fig B No difference in the          distribution of           countin mRNA was found between the          two strains when polysome profiles from growing cells          were examined fig C The results indicate that in the          absence of IfkA and its phosphorylation of eIF during          early development           countin mRNA is retained less well          on polysomes and has fewer associated ribosomes This          suggests that normally during early development in the          wild type strain enhanced translation of           countin mRNA occurs as a result of          IfkA phosphorylating eIF          The reduction of ribosomes associated with           countin mRNA in developing BS          cells implies a reduced translation efficiency of           countin mRNA and probably accounts          for the reduced levels of Countin found in the mutant          strain Also it is possible that reduced association          with ribosomes results in a destabilization of           countin mRNA and this might          account for the more rapid loss and lower levels of           countin mRNA found in BS cells          after the onset of development To examine this          possibility           countin mRNA levels were examined          after the inhibition of transcription  hours after the          onset of development using actinomycin D     After          inhibition of transcription           countin mRNA was lost earlier in          developing BS cells than in the parental Ax cells          fig  Two hours after addition of actinomycin very          little           countin mRNA remained in BS          while only modest degradation had occurred in Ax          Addition of cycloheximide a translation inhibitor that          inhibits dissociation of ribosomes from mRNA              increased the stability of           countin mRNA Addition of          cycloheximide has been shown to result in a substantial          reduction in the elongation rate of protein synthesis in           Dictyostelium and can cause mRNAs          with few ribosomes to acquire more ribosomes ie it          can reverse the polysome shift     Taken together          these findings suggest that           countin mRNA is destabilized in          developing           ifkA null cells due to the loss of          ribosomes and decreased translation efficiency of           countin mRNA in these cells          Recent findings indicate the presence of another          Countinlike factor Countin that is involved in          regulating aggregate size               Countin mRNA levels were found to          be the same in BS and Ax during growth and          development not shown                            Discussion        The multicellular developmental program of         Dictyostelium is a response to        starvation with the goals being the survival of some cells        in the form of protected spores and dispersal of the        survivors in hopes of finding an environment that supports        growth Depletion of amino acids as opposed to other        nutrients such as glucose and vitamins was shown to be        responsible for shutting down growth and cell division and        initiating the developmental program              Although substantial progress on the regulation of the        initiation of development in         Dictyostelium has been made               how the cells sense starvation and in particular        amino acid deprivation is unknown GCN of yeast and        mammals is a known sensor of amino acid starvation and        regulates cellular responses to such starvation             Using degenerate primers and PCR and database searching        identified two GCNlike genes in         Dictyostelium          ifkA and         ifkB  Thinking that one or both of        these genes may play a role in sensing amino acid        starvation and in initiating development we carried out        the work described herein to examine their functions        The predicted amino acid sequences of IfkA and IfkB are        nearly identical within the kinase domain and the HisRS        domain and in turn these two domains share significant        sequence identity with GCN proteins from yeast         Drosophila  and mammals This        includes the characteristic features peculiar to the kinase        domain of GCN proteins the m m and m motifs of the        HisRS domain and a cluster of positively charged residues        at the Cterminus that are thought to function in ribosome        binding and dimerization       Within the kinase        domain the         Dictyostelium proteins possess an        inserted sequence between the th and th kinase subdomains        that is also found in this position in all known GCNlike        proteins The insert in IfkA and IfkB is significantly        longer than that of other GCN proteins The major        difference between IfkA and IfkB is the amino terminal        extension of about  amino acids that is found in IfkA        but not IfkB Similar extensions amino terminal to the        kinase domain are found in GCN proteins from other        species and the function of this portion of the protein is        unknown This region has limited sequence identity to the        kinase domain and thus has been termed the pseudokinase        domain     Similarly the extension in IfkA shows        limited sequence identity to the kinase domain In        contrast IfkB begins at the kinase domain and is the only        known GCNlike protein that does not possess a        pseudokinase domain        Even though a number of attempts have been made we have        been unable to disrupt the         ikfB gene This suggests it is an        essential gene a property not found for eIF kinases of        other organisms and we currently have no insight into its        function Although it is possible that IfkB plays a role in        the transition from growth to development we do not think        it does A basal level of eIF phosphorylation was found        in growing cells and this basal level was maintained        during development in the         ifkA null strain Thus we have not        detected any changes in eIF phosphorylation that can be        attributable to regulated IfkB activity Instead only a        basal and unchanging level of phosphorylation during growth        and development can be attributed to IfkB        A very early event marking the initiation of development        is a substantial reduction in overall translation        initiation and a concomitant major shift of ribosomes from        mRNAassociated ribosomes polysomes to free ribosomes             The percentage of mRNA associated with polysomes        drops from about  in growing cells to  within        several minutes of the removal of the food source We        detect no increase in eIF phosphorylation within this        time frame indicating that enhanced eIF phosphorylation        is not the mechanism used to bring about the rapid initial        decrease in the initiation of protein synthesis        Disruption of the         ifkA gene was accomplished and        several defects were found in the null strain BS that        indicted a role for IfkA and eIF phosphorylation during        the first several hours of development Examining the        morphology of the null strain revealed two major        aberrations relative to the normal morphology attained        during development BS cells aggregated and formed        mounds two to four hours earlier than the parental cells        Earlier aggregation was seen when cells were developed at        both high and low cell densities        The early aggregation phenotype associated with BS        suggests that the cAMP pulsing system was established        earlier than normal This was confirmed indirectly by        examining the expression of several of the components of        the pulsing system mRNA for both Carl the cell surface        cAMP receptor and AcaA the adenylyl cyclase responsible        for cAMP synthesis was found to be induced  to  hours        earlier than in the parental cells The levels of these        mRNAs were also greater in developing BS cells Thus        the components of the pulsing system are produced earlier        and to higher levels when IfkA is not functioning In        addition these genes are pulseinduced genes and thus        their induction during early development normally is        enhanced and promoted as the cAMP pulses are established            The early and more abundant induction of their mRNAs        in BS indicate that the pulsing system is functioning        earlier in the absence of IfkA The earlier and more rapid        loss of discoidin mRNA reinforces this conclusion as        discoidin is a pulse repressed gene            Examination of eIF phosphorylation in         ifkA null cells indicated that the        IfkA protein is responsible for increased phosphorylation        eIF from  to  hours after the onset of development        Although an increase was seen in the parental strain during        this time frame eIF phosphorylation levels in developing        BS cells remained at the lower basal level found in        growing cells        Concomitant with the increased eIF phosphorylation in        the parental strain was a secondary shift of ribosomes from        polysomes to free ribosomes A decrease in polysomes of        about   and an equivalent increase in free ribosomes was        observed when the polysome profile of Ax cells developed        for  or  hours was compared to the profile from BS        cells developed for the same time or to the profile from        Ax cells developed for only  minutes These results        indicate that IfkA is normally active from about  hour to        about  hours after starvation and normally phosphorylates        eIF during this time period however we have no direct        data that demonstrates IfkA phosphorylates eIF IfkA        activation at these times results is a reduction in overall        protein synthesis initiation as indicated by the secondary        shift of polysomes to ribosomes Based on the normal        function of GCNlike proteins     these findings        suggest that uncharged tRNAs are more prevalent within the        cells during this time relative to either growing cells or        to cells immediately after removal of the food source        In addition to the earlier aggregation phenotype of        developing BS cells the IFkA null cells also formed        atypically large aggregates mounds and subsequent        developmental structures This phenotype is reminiscent of        cells that lack Countin a component of counting factor        that regulates the size of aggregates              Countin mRNA was found to be lost        significantly more rapidly in developing BS cells        relative to the parental Ax cells Examination of the        stability of         countin mRNA indicated that it was        turned over more rapidly in BS cells during early        development This suggests that         countin mRNA is destabilized in        developing cells that lack IfkA function and we assume        that         countin mRNA synthesis is not        affected in these cells We suggest the destabilization of         countin mRNA may be a result of the        loss of ribosomes which otherwise would afford protection        from degradation from this mRNA in BS cells        The distribution of         countin mRNA within the polysome        profile was altered in developing BS cells As described        above bulk mRNA undergoes a secondary shift from polysomes        to free ribosomes in Ax cells and this shift was not seen        in BS cells as it is dependent upon eIF        phosphorylation by IfkA More ribosomes were found to be        associated with         countin mRNA in early developing Ax        cells relative to BS cells which is the converse        ribosome association with bulk mRNA in the two strains        This finding indicates that         countin mRNA is translated more        efficiently when IfkA is functioning properly This is        similar to the enhanced translation of certain yeast and        mammalian mRNAs GCN ATF both transcription factors        regulated by GCN when GCN in these organisms is        activated by amino acid starvation even though bulk mRNA        undergoes a decrease in translation efficiency             The hallmark of mRNAs that are upregulated by GCN and        eIF phosphorylation is the presence of several upstream        open reading frames within their  UTRs The uORFs are        involved mechanistically in bringing about enhanced        translation initiation under conditions that otherwise        favor a general decrease in translation initiation            Within the  UTR of         countin mRNA we find uORFs similar        in number and in arrangement to those of GCN mRNA the        major mRNA regulated by yeast GCN     Thus we        suggest that         countin mRNA and probably other as        yet identified mRNAs are translationally upregulated when        IfkA phosphorylates eIF during the preaggregation period        or from  to  hours after the onset of development        A result of the lack of increasing the translational        efficiency of         countin mRNA in developing         ifkA null cells should be less        Countin protein in these cells Indeed we found less        intracellular Countin throughout the first  hours after        the onset of development of BS cells In addition there        was significantly less Countin secreted during the first         hours of development Countin as an essential component of        counting factor regulates aggregate size after it is        secreted A high extracellular concentration of counting        factor is interpreted by the cells of indicating a large        number of cells within an aggregating stream This causes        the breakup of the aggregating stream into groups of the        normal number of cells     Thus the large size of the        structures formed by developing BS cells can be        accounted for by the lower extracellular Countin        concentration and thus a lack of breaking up into smaller        groups of cells The heterogeneity of the size of the        aggregates of developing BS might arise from the fact        that extracellular countin levels eventually reach near        normal levels at about  to  hours after the onset of        development The reduced levels of Countin are not thought        to account for the early aggregating phenotype of cells        lacking IfkA since early aggregation was not found for         countin null cells            Why would the translation efficiency of         countin mRNA be maintained and not        reduced as is bulk mRNA during the secondary shift of        polysomal RNA Since the extracellular concentrations of        Countin reflect cell density perhaps it is important to        maintain a constant level of Countin production and        secretion once development has been initiated Any drop in        translation efficiency might alter the counting mechanism        and result in aberrantly sized mounds        In summary the findings suggest that IfkA is an eIF        kinase of         Dictyostelium that normally        phosphorylates eIF from  to  hours after the onset of        development or during the preaggregation phase This        results in an overall reduction in the initiation of        protein synthesis during this time frame and a concomitant        reduction in the number of ribosomes associated with most        mRNAs the secondary polysome shift For some mRNAs        however initiation of protein synthesis is enhanced or        stabilized under the conditions of increased eIF        phosphorylation This includes         countin mRNA As a result        appropriate amounts of Countin are secreted and aggregate        size is regulated properly In the absence of IfkA eIF        phosphorylation does not increase resulting in inefficient        translation of         countin and perhaps other mRNAs        Decreased Countin leads to larger than normal aggregates        slugs and fruiting bodies The larger size of many of        these fruits results in their toppling over and thus in an        inability to properly disperse the spores Earlier than        normal aggregation and cAMP pulsing also result from a lack        of IfkA activity during preaggregation and we postulate        that this is due to the production and secretion of an as        yet unidentified factor in early developing         ifkA null cells                    Methods                  Cell growth and development          The axenic strain Ax     was used as the          parental or wild type strain in all experiments Cells

western analysis using anti Countin antiserum             kindly provided by Dr Richard Gomer For detecting CMF          the  and  hour conditioned medium samples were          concentrated prior to fractionation by PAGE CMF          antiserum was kindly provided by Dr Richard Gomer                          mRNA and polysome analysis          RNA was isolated processed and used for RTPCR as          described      For polysome analysis BS and          Ax cells were harvest from bacterial growth plates          before noticeable presence of           Dictyostelium cell growth            After removal of bacteria cells          were plated for development as described above After           and  hours of development cells were collected into          polysome buffer HMKNP plus cycloheximide to stabilize          the polysomes To prepare polysome samples from growing          cells cells were scraped from bacterial growth plates          and suspended directly into polysome buffer The cell          lysates were spun at   g for  minutes to remove          nuclei cell debris and bacteria for growing cell          samples The concentration of RNA in the supernatants          was determined spectrophotometrically  mg of RNA were          layered onto a  ml linear sucrose gradient           sucrose wv in polysome buffer without NP and the          gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SWTi rotor at           rpm for  hours at C Gradient fractions were          collected and the profile traces were generated by          continuous monitoring at  nm RNA from each fraction          was isolated by extraction with phenolchloroform          followed by ethanol precipitation RNA from an equivalent          volume of each fraction was subjected to RTPCR as just          described except the reactions were spiked with a small          amount of radioactive dATP for quantitation Quantitation          was carried out using phosphoimaging analysis For all          RNA samples used in RTPCR reactions H specific          oligonucleotides were used as a control H mRNA is          expressed at a constant level during growth and          development    and thus monitors
