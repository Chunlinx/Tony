                    Background        The proper assembly of basic proteins with nucleic        acids such as occurs in the packaging of histones with DNA        to produce chromatin and in the packaging of ribosomal        proteins with rRNA to form ribosomes is a reaction that        must be facilitated so as to prevent the aggregation of        these oppositely charged groups of molecules Proteins that        mediate these reactions generally termed molecular or        nuclear chaperones have been identified biochemically        Two well studied proteins that participate in the processes        of chromatin and ribosome assembly are nucleoplasmin and        nucleophosmin respectively two related proteins whose        characteristic acidic domains have been shown to bind the        basic proteins involved in these processes and present them        to the nucleic acid        Nucleoplasmin is the most abundant protein in the         Xenopus oocyte nucleus and is the        protein for which the term molecular chaperone was coined        due to its multiple roles in the assembly of nucleosomes        during early frog development     Nucleoplasmin forms a        pentamer and its stretches of acidic residues bind to        histone HA and HB In concert with the unrelated acidic        protein NN which binds histones H and H they act        together and with other factors to assemble nucleosomes             In addition to assembly nucleoplasmin and other        proteins are involved in the chromatin remodeling and        nucleosome disassembly that occurs for example during        transcription to allow the access of transcription factors        to nucleosomal DNA     Another major function of        nucleoplasmin is the decondensation of sperm chromatin at        fertilization In this case nucleoplasmin acts to exchange        the sperm specific basic proteins which allow the dense        packing of DNA in sperm with the histones HA and HB        thus effecting chromatin decondensation             Phosphorylation of nucleoplasmin appears to be important in        regulating this activity as heavily phosphorylated        nucleoplasmin is significantly more active            Nucleophosmin also called B     NO    or        numatrin     a protein related to nucleoplasmin is        implicated in ribosome assembly due to its abundance        localization in the nucleolus and its multiple activities        that are consistent with such a function Some of these        activities include nucleic acid binding            ribonuclease activity for processing preribosomal RNA           and association with maturing preribosomal        ribonucleoprotein particles      It may also be        involved in the transport of ribosomal or other nucleosomal        proteins across the nuclear membrane as it is known to        shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus and to stimulate        the nuclear importation of proteins             Nucleophosmin also appears to be intimately involved in        centrosome duplication It associates specifically with        unduplicated centrosomes and its phosphorylation by        CDKcyclin E the trigger for centrosome duplication is        required for duplication to occur     The        nucleophosmin gene is also known for its fusion with the        anaplastic lymphoma kinase         ALK receptor tyrosine kinase in        cases of this disease with pq translocations            The nucleophosmin portion contributes to        transformation by providing a dimerization domain which        allows activation of the fused kinase and signal        transduction            We previously discovered and initially characterized a        novel member of this family in the mouse namely        nucleophosminnucleoplasmin           Npm  To identify the human        ortholog of         Npm and begin its characterization        we have cloned a human         NPM cDNA determined its genomic        structure and relationship to other family members and show        its expression in multiple tissues and subcellular        localization in the nucleus                    Results and Discussion                  NPMcDNA cloning and genomic structure          Mouse           Npm is located approximately  kb          upstream of the           Fgf gene in the same          transcriptional orientation      To determine if          human           NPM is similarly located and to          identify genomic clones of           NPM we analyzed FGFcontaining          human genomic lambda clones    by Southern blotting          using a mouse           Npm cDNA probe A kb           Hin d III           Xho I fragment that hybridized to           Npm was identified subcloned and          used to screen a human liver cDNA library Several          partial cDNAs with strong sequence homology to mouse           Npm were isolated The  coding          region was subsequently isolated using a reverse          transcriptasePCR approach and was fused to one of the          partial cDNAs at a common restriction site to produce a          cDNA with full coding potential Sequencing of subcloned          genomic fragments and comparison with the cDNA sequence          allowed us to construct an exon map of the           NPM gene Figure A           NPM has the same exon structure as          the mouse ortholog and is located approximately  kb          upstream of           FGF in the same transcriptional          orientation Figure B The           NPM exonintron boundaries and          organization information is presented in Table  Based          on its close linkage to           FGF NPM maps to chromosome          q                               NPMsequence analysis          The amino acid sequence deduced from the human           NPM cDNA sequence was           identical and  similar to mouse           Npm Figure  The human sequence          is three amino acids longer than that of the mouse these          additional residues lie in the acidic domain in the          Cterminal portion of the protein At least eight          potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites are          present in the human protein involving such kinases as          casein kinase I and II protein kinase A and C glycogen          synthase kinase  and calmodulindependent protein kinase          II Figure  All of these consensus sites are also          found in mouse Npm with the exception of the casein          kinase I site at residue  A cluster of amino acids at          the Cterminus that is rich in basic residues and          glycines forms a potential nuclear localization signal              in the human as well as the mouse protein Figure           Multiple phosphorylation sites and nuclear          localization signals or the ability to bind proteins          with such signals are also characteristics of          nucleophosmin and nucleoplasmin        When          the functions of NPM are elucidated it will be of          interest to determine the contribution of phosphorylation          to these activities since the functions of both          nucleoplasmin and nucleophosmin are regulated by          phosphorylation which is extensive in both proteins                        To enable an amino acid comparison between NPM with          other members of the nucleophosminnucleoplasmin family          we searched the nonredundant GenBank database using human          NPM           Xenopus nucleoplasmin and human          nucleophosmin as BLASTP queries and  additional          fulllength proteins were retrieved Table  An amino          acid comparison of NPM with these other members of the          nucleophosminnucleoplasmin family from various metazoans          reveals extensive sequence identities and similarities          throughout all of NPM except the Cterminal  residues          Figure  All members of this family have a core region          of relatively close similarity in the Nterminal half of          the proteins Cterminal to this region all have one or          more acidic domains consisting of a total of  to more          than  aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues per          molecule These two residues can comprise more than           of the total amino acids in some proteins of this family          in NPM they make up approximately  of the residues          The Nterminal core region of high similarity between          family members correlates to a region in          nucleophosminB that has been shown to be involved in          oligomerization as well as chaperone activity     A          central portion between nucleophosmins two acidic          domains is required for ribonuclease activity              this region does not have a corresponding domain in          either NPM or nucleoplasmin suggesting that these          proteins would lack such activity A nucleic acid binding          domain in the Cterminus of nucleophosmin is also lacking          in NPM and nucleoplasmin but the known functions of          nucleoplasmin in nucleosome assembly and sperm          decondensation suggest that this protein and possibly          NPM can accomplish intermolecular reactions involving          nucleic acids in other ways perhaps by associating with          other proteins that have this binding activity Indeed          NO a           Xenopus protein with significant          similarity to NPM is found to associate with NO the           Xenopus ortholog of mammalian          nucleophosmin              To gain further insight into the relationship of NPM          with the other known members of this family we used          CLUSTAL W and TreeTop    to produce a dendrogram of          these relationships Figure  In this analysis we          included the  proteins from Figure together with two          other histonebinding proteins that are unrelated to this          family These two proteins           Xenopus NN    and human NASP          nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein     are          closely related to each other and may be orthologs              This analysis shows that NPM is more closely related          to NO and the nucleoplasmins from           Xenopus than to the nucleophosmins          from multiple species No nucleoplasmin ortholog in          humans has been reported to date and our screening of          GenBank has not detected such a sequence The          relationship between NN and NASP can be seen in this          dendrogram and appears similar in closeness to that of          NPM and NO The kinship of NPM and NO is supported          by recent GenBank screens with the NPM amino acid          sequence as a TBLASTN query against the entire          nonredundant GenBank database which resulted in NO          sequences as the best nonNPM match and vice versa          Although other genomic and functional studies would be          required to prove an orthologous relationship between          NPM and NO they appear by several analyses to share a          relatively close evolutionary history and as such could          be considered candidate orthologs                          NPM expression in human tissues          We examined the expression of           NPM in  human tissues by          Northern blot analysis Figure  Abundant and          relatively equal expression of           NPM was found in all tissues with          the highest levels relative to actin in pancreas and          testis and the lowest in lung Previous analysis of           Npm expression in mouse tissues          also showed generally equal and strong expression in the          tissues tested with especially strong expression in          testis     However in the mouse the brain rather          than the lung displayed the lowest           Npm RNA levels Nevertheless the          widespread and relatively strong expression of the gene          in both species suggests that the protein has a          fundamental functions in cells of many if not all          tissues The apparently ubiquitous expression and          abundant levels of           NPM RNA are consistent with other          members of this gene family and with a proposed role as a          molecular chaperone                          NPM protein localizes to the nucleus          All of the nucleophosmin and nucleoplasmin homologs          that have been studied to date are localized in the          nucleus To allow a determination of the subcellular          localization of the NPM protein we tagged the protein          at its Nterminus with a hemagglutinin HA epitope We          then expressed this protein in NIHT cells fractionated          the cells into nuclear cytoplasmic and extracellular          culture medium fractions and analyzed these by          immunoblotting using an antiHA antibody This analysis          revealed that NPM was localized only in the nuclear          fraction Figure  The NPM protein migrated in          SDSPAGE gels as a doublet with apparent molecular masses          of  and  kDa which are larger than the  kDa mass          predicted by the deduced amino acid sequence including          the HA tag Similarly other members of the          nucleophosminnucleoplasmin family also migrate more          slowly than expected           Xenopus NO migrates at  kDa          versus the expected  kDa               Xenopus NO migrates at  kDa          versus the expected  kDa     and           Xenopus nucleoplasmin migrates at           kDa rather than  kDa     The slower migration          is likely primarily due to an electrophoretic anomaly          reflecting the amino acid composition although          phosphorylation or other modifications could conceivably          contribute Supporting this notion the           in vitro transcriptiontranslation          of a plasmid encoding the closely related NO protein          produces a product presumably unmodified with slow          mobility that is similar to the mobility of NO          extracted from cells     The smallersized          polypeptide of the NPM doublet is probably a degradation          product as is observed in analyses of the NO protein              This subcellular localization of NPM together          with the other results here suggests that this protein          is a molecular chaperone with functions in the          nucleus                            Conclusions        The striking similarities in amino acid sequence and        domain structure between NPM and its chaperone relatives        nucleophosmin and nucleoplasmin together with abundant        expression levels and nuclear localization strongly        suggests that NPM shares fundamental nuclear chaperone        functions with these proteins It will be important in        future work to refine these results and test for example        whether NPM may have chromatin or ribosome assembly        functions that are similar or complementary to        nucleoplasmin or nucleophosmin or whether it may have        completely independent functions                    Materials and methods                  Isolation of NPMgenomic probes          We digested previously isolated lambda genomic clones          of the human           FGF region    with restriction          endonucleases Promega Madison WI and analyzed them by          Southern blotting using a mouse           Npm cDNA    probe as          previously described     An kb           Xho I fragment from these clones          that hybridized to the probe was subcloned into          pBluescript Stratagene for analysis Deletion of           nonNpm sequences from this clone          resulted in a kb           Hin d III           Xho I fragment which was then          isolated and used as a probe for the isolation of a human                    NPM cDNA                          Isolation of NPMcDNA          The kb           Hin d III           Xho I human genomic fragment          described above was

minute at           rpm Eppendorf C C The resulting supernatant was          called cytoplasm but actually contained cytoplasmic          membranes as well The resulting nuclear pellet was          resuspended in  l of Buffer C  mM KHEPES pH            mM MgCl              mM EDTA  vv glycerol and           M NaCl with protease inhibitors as above          incubated on ice for  minutes then microcentrifuged           minutes at  rpm Eppendorf C C This final          supernatant was the nuclear extract          The protein solutions were quantified by Bradford          Assay Biorad Hercules CA and  mg of each sample          were subjected to SDSPAGE  acrylamide Following          electrophoresis the gel contents were          electrophoreticallytransferred to nitrocellulose           mA  V  hour C Transfer Buffer II from Harlow          and Lane     The membrane was blocked with  wv          nonfat dried milk in PBS vv Tween  PBST          overnight at C then subjected to immunoblotting and          ECL Amersham Arlington IL detection The primary          antibody was monoclonal mouse antihemagglutinin          dilution  in PBST gift of Guojon Bu Washington
