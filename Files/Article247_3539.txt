                                 Homeless Couple Gets Help            The FBI videotapes revelation that incendiary tear gas canisters were usedat Waco with the knowledge of at least two of its agents there and thepolitical fallout this is generating leads at USA Today the LosAngeles Times and the Washington Post  The New York Timesfronts a story about tension between Janet Reno and Louis Freeh ditto theWP  but leads instead with an evergreen the failure of an Americandiplomatic mission led by Madeleine Albright to produce a peace accordbetween the Palestinians and Israel a story that is fronted at the LATand WP  The sticking point du jour is how many Palestinians in Israelijails should be released Israel is willing to spring  but the Palestinianswant another  the Israelis are saying no to                           USATs lead mainly dwells on the imminent outside investigation ofWaco saying that its honcho could be named as early as today and thatcandidates include two Republican exsenators The WP has this as wellBut the Post and especially the LAT focus instead on wringing significance from thevideotape released yesterday by the DOJ The WP says it shows a hurriedand seemingly casual decision arrived at by the thenhead of the FBIs hostagerescue team Richard Rogers in a discussion with a subordinate to allow one ofthe team members to use incendiary military tear gas cartridges against anunderground shelter near the main compound building The Post notes thatin a subsequent FBI account of the Waco assault Rogers made no mention of theincendiary rounds The LAT adds that when in an appearance beforeCongress thenFBI director William Sessions testified that his agents did notuse any flammable munitions at Waco Rogers was sitting behind him ThePost adds that in court documents FBI officials stated that novideotape existed covering the phase of the operation when it turns outRogers directive was issued Rogers the LAT reminds was later removedfrom his hostage team job because of his role at the Ruby Ridge Idahostandoff the year before Waco in which an unarmed woman was killed by a sniperunder Rogers command            The LAT raises another interesting point Did senior DOJ and FBIofficials in the Washington command center listening to sporadic radiocommunications from Waco hear the conversation on the videotape The paperquotes Carl Stern then Renos press spokesman who was at the command centerthat day as saying that he does not recall hearing it            There is much discussion in the stories about how these revelations havehurt the credibility of federal law enforcement But somebody elsescredibility takes a hit too the medias Its a little hard to believe that ifdozens and dozens of children of a fringeleft group had died in similarcircumstances the mainstream media would have left the story to a documentaryfilmmaker            A WP frontpager reports that George W Bush vowed yesterday that ifelected president he would strip federal funding from failing public schoolsand give the money to parents for tutors or to help them transfer their kids toother schools including private ones The NYT and LAT run thestory inside The coverage notes that Bush never used the word voucher            The Wall Street Journal reports a new finding in the unravelingRussian funds scandal hundreds of corporate and individual bank accounts atdozens of banks around the world are now suspected of receiving parts of theestimated  billion that is missing On some days some of these accountssays the paper received transfers of more than  million            The NYT goes topfront with word that President Clinton and HillaryClinton have signed a contract to buy a  million room colonial home inChappaqua New York They will close in November The Times runs theitem under a nice headline WITH SOME HELP CLINTONS PURCHASE A WHITE HOUSEThe help refers to the  million in collateral President Clintons chieffundraiser Terry McAuliffe put up to secure the house loan The paper quotesone source as saying that since the Clintons have assets of just over million but legal debts of  million banks were a little bit wary aboutproviding such a large mortgage without some extra security The WPreports that the angel was supposed to be former White House chief of staffErskine Bowles who bowed out at the last minute to the consternation of theClintons Isnt it a little surprising that the papers dont mention thesimilarity to the way Richard Nixon got his house with a little help from hisrich friends            The NYT reports that until yesterday afternoon Ebay was offering forbidding a fully functional human kidney The opening bid was  and thelast bid was  before the company ended the auction no doubt becausetrafficking in organs is a felony            The WP reports that AOL having reprogrammed its computers to allowmuch longer screennames has also taken the step of preventing subscribersfrom using as their logons any of the celebrity names that are now for thefirst time technically available So the paper explains noBillclintonaolcom unless youre Him Todays Papers is reminded of somethingit just learned about the NYT
