 INTRODUCTIONThe objective of aquatic toxicity tests with effluents orpure compounds is to estimate the safe or noeffectconcentration of these substances which is defined as theconcentration which will permit normal propagation of fish andother aquatic life in the receiving waters The endpoints that havebeen considered in tests to determine the adverse effects oftoxicants include death and survival decreased reproduction andgrowth locomotor activity gill ventilation rate heart rateblood chemistry histopathology enzyme activity olfactoryfunction and terata Since it is not feasible to detect andormeasure all of these and other possible effects of toxicsubstances on a routine basis observations in toxicity testsgenerally have been limited to only a few effects such asmortality growth and reproductionAcute lethality is an obvious and easily observed effectwhich accounts for its wide use in the early period of evaluationof the toxicity of pure compounds and complex effluents Theresults of these tests were usually expressed as the concentrationlethal to  of the test organisms LC over relatively shortexposure periods onetofour daysAs exposure periods of acute tests were lengthened theLC and lethal threshold concentration were observed to declinefor many compounds By lengthening the tests to include one or morecomplete life cycles and observing the more subtle effects of thetoxicants such as a reduction in growth and reproduction moreaccurate direct estimates of the threshold or safe concentrationof the toxicant could be obtained However laboratory life cycletests may not accurately estimate the safe concentration oftoxicants because they are conducted with a limited number ofspecies under highly controlled steady state conditions and theresults do not include the effects of the stresses to which theorganisms would ordinarily be exposed in the naturalenvironmentAn early published account of a full life cycle fishtoxicity test was that of Mount and Stephan  In this studyfathead minnows Pimephales promelas were exposed to a gradedseries of pesticide concentrations throughout their life cycle andthe effects of the toxicant on survival growth andreproduction were measured and evaluated This work was soonfollowed by full life cycle tests using other toxicants and fishspeciesMcKim  evaluated the data from  full life cycletests  of which used the fathead minnow Pimephales promelasand concluded that the embryolarval and early juvenile life stageswere the most sensitive stages He proposed the use of partial lifecycle toxicity tests with the early life stages ELS of fish toestablish water quality criteriaMacek and Sleight  found that exposure of criticallife stages of fish to toxicants provides estimates of chronicallysafe concentrations remarkably similar to those derived from fulllife cycle toxicity tests They reported that for a great majorityof toxicants the concentration which will not be acutely toxic tothe most sensitive life stages is the chronically safeconcentration for fish and that the most sensitive life stages arethe embryos and fry Critical life stage exposure was consideredto be exposure of the embryos during most preferably all of theembryogenic incubation period and exposure of the fry for days posthatch for warm water fish with embryogenic periodsranging from onetofourteen days and for  days posthatch forfish with longer embryogenic periods They concluded that in themajority of cases the maximum acceptable toxicant concentrationMATC could be estimated from the results of exposure of theembryos during incubation and the larvae for  daysposthatchBecause of the high cost of full lifecycle fish toxicitytests and the emerging consensus that the ELS test data usuallywould be adequate for estimating chronically safe concentrationsthere was a rapid shift by aquatic toxicologists to  to dayELS toxicity tests for estimating chronically safe concentrationsin the late s In  USEPA adopted the policy that ELS testdata could be used in establishing water quality criteria if datafrom full lifecycle tests were not available USEPAaPublished reports of the results of ELS tests indicatethat the relative sensitivity of growth and survival as endpointsmay be species dependent toxicant dependent or both Ward andParrish  examined the literature on ELS tests that usedembryos and juveniles of the sheepshead minnow Cyprinodonvariegatus and found that growth was not a statistically sensitiveindicator of toxicity in  of  tests They suggested that theELS tests be shortened to  days posthatch and that growth beeliminated as an indicator of toxic effectsIn a review of the literature on  fish full lifecycleand ELS tests performed to determine the chronically safeconcentrations of a wide variety of toxicants such as metalspesticides organics inorganics detergents and complexeffluents Woltering  found that at the lowest effectconcentration significant reductions were observed in fry survivalin  fry growth in  and egg hatchability in  of thetests He also found that fry survival and growth were very oftenequally sensitive and concluded that the growth response could bedeleted from routine application of the ELS tests The net resultwould be a significant reduction in the duration and cost ofscreening tests with no appreciable impact on estimating MATCs forchemical hazard assessments Benoit et al  however foundlarval growth to be the most significant measure of effect andsurvival to be equally or less sensitive than growth in earlylifestage tests with four organic chemicalsEfforts to further reduce the length of partial lifecycletoxicity tests for fish without compromising their predictive valuehave resulted in the development of an eightday embryolarvalsurvival and teratogenicity test for fish and other aquaticvertebrates USEPA  Birge et al  and a sevendaylarval survival and growth test Norberg and MountThe similarity of estimates of chronically safeconcentrations of toxicants derived from shortterm embryolarvalsurvival and teratogenicity tests to those derived from fulllifecycle tests has been demonstrated by Birge et al Birge and Cassidy  and Birge et al Use of a sevenday fathead minnow Pimephales promelaslarval survival and growth test was first proposed by Norberg andMount at the  annual meeting of the Society for EnvironmentalToxicology and Chemistry Norberg and Mount  This test wassubsequently used by Mount and associates in field demonstrationsat Lima Ohio USEPA  and at many other locations USEPAc USEPA d USEPA e USEPA a USEPA bUSEPA c USEPA d Growth was frequently found to be moresensitive than survival in determining the effects of complexeffluentsNorberg and Mount  performed three single toxicantfathead minnow larval growth tests with zinc copper and DURSBANusing dilution water from Lake Superior The resultswere comparable to and had confidence intervals that overlappedwith chronic values reported in the literature for both ELS andfull lifecycle testsUSEPA b and USEPA c adapted the fatheadminnow larval growth and survival test for use with the sheepsheadminnow and the inland silverside respectively When daily renewalday sheepshead minnow larval growth and survival tests and dayELS tests were performed with industrial and municipal effluentsgrowth was more sensitive than survival in seven out of  larvalgrowth and survival tests equally sensitive in four tests andless sensitive in only one test In four cases the ELS test mayhave been three to  times more sensitive to effluents than thelarval growth and survival test In tests using copper the NoObservable Effect Concentrations NOECs were the same for bothtypes of test and growth was the most sensitive endpoint for bothIn a four laboratory comparison six of seven tests producedidentical NOECs for survival and growth USEPA a Dataindicate that the inland silverside is at least equally sensitiveor more sensitive to effluents and single compounds than thesheepshead minnow and can be tested over a wider salinity range USEPA aLussier et al  and USEPA e determined thatsurvival and growth are often as sensitive as reproduction inday lifecycle tests with the mysid MysidopsisbahiaNacci and Jackim  and USEPA g compared theresults from the sea urchin fertilization test using organiccompounds with results from acute toxicity tests using thefreshwater organisms fathead minnows Pimphales promelas andDaphnia magna The test was also compared to acute toxicity testsusing Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia and the mysidMysidopsis bahia and five metals For six of the eight organiccompounds the results of the fertilization test and the acutetoxicity test correlated well r   However the results ofthe fertilization test with the five metals did not correlate wellwith the results from the acute testsUSEPA f evaluated two industrial effluentscontaining heavy metals five industrial effluents containingorganic chemicals including dyes and pesticides and  domesticwastewaters using the twoday red macroalga Champia parvulasexual reproduction test Nine single compounds were used tocompare the effects on sexual reproduction using atwoweek exposure and a twoday exposure For six of the ninecompounds tested the chronic values were the same for bothtestsThe use of shortterm toxicity tests in the NPDES Programis especially attractive because they provide a more directestimate of the safe concentrations of effluents in receivingwaters than was provided by acute toxicity tests at an onlyslightly increased level of effort compared to the fish fulllifecycle chronic and day ELS tests and the day mysidlifecycle testTYPES OF TESTSThe selection of the test type will depend on the NPDESpermit requirements the objectives of the test the availableresources the requirements of the test organisms and effluentcharacteristics such as fluctuations in effluenttoxicityEffluent chronic toxicity is generally measured using amulticoncentration or definitive test consisting of a controland a minimum of five effluent concentrations The tests aredesigned to provide doseresponse information expressed as thepercent effluent concentration that affects the survivalfertilization growth andor development within the prescribedperiod of time  minutes to seven days The results of the testsare expressed in terms of either the highest concentration that hasno statistically significant observed effect on those responseswhen compared to the controls or the estimated concentration thatcauses a specified percent reduction in responses versus thecontrolsUse of passfail tests consisting of a single effluentconcentration eg the receiving water concentration or RWC anda control is not recommended If the NPDES permit has a wholeeffluent toxicity limit for acute toxicity at the RWC it isprudent to use that permit limit as the midpoint of a series offive effluent concentrations This will ensure that there issufficient information on the doseresponse relationship Forexample if the RWC is  then the effluent concentrationsutilized in a test may be   effluent  RWC  RWC  RWC and  RWC More specifically if the RWC  the effluent concentrations used in the toxicity test wouldbe     and  If the RWC is  effluentthe concentrations may be   times the RWC   times theRWC  RWC  RWC and  RWCReceiving ambient water toxicity tests commonly employtwo treatments a control and the undiluted receiving water butmay also consist of a series of receiving waterdilutionsA negative result from a chronic toxicity test does notpreclude the presence of toxicity Also because of the potentialtemporal variability in the toxicity of effluents a negative testresult with a particular sample does not preclude the possibilitythat samples collected at some other time might exhibit chronictoxicityThe frequency with which chronic toxicity tests areconducted under a given NPDES permit is determined by theregulatory agency on the basis of factors such as the variabilityand degree of toxicity of the waste production schedules andprocess changesTests recommended for use in this methods manual may bestatic nonrenewal or static renewal Individual methods specifywhich type of test is to be conductedSTATIC TESTSStatic nonrenewal tests  The test organisms are exposedto the same test solution for the duration of the testStaticrenewal tests  The test organisms are exposed toa fresh solution of the same concentration of sample every  h orother prescribed interval either by transferring the testorganisms from one test chamber to another or by replacing all ora portion of solution in the test chambersADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TOXICITY TESTTYPES STATIC NONRENEWAL SHORTTERM TOXICITY TESTSAdvantagesSimple and inexpensiveMore cost effective in determining compliance with permitconditionsLimited resources space manpower equipment requiredwould permit staff to perform more tests in the same amount oftimeSmaller volume of effluent required than for staticrenewal or flowthrough testsDisadvantagesDissolved oxygen DO depletion may result from highchemical oxygen demand COD biological oxygen demand BOD ormetabolic wastesPossible loss of toxicants through volatilization andoradsorption to the exposure vesselsGenerally less sensitive than renewal because the toxicsubstances may degrade or be adsorbed thereby reducing theapparent toxicity Also there is less chance of detecting slugs oftoxic wastes or other temporal variations in wasteproperties STATIC RENEWAL SHORTTERM TOXICITY TESTSAdvantagesReduced possibility of DO depletion from high COD andorBOD or ill effects from metabolic wastes from organisms in thetest solutionsReduced possibility of loss of toxicants throughvolatilization andor adsorption to the exposurevesselsTest organisms that rapidly deplete energy reserves arefed when the test solutions are renewed and are maintained in ahealthier stateDisadvantagesRequire greater volume of effluent than nonrenewaltestsGenerally less chance of temporal variations in wastepropertiesSECTION HEALTH AND SAFETY GENERAL PRECAUTIONSEach
