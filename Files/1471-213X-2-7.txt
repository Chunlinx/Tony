                    Background        The adult cuticular surface of insects is covered with        hairs sensory bristles ridges scales and other        structures In most body regions individual cuticular        structures are aligned in the plane of the epithelium The        basis for the development of this planar or tissue polarity        has principally been studied in Drosophila              where it is under the control of the         frizzled          fz  pathway     Many Drosophila        epidermal cells produce cuticular hairs that are outgrowths        from the apical surface of pupal epidermal cells The        development of epidermal hairs has principally been studied        on the wing where each pupal cell produces a single        distally pointing hair The         fz pathway controls hair polarity by        directing the location for hair initiation     In a        wild type fly hairs are formed at the distal most vertex of        the wing cells and extend distally Mutations in         fz pathway genes result in altered        sites for hair initiation which results in altered hair        polarity and in some cases altered hair number            Sensory bristles are found in all regions of the adult        epidermis Bristles are polarized within the plane of the        epidermis and in most body region neighbouring bristles are        aligned in parallel and point in the same direction as        neighbouring hairs The         fz pathway controls bristle polarity        by regulating the orientation of the spindle for the first        differentiative division of the sensory organ precursor        cell     The ommatidia of the compound eye also display        a dramatic planar polarity that is under the control of the                fz pathway In this tissue the         fz pathway controls polarity by        regulating the RR cell fate decision            The arista is the terminal segment of the antenna and it        is comprised of a central core of epidermal cells some of        which elaborate a single lateral extension     The        laterals and the cells that form them share a number of        characteristics of both hairs and bristles The laterals        are longer than many bristles but thinner At the        ultrastructural level developing laterals resemble bristles        and not hairs     They contain a series of large        bundles of Factin that are juxtaposed to the plasma        membrane In addition microtubules are distributed        throughout the central region of the lateral The        developing laterals resemble hairs and not bristle in that        they are formed at the apical surface of epithelial cells        and they are not innervated        Mutations in the genes of the         fz pathway result in altered hair and        bristle polarity and in some cases large numbers of cells        that produce multiple hairs To determine if the         fz pathway played a role in arista        development we examined the aristae of various         fz pathway mutants      We found        that         multiple wing hairs          mwh  which results in an average of        almost  hairs per cell on the wing also resulted in the        formation of multipled and branched laterals However        unlike the situation on the wing where         mwh results in altered hair polarity        on the arista we did not see any evidence of altered        lateral polarity We also examined aristae from         inturned          in  and         fuzzy          fy  mutants On the wing mutations        in these genes result in altered hair polarity and in many        cells forming two or three hairs     On mutant aristae        we found that         in and         fy caused multipled and branched        laterals but as was the case for         mwh we did not see any evidence for        altered polarity We did not detect any mutant phenotype in        adult aristae of         fz          Van Gogh          Vang          dishevelled          dsh          starry night          stan  also known as          Flamingo          fmi  or         prickle          pk  mutants     It was        surprising that upstream members of the         fz pathway did not show a mutant        phenotype while downstream members did We therefore        examined the situation further In developing wild type        pupal aristae laterals formed near but not at the distal        edge of aristae central core cells     When we examined                fz dsh and         stan mutants we noted that lateral        initiation was no longer restricted to the distal region of        central core cells Although these laterals formed at an        unusual subcellular location this did not produce a        noticeable phenotype in the adult The altered location for        lateral initiation in         fz and other mutants was similar to        their phenotype in the wing     Prior to hair        initiation in wing cells Fz Dsh Fmi and Dgo accumulate on        the distal side of wing cells Stan and Dgo are also        thought to accumulate on the proximal side                To see if this could be the case for lateral        development we examined the distribution of Fz in        developing arista using a FzGFP encoding transgene gene        We found that FzGFP preferentially accumulated on the        distal side of arista central core cells much as it does in        wing cells In addition we found that this asymmetric        localization was lost in         dsh mutants but retained in         in and         fy mutants as is the case in wing        cells As is the case in wing cells the distal accumulation        of Fz did not appear to influence lateral development in an                in or         fy mutant Overall the data argue        that the         fz pathway functions in a similar but        modified way to regulate lateral morphogenesis as compared        to wing hair morphogenesis We suggest that the absence of        a noticeable adult phenotype in         fz aristae while there is a dramatic        phenotype on the wing is due to inherent differences in the        cell biology of the relevant cells                    Results                  The arista phenotype of inturned and fuzzy          On the wing mutations in           inturned            in  and           fuzzy            fy  result in both altered hair          polarity and in many cells forming more than one hair                 In the arista mutations in these genes do          not have an obvious polarity phenotype but they do result          in the production of multipled and split laterals Fig          C We found about two lateral ends per lateral          producing cell a wild type unbranched lateral has one          end per lateral producing cell Table  Most of these          cases were due to independent initiation events in the          same central core cell    or to a split near the          proximal end of the lateral    In phalloidin          stained preparations of           in and           fy mutant heads we saw that early          in lateral morphogenesis Factin accumulated over a          larger fraction of the distal part of the cell than in          wild type Fig I This wider distribution of Factin          typically resolved into two or occasionally more          actinfilled laterals Fig JK On occasion we saw          laterals in           fy and           in mutants that were branched          distally Fig K In a wild type arista the lateral          initiates close to but not at the distal most boundary          of the cell On average the lateral is located at  of          the way toward the distal edge of the cell Table  In           in and           fy mutants the proximal most          lateral was located about  of the way toward the          distal edge of the cell This was significantly different          from that in wild type Table  When we made a series          of timed observations of individual laterals           in pupae we found that most cells          formed multiple independent laterals at a similar time          We also saw examples where laterals split during          outgrowth Fig  The splitting was seen at a variety          of stages from early in lateral outgrowth to as much as           hours or more after lateral initiation We did not          detect any delay in lateral initiation or any notable          change in the rate of lateral elongation in these mutants              data not shown As split laterals extended          there was an increase both in the distance from the          proximal end of the lateral to the branchpoint Fig          BC and from the branchpoint to each of the distal          tips This is similar to what we have seen with other          mutations      That mutations in           in and           fy cause both independent lateral          initiations and the splitting of single laterals during          outgrowth was unexpected as the multiple wing hair          phenotype produced by these mutations has been          interpreted as an effect only on hair initiation              This result led us to reexamine           in and           fy adult wings and indeed we were          able to find small numbers of branched hairs The          presence of branched           fy hairs was reported previously              Thus the phenotypic difference between the effects          on laterals and hairs appears quantitative and not          qualitative          We next attempted to determine the critical time for           in function in lateral development          using temperature shift experiments with the temperature          sensitive allele           in II     On the wing this          allele results in a large phenotypic difference when          pupae grown at the restrictive versus permissive          temperatures We found that the phenotypic difference was          not so dramatic on the laterals as at the restrictive          condition approximately  of laterals were split or          multipled while at the permissive condition about           were split or multipled This difference was still large          enough to use for the shift experiments Lateral growth          takes place over more than  hours at C and more than           hours at C giving us a wide window for shift          experiments     In shift experiments we found that          the crucial time for           in function in lateral development          was around the time of lateral initiation  hours at          C and  hrs at C Fig  Notably temperature          shifts in either direction even shortly after the start          of lateral outgrowth had only minor effects on the          phenotype These results are similar to those previously          obtained on the wing     It is worth noting that           in laterals will sometimes split           hours or more after the end of the           in temperature sensitive period We          suggest that this is an example where the consequences of          a mutation are not manifested until some hours after the          time of action of the gene          On the wing single and double mutant combinations of           in and           fy result in a similar phenotype              This lack of additivity has been interpreted as          evidence that these genes function and are required in a          common process We compared the multipled lateral          phenotypes of           in and           fy single mutants and           fy in double mutants and found no          difference consistent with           in and           fy functioning in the same process          in lateral development Table  In the wing           in and           fy are epistatic to mutations in           fz            dishevelled            dsh            prickle            pk            Van Gogh            Vang  aka           strabismus  and           starry night            stan  aka           flamingo       This was also          the case in the arista Table                           The arista phenotype of mutiple wing hairs          In the wing           multiple wing hairs            mwh  results in similar polarity          disruptions and a stronger multiple hair cell phenotype          than           in or           fy                mwh aristae had almost  lateral          ends per cell Table  Fig D The laterals were also          substantially shorter than wild type  of normal          length Thus in the arista laterals as in wing hairs           mwh has a substantially stronger          phenotype than           in or           fy At early stages in           mwh lateral morphogenesis we saw          multiple locations within individual cells where Factin          accumulated Fig H At later stages these appeared as          multiple independent laterals produced by individual          cells Figure LM These conclusions were confirmed by          timelapse observations     data not shown In          addition we saw examples where a lateral split during          outgrowth     data not shown There was no          alteration in the time of lateral initiation in           mwh although we did see a decrease          in the rate of lateral elongation that was consistent          with the short final length of           mwh laterals     data not          shown The short length and slow growth may simply be a          consequence of the extreme multiple lateral phenotype as          laterals that were only slightly branched were of          relatively normal length In the wing all double mutant          combinations of           mwh and other           fz pathway genes result in a           mwh like phenotype     For the          lateral phenotype we found that           mwh fz double mutants resembled           mwh as is the case in the wing          Table  However           mwh in and           fy            mwh laterals produced an          intermediate phenotype in terms of the mean number of          lateral ends per cell Table  Thus the relationship          between           in and           fy and           mwh appears different in the wing          and arista presumably reflecting differences in the          genetic circuitry in these two tissues                          The arista phenotype of fz mutants          We did not see any obvious mutant phenotype in aristae          from           fz dsh pk Vang or           stan flies Fig B In the wing          mutations in           fz and these other           fz like genes result in hairs with          abnormal polarity due to a failure to restrict prehair          initiation to the distal most part of the cell              Only infrequently does this result in a cell forming more          than one hair When we examined the development of           fz mutant laterals by phalloidin          staining we found that lateral initiation was not as          restricted to the distal part of cells as is the case in          wild type Fig F Table  Rather laterals formed at          a wide range of locations along the proximal distal axis          of the extended central core cells For           fz            dsh Fig G and           stan data not shown the lateral          formed at about  of the way toward the distal edge of          the cell which was significantly different from that of          wild type This was slightly more distal than we saw for           in and           fy but not significantly so Table           For           pk and           Vang mutants the average location          for lateral initation was slightly less distal than in          wild type   vs  and this difference was only          marginally significant The position for lateral          initiation in           pk and           Vang was clearly different from          that of           fz                           Fz accumulates asymmetrically in arista          cells          The initiation of wing hairs in the vicinity of the          distal most vertex of wing cells is preceded by the          preferential accumulation of Fz protein along the distal          side of wing cells     To determine if the distal          initiation of laterals was also associated with the          preferential accumulation of Fz we examined aristae that          expressed FzGFP under the control of the           armadillo promoter This construct          is expressed at a low enough rate so that the subcellular          localization of the Fz protein is still preferentially          found along the distal edge of wing cells Strutt           We found that Fz protein also accumulated preferentially          along the distalproximal edges of arista central core          cells Fig  This could be detected both before and          during lateral outgrowth The ratio of the intensity of          GFP flourescence on the distal versus lateral sides of          the cells ranged from  to  in different aristae          preparations This is similar to the ratio for FzGFP          that we have seen in wing cells The emerging laterals          were found close to but not overlapping this region From          our experiments we could not distinguish between          preferential location along the distal edge proximal          edge or both Based on analogy with the wing situation we          suggest it at the distal edge of the cells In occasional          cells that bulged out from the central core this appeared          to be the case The distal accumulation of FzGFP could          be detected until late in lateral development At this          time the cells become highly elongated along the          proximaldistal axis and it becomes difficult to assess          what the distal edge is Fig           In the wing the accumulation of Fz at the distal edge          of the cell requires the function of           dsh     We examined aristae          from           dsh            armfzGFP pupae and found that the          preferential distal accumulation of Fz was lost Fig           The ratio of GFP fluorescence on the distal versus          laterals sides of cells ranged from    Thus as          in the wing the distal accumulation of Fz in arista cells          is dependent on           dsh function In the wing Dsh          accumulates preferentially along the distal edge of wing          cells      We found that DshGFP also accumulated          along the distal edge of arista cells Fig           In the wing the distal accumulation of Fz is not          dependent on the function of           in or           fy  although in           in and           fy mutants the distal accumulation          of Fz is no longer able to restrict hair formation to the          distal edge of the cell     We examined the          distribution of Fz in           armfzGFP in and           fy armfzGFP aristae The          preferential distal accumulation of Fz was still present          in these arista cells Fig  we obtained distal to          lateral edge ratios of    although the           in and           fy mutant lateral phenotype was          obvious Thus           fz            in and           fy appear to have a similar          relationship in the arista and wing          There are a number of striking similarities in the          morphogenesis of hairs laterals and bristles              Data presented here for laterals and previously for wing          hairs    show that the asymmetric accumulation of Fz          is prominent in these terminally differentiating cells          Given these observations we might expect that this would          also be true for bristles The bristle sense organ is a          multicellular structure with the cells organized in a          dimensional arrangement making it difficult to observe          Fz localization in all of these cells The socket cell          that surrounds the growing shaft remains in the plane of          the adult epidermis and is easy to observe in whole mount          preparations of pupal epidermis The socket cell is also          polarized in the same direction as the shaft as it is          higher on one side than the other We examined the          accumulation of FzGFP in differentiating socket cells          and found that it was asymmetrically distributed both          early and late in bristle differentiation Fig  In          most cells that we observed it appeared to accumulate on          both the proximal and distal dorsalventral etc edges          of the socket cells We cannot be certain from these          observations if it was accumulating in the socket cell or          in the neighboring epidermal cells The level of FzGFP          appeared higher than in typical epidermal cells          suggesting that we are looking at FzGFP present in the          socket cell The ratio of GFP fluorescence at high to low          regions was similar    to what we obtained for          wing and arista cells It was reported previously that          FmiStan protein accumulated to a higher level in the PI          cell that forms the bristle lineage     Previous          experiments have shown that Fz regulates orientation of          the spindle in the division of the PI cell of the bristle          sense organ lineage and it has been thought that this is          the way that           fz regulated bristle polarity               Our observations suggest that           fz may also play a later role in          specifying bristle polarity that is analogous to its role          in regulating hair and lateral development                            Discussion        In wing cells the distal assembly of the hair is        preceded by the preferential accumulation of Fz Dsh        FmiStan and Diego along the distal edge of the cell               This provides a cortical mark that is thought        to specify the proximaldistal axis of the cells In these        cells the region for hair initiation overlaps but is only        a small part of the region where these proteins accumulate        It is unclear how the cytoskeleton is activated in this        restricted region One possibility is that a Fz receptor        protein complex directly interacts with and activates        proteins that stimulate the cytoskeleton to produce a hair        Fig  In the arista we also see a preferential        accumulation of Fz protein at the distalproximal edges of        cells and this likely serves a similar function as a        cortical mark It is worth noting however that the        location for lateral outgrowth does not directly overlap        with the location for Fz accumulation Fig   Although        the lateral is formed in the distal region of the cell it        is not juxtaposed to the junctional complex or lateral cell        periphery where Fz accumulates Rather laterals in wild        type flies form on the apical surface of arista cells Fig             Thus in arista cells it is unlikely that there        is any direct connection between Fz receptor complex        proteins that accumulate distally and the actin        cytoskeleton of the laterals More likely in this cell type        the distal accumulation of Fz and other proteins activates        a signal transduction pathway that activates the        cytoskeleton through a diffusible signal Fig  The JNK        pathway which has been implicated in Fz signal        transduction in the eye is a candidate pathway to be        involved in this        We note that a        diffusible signal could be part of the mechanism that is        used to restrict hair initiation to a smaller part of wing        cells than the region where Fz accumulates        Based on the precedent from wing cells it is at first        glance surprising that an alteration in the site for        lateral initiation does not produce obvious phenotypic        consequences     Pupal wing cells are relatively        isotropic in terms of their shape in the planar direction        The assembly of the hair at the cell periphery puts it in        close proximity to the junctional complex perhaps allowing        for direct interactions between the cortical and hair        cytoskeletons     This could provide orientation        guidance for the growing hair In a         fz mutant where hair formation no        longer takes place at the cell periphery this guidance        would be lost Fig  In an         in mutant where hair formation takes        place at alternative locations on the cell periphery it        would be incorrect Fig  Lateral forming cells are        elongated in the proximal distal direction Fig  and        laterals grow out at a large angle to the apical surface of        the central core cells In this way wild type laterals        resemble         fz mutant wing cells     Thus        early in their development laterals are not close to the        junctional complex or the prominent cortical cytoskeleton        at the cell periphery and are unlikely to be getting any        orientation guidance in this way In a         fz mutant lateral the location along        the proximal distal axis of the cell is changed but there        is no disruption of a close connection to the cortical        cytoskeleton as there is in hair cells In the mutant there        is no change in the dorsalventral position for lateral        outgrowth or the angle of the outgrowth to the apical        surface In part this may be due to limitations inherent in        a relatively large lateral growing out of a long thin cell        It is also worth considering that the elongated shape of        the lateral forming cells becomes much more extreme as        development proceeds Fig      This brings the        laterals close to the cell edges that are parallel to the        proximal distal axis of the central core and the junctional        complexes at these edges could provide orientation        guidance        Previous studies on         in and         fy function in regulating wing hair        development have focused on their role in regulating the        site for hair initiation      Observations reported        in this paper show that multiple laterals associated with         in and         fy mutants can arise either from        independent initiation events or from the splitting of an        elongating lateral The splitting of laterals could be due        to a need for         in and         fy function during the outgrowth        process or to a need for         in and         fy function at initiation with the        consequences only being manifested at a later time We        carried out a set of temperature shift experiments to        distinguish between these possibilities These shift        experiments showed that the essential time for         in function in lateral development is        around the time of lateral initiation This is similar to        what we previously found for         in function in wing hair development            It is interesting that the consequences of a lack        of         in function in laterals are        manifested some hours after the end of the         in temperature sensitive period We        suggest that in an         in mutant there is a subtle defect in        a cytoskeletonorganizing center that promotes lateral        outgrowth The defect is not severe enough to block or        dramatically slow lateral outgrowth In some cells it leads        to the formation of multiple initiation sites and in others        to an unstable lateral that is subject to splitting A        similar phenomenon could explain the formation of        occasional branched wing hairs in         in fy and         mwh wings It could also explain        differences in the hair lateral and bristle phenotypes of         tricornered          trc  and         furry          fry  mutants      In such        mutants bristles and laterals are often branched In        contrast         trc and         fry wing cells have a very dramatic        multiple hair cells phenotype average more than  hairs        per cell The multiple hairs are found primarily in        clusters of independent hairs with only occasional branched        hairs We suggest that there is a common defect in         trc and         fry bristles laterals and hairs        Differences in the phenotypes would be due to inherent        differences in the sensitivity of these cell types to the        defective organizing centers The smaller hairs would be        more sensitive to the defects leading to spitting during        the initial stages of growth which would result in what        appears to be a cluster of independent hairs The larger        structures laterals and bristles could be less sensitive        so that the consequences of the abnormal organizing center        would only be manifested later in morphogenesis if at        all        Previous observations had indicated that the         fz pathway functioned in the        development of planar polarity in hairs bristles and        ommatidia        Consistent with much current        thinking on signal transduction pathways it has been        suggested that there is a core group of         fz pathway of genes that function        similarly in different cell types     Downstream genes        would function to interpret the signal from the core group        of genes in a cell type specific way As attractive as this        idea is a number of observations suggest that much of the         fz pathway is modified in cell type        specific ways For example the asymmetric accumulation of        FmiStan in wing cells is essential for marking the distal        edge of wing cells     However FmiStan does not        accumulate asymmetrically in sensory organ precursor cell        that gives rise to the bristle sense organ although the        orientation of the pI cell spindle is altered in         fmistan mutants     Our        observations on the arista suggest that the genetic        circuitry of the         fz pathway is modified in a different        way in this cell type The most notable differences were        the lack of a substantial phenotype in         pk and         Vang and that         mwh is not epistatic to         in and         fy as it the case on the wing                    Conclusions        In this paper we provide evidence that a modified        version of the         frizzled pathway regulates the        development of arista laterals As is the case for the wing        the asymmetrical accumulation of Fz protein appears to        produce a cortical mark that is used to control where the        cytoskeleton is activated to produce a lateral                    Materials and methods                  Fly strains          Fruit flies were grown on standard media Many of the          mutations were isolated in this lab and described          previously        Several were obtained from          the Drosophila stock center at Indiana University D          Strutt kindly provided flies carrying the           armfzGFP transgene    and J          Axelrod kindly provided flies carrying a           dshGFP transgene this construct          uses the endogenous           dsh promoter     Temperature          shift experiments were done as previously                              Cytological procedures          Standard techniques were used In most staining          experiments pupae were fixed in phosphate buffered saline          supplemented with  paraformaldehyde Actin staining was          done as described previously    using Alexa           phalloidin Molecular Probes For experiments where we          visualized GFP we made an effort to use the minimum          amount of fixation compatible with maintaining the          morphology of the aristae                          Microscopy          Confocal images were obtained using a BioRad confocal          microscope at the Keck Center for Biological Imaging at          the University of Virginia Other images were obtained          using a Spot digital camera National Diagnostics on a          Zeiss Axioskop microscope using bright field optics          Length measurements were made using either the software          provided with the Spot camera or by using the ruler tool          in Adobe Photoshop To measure the intensity of          GFPfluorescence we took maximal projections of optical          sections and used the Psion port of the NIH Image          software to analyze the data The tif images were          inverted and the intensity plotted along an  pixel line          drawn across the relevant cell boundary The background          was estimated by the lowest reading along the line and          this was subtracted from the highest reading to obtain an          intensity measurement The same procedure was done for a          line drawn along a low intensity cell border Multiple          cells were scored usually  from the same projection          averages obtained used to provide an intensity ratio          Microsoft Excel was used to analyze the data calculating          means standard deviation and plotting To measure the          location along the proximaldistal axes of arista cells          we took micrographs of actin stained aristae where the          lateral was small less than  the length of the cell          and measured the distance from the proximal to distal          sides of the cell We also measured the distance from the          proximal side to the distal edge of the base of the          growing lateral where it was connected to the central          core The ratio of these two values is used as a measure          of the location for lateral initiation                          Scoring of arista phenotypes          Adult aristae were mounted in Garys Magic Mountant          and examined under bright field microscope                          In vivoimaging of the arista laterals          Carefully aged pupae were washed and airdried In          early experiments they were then attached to standard          microscope slides with doublestick tape or to shallow          well slides using super glue In both preparations the          animals were placed with their ventral side up Pupal          cases were opened anteriorly At various time points they          were examined by microscope under bright field optics in          a drop of water using a water immersion objective           After observation water was removed from the slides and          the pupae were then kept in a humid chamber at C for          further development and observations Most pupae          tolerated the treatment reached the pharate adult stage          and were morphologically normal More recently we built a          chamber using rubber spacers double stick tape and a          coverslip The pupae were placed on the double stick          tape ventral side up and the pupal case opened A small          amount of  gelatin  glycerol was place on the          anterior end of the pupae and between the opened pupae          and the cover slip Although the optics are not quite as          good as with our earlier approaches the chamber approach          is less time consuming and can be used for automated time          lapse                          Statistical analysis          Excel was used in the quantitative analysis of          phenotypes We used ttest and Z test in different          experiments for comparing different genotypes                            Authors contributions        BH carried out the scanning EM studies many of the in
