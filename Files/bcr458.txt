                    Introduction        Marin County located north of San Francisco        California is distinguished among urban counties in the        United States by its relatively small population         residents by a median percapita income of more than         that of the nation     and by elevated rates of breast        cancer that were first reported in the early s            The media has since pronounced Marin County the breast        cancer capital of the world     and heightened        community concern has inspired grassroots and scientific        efforts to investigate reasons for the high incidence        Initial studies have suggested that elevated rates in white        women living in Marin County and the San Francisco Bay Area        SFBA are generally explained by the higher prevalence of        established breast cancer risk factors including higher        levels of education and income later age at first birth        and nulliparity      Our previous assessment of breast        cancer incidence trends in Marin County isolated the rate        elevation to women aged  years at diagnosis            Community and scientific concern over increasing incidence        rates has nevertheless remained high so detailed        surveillance of incidence and mortality rates has        continued        It has been estimated that only  of breast cancer        cases in the United States are explained by established        risk factors such as income reproductive factors and        family history     Distinctive breast cancer incidence        and mortality patterns in welldefined populations may        therefore inform etiologic understanding For this reason        and as part of ongoing regional cancer surveillance        efforts we analyzed the most recent breast cancer        incidence and mortality data available for Marin County and        compared these rates and trends with those from other areas        in California                    Materials and methods                  Cancer incidence and mortality data          We obtained cancer incidence and mortality data for          Marin County and other California counties from the          California Cancer Registry and the California Office of          Vital Statistics respectively Analyses were based on          new cases of invasive breast cancer            International Classification of          Diseases  Oncology  nd edition site codes           excluding histology codes  invasive          cases only and breast cancer deaths            International Classification of          Disease  th edition site codes CC during          the period  January  December  We excluded           in situ cancers from this analysis          because of ongoing controversy over the diagnosis and          malignant potential of these tumors     We          additionally limited the analyses to white nonHispanic          women because of the marked variation in breast cancer          incidence by raceethnicity and because of the small and          unstable numbers of cases and deaths            n  each year among          AfricanAmerican Hispanic and AsianPacific Islander          women in Marin County                          Rate calculation and statistical          considerations          Using population estimates obtained from the          California Department of Finance     we calculated          incidence and mortality rates for the individual years           as well as for the year period  for          three geographic areas Marin County the rest of the          SFBA Alameda Contra Costa San Francisco San Mateo          and Santa Clara counties and other urban counties in          California The urban counties which were defined as US          Census Bureaudesignated urban areas or as containing at          least one city of at least  residents included          Butte El Dorado Fresno Kern Los Angeles Madera          Merced Monterey Napa Orange Placer Riverside          Sacramento San Bernardino San Diego San Joaquin San          Luis Obispo Santa Barbara Santa Cruz Shasta Solano          Sonoma Stanislaus Sutter Tulare Ventura Yolo and          Yuba counties We excluded rural counties from the          comparison because of the consistent association between          urban residence and breast cancer     SEERStat          software    was used to compute the rates to age          adjust them to the year  US standard population to          produce the  confidence interval CI and to conduct          weighted linear regression to estimate average annual          percentage changes which were evaluated for statistical          significance with a twosided           P value of  The American Joint          Commission on Cancer  rdedition staging was used to          calculate stagespecific rates                            Results                  Incidence trends          Incidence rates of invasive breast cancer among white          women in Marin County show a distinctly increasing trend          over the past decade Fig  Linear regression showed          that breast cancer rates increased  in Marin County          between  and  but increased only  in the rest          of the SFBA and other urban counties in California The          annual rate of increase   CI  was on          average six times higher in Marin County than in          comparison areas Table  In addition there was a          significant  increase in incidence in Marin County          during the year period between   cases per            CI  and   cases per            CI           Our previous study of Marin County incidence trends          showed that between  and  rates increased at a          faster pace among women aged  years than among women          of other ages     The present analyses confirm and          update these observations and show that the large rate          increase between  and  was limited almost          entirely to women aged  years who represented about          onehalf of the breast cancer cases diagnosed in the          county Breast cancer incidence increased  between           and  among Marin County women aged  years          an average annual increase of  Table  Trends were          stable in women of similar age in other regions as well          as in women aged  and   years regardless of          region Fig  By  breast cancer rates in Marin          County women aged  years approached the magnitude of          those aged   years in other counties Fig                           Comparison of average annual incidence rates          By the end of the decade breast cancer rates          continued to be substantially higher in Marin County than          in other parts of California including other parts of          the SFBA Annual ageadjusted breast cancer incidence          rates for Marin County averaged over the five most recent          years for which we have data  exceeded by at          least  those from any single other urban county in          California and they were  higher than rates for other          SFBA counties and were  higher than rates for other          urban counties combined Table  Among women aged           years average incidence rates were  higher in Marin          County than in the rest of the SFBA and were  higher          than in other urban California counties          Nearly all of the excess in overall rates was for          earlystage stage Istage II disease for which Marin          County rates  cases per   CI           were  higher than those for the rest of the SFBA           cases per   CI  and were  higher          than those for other urban California counties  cases          per   CI  Rates of laterstage          stage IIIstage IV disease were not significantly          different in Marin County  cases per   CI           as compared with those in other areas SFBA           cases per   CI  other urban California          counties  cases per   CI                           Mortality trends          Despite the excess in earlystage tumors breast          cancer mortality rates have been decreasing more slowly          in Marin County than they have been in other parts of the          state Whereas breast cancer mortality declined          significantly at  per year in other parts of          California between  and  Marin County rates          decreased less than  per year this change was not          statistically significantly different from zero Table           Fiveyear average  breast cancer death          rates in Marin County women were  higher than those          rates observed for other parts of the SFBA and urban          California counties Table  Among women age           years mortality rates increased  per year in Marin          County while decreasing  per year in other SFBA and          urban California counties                            Discussion        Patterns of breast cancer incidence and mortality in        Marin County California have deviated markedly from those        observed in other parts of the state over the past decade        These findings demonstrate the public health burden of        breast cancer in this community but also have the        potential to serve as a source of hypothesis generation as        regards the association between higher socioeconomic status        and breast cancer Cancer incidence patterns in Marin        County have been informative in the past the soaring        incidence of endometrial cancer there in the s           was ultimately linked to the utilization of estrogen        therapy by postmenopausal women        The higher breast cancer incidence in Marin County has        been attributed to its unique and uniform sociodemographic        characteristics     which correspond to a higher        prevalence of women with known breast cancer risk factors        With a relatively small population for an urban county        Marin County was one of the wealthiest counties in the        United States in  with a median percapita income of        almost US about  higher than the state and        national medians     Marin County consistently ranks        among counties in the nation with the most highly educated        populations with at least  of adults having a        bachelors degree which is  higher than the national        rate in      It also has a higher percentage of        white nonHispanic residents  than surrounding        counties            In accordance with its high socioeconomic status Marin        County has higher proportions of women with other        established breast cancer risk factors including lower        parity    and later age at childbearing In   of        the live births to white women were to mothers aged         years and over in Marin County as compared with  in        California     In addition  of all women aged         years and  of all women aged  and over reported        using hormone replacement therapy as part of a community        health survey conducted in Marin County in  RRE        unpublished data  although comparable figures are not        available for the state Prehn and West using  census        data calculated breast cancer incidence rates for        aggregations of census block groups matched to Marin County        on characteristics associated with higher breast cancer        risk percentage white population urban status average        parity median household income percentage of persons with        a college degree percentage of persons with a        workingclass occupation and percentage of households        living below the poverty line and found rates in the        matched areas to be comparable with those in Marin County            In another study using interviewbased information        higher breast cancer incidence rates among white women in        the SFBA were also fully explained by the distribution of        parity age at first birth months of breastfeeding age        at menarche and age at menopause     Other previous        analyses of nationwide variation in breast cancer incidence        and mortality found most of it attributable to the        distribution of known breast cancer risk factors             It thus seems likely that a substantial part of the        excess incidence observed in Marin County is explained by a        higher concentration of women with a higher breast cancer        risk profile        The increasing incidence of breast cancer might be        explained by changes in the composition of the Marin County        population over the past decade Data from the US Census        Bureau show that Marin County had relatively high levels of        outmigration and had low levels of immigration during         compared with other parts of California            Examination of the agespecific population denominators        used in this analysis    shows that the proportion of        women aged  years which includes the leading edge of        the baby boomer cohort changed very little over the        decade in Marin County whereas this proportion increased        substantially in comparison areas This deviant pattern        could be explained by the outmigration from Marin County of        women aged  years and by the immigration of younger        women As realty data show that the median single family        home price surged to  by the year  making        Marin County one of the least affordable counties in the        nation     we speculate that women in the age group         years who may have had more children at younger ages        left the county over the decade while younger perhaps        professional women who did not have children or who        delayed childbearing immigrated to or stayed in the        county Some support for this phenomenon is provided by the        widening difference between Marin County and California in        the proportion of live births to white mothers aged         years and older as compared with those aged younger than         years ratio  in  and  in      The        numbers of women in Marin County with a high breast cancer        risk profile may thus have increased further over the        decade        We consider it doubtful that the observed trends are        strongly biased by inaccurate cancer registry or population        data The trends observed in the rates were also observed        in the case counts alone Although some of the observed        rate increases could be attributable to inaccuracy of the        intercensal population estimates particularly in the         age group systematic population undercounts would        presumably have produced similar increases in the incidence        of other cancers which we did not observe Furthermore        the California Department of Finance population estimate        for Marin County for the year   was less than         lower than the actual count performed by the US Census        in   Regardless of this incidence trends        will be reassessed when revised population estimates        benchmarked to the  census become available        Breast cancer incidence has been positively associated        with socioeconomic status across raceethnicity geography        and time         Recent data from California        show that rates for white women in the highest        socioeconomic quintile were  higher than the lowest        quintile and were  higher than the overall rate            However understanding of the biologic factors mediating        this association remains incomplete In a large national        interviewbased study conducted in the s adjustment        for reproductive patterns menopausal characteristics        hormone use alcohol consumption body mass index height        and family history did not entirely account for the        relations of income and education to breast cancer risk            To achieve a more contemporary understanding of the        contributions of established breast cancer risk factors it        would be helpful to reassess the roles of factors whose        prevalence has increased substantially over time including        delayed childbearing    and use of hormone replacement        therapy     In addition there are ongoing efforts in        Marin County to identify novel risk factors relevant to        this socioeconomic group These efforts include a        casecontrol study of adolescent exposures and experiences        for which data collection was recently completed and        projects to identify environmental exposures unique to this        group or to the county        It is uncertain to what extent the socioeconomic        gradient in breast cancer and the patterns we have        observed in Marin County might be explained by better        awareness of breast cancer by access to health care or by        utilization of screening programs Screening mammography        has been linked previously to breast cancer incidence        increases in the United States most notably the  annual        increase after its widespread adoption in the s            In the state of Hawaii mammography utilization accounted        for  of the geographic variation in overall breast        cancer incidence in  and for  of the variation        among women aged  years            At first glance our observations of incidence excesses        limited to earlystage cancers would suggest some relation        to regional differences in screening However these        patterns do not demonstrate other hallmarks of differential        lead time bias There was no evidence of a Marin County        deficit in laterstage cancers mortality rates remained        stable despite distinct mortality declines observed in        comparison regions and disparate agespecific incidence        trends were observed within the larger age group aged         years targeted by screening programs     In addition        mammography utilization data do not suggest substantially        elevated rates of screening among Marin County women A        community health survey conducted in Marin County in         found that  of women aged  years received a mammogram        in the past year this proportion is comparable with or        only slightly higher than those for other areas with lower        breast cancer rates RRE unpublished data  There        are no data available to explore other aspects of        mammographic screening in this population such as        increased frequency or better sensitivity due to higher        volume     The possibility of a real increase in small        tumors is however underscored by reports of significant        increases in small breast cancers among unscreened women in        Australia            United States cancer registries do not routinely collect        information about patient income and education making        assessment of cancer trends by socioeconomic status very        difficult     Our findings of rapidly increasing rates        of breast cancer in Marin County over the past decade        however along with evidence that high rates there are        explained by the sociodemography of the county            cause us to speculate whether breast cancer rates are        increasing similarly in other groups of highly educated and        affluent women nationwide While we can monitor incidence        rates in Marin County because it is a county we cannot        conduct ongoing annual cancer surveillance in        sociodemographically similar populations living in        subcounty regions because of a lack of appropriate        population estimates When detailed  Census data are        released for subcounty areas we will reexamine the        relations between sociodemographic characteristics and        geographic variation in breast cancer incidence If our        speculations are supported by these data then Marin County        statistics indeed serve as a canary in the gold mine as        regards breast cancer incidence in educated or affluent        women and they may also be prescient as regards breast        cancer mortality These observations should motivate us to        intensify our efforts to learn more about the relationship        between socioeconomic status and breast cancer                    Conclusion        The incidence of invasive breast cancer has increased        significantly in the affluent population of Marin County        California between  and  This large increase has        not been observed in other parts of California and appears        to be limited to earlystage disease among white women aged         years at diagnosis Despite the preponderance of        earlystage diagnoses in Marin County breast cancer        mortality rates remain unchanged declining somewhat        overall and increasing slightly among women aged         years These findings coupled with our understanding of        the unique sociodemographic characteristics of this region        have the potential to serve as a source of hypothesis        generation as regards the association between higher        socioeconomic status and breast cancer
