                this area Dallas   im born and raised here   well great so who you want to talk about baseballwise   may may as well talk about the Rangers   the Rangers all right   uh uh might as well   well do you think theyre going to get anyone in Florida   uh i hope i hope they do theyve uh i forgot whove they signed already   did they sign that shortstop that was they were talking about some shortstop they were going to try to get in the free agency draft or the free agency market   i dont know who they uh they they decide sign finally signed up Brian Downing i know   for oh okay   theyre theyre trying to get uh God whats his name whats that black mans name uh   is he with them now   yeah   Ruben   Ruben yeah they havent they still havent signed Ruben yet   yeah no i heard that theyre not going to talk to him till next weeks now they talked to his agents today and then theyre going to talk to them some more next week which i dont know whether thats good bad or indifferent because wish theyd get that out of the way and maybe he could do something else   yeah i know well they said they made a mistake they made a mistake by  uh not signing not signing him uh to a longer contract than what they did   i know why do you think they did that   oh they did did did it for economics but its coming back and its going to haunt them this year because he played such good ball the last couple of years   uhhuh   because now his uh his contracts say they i think they signed him for like three or four hundred thousand last year but now its going to cost them somewhere about uh eight hundred thousand to a million  is kind of   oh you dont think hell get that twenty seven million like that other guy just got        i dont think so i dont hell hes its its going to cost them though       its going to cost them but hes worth it   thats true well do you think they need to fire Bobby   Valentines a good guy i dont know if hes i dont know hes hes done a lot for the team   uhhuh   he really has i think hes an excellent i think hes an excellent coach hes probably one of the best ones that theyve had just because hes more consistent   uhhuh   hes more consistent than any other coach that weve had and had there in a long time and i i think hell do some good he just needs a they just need to put together a good pitching staff and i think theyll go pretty good   not have so many injuries   yeah that was thats what killed them last year i went to a few went to a few of their games and it just uh the pitching was okay but it was   i know   it was inconsistent   are you comfortable that Bobby Witt will be back or is he   uh   ever going to develop into a super pitcher   uh i dont think he is       i dont think he is     what about Kevin Brown   Kevin Brown uh he might he might he still hes still got a little learning to do   yeah i thought maybe he would but i was kind of disappointed last year   yeah i was disappointed the whole season so  they they they started out i mean if they would have continued they went off that fourteen game losing streak or winning streak then they kind of hit the dumps there for a while   well they yeah yeah but then all their pitchers were hurt so that that really hurts when you cant when all of the pitchers get hurt like that so   yeah thats true you think theyre going to do anything this year   i dont know i uh uh i think they need a another arm and im still not sure that that new third baseman Dean Palmer is as good as they think hes going to be   i think they made a mistake they made a mistake trading Buechele uh   but well i dont think they uh think they knew they couldnt afford him and Ruben and they decided to go with Ruben because he   yeah thats probably true but uh you know you got to you got to have more not one persons going to make the team   yeah but theyre not willing to pay big bucks it doesnt seem i think theyll have an exciting team last next next year and i just you know if they dont have any injuries but   yeah   uh Kansas City you know just signed a big time player so theyre theyre tough at signing all those people they got uh Joiner Wally Joiner from California so   oh yeah   that should help their team   yeah it sounds like you keep up on baseball pretty well   no i have one of those uh minds that remembers trivia thats of completely useless   that what useless trivia     yeah i mean something important i cant remember but something about baseball or football or something that really doesnt mean anything i can remember its one of those weird things i dont know why you know and i cant find my car keys then but i can remember you know something that about sports thats not even important   remember remember who Kansas City signed but you cant find your car keys   thats right or my glasses  yeah i know and and why why do i remember sports its just one of those things i dont know why that if i can hear it on the radio and it just sinks in and   that thats great well thats great ive never ive never had a decent conversation with a woman about baseball   well well thats thats a yeah oh thats thats embarrassing almost but no i could probably name them almost the starting lineup for the Rangers   until until now
