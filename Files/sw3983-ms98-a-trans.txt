                okay um what type of magazines do you have   we take several at home i i take um Skiing Magazine and i take uh Discover Magazine and also uh CD and Stereo Review   uhhuh   and National Geographic i think   oh thats a   and Boys Life   oh good thats a good one id like to get  um so i take it that you like to ski do you um do you um receive a lot of information on skiing through the Skiing Magazine   i presume that i do uh i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because i do get things from ski associations and things   uhhuh oh   uh at during the year   oh uh and do you receive discounts and things like that do you think or   uh not so much that i uh more likely to see those at a ski show or something but um  i just enjoy reading about the resorts and   oh   where you can go and and new equipment thats come out and so forth some fashions are always in there too     oh umhum so with this vacation youre taking did you receive the information from your skiing magazine   probably not uh we already knew we wanted to take one and we just started looking around   oh   i may have referred to a couple of them but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information and picked up a lot of brochures   oh hm   and just decided to go to Crested Butte we hadnt been there before   um that sounds nice   its kind of away from the crowd thats why we chose that one its supposedly low lift lines but i havent skied Utah yet but i want to   uhhuh oh huh thats oh well you need to come out   like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those i understand Deer Valley is nice too   uhhuh Deer Valley uhhuh yeah they are its wonderful snow   well how about you what what magazines do you have at home   uh i am currently taking Decorative Woodworking and uh Country Living and lets see we do have National Geographic and then we have some church magazines but i really enjoy the Decorative Woodworking im heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that so the Decorative Woodworking has just been a great great help   oh okay does it have uh articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth   umhum uhhuh they do have uh mostly they have the the ads on the equipment but the whole magazine is just filled with uh pictures and projects that you can make yourself and then it has all of the patterns and the instructions that you would need to make a wood project and and then how to paint it with the tole paintings and so its really a fun one i like that   well thats good its good to get use out of one   uhhuh   im not sure that um in the case of National Geographic i mean i read it but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time but then eventually therell be a school project or something   umhum   where my son will need to refer back through forty eight back issues to find you know France or something or whatever it is hes looking for   uhhuh  yeah yes ive ive noticed that too but they have been nice to have around every once in a while they come in handy   i used to take Smithsonian too and i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it you get so many coming in and     hm oh uhhuh oh   by the time the next round comes in im still not through reading the first round   oh that   uh because oh Scientific American comes to our house too i forgot thats mostly my sons but he but i do read it too and so   oh uhhuh hm well that sounds   and he takes Games Magazines too Games Magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve   uhhuh oh   you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that and he likes to to try that and so   umhum   he does but  does get to be a lot of paper though after a while  if you dont keep them weeded out they almost take over   uhhuh   they do they can do that i found that theyve been fun for my little girls theyre five and four years old and they like to go through and   oh yeah theyre just kind of getting started now with there   uhhuh  they like to cut the pictures out and paste them on and so weve found good use for those   mine is a senior in high school so hes were kind of at the end of that trail youre just sort of beginning to think about first grade   oh oh uhhuh  yeah its fun well i do have a boy in junior high too so   oh okay so youve got a little bit of a gap there between the little ones   so were kind of running the gamut  yeah but they do it
