                                  Dont Laugh at Me Argentina            Argentina used to be a place of legendary politicalirresponsibility where generals in funny hats declared war on MargaretThatcher and populist politicians who promised paradise consistently deliveredhyperinflation instead But over the past  years President Carlos Menem hassteadily turned the countrys reputation around Inflation has been eliminatedwith the peso securely pegged to the dollar An absurdly inefficient system ofprotected markets and moneylosing public corporations has been liberalized andprivatized producing a fair bit of unemployment but a huge surge inproductivity And as recently as five or six months ago the country was thedarling of the business press praised for its success in riding out theworlds financial storms            As usual however goodpress was the sign that things were about to take a turn for the worse For avariety of reasons including the devaluation in neighboring Brazil Argentinahas been sliding into a moderately severe recession and with it a growingbudget deficit just as a presidential election approaches And in apparentdesperation over his lag in the polls Eduardo Duhalde the Peronistcandidatethe candidate in other words of Menems party which broughtArgentina its unaccustomed stabilitystartled everyone by announcing hisintention to discuss possible debt relief for Argentina Not with the banksmind you but with the pope The pope has recently joined the call for debtforgiveness for poor nations but he was surely talking about Fourth Worldeconomies such as Mozambique not relatively welloff places such asArgentina            You have to admit that it is pretty funny Surely the MontyPython cast is about to leap into view shouting Nobody expects theSpanish Inquisition But somehow the markets didnt appreciate the humor TheBuenos Aires stock market plunged and the interest rate on Argentine bondssoared            The odds are that thiswhole affair will soon blow over But even assuming that the peso holds andthat things dont fall apart there is still a serious lesson in Argentinascurrent travailsnamely that you can scratch one more supposed economicpanacea off your list For Argentina has been the role model for those whobelieve that a credibly stable currency is all you need to promote prosperityAnd its troublesespecially the contrast with the unexpectedly good news fromBrazilare therefore a reminder that as John Maynard Keynes pointed out wayback in the s a strong currency and a strong economy are by no means thesame thing            Now Argentina does by law the socalled convertibilitylaw have an undeniably strong currency A peso is worth a US dollar andthat promise is made credible by the legal requirement that every peso incirculation be backed by a dollars worth of foreign exchange reserves Inother words short of actually abandoning its own currency in favor of the USdollara measure that has been discussed quite a bit latelyArgentina hasdone everything possible to make that currency credible and secure Thiscurrency board system was introduced in  when hyperinflation was arecent memory and most people expected it to return in due course and you canmake a reasonable case that Argentina should stick with its currency board forsome time to come Domingo Cavallo who as finance minister was the architectof the board suggested a few months back that it should endure for a decade orso But you can no longer brush off the argument that the system is a sort ofeconomic straitjacket one that is becoming increasingly onerous            The problem you see isthat the same rules that prevent Argentina from printing money for badreasonsto pay for populist schemes or foolish warsalso prevent it fromprinting money for good reasons such as fighting recessions or rescuing thefinancial system Argentina came very close to financial collapse in  whenit turned out that the convertibility law left no leeway to rush cash totroubled banks It has since established various safety nets to prevent arepeat of that crisis but some observers doubt whether those nets are reallystrong enough And now the country faces what is basically a gardenvarietyrecession the sort of thing that happens to every economy now and thenexceptthat unlike the United States or even a similarsized First World country suchas Australia it cannot try to cushion the slump by lowering interest rates andpushing more money into the system            Now these problems with a rigidly fixed exchange rate arenot news But for a while managed to convince themselves that they werentsignificant They argued that as long as governments themselves followed stablepoliciesand as long as the economy was sufficiently flexible theallpurpose answer to economic difficultiesthere would be few seriousrecessions            But it turns out thathistory does not stop just because the currency is stable And faced with apolitically inconvenient recession the Peronists find that there is nothingthey can do They cannot print money They cannot even borrow money for someemploymentgenerating public spending because fiscal indiscipline wouldundermine the pesos hardwon credibility You can understand why Duhalde mightbe tempted to appeal to a higher authority            Of course Argentinas economic team still believes thatits system is better than the alternatives The more sensible advocates ofcurrency boards and if necessary dollarization have always based their viewsless on hope than on fearfear that any attempt to fight a recession bydevaluing would lead instead to a surge in inflation and a financial collapseBut as it turns out their fears may have been almost as overstated as theirhopes When Brazilwhose economic history is nearly as dismal asArgentinasfinally devalued in January the predicted hyperinflation neverarrived and neither did the financial meltdown Indeed it is starting to lookas if the collapse of the real was just what the doctor ordered            The serious lesson of the antics in Argentinathen is that the big issues of monetary economicsfixed vs flexible exchangerates whether countries should have independent currencies at allare stillwide open Its an eternal controversy and not even the pope can resolveit
