                    Background        Serial analysis of gene expression SAGE has been used        to profile mRNA levels in a variety of organisms and        systems         Recently several modifications        have been made to the protocol to create a protocol        referred to as microSAGE         which allows the        generation of SAGE libraries from small quantities of        starting material as little as  cells or  g total        RNA These modifications include the direct binding of mRNA        to magnetic oligodT beads before the reverse        transcription step and a great reduction in the quantity        of linkers used to generate ditags While it has been shown        that conventional SAGE is representative and accurate            the same has not been clearly shown for microSAGE        Moreover the extent to which data generated by either SAGE        or microSAGE are reproducible in the sense of giving        identical tag representation from duplicate samples has        not been thoroughly addressed Given the time and expense        involved in constructing and sequencing SAGE libraries        concerns about how reproducible SAGE data are in general        as well as how representive and accurate microSAGE data are        in particular may deter potential users from pursuing this        approach        We have addressed these questions by constructing and        analyzing a series of microSAGE libraries We made        libraries from the same mRNA samples to examine the        variability due to library construction and made        sublibraries from identical pools of ditags to examine the        variability due to the last steps in SAGE library        construction as well as due to sampling We have also made        and analyzed libraries from tissue obtained from both        agematched and nonagematched individuals to examine the        variability due to tissue preparation as well as individual        differences in gene expression We found that microSAGE        data as previously shown for conventional SAGE data            are highly accurate in the sense that they reflect known        tissue and developmental geneexpression profiles We found        that tag distribution is virtually identical in samples        constructed from either identical mRNA samples or ditag        ligation reactions However we found large variations in        tag distributions between both agematched and        nonagematched human peripheral retinal libraries We even        saw a relatively large variation in tag distributions        between libraries made from tissue pooled from small        numbers of individual neonatal mice a fact that may        reflect developmental asynchrony as well as baseline        individual variation in gene expression This fact has        implications for any expressionprofiling approach and        suggests that in order to average out individual variations        in gene expression many different samples of a tissue of        interest will have to be examined                    Results                  MicroSAGE data are representative and          accurate          To determine whether microSAGE data are          representative we conducted a virtual Rot analysis A          virtual Rot analysis much like a Rot analysis generated          by measurement of mRNA reassociation kinetics examines          the relative fraction of total mRNA made up of          transcripts of high medium or low abundance It is          constructed from SAGE data by cumulatively plotting the          total fraction of all tags represented by tags of a given          abundance level Virtual Rot analyses of adult mouse          whole retina and adult hypothalamus showed a distribution          that closely reflects an actual Rot analysis of mouse          brain RNA Figure abc              To determine whether microSAGE data can provide an          accurate measure of mRNA abundance  that is give tag          levels that match levels of mRNAs for which abundance          levels have previously been measured  we examined our          adult mouse retinal library for tags corresponding to          several such mRNAs Although no absolute quantification          of mRNAs in mouse retina has been made measurement of          rhodopsin betatubulin and interphotoreceptor          retinolbinding protein IRBP mRNAs in adult rat retina          indicate that these represent   and           of total RNA respectively     These          figures are based on the observation that mRNA consists          of roughly  of total RNA in both rat and mouse retina          SB and CLC unpublished work In the mouse we          found that rhodopsin represented  betatubulin           and IRBP  of total SAGE tags values that on          the whole approximate levels reported for rat The slight          discrepancy in betatubulin levels between rat and mouse          may reflect species variability in geneexpression          levels or the failure to identify all alternative           ends of the betatubulin message by microSAGE          Additional analyses to determine the accuracy of          microSAGE data were carried out by examining a series of          libraries from mouse retina and hypothalamus We have          constructed SAGE libraries from mouse hypothalamus total          wildtype mouse retina at day intervals from embryonic          day E  through to postnatal day P  P          wildtype mice along with littermates mutant for the           crx gene which encodes a Paired          type homeodomain transcription factor that directly          regulates transcription of many photoreceptorenriched          genes adult mouse retina and microdissected outer          nuclear layer which consists entirely of rod and cone          photoreceptors     We examined this very large          dataset for expression of genes known to be photoreceptor          specific Figure  We found that photoreceptorspecific          genes typically showing high retinaspecific expression          that began around one week after birth coinciding          exactly with the previously reported increase in          expression of rhodopsin and other rodspecific genes                We typically saw higher expression of          photoreceptorspecific genes in microSAGE libraries made          from microdissected outer nuclear layer  rods versus           rods for whole retina and in many cases higher          expression in P           crx samples relative to P           crx samples These observations          accurately reflect the known expression pattern of          rodspecific genes     Examining the temporal          dataset for genes that are known to be selectively          expressed in retinal progenitor cells Figure  we          found that high expression persisted until P followed          by a rapid drop with expression barely detectable in the          adult These data correlate well with the time course of          mitosis within the developing retina                               Cumulative distributions of pvalues indicate the          differences among microSAGE libraries          One way to measure the significance of the differences          between libraries is to see the cumulative distribution          function of the           p values If the difference          between two libraries is large we would see a large          number of SAGE tags with small           p values for that pair compared          to a pair in which the only source of variation is          experimental variability in microSAGE library          construction The           p values we compute are the          probability of observing the different tag counts for          each gene when there is no differential expression          Although comparing the cumulative distributions does not          match the libraries on a genebygene basis it gives an          overall picture of the qualitative differences          Cumulative           p value distributions for all          libraries considered in this study are plotted in Figure           We investigated a variety of statistical methods of          calculating           p values for differences in SAGE          tag distribution in addition to the Monte Carlo analysis          program included in the SAGE analysis software These          included a test for equality of proportions equivalent          to the chisquare test modeling the sampling of tags          using the Poisson distribution Fishers exact test and          a Bayesian model We found that all methods gave similar          results for the range of           p values considered here see          Materials and methods for a more complete discussion of          these comparisons                          Visualization of the data in rotated coordinates          reveals the relationship between average count and fold          changes          We find it convenient to view the data in a log scale          in rotated coordinates going from the original          coordinates            x            y  to the new coordinate system          log                       xy  log                       y            x  This transformation          corresponds to a degree rotation and a linear          stretching of the logscaled data log                       x  log                       y  This type of plot has been          popular for microarray data with the           x  and           y axes corresponding to the mean          intensity of the signals and their fold ratio          respectively up to scaling constants      For tag          counts the axes become the sum of the log counts and the          fold change respectively with no rescaling necessary          This makes it easier to visualize the data with          horizontal lines rather than diagonal lines corresponding          to fold changes We can easily identify those genes with          large fold changes and see the relationship between the          average count and the fold change We note that although          it is advantageous to work in a log scale for the          foldchange interpretation it means that those genes          with tag count of zero in either library are deleted from          the picture Another way of viewing the data is to plot          differences in the two counts rather than their fold          ratios as a function of the mean log count Both ways          contain the same information and one can be derived from          the other          To gauge the baseline variability arising from library          construction in the microSAGE process we consider the          two libraries made from the same mRNA sample            crxA versus           crxB  In Figure c we plot the          data along with a confidence band corresponding to two          standard deviations away from the center at each average          log count This band was computed using a locally          weighted smoothing technique based on the standard          deviations in the neighborhood of each point As we          expect     the fold changes due to noise are higher          at lower tag counts This confidence band can serve as a          rough measure of the variability in the system due to          experimental procedures The same confidence band from          this comparison is superimposed on Figure          abcdefghito see how the variability present in          comparisons of different libraries compares to variation          seen in libraries made from the same starting material          See the additional data files for a full list of tag          counts in each of the SAGE library comparisons in the          Results section                          MicroSAGE data are highly reproducible          To examine microSAGE data for reproducibility several          analyses were carried out As a baseline gauge of          variability in tag sampling we compared the collection          of tags comprising the first  tags obtained from          the microdissected outer nuclear layer library to the          collection of tags comprising the second  tags          obtained from this library A scatter plot of tag          abundance showed a correlation coefficient of  when          all tags were considered or  when only tags present          less than  times in total in both libraries were          examined Table  A plot of cumulative observed           p values of tag differences in the          samples normalized to total tag number showed no increase          of observed variance over expected variance Figure           and no highabundance tags fell outside the confidence          band of two standard deviations plotted for comparisons          of libraries made from identical starting material          Figure a P retinal libraries made from the same          ditag ligation but different largescale PCR          preparations showed a correlation coefficient of           when all tags were considered little difference between          observed and expected           p values of variance Figure           and showed relatively little difference between abundant          tags Figure b Two libraries made from the same          posnatal day            crx mRNA samples that is the          RNA sample was divided into two tubes at the onset of the          reversetranscription step showed a correlation          coefficient of  showed very little difference          between observed and chance cumulative           p values of variance Figure           and showed little difference between abundant tags          Figure c These data show that microSAGE data are          highly reproducible when identical starting material is          used to generate libraries see Table for a full list of          libraries and comparisons Although the amount of          starting material used to generate each of the libraries          varied somewhat we did not find any substantial changes          in the fraction of duplicate ditags found in each          library which we have found to be more or less constant          approximately  when more than  g total RNA is used          SB and CLC data not shown          The correlation coefficients particularly for the          selfself comparison ONL versus ONL when only tags          present less than  times in total were considered may          seem somewhat low compared to correlation coefficients          computed for microarray data       However any          digital geneexpression dataset shows a certain amount of          noise due simply to sampling variability particularly          for lowerabundance transcripts     Even if two tags          are actually found at identical levels in two libraries          the observed values of those tags will show a Poisson          distribution about the actual values thus resulting in a          lower observed correlation coefficient This is          particularly true for lowerabundance transcripts and is          clearly seen in the substantially lower correlation          coefficients that are observed when very highabundant          transcripts are excluded from analysis see Table           Multiple replicate experiments which are typically          carried out in microarray studies might filter out some          of this noise but such replicates are not feasible given          the expense and time required to generate microSAGE data          In any case the absolute           r values are not as important as          the relative changes in the correlation coefficients          observed as a result of experimental or sample          variability when considering the data presented here                          MicroSAGE data show pronounced differences in gene          expression between age and sexmatched samples          As the above data indicate that the microSAGE protocol          does not introduce differences in libraries made from          identical starting material it is possible to interpret          the geneexpression differences that might be found among          individuals To begin to probe such individual          variations we analyzed libraries from individual human          retinal samples and from genotypically identical mice          from the same litter and genotypically identical mice          raised in different animal facilities MicroSAGE          libraries generated from freshly dissected peripheral          retina from similarly aged adult male humans gave a          correlation coefficient of  when all tags were          considered a substantial difference between observed and          chance           p values of variance between the          samples Figure  and many tags lie outside the          confidence band plotted for comparisons of libraries made          from identical starting material Figure d These          differences were substantially similar to differences in          expression seen between peripheral retinal libraries          obtained from a yearold and an yearold          individual which showed a correlation coefficient of           when all tags were considered a large difference          between observed and expected           p values of variance Figure           and large number of differences in highabundance tags          Figure e          Retinas from one P mouse litter were used to          generate two SAGE libraries with retinas from three P          littermates combined to generate one library PA and          three different P littermates combined to make another          PB Many differences in gene expression were          observed and an overall correlation coefficient of           was seen when all tags were considered Figures  f          Some of these differences appear to be in known          rodspecific genes and may reflect developmental          asynchrony as this is the time at which highlevel          expression of rodspecific genes is first observed          although most of the observed differences do not appear          to be found in genes that show dramatic variation in          expression through development We also examined two          hypothalamus libraries each constructed from agematched          male mice of the same strain obtained from animals          raised in different facilities These samples showed a          correlation coefficient of  when all tags were          considered or  when highly abundant tags were          excluded a high value for cumulative           p value differences Figure           and large numbers of tag differences Figure g          suggesting that pronounced variation in gene expression          is found even in genetically identical age and          sexmatched individuals housed in similar laboratory          environments          To understand the significance of these individual          differences we also compared disparate tissues We          compared two CNS tissues the adult retina and          hypothalamus which showed a correlation coefficient of           when all tags were considered or  when highly          abundant tags were excluded Figure h We also compared          a CNS tissue and a nonCNS tissue adult retina and T          fibroblasts which showed a correlation coefficient of           when all tags were considered or  when highly          abundant tags were excluded Figure i Examination of          the           p value plots Figure  reveals          many more tags that differ at low           p values in the CNS and nonCNS          tissue comparison than in the comparison of the two CNS          tissues Likewise plots of           p value differences versus tag          abundance Figure hi show substantially more          variability in the CNS versus peripheral tissue          comparison See additional data files for a full list of          tag counts in each of the SAGE library comparisons          discussed here                            Discussion                  MicroSAGE is highly representative reproducible          and accurate          We found that tag abundance data measured by microSAGE          reliably reflect mRNA abundance profiles despite the          fact that nearly fold less starting mRNA was used          here than is used to construct libraries in conventional          SAGE Tag distribution as determined by microSAGE closely          mirrors profiles seen by Rot analysis of brain tissue          Likewise tag abundance levels in libraries made from          identical mRNA samples and ditag ligations showed very          high similarity The fact that the tag abundance levels          differ slightly more in the libraries made from the same          ditag ligation than in those made from the same mRNA          sample may reflect a small amount of denaturation of          ATrich ditags during storage of the ligation reaction          as has been previously reported     Overall          microSAGE passes all the tests for representativity          reproducibility and accuracy used previously for          conventional SAGE                              Differences in gene expression were observed among          samples of the same tissues from different          individuals          The high reliability of microSAGE data revealed in          these analyses allows us to report the first          comprehensive profiles of levels of difference in gene          expression observed among tissues obtained from age and          sexmatched individuals The variability among the          samples observed does not appear to be due to          experimental variability in library construction Thus          it is due either to differences in the processing of the          tissues used to generate the libraries  in variations in          mRNA stability between tissue collection and mRNA          purification or in heterogeneous tissue dissection  or          to real variations in gene expression among          individuals          Although no studies to our knowledge have addressed          the question directly the limited body of data on          expression profiling of age and sexmatched humans          generally reports significant variation in gene          expression among individuals       although          little of these data are publicly available On the other          hand the literature on interindividual variation in          gene expression in inbred mice is both limited and          somewhat inconsistent While many studies have examined          expression in inbred mice the extent of variation in          gene expression in age and sexmatched individuals is          rarely addressed Published microarray experiments using          inbred mice have been typically conducted using pooled          samples from anywhere from     to              individuals Likewise for other methods of          geneexpression profiling such as differential display          and its variations    or SAGE     most          previously published work has either been focused on          samples from large numbers of pooled individuals or has          considered individual mice that were not strain age or          sex matched          Our results agree quite well with several recent          reports in which interindividual variation in gene          expression is explicitly examined A recent study          reported a high degree of variation in RNA levels in rat          hippocampus taken from different animals A large          fraction of candidate genes tested by quantitative          reverse transcription PCR RTPCR were found to vary          significantly even among individuals from inbred strains              Another study reported analysis of          interindividual variations in gene expression in liver          testis and kidney of male CB mice using a spot          microarray This study found that  liver           testes and  kidney of all genes differed between          individuals at           p       The data from          kidney compare fairly well with our data in Figure for          littermatelittermate variation  of SAGE tags          different at           p   after subtracting the           of tags different at           p   in the ONL versus ONL          sampling control or even humanhuman variation  of          SAGE tags different at           p   following subtraction of          sampling variation Because our libraries are all          derived from neural tissue our roughly twofold higher          variability may reflect greater experiencedependent          plasticity in the CNS Several other microarray studies          of inbred mice while not specifically reporting          interindividual changes in expression nonetheless          reported considerable differences in both brain and          peripheral tissues among different individuals                        There are however several published microarray          experiments in which although individual variation in          gene expression was not explicitly addressed variation          in gene expression in age and sexmatched individual          mice or pooled samples of three or fewer mice was          measured and found to be relatively small                 These include data from both peripheral tissue and          brain that reported           r values for individual mice at          around       and one publicly available          dataset of interindividual comparisons of CNS tissues              We analyzed this dataset and found it to have          correlation coefficients in the  range SB          WPK and CLC data not shown On the face of it          this seems at odds with our and other groups data          demonstrating considerable variation in gene expression           our           r values being in the           range for the developing retina and hypothalamus          comparisons None of these published data was from the          hypothalamus or developing retina so it is possible that          the samples we analyzed show greater interindividual          variability However this sort of direct comparison          between expression profiling methods may not be          appropriate Expression changes observed in microarray          experiments can in principle and in the hands of some          investigators accurately reflect expressionlevel          changes observed by northern or quantitative RTPCR data              However other investigators including          ourselves have found that both oligonucleotide and cDNA          microarray consistently underestimate true fold changes          in mRNA levels as measured by northern or RTPCR               This is most probably due to background hybridization          to the array and signal normalization and is not an          issue for digitalexpression profiling approaches such as          SAGE Underestimating differences in mRNA levels will          give rise to higher observed           r values While we cannot be sure          that this was the case for the studies mentioned above          given the variation in microarray hybridization and          scanning protocols among different investigators it          remains a distinct possibility This concern together          with other recent studies that raise questions about the          ability to accurately perform crossplatform comparisons          of geneexpression datasets      prevents us from          drawing firm conclusions about the true extent of          interindividual differences from the published          microarray data It will require SAGE and microarray          analysis of identical starting material coupled with          northern or RTPCR verification of genes that show          interindividual variation by either or both methods to          gauge exactly how accurately either method estimates          interindividual differences in gene expression This          however is beyond the scope of the current study                          Heterogeneous dissection cannot account for most of          the interindividual differences observed          The observed differences among microSAGE libraries          made from identical tissue from different individuals          could have resulted from heterogeneous tissue dissection          We addressed this question for our retinal samples          Because our P mouse retina libraries were made from          total retina stripped of surrounding tissues such as          lens and retinal pigment epithelium we determined          whether tags corresponding to genes highly expressed in          those tissues such as crystallins RPE RGRlike          opsin were found in these libraries and determined that          they were not expressed in either library except          occasionally at the single tag level SB and CLC          data not shown Moreover interindividual variation in          celltype composition among murine retinas appears to be          minimal     and thus variable ratios of cell types          in dissected retinas does not appear to account for the          observed variation          Rods represent a greater fraction of cells in the          periphery of the human retina while cones and ganglion          cells represent a greater fraction of cells near the          center Observed differences in tag levels between the          human peripheral retina libraries could be reflecting          small differences in the radial distance from the fovea          of the dissected region We found however that although          a number of the tags that differ by           p   between the yearold          and yearold individuals corresponded to known          rodenriched genes the direction of change was not          consistent between the two samples Although more tags          corresponding to known rodenriched genes were at a          higher level in the library from the yearold          individual many other rodenriched genes were more          highly represented in the library from the yearold          individual One of the tags that was higher in the          yearold individual corresponded to a known          ganglioncellspecific gene whereas none of the tags          that were more highly expressed in the yearold          individual corresponded to ganglioncellspecific genes          see Table for a summary of this data Moreover when          compared to data from our previously published work          analyzing genes that show either peripheral or foveal          enrichment in libraries taken from the same individual at                    p       we likewise          found no consistent pattern in the tags that differed          between the yearold and yearold peripheral          retinas Table           It is more difficult to rule out heterogeneous          dissection as a variable in the differences seen in the          hypothalamus libraries particularly as tissue          dissections were carried out by different investigators          Unlike in the retina we lack good markers that are both          highly expressed in adjacent tissues and excluded from          the hypothalamus and are thus unable to directly          evaluate our hypothalamic libraries for contamination          The great majority of differences observed however seem          to represent differences in very broadly expressed          proteins particularly ribosomal and mitochondrial          proteins SB and CLC data not shown suggesting          that heterogeneous dissection is unlikely to account for          most of the differences observed However we cannot rule          out the possibility that some smaller fraction of the          differences is due to heterogeneous dissection of the          starting material for the two libraries                          RNA instability following tissue dissection does          not account for most of the interindividual differences          observed          While major differences in gene expression were          observed in libraries generated from different          individuals some of the samples used to generate these          libraries differ in their storage conditions before          processing The interval between enucleation and freezing          was  minutes for the yearold and yearold          retinas whereas the yearold retina was kept at room          temperature for  hours and then processed for RNA          extraction The tissue used to make the two P mouse          libraries was harvested and frozen  minutes later but          the periods over which the two samples were stored at          C were different  week and  months respectively          It is thus possible that differences in tag distribution          among the libraries might represent differential mRNA          stability following tissue collection Several reports          have indicated a high level of RNA stability for up to           hours postmortem in tissue kept at room temperature                 and no reports to our knowledge have          indicated instability of mRNA in tissue stored long term          at C However as SAGE comprehensively profiles          cellular mRNA expression while previous studies examined          only a handful of candidate transcripts                 it could be that SAGE identifies unstable transcripts          that are missed by a candidategene approach          The correlation coefficient between tag abundance          levels in the yearold and yearold retinal          samples which were both processed  minutes after          enucleation is substantially higher than the correlation          coefficient between the retinal libraries from the          yearold and yearold individuals This is so          despite the fact that the yearold and yearold          individuals differ not only in age but also in sex This          could mean that a major portion of the observed variance          might result from differential processing andor storage          of the tissue before mRNA preparation However          comparison of expression of genes that differ by           p   in the SAGE libraries          from the peripheral retinas from the yearold and the          yearold individuals indicates a roughly equal          magnitude and direction of change of overall expression          levels between the samples Figure  Were the          differences between the samples largely due to          differential mRNA stability one would expect to see a          subset of mRNAs that were much reduced in expression in          the yearold sample as that one spent a longer period          of time between enucleation and RNA extraction One might          also expect to see a fraction of more stable transcripts          showing a small compensatory increase in relative          frequency but this is not the case The most likely          explanation then for the differences between the          yearold and yearold samples is variation in gene          expression          The observed variation between the two P mouse          libraries was more surprising As  of the tags that          differ at           p   represent known          rodspecific genes SB and CLC data not shown a          small subset of these results probably partially reflect          minor differences in developmental timing and some of          the other differences in tag abundance may also reflect          variation in genes expressed in a dynamic manner during          development Other differences may reflect differences in          mRNA stability during longterm frozen storage However          as with the human samples the direction of a roughly          equal magnitude and direction of change of expression          levels is seen in tags that differ at           p   between the samples          Figure  suggesting that differential mRNA stability          is not the cause of observed variation This also          suggests that for both the humanhuman and          littermatelittermate comparisons no major selective          mRNA degradation occurs between tissue harvesting and          binding of the mRNA to the magnetic oligodTcoupled          beads The source of most of the variation between the          samples thus remains unclear One animal that was a          developmental outlier is a possible explanation For          example litters of inbred mice sometimes have a runt          suggesting a difference in rate of development andor          other factors However much of our data collected and          analyzed for other purposes would suggest that such          outliers are rare at least with respect to eye          development                               Interindividual differences in gene expression are          most likely to account for the observed differences in          tag distribution          A final source of the observed variability between          individual samples probably reflects real individual          differences in gene expression It may partially reflect          genetic polymorphisms that give rise to different           Nla III sites and hence different          SAGE tags although this is unlikely to explain observed          differences in gene expression between the inbred mice          The fact that the yearold and yearold human          samples as well as the murine hypothalamus samples were          both obtained from males implies that differential          expression of Xinactivated polymorphic alleles cannot          explain the observed differences A fraction of the          variation is likely to represent either differential          environmentally induced patterns of gene expression or          stochastic variation in gene expression that persists in          the adult In tissues such as the hypothalamus where we          see large differences in gene expression in age and          sexmatched mice of the same strain this variability may          reflect high levels of variability in behavior that are          seen in inbred mice raised and tested under seemingly          identical laboratory conditions              Moreover the high variability that is seen in both          the development and geneexpression profiles of cloned          mice      and the relatively low heritability of          many quantitative traits such as lifespan or psychiatric          illness that is observed in monozygotic twins               implies that there is substantial variability in gene          expression even in genetically identical individuals          particularly in tissues of the CNS                            Conclusions        We have shown that the microSAGE method like        conventional SAGE analysis is highly accurate and        representative Furthermore we have shown that it is        highly reproducible when different libraries are made from        the same starting mRNA samples However we find that        considerable differences in gene expression are observed        between samples of the same tissue taken from different        individuals These may reflect minor differences in the        processing or storage of the samples or may represent real        differences in gene expression Further experiments are        required to resolve this issue In any case these data        show that a measure of caution is required when comparing        tag abundance levels in different SAGE libraries that were        not processed identically or obtained from the same        individual                    Materials and methods                  Isolation of mouse brain and retinal tissue          CB mice were used to obtain tissue from          hypothalamus adult retina and outer nuclear layer The           crx and           crx littermates represent          hybrids of CB and Sv strains Mice were killed          between  pm and  pm and were housed on a           lightdark cycle Microdissected outer nuclear layer          tissue was obtained by flatmounting freshly dissected          retinas flattened by radial cuts onto nitrocellulose          filters The filters were then frozen at C in OCT          mounting medium photoreceptorside down Orthogonal          cryostat sections of  m were cut onto Superfrost          slides Fisher and the edge of the section containing          the outer nuclear layer was hand dissected using a          microscalpel and immediately frozen Only sections          containing retinas with excellent morphology were used          for sample preparation All libraries with the exception          of the P           crx and           crx littermates were made          immediately directly from tissue stored at C The          P           crx and           crx littermate libraries were          made directly from Trizolpurified total RNA and were the          same starting material used in two previous studies from          this lab      Human tissue was obtained from          patients with periocular malignancies removal of which          required enucleation of a healthy eye The donors were an          yearold Caucasian female and yearold Caucasian          male

Generation of SAGE libraries          A modification of the microSAGE method    was used          to generate all SAGE libraries In brief  mg of          tissue containing  million cells was used to          generate each of the libraries with the exception of the          P           crx and           crx littermate libraries for          which  g total RNA was used and the microdissected          outer nuclear layer library for which retinas from two          different individuals were used Six nanograms of each          linker was used to generate the ditags and  cycles of          amplification were used to obtain ditags from each of the          samples with the exception of the E library which          was amplified for  cycles and the ONL library which          was amplified for  cycles In the case of the PB          SAGE library ditag amplification took place after the          initial ditag ligation had been stored at C for           months DNA sequencing was conducted on an ABI  SAGE          tag counts for each of the libraries Figure           hypothalamus   adult retina   Figures            T   obtained from     hypothalamus            E   E   E            E   P

proportions            In this method we want to see if the difference            between the proportions             p                           xA and             p                           yB is significant     Each            tag here is viewed as a random variable following a            binomial distribution which can be approximated by a            normal distribution in this case because the total            count is large The statistic of interest is                        We can compute the             p value or the confidence            interval from this statistic This test is conceptually            simple and easy to implement There is no need to            perform MonteCarlo simulations as done in the software            by SAGE  as they seem to give similar            results                                Poisson model            We can use Poisson distribution to model the            sampling of tags as the selection of a particular tag            can be regarded as a random event with a small            probability Considering the probability of observing             y occurrences of a clone already            observed             x times we have the formula                                                  p values can be computed by            summing up the appropriate tail of the            distribution                                Fishers exact test            When we think of the data as the    table the            most common way to compute the             p value is the chisquare test            which can be shown to be equivalent to the equality of            proportion test described above For a small number of            tag counts Fishers exact test may be used which            computes the exact probability of the observed               table containing             x y Ax By  based on a            hypergeometric distribution assuming that the marginals            are fixed                                Bayesian Model            We can also use a Bayesian model with a prior            distribution for the likely fold changes     The            prior distribution is often specified using a beta            function for mathematical convenience and the            parameter is chosen to reflect the distribution of            changes in expression levels between experimental            conditions This approach allows one to estimate the            probability that the proportions differ by a given            factor            The first three of these methods are closely            related For example the binomial distribution            related to the equality of proportions method and            which serves as the basis for the Monte Carlo analysis            conducted by the SAGE  data analysis software            with small probability and large sample size converges            to the Poisson distribution Fishers exact test should            replace the chisquare test when the number of counts            in the    contingency table becomes very small              roughly speaking For our data we have found that            all these methods give very similar results and the            difference in the             p values is noticeable only for            the very small             p values that is                                                    Additional data files        All comparisons
