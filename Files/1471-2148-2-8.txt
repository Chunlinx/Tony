                    Background        Pyridinebisthiocarboxylic acid pdtc is an        ironregulated metabolite produced by certain pseudomonads        that is highly reactive towards metals by virtue of a pair        of thiocarboxylate groups and ring nitrogen that combine to        form a nonspecific high affinity tridentate ligand        Figure       The formation constants for Co Cu        and Fe complexes of pdtc were determined to be greater than              Uptake studies using Fe showed that        addition of pdtc to the growth medium of two different        pdtcproducing pseudomonads increased the efficiency of        iron uptake by      The contribution of pdtc to iron        uptake may be due to the fact that the copper complex of        pdtc Cupdtc has the ability to reduce both soluble and        mineral forms of ferric iron     Not surprisingly in        light of its high affinity for essential metals pdtc also        exhibits antimicrobial activity            MoeB the molybdopterin synthase activating enzyme        MSAE is part of the wellcharacterized molybdopterin        cofactor MPTMo synthesis pathway A dimer of MoeB        adenylates the MoaD subunits of molybdopterin synthase        that after the conversion of these AMP moieties to        thiocarboxylates by a sulfurtransferase goes on to convert        precursor Z to molybdopterin MPT      Molybdopterin        synthase is a heterotetrameric protein composed of two        units each of MoaD and MoaE The crystal structure of the         E coli MoeBMoaD complex clearly        shows the interaction between these two proteins and        unambiguously confirms the adenylation role of MoeB            After a thiocarboxylate moiety is formed on the terminal        glycine of each MoaD subunit the two sulfur atoms are        transferred to precursor Z as sulfhydryl groups in a        dithiolene configuration        Molybdenum is        added to MPT in subsequent steps to generate MPTMo the        active form of the molybdopterin cofactor Since MPTMo is        required for nitrate reductase activity     the        activity of this enzyme can be used as a diagnostic        indicator for the presence of the MPTMo synthetic pathway                   There are a number of genomic sequences deposited in        GenBank as MoeB proteins although only a few have been        physiologically or genetically proven to function in MPTMo        synthesis Two         moeB sequences with evidence for        function include a knockout of the open reading frame        encoding GenBank accession number BAA which was shown        to cause the accumulation of precursor Z in         E coli    and accession number        Z which was found to be located within a cluster of        other MPTMo synthesis genes of         Mycobacterium tuberculosis            MSAEs from eukaryotic organisms have also been        characterized MOCS GenBank accession number NM        from humans and         cnx  from         Arabidopsis thaliana            respectively have been sequenced and         cnxF from         Aspergillus nidulans    has been        both sequenced and physiologically characterized        MoeZ is one of several MSAElike conceptually translated        protein sequences identified by the         M tuberculosis genome sequencing        group at Sanger Center     Although coding for a        putative protein with high sequence similarity to MoeB         moe Z was so named because it had no        genetic linkage to other MPTMo synthesis genes Cole         et al    state in their GenBank        entry accession number Z that MoeZ is possibly        involved in the synthesis of molybdopterin but there has        been no biochemical or physiological characterization of        this protein An open reading frame ORFF identified as a        necessary part of the         Pseudomonas stutzeri pdt locus coding        for the synthesis pathway of pdtc Figure  was found to        have  identity to         M tuberculosis MoeZ at the amino        acid AA level Further analysis revealed that a  base        pair region of         P stutzeri ORFF shares  homology        with         M tuberculosis moe Z     The        products of the         pdt locus probably function by        activating then sulfurating a carboxylic acid precursor        The end product of this synthesis is pdtc a molecule with        two thiocarboxylic acid groups that is secreted from the        cell        Recently data obtained from genome sequencing projects        have made it clear that bacteria exchange genetic        information by means of transducing bacteriophages        conjugative plasmids and natural transformation    at        a much higher rate than previously thought     There        seem to be few insurmountable barriers to interspecies gene        transfer with transfers being documented between such        diverse organisms as archea and eubacteria             Synechococcus sp    and some         P stutzeri strains    are two        examples of the many bacterial species known to undergo        natural transformation Of the completely sequenced        genomes all show some level of lateral gene transfer        LGT For example  and  of the         M tuberculosis and         Synechocystis sp PCC genomes        respectively are estimated to be composed of sequences        acquired by LGT            We report here on the structural functional and        evolutionary relationships of         moeZ and discuss the possibility that        the discontinuous distribution of         moeZ is the result of a LGT event        between unrelated bacteria                    Results and Discussion                  Structure          We assembled a set of sequences similar to the product          of           Pseudomonas stutzeri pdt locus          ORFF            PsmoeZ  Table  Protein BLAST          searches using PsMoeZ as the query yielded more than           sequences with significant similarity BLAST E value            Interestingly PsMoeZ had higher similarity to          seven sequences of mycobacterial streptomycete and          cyanobacterial origin than to the most similar          pseudomonad sequence Table  NA BLAST searches showed          that           PsmoeZ had higher homology as          measured by length of homologous overlap to four of          these same sequences than to pseudomonad sequences Table           Figure a We found that           MlomoeZdR MlemoeZ MtmoeZ PamoeB          PamoeBR ScmoeBR and SycmoeZ had significant          homology   bp of   identity to           PsmoeZ Table  To characterize          the structure function and evolution of PsMoeZ we          chose to study these seven genes along with the           P stutzeri sequence           EcmoeB was included in the study          because its function has been extensively characterized           MtmoeBR NosmoeZ and           SyymoeZ were included for reasons          discussed later BLAST searches of finished and          unfinished microbial genomes          httpwwwncbinlmnihgovMicrobblastyielded          additional sequences in the genomes of           Corynebacterium diphtheriae            Mycobacterium avium            M bovis  and           M smegmatis with significant NA          homology to           PsmoeZ  but these were not          included in this study because of their potentially          provisional nature pending completion of the genome          sequencing projects Inclusion of these sequences in the          analyses presented here did not change any of our          conclusions          Using each protein sequence listed in Table as a          query to search the Conserved Domain Databases we found          that each contained an Nterminal domain with high          similarity BLAST E value    to the ThiF family          domain Pfam Table  Figure c suggesting that          this portion of all the proteins in this study performed          a similar function The ThiF protein adenylates ThiS          prior to sulfuration of that protein by a separate          sulfurtransferase      Pfam encompasses the          nucleotide binding site of ThiF All  sequences in this          region have high similarity to the derived consensus          sequence GXGXXGXASXGXGXXGXDXR which defines a          nucleotide binding motif      In addition all          sequences have five residues or conservative          substitutions in the case of PaMoeB shown to          participate in the adenylation reaction catalyzed by          EcMoeB Figure      The fact that such high          similarities are retained in the ThiF coding region          across three bacterial divisions suggests that this          domain functions more or less autonomously If the ThiF          domain interacts only with dinucleotides and had evolved          to a high degree prior to the speciation of the strains          in our study then there would be little selective          pressure to fix additional modifications The high degree          of AA similarity that all  sequences have to the ThiF          family domain probably indicates that these proteins at          least in part perform a similar function most likely          activating a substrate by adenylation          All of the predicted amino acid sequences except          EcMoeB MloMoeZdR and PaMoeB also have Cterminal          similarity BLAST E value    to a rhodaneselike          domain Pfam Figure c Table               Rhodanese a thiosulfatecyanide sulfurtransferase EC           is composed of two domains that are similar in          threedimensional structure but divergent in sequence              All residues contributing to the active site of          rhodanese are contained within its Cterminal domain The          cysteine that covalently bonds to the transferred S atom          is conserved in all nine of the sequences that contain          the rhodaneselike domain included in this study data          not shown The similarity scores to the rhodaneselike          domain for those sequences that contain it were lower          than the ThiF similarity scores However since the          rhodanese domain is characterized by conservation in          terms of three dimensional structure rather than primary          sequence these lower similarity scores are not          surprising          Examination of the Clustal Xalignment of all the          protein sequences revealed significant structural          differences Figure  In addition to the ThiF family          domain all sequences except MloMoeZdR also possessed a          region similar to the Cterminal half of ThiF EcMoeB          MtMoeBR PaMoeB PaMoeBR and ScMoeBR all contain two          pairs of cysteine residues each arranged in a CXXC motif          and spaced  residues apart like those in ThiF          proteins arrows in Figures cand  But the PsMoeZ          sequence along with MloMoeZdR MleMoeZ MtMoeZ          NosMoeZ SycMoeZ and SyyMoeZ lacks these four          cysteine residues In all these sequences except          MloMoeZdR the first CXXC motif is replaced with NYRD          In MloMoeZdR the first CXXC is substituted with GYRD          All these sequences except MloMoeZdR also have a gap in          place of the second CXXC MloMoeZdR ends prior to the          position where the second CXXC would occur This dual          CXXC motif found in MoeB ThiF and HesA proteins forms          a metal center with a zinc atom      The presence of          all four of these cysteines has been shown to be required          for activity in MoeB     Therefore the proteins          lacking them are unlikely to function as MSAEs We          designated the region containing these two cysteine pairs          as X CXXC for the purposes of our discussion Figure          C          MoeBR MoeZdR and MoeZ proteins can be further          differentiated from MoeBs by the inclusion of a          polyproline motif immediately following the first CXXC          location boxed area in Figure  This polyproline tract          is immediately adjacent to a disordered surface loop          found in MoeB proteins thought to be involved in          proteinprotein interactions     The consensus for          this motif RXLYPEPPPP closely corresponds to a sequence          RSLYPPPPPP found in rat and human metabotropic           glutamate receptors      This motif is reminiscent          of proteinprotein interaction domains found in some          proteins     however interactions of this type have          not been shown to be facilitated by the polyproline motif          in rat and human metabotropic  glutamate receptors          An AA substitution found in MoeBRs and MoeZs may alter          the substrate specificity of these enzymes In EcMoeB           sheet  residues  of EcMoeB Figure  forms          part of the pocket which accepts the Cterminal portion          of MoaD of which the terminal glycine is subsequently          adenylated     EcMoeB I located at the          Cterminal end of this beta loop is substituted in MoeBR          proteins by Y and in MoeZ proteins by F or Y These bulky          substitutions may restrict access of the Cterminus of          MoeDlike proteins and may indicate that a different type          of substrate is adenylated by MoeBR and MoeZ          The presence or absence of two features the two pairs          of cysteines in the X CXXC domain and the rhodaneselike          domain form the primary basis for differentiation          between the four different protein structures among the          sequences found in Table Figure c MoeB as          represented by the functionally characterized EcMoeB          consists of an Nterminal ThiF domain followed by a X          CXXC domain with both CXXC pairs intact and no          rhodaneselike domain MoeBs also lack the polyproline          motif and have I at position  MoeBR has the ThiF and          X CXXC domains configured like MoeB but includes an          Nterminal rhodaneselike domain the polyproline motif          and has a Y substitution at position  EcMoeB          numbering MoeZ has all the components of MoeBR but all          the cysteines in the CXXC motifs are absent and position           contains either F or Y Finally MoeZdR MoeZ          deleted Rhodanese contains the ThiF domain followed by          an Nterminal portion of the X CXXC domain that has GYRD          substituted for the first CXXC and terminates prior to          the second CXXC pair MoeZdR probably does not function          as a MoeB BR or Z protein because of its substantial          truncation It is included in this study only because of          its homology to PsMoeZ Once these structural          definitions were defined we decided to add NosMoeZ and          SyyMoeZ to our data set since they were MoeZs that we          had not included in our dataset by reason of homology We          also included MtMoeBR because we were interested in the          relationships between MoeBR and MoeZ sequences that were          coresident in the same genome          The Conserved Domain Database was screened for          additional sequences related to the PsMoeZ sequence          This search yielded  proteins structurally similar to          MoeBR and MoeZ proteins Five of these were eukaryotic          sequences of unknown function five others were          eukaryotic MSAE proteins and one was a ThiF ORF within          an operon containing two other thiamin biosynthesis genes          in           Erwinia amylovora     The          remaining eight sequences were of bacterial origin and          were already included in our dataset A similar search          using PaMoeB as the query yielded  sequences with a          domain structure similar to MoeB most of which were          entered into the database as MoeB ThiF HesA or          ubiquitinactivating enzymes from archaea bacteria and          eukaryota In terms of distribution the MoeB structure           sequences was much more common than the MoeBR          structure  sequences while MoeZ was represented by          only six sequences in the GenBank nonredundant nr          database          Based on our sequence analysis some           moeZ sequences have been          misidentified SycMoeZ SyyMoeZ and NosMoeZ are          identified as a MoeBs in GenBank accession numbers          CAA BAA and NP respectively The lack          of all essential cysteines in both copies of the CXXC          motifs suggest that these MoeZs probably do not function          like MSAE proteins                          Conserved NA sequences          When the regions of greater than  NA homology          between each individual NA sequence and           PsmoeZ were plotted it became          apparent that these homologies clustered in defined          regions Figure a Five sequences had a homologous          region within the Nterminal half of the ThiF domain six          sequences had a homologous area in the Cterminal half of          the same domain and four sequences showed homology to          areas of the X CXXC domain Five sequences with greater          than  bp of more than  NA acid identity to           PsmoeZ MlemoeZ MtmoeZ PamoeBR          ScmoeBR and SycmoeZ along with           PsmoeZ were designated the high          homology group and used in subsequent analyses of the          homologous regions          Using a codonbased alignment of the NA sequences in          the high homology group we analyzed the occurrence of          synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions over the          entire coding region The plot of the ratio of          synonymousnonsynonymous substitutions dSdN identified          five regions where the synonymous substitution rate          exceeds the nonsynonymous substitution rate dS  dN            suggesting that homology in these areas was driven by          the need for AA conservation Figure b Analysis of a          plot of the degree of identical amino acid residues among          the high homology group showed that a high degree of AA          similarity existed in these same regions data not          shown Visual inspection of the NA alignment of the high          homology group revealed that substitutions in the areas          where dS exceeded dN tended to involve the second and          third bases of the codons confirming the previous          suggestion data not shown There was also a correlation          between the regions of homology to           PsmoeZ and the areas where          synonymous substitutions exceeded nonsynonymous          substitutions Figure aand b These correlations          support the supposition that the NA homologies among the          sequences are driven by functional constraints of the          proteins and not by the need to maintain secondary          nucleic acid structure Analysis of predicted secondary          mRNA structure did not reveal any conserved stems or          loops in the regions of NA conservation among the high          homology group data not shown                          Function          The functionality of MoeB MoeBR and MoeZ are known          MoeB exemplified by EcMoeB and MoeBR exemplified by          cnxF of           Aspergillis nidulans              participate in the synthesis of MPTMo as MSAEs This is          a housekeeping function for most organisms MoeZ on the          other hand has been shown to be necessary for the          synthesis of pdtc an unusual metabolite However since          CTN a mutant of           P stutzeri  missing a  kb          genomic fragment that includes           moeZ     reduces nitrate as          does the wildtype data not shown it is evident that           PsmoeZ is not necessary for MPTMo          synthesis          Both           moe BR and           moe Z coexist in the           M tuberculosis genome which          exhibits nitrate reductase activity but           moe BR is missing from           M leprae  which has no nitrate          reductase activity The fact that these two separate          genes are maintained in           M tuberculosis supports the          supposition that they perform different functions On the          other hand the sequencing of the nitratereducing          cyanobacteria           Synechocystis sp PCC and           Nostoc sp PCC is complete but          no MSAE sequences have been found Perhaps MoeZ fulfills          MSAE function as part of a modified MPTMo pathway in          these species          MoeBR incorporates a rhodaneselike domain but MoeB          does not Examples of both MoeB            E coli  and MoeBR CNXF of           A nidulans  have been          characterized as MSAEs indicating that the Cterminal          rhodaneselike domain addition does not inhibit MSAE          activity The presence of a rhodanese domain in MoeBR and          MoeZ suggests that these members of the family may          perform an additional function compared to MoeB           P aeruginosa has both a           moe B and a           moe BR also suggesting that the          products of these two genes have different functions or          perform the same function in a slightly different manner          However there is no physiological evidence for the          functional significance of the rhodanese domain in MoeBR          Rhodanese extracts a sulfur from sulphane sulphur          containing anions eg thiosulfate forms a temporary          covalent linkage between the S atom and a conserved          cysteine residue then transfers the sulfur to a          thiophilic acceptor eg cyanide Whether sulfur          transferase functionality is retained in the          rhodaneselike domains of MoeBR and MoeZ and whether          these proteins can function to activate a substrate as          well as transfer a sulfurcontaining moiety is          unknown                          Evolution          Because of the definitive structural features shared          among MoeZs and the homologies among their coding          regions we decided to investigate the phylogenetic          relationships of           moeZ sequences To infer baseline          interspecies evolutionary relationships we performed a          phylogenetic analysis of the S rDNA SSU sequences          from the seven MoeZcontaining strains included in our          study We obtained sequences for all SSU alleles for each          strain from GenBank Analysis of all the SSU alleles for          strains with multiple copies revealed that there was no          substantial variation among them We chose one          representative fulllength SSU sequence for each strain          for our analyses Table  The tree of SSU sequences          shows the two proteobacteria            P stutzeri and           M loti  at one end of the tree          with cyanobacteria            Synechococcus sp and           Synechocystis sp and mycobacteria                     M leprae and           M tuberculosis  clades branching          off from a common node Figure  This tree topology          agrees with those that have been previously published                       The           moeBBRZ sequences under study are          a mixture of orthologs and paralogs and a combined study          of their phylogeny is not possible so we limited our          study to           moeZ sequences We constructed the          tree from a gapless region of the NA alignment spanning          the entire ThiF domain except for the last two bases The          topology of the ThiF domain tree matches the SSU tree          except that           PsmoeZ  which was adjacent to           M loti in the SSU tree appeared          between the cyanobacteria and mycobacteria clades Figure           Parsimony likelihood and distance methods all          resulted in trees with the same topology Moreover the          placement of           PsmoeZ in the ThiF tree was not          changed when fulllength MoeZ AA sequences were analyzed          using the same methods          Additional support for the topology of the ThiF domain          tree was sought by conducting a manual analysis of the          insertions and deletions indels in the alignment of          fulllength           moeZ sequences           PsmoeZ contains five indels in the          codonbased NA alignment Table  Of these one is          unique to           PsmoeZ  four are shared with          members of the mycobacteria clade and none are shared          with members of the cyanobacteria clade or           MlomoeZdR  Thus the results of          the indel analysis supported the position of           PsmoeZ in the ThiF domain          tree          The incongruence between the SSU and the ThiF domain          trees suggests that           PsmoeZ may have been acquired by           P stutzeri strain KC by lateral          gene transfer LGT from an ancestor more closely related          to mycobacteria and cyanobacteria than to proteobacteria          The results of the indel analysis also suggest that           PsmoeZ is more closely related to          the mycobacteria           moeZ sequences than to the          cyanobacteria and proteobacteria           moeZ sequences BLAST homology          results also support this close relationship to the          mycobacteria          Although they were not included in the analysis          presented here the homologies of           PsmoeZ to sequences in the          unfinished microbial genomes of           M avium            M bovis  and           M smegmatis were also very high          and thus provide additional support for the placement of           PsmoeZ in the ThiF tree and          suggest that the direction of LGT was from a          mycobacterial species to           P stutzeri           Comparison of the GCAT percentages and codon bias          profiles of           PsmoeZ to data from other known           P stutzeri strain KC coding          regions indicates that acquisition of           PsmoeZ was ancient The GCAT          percentages for the  st  nd  rd and all three codon          bases combined compiled from the seven published coding          regions of           P stutzeri strain KC were             and  respectively For           PsmoeZ  these values were similar             and  respectively A          comparison of the           PsmoeZ codon bias table with the          one compiled from the seven published strainKC coding          regions did not reveal any divergent trends Many of          these substitutions could be due to GCAT percentage          adjustment to the           P stutzeri genome but since the          donor is unknown and only seven ORFs have been sequenced          from strain KC a definitive analysis is not          possible          It is not unreasonable that a pseudomonad coexisting          in the soil with cyanobacteria mesorhizobium          streptomycete and freeliving mycobacteria could acquire                    moeZ from one of these species           P stutzeri has been characterized          as having an exceptionally plastic genome with high          genotypic diversity within the species     LGT          events are thought to contribute to this plasticity and          consistent with this many           P stutzeri strains also exhibit a          natural transformation ability     The fact that          incorporation of DNA into the genome through homologous          recombination requires a region of homology usually          limits LGT mediated by natural transformation to closely          related species      The ThiF domains of the high          homology group do provide a region of homology suitable          for homologous recombination This homology is shared          across a wide range of species and thus could have          contributed to a natural transformationmediated LGT          event in           P stutzeri  This mechanism of          acquisition is supported by the fact that no phage genes          transposase coding sequences IS elements or repeat          sequences were found in the  kb cosmid clone that          contains           PsmoeZ              Three other           P stutzeri isolates obtained from          the American Type Culture Collection have been shown by          Southern analysis to lack pdtc synthesis genes These          same strains plus           P aeruginosa PAO           P putida mt and           P fluorescens F were also shown          not to produce pdtc     Pdtc production in bacteria          other than           P stutzeri strain KC is limited to                    P putida strain To and one other          unclassified pseudomonad strain               P stutzeri and           P putida are closely related both          belonging to rRNA homology group I     so they may          be descendants of the original pseudomonad that acquired           moeZ by LGT The relative rarity of          pdtc production among pseudomonads especially the           P stutzeri strains is consistent          with the hypothesis that           PsmoeZ was acquired through LGT by          strain KC Alternatively a pseudomonad ancestor could          have contained the genes for and produced pdtc but this          function could have been lost from most strains Loss of          this function is plausible if pdtc production is a highly          specialized function or is only required for survival in          extreme or competitive environments                            Conclusions        It is not known what function MoeZ performs in the        mycobacteria and cyanbacteria species that contain it        Indications are that in mycobacteria MSAE function is        performed by MoeBR But in the fullysequenced        cyanobacteria there are only MoeZs and no MSAE so in these        organisms MSAE function may be fulfilled by MoeZ In either        case MoeZ is essential to pdtc synthesis in         P stutzeri strain KC and pdtc is a        potent and versatile molecule Its capabilities of        enhancing iron uptake and iron reduction make it a good        candidate for a pathogenicity factor The role of MoeZ in        the pathogenic mycobacteria and its impact on virulence of        these strains should be investigated                    Materials and Methods        Sequences were obtained from the GenBank nonredundant        nr sequence database at the National Center for
