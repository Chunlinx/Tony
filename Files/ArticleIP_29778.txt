                                 Ellisons Wonderland            When Ralph Ellison died in  he left behindthousands of pages of drafts and notes for the book he had been working on for yearsand a terrible dilemma Ellisons readers and Ellisons publisherwanted the legendary second novel they were sure had to be buried in the paperssomewhere But literary scholars and Ellisons friends would surely denouncethe publication of anything that went beyond the authors known intentionsBecause the manuscript was nowhere near to being a coherent finished work andbecause Ellison left no instructions his literary executor John F Callahanhad to choose between disappointing the amateurs and infuriating theprofessionals            The griping about Juneteenth even beforepublication makes it clear that Callahan has taken the side of readersEllison did not leave behind the shapely building that Callahan has given usGregory Feeley wrote last month in the New York Times Magazine  Criticsquoted in the article complain that sections of the novel published as excerptsduring Ellisons lifetime are missing that important characters have witheredor vanished and that  or more pages have been whittled down to             A scholarly editionpromised for the future will enable betterinformed opinions by placing thisextract in the context of Ellisons longer manuscript But on the basis of whatwe know Id say that Professor Callahan who teaches at Lewis  ClarkCollege in Portland Ore deserves to be commended not condemned Withoutadding a word other than the title Juneteenth  he has culled a nuggetthat gives a sense of what Ellison was up to all those years without harmingany of the alternative conceptions of the work that are bound to emergeJuneteenth doesnt pretend to be a definitive framework or even aframework at all Its merely a necessary starting point for an inquiry intowhat might have been            In an afterword Callahan says that he took most ofJuneteenth from Book II the strongest and most heavily plotted part ofwhat were apparently intended to be three parts The story begins inWashington DC circa  when a black church delegation arrives at theoffice of the Sen Adam Sunraider on urgent unstated business Before thegroup succeeds in reaching him an assassin shoots the racist Sunraider fromthe Senate gallery Critically wounded Sunraider summons the leader of thecongregation the Rev Alonzo Hickman to his bedside We learn that Hickman aBaptist preacher known as Gods Trombone was the only father Sunraider everhad Though either white or a fairskinned mulatto Bliss as the senator wasknown as a boy was raised by Hickman to be a black minister            From here the storyunfolds outward in many directions at once jumping from the hospital bed tovarious points in Hickmans and Sunraiders lives The turning point for theirrelationship was a celebration of Juneteenth Day a holiday commemorating theday in  when slaves in Texas first learned that the Civil War was over andtwo and a half years after the fact that President Lincoln had issued theEmancipation Proclamation Amid the festivities a crazed white woman appearedclaiming to be Bliss mother After this incident Bliss became obsessed withhis lost mother and eventually ran away from home We get woozy glimpses ofBliss Sunraiders later life as a con artist moviemaker and chauffeur beforehe became a senator and a bigot            Little of this information comes in the form ofstraightforward narrative but instead accumulates through murky fragments Thelanguage is far more complex and difficult than that of Invisible Man In place of a single narrator there are at least three The authorial voiceHickman and Sunraider who speaks in a number of distinct tonguesas thechild Bliss in dreams in remembered conversations and in convoluted memoriespoured into a deathreverie stream of consciousness Click to read a briefexcerpt describing Sunraider waking in the hospital with Hickman at hisbedside            The passage ischaracteristic of the book in both its lyricism and its opacity We only findout subsequently that Sunraider is Bliss and that Why hast Thou forsaken mewas his opening line at Hickmans revival service when he would riseChristlike from a coffin            Only in a few places does Juneteenth attain thenarrative velocity of Invisible Man  In a thrilling climax we finallyhear the story of how Bliss came to be adopted by Hickman and how Hickman wastransformed from an Oklahoma City neerdowell into a man of God it hinges ona false accusation of rape a lynching and some amateur obstetrics Thissection indicates that Ellison could still write in the lucid explicit vein ofhis first novel but chose to do something more difficult and complex boththematically and stylistically in his second Ellisons first love wasjazzhe played the trumpetand many of the passages in Juneteenth areextended riffs in a kind of freeform verbal polyphony If Invisible Manwas Louis Armstrong Juneteenth is Charlie Parker            At the level of plotmany things are never explained among them how Bliss got to be Sunraiderthe story of Sunraiders own illegitimate mixedrace son who seems also to behis assassin and the meaning of the message that prompts Hickman toWashington Future fragments may illuminate these issues But these confusionsseem largely purposeful not accidents of omission by author or editor IfEllison had finished and published his novel the story still wouldnt bewhole Its meant to be up to the reader to assemble the shards into a vaseFor this reason one doesnt feel cheated by not having all the pieces In acurious way the unfinished state of the novel complements the inherent andintentional incompleteness of the underlying story            Think of William Faulkner whose characters often appearand reappear in his various novels and stories Its as if Hickman andSunraider have an independent existence of which Ellison offers glimpses andglances in the various pieces he never assembled into a single structure Forme Juneteenth recalled especially Absalom Absalom in whichQuentin Compson puts together a story that rattles family skeletons and pointsup the reality that white Southern culture is blacker than meets the eyeSunraider yearns to know who his mother is and Hickman wants to know how Blissbecame Sunraider The reader approaches these mysteries through the incompleteknowledge of the characters Crucial information is delayed and denied whichbrings us back to the motif of Juneteenth the day when slaves found outtheyd been free for two and a half years            Why didnt Ellison finishor publishthe bookThe oftrepeated official version involves a fire that destroyed an importantmanuscript in  But as disastrous an event as that must have been I findit unconvincing as an explanation Ellison described losing a summers worth ofwork He had a decade of writing his novel behind him and almost three moreahead of him A more compelling explanation is that Ellison wanted to write asecond novel that would meet the standard of Invisible Man while beingan entirely different kind of book This strenuous ambition was confounded by aperfectionism that as Ellison wrote in the introduction to his volume ofessays Shadow and Act  made it somewhat unreal to even think ofhimself as a writer As he puts it my standards were impossibly high            Those standards didnt keep Ellison from writingmerely from calling it quits Failing to finish doesnt mean he failed Indeeda great unfinished work can be more fascinating than a finished one because ofthe way the reader is drawn into the artistic process Juneteenth is atruly interactive novel in which readers are not an audience butcollaborators trying to pull together strands and elements of a story that hasno final resolution Other fragments and versions will add to what Callahan hasassembled not overwrite it As with Faulkner the boundaries of Ellisonsseparate texts may blur but the mythic force of the buried story and thestylistic virtuosity of its telling will remain
