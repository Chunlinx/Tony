working in America today but I find it less easy to passover his  film The                Age of Innocence as AO Scott does Icompletely disagree that this film substitutes intensity for emotion The

for AO Scott but I saw  Age ofInnocence  again a few months ago and found the technique that you admirea distraction A critic at the time described the movie admiringly asvirileand Im forced to agree Scorsese is working so hard to show that hecan make a womens picture in a robust manner that he loses touch with hissupposed themes And he doesnt begin to get inside his impotent maleprotagonists head Youre right the film is full of astonishing momentsstuffas good on its own terms as anything Scorsese has done But I wonder if anyoneeven remembers what the film is supposed to be about                           Kundun  on the other hand really is atriumphant merging of form and content Im less enchanted by the content thanmany but I certainly respect Scorseses struggle to alter his

more aboutAge of Innocence not to mention Kundun  AfterHours  and Goodfellas but I pretty much agree with Edelsteinstake on it It does indeed have virtuosic moments but the central lovetriangle is entirely inert Scorsese just doesnt do courtship as well as hedoes male friendship I think that Age is a case like RagingBull  of Scorsese overwhelming the audience with technique and producingvisceral effects rather than emotional responses This is true ofGoodfellas as well in my viewa completely exhilarating movie thatnonetheless has a certain coldness at its heart            Now these effects are powerful and the technicalcommand behind them is extraordinaryunparalleled Im willing to stipulateamong American directors of Scorseses generation The argument of my piece isthat Scorsese is often hailed as a visionary on the basis of his technicaldiscipline and formal panache but that in too many cases the vision seemstired or blurred I wish Id had space and time to examine each of Scorsesesfilms more closely and to contextualize them to everyones satisfaction butIve enjoyed following this discussion so far and look forward to more            To reply clickhere
