                                 Why George W Wouldnt Hack It as a CEO                        One of the curious things about what Jake Weisberg aptly calls the Do Dim BulbsMake Good Presidents question is that its not a question anyone wouldask about corporate CEOs On the contrary its conventional today to hear thathaving a really smart CEO is necessary to compete successfully especially inthe New Economy and articles about company heads routinely include lines likeHe was the smartest guy Id ever met You would be very hardpressed to findsomeone who could argue with a straight face pace Richard Brookhiser onGeorge W Bushs future prospects that its precisely because Jack Welchisnt that smart that hes done such a good job at GE            It is true of course that the landscape of CEOs is dotted withhighprofile figures who never made it through college including Michael DellBill Gates and Steve Jobs But the basic assumption about these guys is notthat they got tired of wrestling with Introductory Calculus and quit but thatthey were too smart to waste their time in school A debatable assumption tobe sure but then I finished college so I would say that The success ofGates Dell et al in fact is antithetical to Bushs educational careerwhich looks like nothing more than a rote exercise in credentialism            The only reason this comparison really matters incidentally is that thesame crowd that has leapt to Bushs defense has often been fond of saying inthe past that we should look to business as a model for the way we rungovernment This was never as congenial an analogy to Republican ideology asRepublicans thought it wasmost corporations borrow significant amounts ofmoney and take their time paying it back and most invest heavily in thefuture rather than giving money back to their shareholdersbut an importantpart of it was the idea that a president needs the same skills as a CEO RossPerot too was fond of this analogy since he was a CEO            If a president needs the same skills as a CEO then George W is out ofluck Actually he probably would have fit in pretty well with the corporatechieftains of the late s and early s when there was no foreign and notmuch domestic competition and the oldboy network was in full effect Butnotsmartness doesnt count for much anymore at least not in the businessworld
