             how many children do you have now   well i have five   you have five well you do have a hard time finding time then dont you   right well five are i mean four of them are grown theyre in college or just out of college so i really have just a thirteen year old at home   umhum you sound so young   well i work at it  i try to fool everybody  uhhuh   to have them uh i think youre doing a good job i just have one child and uh i dont think um well theres not much i can do about it my  my wife and i are uh in our forties you know so uh   uhhuh   but its hard to raise one child without them thinking theyre the theyre the pivot point of the universe   i think youre right because i was an only child too and thats one reason i have so many  because i really i enjoyed the big family   yeah   and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters and so shes sort of like an only child and its the same type of thing um   umhum i have a younger brother like that im in my forties like i say and i have a brother in his twenties and i was i was the youngest   uhhuh yeah   so i understand how that worked and he was treated like he had five fathers or something   right thats exactly how it is you know shes got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her when things dont go right she just calls one of them you know but um   yeah   yeah its its a little bit difficult though i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more and   did yall do a lot of organized things like uh Little League uh soccer and   we we really did not my next oldest daughter thats in college in California is a world twirling champion she twirls a baton and we did a lot of things together she and i did a lot of things together and flew weve flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform   uhhuh umhum   and that was a lot of fun but that that i guess you could consider that organized i mean theres a competition all the time we were very heavy into that   yeah   other than that they were pretty much and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that   you know i think thats probably true the  if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities and if you have a large number of children or then you dont   uhhuh well you cant afford to   no you cant and theres not enough time um like my son is in uh Little League this year hes ten   right   and they practice three times a week and they have a game and its just uh if there were more than one child i dont know there there would be no way to do it   right thats right   you know one parent go in one direction and id have to go in the other and   uhhuh   we could only cover two at that   yeah well i know i spent hours in the gym everyday with my daughter and my little one also competed because really she had no choice she had to go with me   umhum   so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing and of course the competing itself really didnt matter what it was it was making the friends and going all the places and it was a really neat experience but it took our total time i did not work um when i did this now i do work full time   umhum   and its just my thirteen year old and myself and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other   i dont think although  i think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me but im not sure i could afford three i most certainly couldnt educate three  i dont know how my my parents did it     yeah   i mean there were five of us i dont recall you know wanting anything in particular uh but i dont know how my father did it he worked at a truck line and he just didnt make that kind of money with five children but we did okay we had a house and a home and but now my wife and i both work and we dont i dont believe we have as much as my parents did and we only have one child   really well things cost a lot more i dont know how it is in Georgia and i dont think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some   umhum um Atlantas horrible yes have we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and and different areas and from talking to them theyre shocked   is it really   what and they you know the housing so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it they sell their house they stash away a good bit of money   right thats what ive heard   and come down here and i work with a lot of them they they think they theyve really done something then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous   hm   compared to to where they came from the housings cheaper but thats about it   yeah im surprised to hear that ive heard very positive things about Atlanta everybody
