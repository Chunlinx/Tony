            well i i dont think that its its wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where theres where theres uh endangerment to their own life and other peoples lives   all right i agree with that people that are uh driving   umhum   like uh truck drivers and things like that i definitely think they should be tested and and im not im not opposed to any testing i mean   umhum   because i know i certainly wouldnt want to uh you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or you know because he was on drugs while he was there   yeah   uh   well how do you feel how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring   oh um i was tested uh within my company i think its its its kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states and because i dont know of any other countries that are doing this   umhum   and i feel i feel like its really just within the United States its um its okay i think your record should stand for itself that you know if youve been tested at other companies and youve always come up negative or whatever then i dont see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over and once youve established the fact that youre not a drug user and   umhum   especially if your personality proves that youre not   umhum   i think they could uh save money by not doing that you know every time say if you change jobs that you you wouldnt have to do it if youd just been tested at your other work place   well what about random testing though   oh right   do do you feel like thats an invasion invasion of certain peoples rights if not everyone is tested   uh not if its done fairly and thats probably my question is how how do you know its done fairly   i dont know that you do if its random then its random and thats not necessarily fair   yeah well they might tell you its random   umhum   but then you know its kind of like a a lottery somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesnt win anything and tries and tries and tries   yeah   you know   well i happen i know that for instance in the NC double A they drug test and its not random   oh i see howd how did they how do they pick their people   um well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh   uhhuh   at the NC double A does have something to do with it but its almost discretionary on the coachs part of each individual individually individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem   oh i see so do you   and and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time   right well do you think that should be implemented in the work place you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them   well not being a drug user i dont have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someones rights if someones   to be tested right   having personal problems for some reason thats causing them to have behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset   right   right right yeah it it would almost be like a a uh   its an accusation and and its and its based based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave   uhhuh   uh normal uh you know   right and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs   right exactly it it i dont the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if its across the board from from the janitors to the executive management   right i agree with that because i know personally myself ive been in the same job for three years itll be three years in August and ive already been drug tested three times   umhum       what type of job do you have   well im an environmental engineer   uhhuh   and ive been drug tested three times and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus so see i i for some reason ive come up three times thats pretty high statistics   well does your job require does your job require you to drive company equipment or to  operate any type of machinery that might endanger endanger someone   no no not at all it   well it that doesnt i i mean i i   its a legal job you know   uhhuh   so see its really strange   hum that is odd i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company   oh uhhuh   so i dont know if i wasnt drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didnt request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion   right well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for before before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey weve already drug tested her and and she came up negative   well no i dont think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i didnt i mean they they dont know that i dont use drugs they just tested me once   yeah right right yeah   but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen   uhhuh   uh were clean   uhhuh   and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it wasnt as important to them that they test me regularly but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly regularly uh just across the board   uhhuh yeah and are they tested random   no theyre all of them are tested once every three months its a rotation   theyre oh okay i see   but it but again it depends on what job youre in the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot   yeah   and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines arent tested as much   uhhuh uhhuh   but but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is they say we were testing you tomorrow and well test you every three months thereafter while you work here   oh i see uhhuh okay so they know that and they   yeah its its made very c lear upon hiring   uhhuh okay well   well have we spent our at least five minutes  okay   yeah i think so yeah seven twenty five   okay   okay nice speaking to you   nice to talk to you too byebye   okay bye
