        well theres been a lot of publicity lately about that new Nancy Reagan book out by uh Kitty Kelly the unauthorized biography are you interested in that at all   not really im not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan so i i dont particularly read um biographies or autobiographies   no uhhuh   no i havent read too many i im more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that not not of that nature though so   uhhuh well i the reason why i was thinking about looking at it is because its supposed to im not a fan of Nancy Reagan and so its supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it and i thought just purely for entertainment i might enjoy that but i i wouldnt want to go out and buy it like you know the hard back copy of it   yeah   but i might check   if they if they had it i dont even know that id probably read it even if it was at the library though you know i i just you know im just not really interested in reading about other peoples lives to that degree you know unless maybe they lived a long long time ago   really uhhuh   for me it would be interesting to find out what life was that life you know in that period but   uhhuh   not not really interested no   in biographies well i uh i have read some biographies i prefer to read if i read a biography its mostly because maybe i have to uh you know back when i was in school i had to have information about that person or um preparing some kind of lesson and i need to have   umhum   more information about people but i i do like to read some biographies but that one just sounded like gossipy and i wouldnt want to sit down and just read it cover to cover but flip through just for just to get a good laugh   umhum yeah i think the last biography that i read im not i think it was was um on Lady Randolph Churchill Churchills mother and that was excellent   uhhuh was it   uh yeah it was its in two parts i think the first one is called Jenny or something like that uh because that was her name and um i only got to read one part of it and ive been looking for   uhhuh   you know the other half but didnt read the i read the half where she was in her later years and it was absolutely excellent and it was very descriptive of of people with money back then and uh affluents in in England uh uh that you know were associated to the king and all and it was   umhum   it was really pretty fascinating and i  and that was actually a couple of years ago so   uhhuh   its its been a while since ive read any biographies   well   but i love to read i mean im constantly reading i read i like uh mysteries and i like um as far as improving myself uh i havent read any lately but i was reading classical works that i hadnt read before you know that you might have needed to read in school but that i just didnt read for some reason or another another or that you know that you can only   umhum   read so many in school that they make a requirement of and yet there are so many out there   right   that uh that you you know you never get a chance to read and so i said well i think it was because i read um Dickens A Tale of Two Cities and i just   uhhuh   i mean that even when i read it now it still makes me cry the ending of it and i couldnt believe i i could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book id read some Dickens before but i hadnt read that one and i i was like i thought to myself     uhhuh   you know what other things are out there that are that are classics you know that have withstood time and that are just excellent somethings excellent about them   uhhuh   whether its the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written you know that was written about and um so i started reading i had this like you know i had a binge of  my mother uh i was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband but my uh mother sent me you know like booklet you know uh boxes full of different books   oh   and uh she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over but she she is quite familiar with i guess because it seems like uh older people have much better um in their schooling they they got more of the classics than i did you know and she knows so much more of them than i do i wouldnt even know you know to go look for that author or that book   uhhuh right   yeah so   well i like the classics too uh i think that theres a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage  books and i well i dont prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at uh well like at a Target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out paperback type books usually i   umhum   im going to the book store for a particular reason um   uhhum probably you read a book review or something some kind of review on it   yes yes and and uh i buy some of the not selfimprovement books but uh selfhelp books like we just bought a new house so i bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for you know and or how to   umhum   repair this or repair that in your own home i bought that for my husband  and or how to how to do something books you know for reference and uh   umhum   and those are really helpful i think in helping um well you know like some what symptoms medical symptoms like when how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not   yeah yeah   type books which i have use as reference and have been real handy but purely just for enjoyment i i had a major in English and linguistics and so i have have a lot of books in my home that i can read from the classics and i do enjoy those quite a bit and um so i tend to for reading just day to day uh you know i have a particular book im looking for or i just enjoy uh you know the newspaper magazine   yeah   its handy   well what i do is i usually have two books at one time i have a classic which i have to work on basically you know what uh       just depending well some authors i can just you know basically drink in but others i really do have to work at them and then um whether you know theyre a foreign author or whatever   uhhuh   um or if its their style or or just understanding the material and then i you know it some of those its like i said its like school you have to work at it but to me its worthwhile in the end i feel good about it and i usually remember those a long time later and then i have the books that i read just   right   purely for enjoyment you know i mean just light reading that i particularly like Dick Francis books and just some of the the authors that are uh for mysteries just you know just   light reading   uh purely for entertainment you know thats it im not really expecting to get anything out of it except to be momentarily pleased you know because i dont i can never remember the plots or anything   uhhuh uhhuh   right   later on those books   well i think thats good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things its not like       uh most television where you you know you just you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but still understand what was going on   yeah oh yeah that television it gives you everything   uhhuh   so its  basically mindless i mean all your you the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know what youre hearing and your your sight uh your sight but they give you everything else   right right   its usually the television that we see nowadays seems like that its it it doesnt even have some of the underlying uh things to it you know that maybe the old movies and things had you know the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out or you know like with Hitchcock or something where youre youre youre expecting something or   umhum   well i i dont know it just i dont really care much for TV at all i just i mean i sometimes get hooked into it       but i really i really get mad at myself when i do because i realize i realize fully theres no really redeeming value for T TV no   not too much not too much well thats right well i think it is good to to read books and and  because even if its like you say its light reading you are still getting some mental exercise   yeah youre developing your imagination which       you know when you develop your imagination that can take you into a lot of other areas because youve developed uh your your your mind in in seeing things you know even if its your own set way   right   you know its youre youre taking words and developing a picture in your mind   thats right   so i mean   thats good   and its its excellent i im we havent got children yet but i hope to uh set an example for ours that you know that reading is can it can be your best friend basically i mean even if you havent got a a a human friend around you can pick pick up a book and and   uhhuh right   and be with somebody basically   uhhuh i think so well i guess id better close now so i can   oh it sounds like your kids are doing stuff so are are you a teacher i gathered you might be a teacher   uh well i i was im home now full time but uh so yeah were we think books are important around here well you have a good day stay out of the rain okay byebye   oh okay uhhuh yeah okay okay you too take care bye bye
