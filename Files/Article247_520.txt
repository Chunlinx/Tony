                                 Desert Storm Warnings                           USAToday and the New YorkTimes lead with a federal judges ruling that the lineitem veto isunconstitutional The Washington Post leads with the Russian defense ministersfacetoface rebuke of the US Defense Secretary over Iraq The top nationalstory at the Los Angeles Times is the unhappiness among manycongressional Republicans about Newt Gingrichs decision to handle the Lewinskyscandal by saying nothing critical of President Clinton            According to the WP lead in their Moscow meeting Igor Sergeyevforcefully lectured William Cohen right in front of reporters about how Americawas being too tough on Iraq and warned that future USRussian relations maybe affected The paper reports that Cohen kept his cool Also the Postreports that Cohen asked Sergeyev about yesterdays allegations in theWP about a  agreement by Russia to sell Iraq equipment that could beused to develop biological weapons The Russians issued a carefully wordeddenial            The Post portrays the recent diplomacy undertaken by Russia inconnection with the Iraq flareup as providing it with a chance to take on aglobal role it hasnt had since the Soviet collapse And indeed Cohen left themeeting with the latest Russian proposal for softening UN weapons inspectionsof Iraq RussianUS tensions over Iraq also get frontpage space atUSAT  the LAT and the WSJ             The NYT describes the lineitem veto veto as a major blow randomchoice of words to President Clinton and Republican congressional leadersThe decision sets the stage says the paper for a ruling on the matter by theSupreme Court            The Times reports that although the LIV is often defended as a toolfor fiscal restraint even the Clinton administration attributes to it only Min direct deficit reduction            The USAT front section cover story does a very able job ofcovering the geopolitical and especially military nuances facing any US moveagainst Iraq The paper points out that of course this time there isntnearly the amount of international support for military action And itssuggested that the current goal of thwarting Saddams ability to wage chemicaland biological warfare is far more nebulous than s objective of throwingSaddam out of Kuwait            But on the other hand says the paper US smart bombs have gottensmartertheyre now less likely to be distracted by smoke or bad weather andthere will be a lot more of them now And now almost every plane in thegathering US air arsenal can launch them            This story has a surprising even disconcerting amount of order of battleinformation The six F Stealth fighters stationed nearby in KuwaitAlso the piece makes the point that still seven years after Desert Stormthere is no ideal bomb in the inventory that can reliably destroy biochemicalweapons plants while keeping poisons from getting into the atmosphere whichmeans that true precision will be needed to avoid large numbers of civiliancasualties Another obstacle noted is that it is impossible to destroy all thecomputer disks holding cookbooks for making chemical and biologicalweapons            A couple of questions about the story however The paper says that the Bstealth bomber is a stealth design like the F stealth fighter just muchbigger But actually the former employs smooth curves to bend radar waveswhile the latter uses flat jagged edges to scatter them And USAT saysthat the only US jet capable of dropping a  lb bunkerbusting bomb ismissing from the roster being formed over there But doesnt explain why TheNYT frontpage piece by exMarine Gen Bernard Trainor on the USmilitary plan says that the  pounders will be used            According to the Wall Street Journal Washington Wire Clinton advisorBruce Lindsey had a phone conversation last summer withLinda Tripp Hispurpose to find out more about Kathleen Willeys allegations of sexualharassment by Clinton            Todays Papers appreciates all its sharpeyed grammarian readers and willpress on irregardless of its occasional missteps            The NYT features a sprawling oped by Tom Clancy called Know the Answers BeforeGoing to War In it Clancy states that we dont seem to have the answers tovery many of the questions relevant to attacking Iraqs chemical and biologicalwarfare capabilities This is interesting because in Clancys novels the USinvariably has all the answers and its weapons perform as required So maybethe questions he proliferates here here unlike in his books he questions thenotion of a surgical strike and here he wonders Who has told us that it isOK to kill women and children are signs of a longdeferred maturity Butmore likely is that this is antiClinton blather from a conservativeRepublican After all in this piece the carhomeandfire salesman turnedglobal strategist describes the Gulf War as if it were a model of Clausewitzianclarity concerning ultimate goals and acceptable means forgetting in theprocess that at the end of that war the BushPowellSchwarzkopf axisinternally disagreed about war issues that had never been articulated for theAmerican people Should the US destroy the Iraqi military invade Baghdad ortopple Hussein even after Iraq was repulsed from Kuwait Because of thathistory the American people have now given such matters much more thought
