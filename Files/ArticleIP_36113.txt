                                 The Bush Triangulation Strategy            Lastweek House Republicans tried to postpone a fiscal squeeze by deferring paymentof the Earned Income Tax Credit to lowincome workers Their presidentialfrontrunner George W Bush shot them down I dont think they ought tobalance their budget on the backs of the poor said Bush Tuesday speaking inNew York about education reform Bush spanked his party again this time forprojecting pessimism indifference and disdain for government            Bushsbroadsides have filled the talk shows and front pages with speculation that heis triangulating against congressional Republicans just as Bill Clintontriangulated against leftwing rap artist Sister Souljah in  and againstcongressional liberals in  But the medias onedimensional understandingof triangulationthat Bush is trying to distance himself from the GOPs rightwing and stake out the middle ground between two extremesoversimplifiesthe game Bush isnt positioning himself on a straight line between Clinton andthe congressional GOP He isnt even taking up a third position on theirtwodimensional battlefield He is venturing into a third dimension rejectingthe whole Washington debate and defining his contest with Al Gore along a newaxis He is trying to render Gores threepoint campaign message obsolete                                           The country is doing well Clinton and Goreconstantly recite statistics that reflect well on their administration morejobs lower deficits lower interest rates fewer people on welfare lesscrime They credit their own policies particularly the  tax hike forachieving these results by establishing fiscal responsibility For yearscongressional Republicans predicted that Clintons plan would ruin the economyThen they defied credulity by reversing their message claiming that theeconomy was in great shape and that their own policies were responsible forit            Thisis the biggest obstacle facing Bush He is challenging the incumbent vicepresident in a time of peace and prosperity and the congressional GOP has notmade a persuasive case either that the prosperity is false or that it is truebecause of Republican efforts in Washington Clinton and Gore have spent sevenyears telling Americans the story of how their administration revived theeconomy Whether or not this story is true it is now deeply ingrained in thepublic consciousness and Bush cant look to his party in Washington for aneffective rebuttal to it            Instead Bush is attempting something far more bold and interesting He isweaving an alternative story While focusing on Bushs criticisms of his partyin his speech Tuesday the media overlooked the more important passage thatpreceded them He said                           In state after state we are seeing a profound shift ofeducational priorities An age of accountability is starting to replace anera of low expectations  The principles of this movement are similar fromNew York to Florida from Massachusetts to Michigan  At the beginning ofthe s so many of our nations problems from education to crime towelfare seemed intractable  But something unexpected happened on the wayto cultural decline Problems that seemed inevitable proved to be reversibleThey gave way to an optimistic governing conservatism Here in New York MayorGiuliani brought order and civility back to the streetscutting crime rates by percent In Wisconsin Gov Tommy Thompson proved that welfare dependencecould be reversedreducing his rolls by  percent Innovative mayors andgovernors followed their leadcutting national welfare rolls by nearly halfsince  and reducing the murder rate to the lowest point since  Noweducation reform is gaining a critical mass of results In the processconservatism has become the creed of hope The creed of aggressive persistentreform The creed of social progress                        Whatsimportant about this narrative is not what it says but what it doesnt say Itmakes no mention of anything that happened in the White House or in CongressBush has decided that he cant win the federal policy debate that has consumedClinton Gore Newt Gingrich and the national media for seven years So he hassimply erased it Yes crime is down fewer people are on welfare and schoolreform is gaining momentum And yes the incumbent party deserves credit Butin Bushs story that party isnt the Democratic White House Its the stateand local GOP                                           Congress is petty and mean Republican congressionalleadersGingrich House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Majority WhipTom DeLayhave spent their tenure in the majority denouncing governmentbickering with Clinton and the Democrats impugning their integrity andblaming them for every problem They have convinced many people that Clintonand Gore are blameworthy But they have convinced many others thatcongressional Republicans are more interested in impugning integrity and fixingblame than in solving problems The negative portion of Gores game plantherefore is to lump Bush together with Armey and DeLay as the party ofcarping and destructiveness            Bushsgame plan is to turn Gores game plan on its head Hes not going to argue withGore over which party is destructive or blameworthy Hes going to reject thewhole Washington blame gameundercutting his own party as well as Goreandportray himself as a man who solves problems instead of complaining about themor blaming them on his enemies Too often my party has confused the need forlimited government with a disdain for government itself Bush said TuesdayOur Founders rejected cynicism and cultivated a noble love of country Thatlove is undermined by sprawling arrogant aimless government It is restoredby focused and effective and energetic government And that should be our goala limited government respected for doing a few things and doing themwell            SomeHouse Republicans including DeLay have fired back at Bush accusing him ofbetraying them meddling in their business and distorting their ideas Thiscounterattack has only helped Bush achieve the distance he sought in the firstplace Others including Armey have tried to spin Bushs comments suggestingthat hes really siding with them against Clinton in the Washington budgetfight They dont understand that theyve lost that fight and that Bush iswilling to repudiate the fight and everyone in itincluding themin order toruin Gores strategy and beat him                                           The religious right is scary Gore like Clintonhas often used cultural issues such as abortion to make the GOP look extremeThe media and moderate Republicans convinced that these issues are thepartys weakness and that its libertarian economic ideas are its strength haveinterpreted Bushs remarks as a rebuke to Republican Puritanism But a closerlook at Bushs comments suggests the opposite He is concerned that the partylooks mean because of its economic policies and he is using cultural issues tosoften that image by projecting Republican compassion            IfBush had felt a need to triangulate against the cultural right he could havejoined others in repudiating Pat Buchanan for questioning the wisdom ofAmerican intervention against Nazi Germany He didnt Alternatively he couldhave used his address to the Christian Coalition last Friday to criticizereligious intolerance Instead he gave a speech that bypassed traditionalmoral issues such as school prayer and homosexuality and never mentioned theword abortion The media inferred that Bush was ignoring moral issues becausethe religious right has nowhere else to go They missed the real story Thereason why Bush doesnt have to talk about old moral issues that might make himlook mean is that hes introducing new moral issues that make him look warm andcaring            In hisspeech to the coalition Bush used the word compassion  times He urgedChristians to pursue a kinder gentler mission What we need are people wholive out their faith in every walk of life in politics but also working incrisis pregnancy centers drug treatment programs and homeless sheltersPeople who make Gods work their own  Our compassion must extend to thepoor and to the fatherless Our compassion must defend the disabled  I willrally the armies of compassion to nurture to mentor to comfort to performtheir commonplace miracles of renewal  I will involve them in afterschoolprograms maternity group homes prison fellowships and drug treatmentprograms            Tuesday Bush warned Too often on social issues my party has painted animage of America slouching toward Gomorrah Of course there are challenges tothe character and compassion of our nationtoo many broken homes and brokenlives But many of our problemsparticularly education crime and welfaredependenceare yielding to good sense and strength and idealism He went onToo often my party has focused on the national economy to the exclusion ofall elsespeaking a sterile language of rates and numbers of CBO this and GNPthat Of course we want growth and vigor in our economy But there are humanproblems that persist in the shadow of affluence On this view the GOPsproblem is libertarian indifference in Washington and the solution is to fixbroken homes and broken lives through compassion back home            Gorerecognizes Bushs strategy and is trying to drag him back into the Washingtonfight Hes now differed with congressional Republicans on one littledetail Gore said on Face the Nation  If he really wants to try tobreak with them he ought to endorse our healthcare Patients Bill of RightsHe ought to endorse an increase in the minimum wage for the working poor Andhe ought to come out against this huge risky tax scheme But Bush isntbiting and congressional Democrats more interested in beating theirRepublican colleagues than in beating Bush have welcomed and exploited hisindictment of the GOP Bush doesnt mind They can have the battle He wantsthe war
