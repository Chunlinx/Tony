        do you have a recipe that you would like to share     why dont you start first and ill think about it   okay uh  we i find that the nicest party for dinner uh uh group for a dinner party is eight people uh they set at my dining room table easily and it just seems like you can decorate a table and and you can serve easily with eight people uh particularly if youre wanting to do the soup to nuts thing which uh with my dishes i have a really pretty soup tureen so i like to start out with you know some kind of soup that nobodys had lately like sauerkraut soup or minestrone depending upon what the menu theme is   umhum   but one thing that i like to do um of course i always want to make it easy on the cook and uh the lady who is the manager of the country club gave me a really good recipe for ham loaf that its something you can make up ahead and then stick in the oven you know   yeah umhum   after after your guests are here and youve started cocktails really uh usually course you have to have some kind of entertainment too and and we do play bridge my husband plays when i make him  and uh       well usually our friends the women are the bridge players and the men are there because its an excuse to get together   umhum   but i do find that in in order to have your party last beyond the dinner table there have there does have to be something to go on to or you just kind of sit around and everybody goes to sleep and gets bored you know theres got to be a a silly game or a something fun to do afterwards   yeah umhum i would say our dinners are probably more casual than that with um having kids and that kind of stuff it may be inviting you know neighbors over for dinner or something like that but not really we havent really tried a dinner party i guess   umhum you have more summer than we do though   yeah or a barbecue or something like that yeah   yeah we can do that well starting the end of this well starting now we can do that through October but thats about it for us and then were basically inside you know even if its really warm during the day at night its going to cool off and by the time you would get ready to eat youre going to want to be in   umhum right yeah   so our climate is not as conducive to the outdoor entertaining as yours are although its certainly a lot more casual and a lot more fun   yeah   yeah   keeps the kids busy too  gives the grownups a chance to well like you said play a game or just talk or something like that   right  i yeah and i think outside you can just kind of kick back and and visit after dinner but is seems like when youre inside the first thing you know someone has turned on a TV and that kind of is the end of your party i think   yeah thats true yeah   what do you do uh for a barbecue when you cook out whats your favorite thing   well i guess we i we lived in Kansas City for awhile and it was kind of fun to do Mexican food up there because a lot of people didnt really   yeah   hadnt had it before and i know um we were going to make um fajitas one time and  the grocery stores i mean the people knew when i asked for the beef skirt that you use to make it they said are you from Texas  so its  fun   oh i see youre youre even labeled by your food how do you do fajitas   yeah  well it you can either use weve always used um beef skirt steak but you can also use flank steak and you marinate it the recipe ive used is you marinate it in a can of beer and a bottle of Italian dressing and then you can either grill uhhuh   eight ounce   and then you can either grill it or you can um broil it we usually grill it outside and then you cut it into real small real thin pieces and serve it on flour tortillas with like grated cheese and sour cream and guacamole and that type of thing   umhum ive ive i love Mexican and im always doing the hot things and i make my own salsa and all that and its really spicy but i just havent had the nerve to try fajitas how large a steak would you need to serve eight people   umhum i think i was reading looking at this recipe were going to have some guests in in a couple of weeks and they said recommend a pound for four people i think three to four people yeah   so id need two pounds wouldnt i one pound four people and then is that a fairly thick steak or   it its kind of a thin steak   oh   and so it doesnt take very long to to grill   uhhuh so when you when you get it you dont have your meat man cut it to a certain width you just take whatever you find okay flank or skirt   yeah   okay  okay im ive been wanting to try that and i just havent got the nerve up i do tacos and enchiladas and all that stuff but   yeah umhum   okay a can a sixteen ounce can of beer and then you mix eight ounces of Italian dressing with it do you let the beer get flat or   well you just um well i usually just put it like in a Pyrex pan you know i have an eight by or a nine by thirteen pan i put it in there and i pour it over the top and then you just you know turn it leave it in there for overnight or something and turn it every once in awhile   um umhum   maybe i usually cover it with Saran wrap or something and then  or start it in the morning and its ready in the evening to cook   umhum you know something i do when i marinate steak that you might think is interesting i have a tupperware uh sealed or any plastic sealed and then i just turn it over every once in awhile   umhum oh yeah   and it saves you know its just easy just to turn the whole dish over the whole container over   the whole yeah yeah   okay yeah so you do grated cheese and guacamole   that would make it nice and easy and some people like sour cream and then you like warm your um flour tortillas up in the oven   okay uhhuh okay where did i write the part about the tortillas warm the tortillas   i usually just wrap them up in foil or something like that and stick them in the oven for awhile   yeah okay   in fact as a wedding gift we got a tortilla warmer but i dont think very many people have those and it doesnt hold very many tortillas so we dont use that often   i see uhhuh im sure youd probably i mean the men would eat two and the women would eat one isnt that usually how that goes   probably yeah because once you get the meat in there it gets pretty filling   uhhuh yeah what about salsa you can or you cant or you just dont usually put salsa on it  you know   oh you can yeah i im not into the hot hot food my my husband is but  im not so   i see well we have our children all three live here and our two married daughters have three children between them who range from eight to three and every time they and they always come here for every holiday it seems and birthdays and and every time we always have to start up with something really hot and spicy as an hors doeuvres and it gets to be   umhum   both our son sonsinlaw are good cooks and enjoy cooking and it kind of gets to be a contest to see who can come up with the   the hottest  yeah   right  the hottest almost not eatable hors doeuvres to start us out so well its fun take talking to you im going to try fajitas   oh well good well its nice talking to you where do you live in Indiana i have some relatives that live up um near Terre Haute oh okay   well were way up the other end of the state were uh half way between Chicago and Indianapolis on i sixty five so and Terre Haute is you know its like three hours south   yeah well i know when we flew up there we flew into Indianapolis and then had to drive down there so yeah   umhum yeah this is a little
