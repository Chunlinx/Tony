        so um  what do they do about recycling in Raleigh is there any public program     yeah they they uh get uh they regarding recycling they just gave us uh about five man about five or six months ago they passed out these um green containers to everybody in the city   umhum   and uh they started out by just recycling newsprint and clear glass i think and or well clear glass and uh you know brownish glass and ah however no plastics oh cans was another thing that theyre recycling um   hm   and so you know there  really wasnt a lot that i could put in there anyway i just mostly had bottles um   umhum   and it seemed like that uh plastic would would wouldve been very helpful to recycle well finally they started plastics but only the kind of milk bottle plastics   yeah umhum oh that   how about how about in your area   well in Atlanta they um where i used to live they had a they had just started a program but apparently it wasnt city wide because i moved over to a different neighborhood and they didnt even you know no one had ever heard of this     right   and um  the one nice thing though is im is im lucky is im pretty close to downtown so um  aluminum cans be recycled just by tossing them out in your yard and the bums come around and   umhum do they have a deposit on them   um no they dont have any deposit but um you know theres a theres a thriving industry of homeless people that  collect uh aluminum cans and turn them in for you know recycling the the weight in aluminum   right right yeah because uh in in places where theres a bottle deposit i know that if you discard anything somebody will pick it up  which is a good argument in favor of deposits uh   uhhuh umhum   course uh now its AdoptAHighway they get rid of a lot of that anyway but im not sure when they do pick it up if they recycle it there uh     yeah umhum yeah im not sure i i dont i think they only carry one bag when i when ive seen people out there you know   yeah well i mean well yeah yeah but i mean if you put you know i oh i see what you mean everything would be in the same bag and they would have to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash yeah   yeah hm   yeah that would that would be good because uh you know   umhum yeah yeah that seems like it would be you know very labor intensive to actually you know go through it all and pick out the different things   umhum right of of course if theres a deposit its worth it for kids to do   umhum   um now soft drink companies dont want that because it uh obviously it would have a negative effect on sales to some degree i dont know   yeah i i mean its you know they have the cost of the cleaning equipment to clean the bottles and   um hm i suppose yeah but that would be cheaper than getting new plastic i i think its just the fact it raises the price temporarily that they dont like   and things like that umhum   it should be anyway well did you see there was an interesting article about recycling in the Wall Street Journal about three or four weeks ago   umhum   it talked about some commodities that are being recycled uh they  they they these critics start recycling before theres an industry to deal with the stuff and   umhum   i forget where it was i think it was Portland Oregon ended up burning a bunch of it  it was just piling up and they had no where to put it   yeah ive heard that you know a lot a lot of the you know more popular recycled materials like aluminum and um  paper especially that because you know everyones become much more environmentally conscious and you know has moved to recycle that   hm   their you know the the the the the systems basically has this very large backlog of of material to be recycled and and processed and apparently in a lot you know in a lot of industries   umhum   you cant just you know take a bunch of stuff and recycle it you generally you mix it with with new material   right yeah i think that   and that and that you know with you know coupled with the recession that there just isnt you know the demand for you know recycled product   yeah well i dont yeah i dont know i guess if  as far as packaging materials are concerned are concerned if uh durable goods purchases go down you need less packaging i   umhum umhum   i dont know how much sensitive things like soft drinks sales are to economic conditions though i i i i i expect it well i would expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are or something i think thats one of the things people think of cutting back on but it certainly would be a way to save money  um   umhum   but um yeah in the the the article uh mentioned that it very much depend upon depended upon what kind of products youre talking about certain things and i believe clear glass is one there is plenty of market for they can use all they can get but its other things   um   and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those thats rather difficult to recycle its just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable   umhum yeah yeah i think it depends on like the little number in the circle   umhum   that they have on them but because they i have a lot of friends that you know are very into recycling you know and say you know just about you know they they try and throw out as little as they can you know and and   hm umhum yeah thats right right right um well im down i read somebody say he was down to uh one bag of garbage a week and thats about the same with me but ill tell you my garbage is mostly by weight is mostly junk mail   umhum umhum   if i could get rid of that  it wouldnt be much at all its just that     umhum
