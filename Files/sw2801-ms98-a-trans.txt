            so do you do any of your own repairs or maintenance work   well i do a little bit i just do mainly you know change the oil and uh ill do an occasional tuneup things like that change set of disc brakes but most of the stuff i have done i just dont have time to fool with it or you know its just out of my technical expertise   yeah do you have like an American or foreign car   one of each   okay   a foreign and uh and i have a a truck   because i know like ive got a a Honda and and its just beyond even my my dads and my husbands comprehension a lot of that stuff they grew up with Americans little simpler arrangements on under the hood so so theyll change the oil for me and   yeah   um thats about it these days   yeah i dont work on anything foreign   yeah its its   well youve got to have a different set of tools for it and everything else too so   you have to have metric dont you   yeah metric well even even some American cars have that now but uh   yeah   uh theyre still a little bit over all simpler you know to work on but uh   yeah   i feel like if if i can afford to have it done im going to have it done   well its its a lot easier than getting under there and finding out something major has happened that you didnt know about and Advanced Auto closed fifteen minutes ago and   yeah   getting into that kind of hassle   well have you had anything done to yours lately or   yeah i had um well i was having problems with the cruise control   umhum   so i had to take it down and have them look at that and they said it was something with the um the way the choke was adjusted   yeah automatic choke   yeah   how much did that cost you to have that fixed   well i had the um like the sixty thousand mile tuneup done at the same time so the whole thing was like two hundred dollars   yeah not cheap like it used to be   no it i mean the first time i found out how much it was going to be i about fell over   yeah ive had uh we have a Volvo and uh i had some steering problems   but   and it ended up being the entire rack and pinion steering assembly   holy cow   and by the time i got everything done it was twelve hundred bucks   wow     so something something that small and that minor uh well its not really minor but something that small can cost that much money   was it is it a fairly new car i mean was it   well its five years old   well thats still   but but still it doesnt have that many miles its got uh just over sixty five thousand miles on it and rack and pinion steerings uh i dont think ive ever heard of one going out   i know i havent the the little bit i know about cars ive never heard of anybody having that happen to them   the uh the guy that i talked to that replaced it he said i just he said weve never really had to replace one weve had to go in and do some adjustments but never replace one but the actual gear teeth on this one had had broken   man   so i think it was a defect defect and i tried to get the Volvo Corporation to cover it but they just refused to do it   did they   so i just rather than get tied up in in a bunch of you know garbage i just went ahead and and got it done and and to heck with it   yeah   but uh and then the the truck i have i have uh ive had just virtually excellent luck with it and other than taking in for just regular warranty work and things like that its its been a real good truck   well ive the only two cars ive had i had a Honda Civic and it was lets see uh im trying to think how old it was i got it in eighty one and got rid of it in eighty eight so it was seven years old and had almost a hundred thousand miles on it   theyre good cars   yeah and i i mean i never had any problem with it and ive got an Accord now and other than you know minor tuneups like with the the choke and stuff ive never had any problem with it so ive been really lucky   i had a i had a Honda Accord uh it was uh trying to think what year it was uh i think it was an eighty eight or eighty seven eighty seven   mines an eighty eight   and uh its the the was the LXI with the the fuel injection is that what you have   yeah no ive ive got the LX   i think it still has fuel injection theres i think the DX is the one that does not   okay   but uh they are probably one of the nicest running cars ive ever driven they run good and theyre and theyre peppy   yeah and this ones you said yours was just now about sixty five thousand and mines an eighty eight and its it just turned over seventy thousand   yeah i i will i dont i dont think id ever buy another Volvo i bought it mainly uh for my wife and daughter for safety more than anything and i thought well itd be an investment well be able to keep it for ten or twelve years   so yeah sure   and uh i i dont think id buy another one only because the maintenance costs are very very high   yeah   and thats just a little bit out of my range its enough just to buy it without uh having the other problems but uh   once it   i will definitely go back go to uh now go back to Honda or Mazda or something like that next time   weve been looking recently just you know mainly window shopping but um weve been thinking more American just       because we want a bigger car this time   umhum   and weve been looking at um Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis and were leaning a little bit towards the uh Grand Marquis as far as just looks but my parents have a um Continental and theyve had nothing but nightmares with that car   oh really   its been its been one thing after another going wrong that the local dealer either says theres nothing wrong its your imagination or says well its supposed to be that way just get used to it its been an absolute nightmare for them   hum   so it kind of makes me dread going back to an American manufacturer   thats been i think until they get the reliability up i dont you know other than trucks ive had always had good luck with American trucks but with cars i ive not had much luck with uh American cars especially General Motors   yeah   but uh you know i look at reliability and and you know like stuff like tires and and belts and stuff like that uh actually you can buy the parts cheaper for foreign cars if you buy them and put them in yourself   sure yeah   but if you have to have it done of course it ends up costing you the installation fee but i have had if i had to say dollar for dollar spending on foreign and as opposed to to American i spent far less on the foreign cars   umhum i believe that   long term a lot a lot more and then then you add the the fuel savings on top of it   yeah   so my moneys on foreign cars until American until the American cars can can meet the standards   i wish there were bigger foreign cars really it seems like they kind of   well that thats interesting that you say that because if youll start looking now at some of the Hondas and some of the Mazdas and and a lot of the car companies now are beginning to scale up you know like the the Lexus   really yeah   see those cars if if youll go look at them theyre as big as some of the General Motors cars   i hadnt really even   if you if you put them side by side and i i didnt really notice it until someone pointed it out he says well if youll look and see whats happening   yeah   foreign cars are able to keep the same gas or keep keep good gas mileage good reliability but theyre scaling up whereas the Americans now are scaling down and they cant improve the gas mileage anymore so the Japanese the Japanese have have definitely beat us in both sides of the game   yeah   they they thought you know build them small cheap and you know and and little repair and you know get them hooked and then start slowly adding stuff on   moving them up   and people like the reliability but they also like the size and now theyre sizing up theyve got the reliability and theyve got the gas mileage you know   and i dont i dont think people mind too much taking the car in for a a tuneup you know just general fifteen thousand mile maintenance or or even getting the oil changed if they know that theyre not going to have any other major problems that theyll have to pay for on top of that   thats right and with American cars and the warranties you dont know   what did they used to say Ford stood for fix or repair daily   yeah except ive got a Ford truck       and i know a lot of people that have Ford trucks and really theyre very maintenance free   well thats great   from i now i i i speaking only from trucks   i wonder why they cant extend the trucks you know reliability out to the cars i mean i dont know   i dont know thats surprising surprising because you know everybody i know that has a Ford car has had nothing but trouble with it but they they have a Ford truck and theyre theyre virtually uh flawless   thats weird   the uh the the undercarriage and everything else if you put them next to a Chevy or or another type of truck American truck you cant even come close to a Ford   really   and uh thats why i buy Ford trucks mine runs like a top it it ive like i say ive had absolutely nothing wrong with it other than taking it in for normal maintenance and uh and i i put over a hundred miles a day on it   man   and ive never ive never had trouble with it   thats great   so ill buy Ford trucks but ill buy foreign cars   i think they need to uh take a look at and see what they cant figure out what the catch is there   i know its its its kind of kind of crazy but i dont know but but until they until they meet the standards that you know that im used to anyway that you know ill ill buy what whatever i get you know thats best for my money   yeah and you know like i said ive had ive had great luck with the Hondas and its kind of hard to walk away from a good thing when its you know youre not sure what youre going to get when you change   yeah theyre theyre good cars i i i will say that you probably made a good choice   yeah   in that one but how about have you had tires changed on on that car   i had the um tires changed at fifty two thousand they had they had started to look to look pretty bald     umhum did you put the same kind of tires back on it did you   no um lets see i had
