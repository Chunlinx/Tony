                                 The Gay Fray            On Nov President Clinton spoke at a fundraising dinner for the Human RightsCampaign It marked the first time a sitting president has addressed a gaypolitical organization We are redefining Americas immutable ideals saidClinton But in the cauldron of politics ideals are never immutable Its yourmutation vs theirs For example                            Civil rights vs special rightsClintons main thrust was to equate gay rights with civil rights He likenedhis speech to the  NAACP gathering at which Harry Truman became the firstpresident to address a black civilrights group HRC Executive DirectorElizabeth Birch likewise said her cause was civil rights rather than gayrights            The civilrights analogyserves three purposes First it subsumes an apparently radical idea gayrights under a patriotic tradition the espousal and gradual extension ofequal rights Clinton traced this tradition to Thomas Jefferson and called itthe fundamental story of our country Second it minimizes the burden ongayrights advocates Civil rights are basic You can extend them to gaysand to Jews Nazis and vegetarians without condoning their behavior Thirdit allows gayrights advocates to avoid mentioning homosexuality Clintonspokesmen Mike McCurry and Rahm Emanuel demonstrated this feat when summarizingthe speech for reporters            Criticssay that gays want not civil rights or equal rights but special rightsThe Sword has so effectively permeated the gayrights debate that in theirspeeches both Clinton and Birch felt obliged without prompting to deny itThis didnt stop Ralph Reed and other critics from hurling it on television thenext morning Reed elaborated Gays are demanding a special category based onsexual preference under our civilrights statutes This argument failslogically our civilrights laws are entirely about special categoriessuch as race but it succeeds politically by giving a fig leaf of neutralityto what is actually a moral aversion to homosexuality                            Tolerance vs approval Conservativeslong ago surrendered to the liberal crusade for tolerance Now they claim torepresent tolerance against the lefts demand for approval of homosexualityIts a strong argument because gays do want approval One prominent gayactivist called Clintons speech a message of acceptance Dan Quayledescribed Clintons message as part of an attempt by gays and liberals toimpose their particular viewpoint on us As CNN pundit Mona Charen put it Wewont ask about your private life but dont flaunt it Gays see it the otherway around If they cant be open about their orientation said Birch theyreeffectively banished to the closet But thats a hard argument to sell to anaudience that doesnt knowand doesnt want to knowwhat its like to begay            TheEllen controversy illustrates how easily open homosexuality can beconstrued as aggression On Oct  Vice President Gore boasted that when theTV character Ellen played by Ellen DeGeneres came out as a lesbianAmericans were forced to look at sexual orientation in a more open lightConservatives led by Quayle exploded at Gores use of the Fword Clintonlearned from the mistake On Nov  when asked on Meet the Presswhether he agreed with Gore he rephrased the point saying that the comingoutepisode gave Americans a chance to see homosexuality in a new light                            Outreach vs pandering Clinton wantsto make gays participation in politics appear normal His idea of normalpolitics is cobbling together interest groups Previewing the speech McCurrycompared it to an ItalianAmerican dinner Birch welcomed that analogy andasserted that gays should be treated like the Hispanic vote because exitpolls indicate that theyre  percent of the electorate This foolish argumenthelped conservatives dismiss Clintons speech as pandering Reed adroitlydeployed the Sword calling Clinton a lackey of the old Democratic Party of apolyglot of special interests of gays of feminists and of unionmembers            Gayrightssupporters compounded the damage by bragging about gay money and politicalclout DeGeneres depicted her own comingout as a financial boon I becamemore famous So much for those people who said that it would ruin my careerBirch boasted that gays had made significant investments on par with otherconstituency groups into campaigns HRC advertised that it had contributed million to Democrats in  that gays had chipped in  million altogetherand that Clintons appearance at its dinner would raise  Clintonpointed out that since Ive become president were spending  times as muchper fatality on people with AIDS as on people with breast cancer or prostatecancer Conservatives gleefully connected the dots Rich homosexuals werefunding Clinton in exchange for favors at other peoples expense By the end ofthe Sundaymorning chat shows CNNs Frank Sesno was asking Emanuel Is thisjust another political group another bunch of donors that youre appealingto                            Protection vs pity Clinton and Birch talked abouthow gays have suffered from AIDS teen suicide and hate crimes But this lineof argument is also dangerous If gays are unhappy said Bill Bennett in adebate with Birch on ABCs This                Week  the compassionateresponse is to help them abandon homosexuality This is fast becoming therespectable antigay position Antigay extremists picketed the HRC dinner withsigns saying God Hates Fags but a second group of protesters won betterpress coverage by carrying signs saying Ellen Can Change                            Employment vs marriage Clinton urgedCongress to pass the Employment NonDiscrimination Act which would ban jobdiscrimination against gays Chat shows replayed his best sound bite Beinggay has nothing to do with the ability to read a balance book fix a brokenbone or change a spark plug Even Quayle and Bennett had to agree Butneither Clinton nor Birch mentioned gay marriage Why Theyve used the samepollster and seen the same polls Americans favor equal treatment of gays inthe workplace but oppose gay marriage probably because the latter involvessex Last year Clinton signed legislation prohibiting federal recognition ofgay marriages then bragged about it in campaign ads Republicans named it theDefense of Marriage Act framing gays as the aggressors Would Clinton signit again Yes said Emanuel after the HRC speech            Conservatives have attacked ENDA in several waysby claiming for examplethat it entails job quotas ie special rights for gays But defending theright to discriminate against gays is no longer a sure winner for them Theyrebetter off changing the subject to marriage where they hold a clear advantageOn This                Week  Birch focused on civil rights and jobdiscrimination only to be derailed by George Wills first question Doesbasic equal civil rights include the right to marry Birch unlike Clintonhad to give a principled answeruh yesat which point Will and Bennettdragged her through the sordid exercise of distinguishing gay marriage frompolygamy and incest Birch pointed out that conservatives defend serial andchildless heterosexual marriages but the whole topic was a loser for herQuestions not answers win debates                            Identity vs behavior Everyone nowagrees with Martin Luther King Jr that people should be judged by the contentof their character not by the color of their skin The gayrights debate turnson whether homosexuality is more like the former or the latter This is whygays substituted the phrase sexual orientation for sexual preference            Now conservatives arefighting back Their usual tactic is to pepper the debate with references tosexual vices such as adultery and bestiality But Clintons war on nonsexualsins gives them a new angle Citing the campaign against tobacco Bennettargued that being a gay man is worse than being a smoker because homosexualitytakes  years off your life            Tosuppress the image of homosexuality as a vice Clinton and Birch attributecivic virtues to gays If they obey the law show up for work every day orshow up for school if theyre good citizens they ought to be treated withrespect said Clinton Responding to Wills criticism of gay couples who seekto marry Birch insisted They are taxpaying They are taxpaying                            Nature vs nurture This underlies theidentity vs behavior debate On the Sunday chat shows after Clintons speechconservatives argued that homosexuality involves a choice while liberalsmaintained that its genetically based and hardwired The hotbutton issuebehind this academic dispute is kids If children are amenable to gaypersuasion conservatives can argue that they should be protected byexcluding gays not just from jobs that involve children eg teaching butalso from any legal rights that confer respectability The extreme argumentdredged up by Bennett is that gays conspire to recruit kids The morerespectable argument leveled by Will is that kids are susceptible toatmospheric social cues            The conventional view of lastweeks frame game is that Clintons words didnt matter because his merepresence advanced gay rights as a mainstream cause No doubt it did But wordsalways matter and last weeks exchange proved that opponents of gay rightsarent running out of good ones any time soon
