exorbitant wealth sunny beaches palm trees and beautiful people But        LA is also linked with adventure and maybe even danger complete with        earthquakes floods crime and scandals of O J Simpson proportions        Because the world is watching its a town eternally destined to make a        spectacle of itself whether onscreen or in real life The result is a        modernday wild West meshed with everyday life where image is        reality poverty clashes with wealth and fame is acquired        overnightall publicized to the hilt around the globe        The worlds perception

unique identities for        themselves which would be more of a challenge if the town didnt have        such an anything goes attitude The results are often amusing if not        outrageous and can be seen in everything from clothing styles and        choice of car to how Angelenos spend their time and money        No matter what they expect to see in Los Angeles visitors        invariably
