                    Background        The B cell antigen receptor BCR is a multisubunit        complex that acts as a key sensor regulating the response        of lymphocytes to their environment reviewed in                  In mature B cells activation through the BCR        stimulates cellular proliferation and differentiation In        immature B cells activation through the BCR induces either        a state of unresponsiveness termed anergy or death by        apoptosis depending on the physical nature and        concentration of the antigen                             In some B cell lymphomas        activation through the BCR can induce cell cycle arrest and        apoptosis         in vitro and tumor dormancy         in vivo        The core of        the multisubunit BCR is membranebound immunoglobulin        mIg which is noncovalently associated with two        coreceptor molecules CDa Ig and CDb Ig        products of the mb and B genes      The        biochemical changes induced by engagement of the BCR are        extensive and include an increase in tyrosine        phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins        hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids fluxes in the        concentration of intracellular free Ca  activation of        several serinethreonine kinases including components of        the MAP kinase pathway and changes in the activities of a        panel of transcription factors Although much is known        about the biochemical changes occurring in response to        BCRmediated activation the differences in the signal        transduction pathways that give rise to the different        cellular responses following activation of the same        receptor in immature versus mature cells have yet to be        elucidated completely discussed in detail in refs                   Some of the earliest changes that occur following BCR        engagement are the activation of several nonreceptor        protein tyrosine kinases PTKs including p         blk Blk p         fyn Fyn and p         lyn Lyn of the Src family            Btk of the ItkTec family     and p         Syk Syk of the SykZAP family            The importance of Syk in BCR signaling and        lymphocyte development has been clearly demonstrated using        gene inactivation approaches Although         syk deficient mice die perinatally        analysis of radiation chimeras reconstituted with fetal        liver from         syk deficient mice has demonstrated        a block in the transition from proB cells to preB cells        indicating that signal transduction through Syk is required        for early B cell development      Inactivation of        the         syk gene in the chicken DT B cell        lymphoma leads to a loss in the activation of PLC the        increase in intracellular free Ca and the apoptotic        response following engagement of the BCR In contrast        BCRmediated activation of Lyn kinase was largely        maintained      The Sykdependent signaling pathway        appears to be facilitated by the adaptor molecule BLNK        also known as SLP and BASH       Syk can        induce the phosphorylation of BLNK in cotransfection        experiments     which may be important for the        recruitment of other Syk substrates like PLC through a        scaffolding function     BLNK function is necessary        for signal transduction since no Ca flux or PLC        phosphorylation is observed in response to BCR engagement        in BLNKdeficient DT cells            The formation of large protein complexes associated with        the membrane receptor through specific proteinprotein        interactions appears to be an early step in BCRmediated        signal transduction In response to receptor activation        Syk becomes noncovalently associated with the BCR through        tandem SH domains located in the amino terminal half of        the protein     Following engagement of the BCR        phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in        immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motifs ITAMs        found within the cytoplasmic tails of CDa and CDb        provides docking sites for Syk localization              The ability of phosphorylated ITAM peptides to selectively        enhance Syk kinase activity         in vitro suggests that recruitment of        Syk to the receptor complex may serve to activate the        kinase in part through allosteric changes in the        structure of the Syk protein       Upon        activation Syk and the receptor complex become localized        in detergentresistant cholesterolrich membrane        microdomains lipid rafts resulting in the segregation of        the BCR complex from other membrane components            In this report we describe the use of a mutant form of        Syk that leads to the constitutive activation of the        endogenous wildtype Syk kinase when introduced into B cells         a dominant positive effect  in the absence of detectable        tyrosine phosphorylation It was anticipated that the        presence of a constitutively active Syk enzyme could help        in delineating the signaling events that occur upstream and        downstream of Syk activation in the BCR signal transduction        pathway However although these cells carry a highly        active Syk kinase no evidence for downstream signaling was        found These data indicate that activation of Syk kinase        enzymatic activity in cells is insufficient for signal        transduction                    Results                  BCR engagement induces apoptosis and Syk          activation          Stimulation through the BCR has been shown to induce          changes in cell growth and viability in several B cell          systems including the human Daudi chicken DT and          mouse WEHI and BCL            B B cell lymphomas                    For example stimulation of BCL            B through the BCR suppressed          exponential population growth in cell culture Figure          A Using flow cytometry to measure membrane          permeability and DNA content of cells BCR stimulation          resulted in a fold increase  to  in the          proportion of apoptotic cells after  hrs Figure          B          BCRmediated tyrosine kinase activation is thought to          be involved in the signal transduction cascades that give          rise to these changes in cell growth and viability              To determine if BCR engagement under these conditions          leads to Syk kinase activation increasing amounts of          antiIgM were added to cultured BCL            B cells An           in vitro Syk specific          immunecomplex kinase assay was used to measure changes          in Syk activity in response to BCR stimulation Figure          A In unstimulated and control treated BCL            B cells lanes  and  low          basal levels of Syk activity were detected The          autophosphorylation activity of Syk increased          dramatically with the addition of antiIgM Syk activity          responded in a dose dependent manner and reached a          plateau at  g lane  in which activity was  fold          higher than in unstimulated cells          The kinetics of BCRinduced Syk activation was          analyzed to determine the rates of Syk kinase activation          and inactivation following initial engagement of the BCR          Figure B Maximal Syk activation occurred within  min          of receptor engagement lane  and decreased to          intermediate levels at times thereafter lanes  and           Additional experiments revealed that even  hour after          BCR stimulation Syk activity remained slightly elevated          in comparison with unstimulated cells data not          shown          The increase in Syk activity in response to BCR          engagement in BCL            B was accompanied by an increase          in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk protein in cells          Figure C No phosphorylated tyrosine residues were          detected on Syk in unstimulated or control treated cells          lanes  and  Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk          peaked after  seconds of BCR stimulation lane  and          decreased by  minutes lane  The rapid induction of          tyrosine phosphorylation and its subsequent reduction          paralleled the kinetics of Syk kinase activity Figure          B                          Expression of a KAF mutant Syk results in a          dominant positive effect          BCRmediated apoptosis was preceded by an increase in          Syk kinase activity in BCL            B Syk has also been implicated          in BCRinduced apoptosis found in the chicken B lymphoma          line DT     To determine the role of Syk kinase          activation in the apoptotic response in BCL            B overexpression of a mutant          form of Syk was used in an effort to alter the level of          Syk activation following BCR engagement Sitespecific          mutations were placed in two regions of Syk A lysine at          amino acid position  predicted to be critical for          kinase activity was replaced by an alanine Figure A          Three carboxyterminal tyrosines positions           hypothesized to play regulatory roles were replaced by          phenylalanines Based on the effects of similar mutations          in other kinases it was expected that the combination of          these replacements in KAFSyk might produce a          dominant negative effect          BCL            B cells were infected with          defective retroviruses expressing wildtype or KAF          mutant Syk Clones expressing varying levels of wildtype          or mutant Syk mRNA were identified using a threeprimer          reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RTPCR          assay Figure B Using this approach PCR products          differing in size were simultaneously amplified from the          transgene and the endogenous syk cDNAs in the same PCR          reaction KAFSyk expression varied relative to          endogenous Syk and ranged from undetectable levels          Figure C lanes  to equivalent expression levels          lane  The highest transgene expression was found in          clone           The ICKA was used to determine the effect of          KAFSyk expression on endogenous Syk Syk activity          was measured in parental BCL            B Figure D lanes  and          cells that express the KAFSyk molecule lanes             Surprisingly cells that expressed the KAFSyk          molecule displayed constitutive Syk activity in          unstimulated cells lanes  and  A correlation          between constitutive kinase activity and mRNA expression          levels of KAFSyk was observed compare Figure          Cwith Figure D clones with higher levels of          KAFSyk mRNA eg clone  had higher levels          of constitutive kinase activity while clones with lower          levels of KAF Syk mRNA eg clones            and  had lower levels of constitutive kinase          activity Thus it appeared that introduction of this          mutant form of Syk resulted in a dominant positive effect          on kinase activity rather than a dominant negative          effect          To determine if the observed Syk activity is an          artefact of the           in vitro assay a series of immune          complex kinase assays of Syk precipitated from mixtures          of lysates was performed Most significantly a mixture          of a lysate from unstimulated BCL            B cells harbouring wildtype Syk          with a lysate from unstimulated DT expressing the          KA F mutant Syk see below at   and           ratios showed no activity in the immune complex kinase          assay data not shown These data indicate that the          mutant Syk protein must be expressed together with the          wildtype enzyme in cells to generate the dominant          positive phenotype and suggest that its effect is          indirect Although we cannot rule out the possibility          that the kinase activation is occurring during the          isolation procedure the results of the mixing experiment          suggest that the wildtype Syk enzyme is active           in vivo under these conditions          To determine if expression of the KAFSyk mutant          resulted in a change in BCR responsiveness the kinetics          of Syk activation were measured in clones  and           following BCR stimulation Figure E Incubation with          antiIgM induced a rapid increase and delayed reduction          in Syk activity with kinetics similar to that of control          clones Although the basal levels of Syk activity were          elevated in clones that expressed the KAFSyk          molecule the cells were still responsive to BCR          signaling          To determine if the constitutive Syk activity observed          in unstimulated cells carrying the KAF transgene          was accompanied by constitutive Syk tyrosine          phosphorylation the levels of phosphotyrosine on Syk          were determined by immunoblotting after          immunoprecipitation Figure F Syk from unstimulated          BCL            B and vector control clones had          undetectable levels of phosphotyrosine lanes  and           upper panel Syk from unstimulated clones carrying          the KAF transgene which had constitutive Syk          activity also had undetectable levels of tyrosine          phosphorylation lane    and  upper panel          Thus despite constitutive Syk activity observed in these          infectants tyrosine phosphorylation did not correlate          with activity compare lanes  and  of Figure Dwith          lanes  and  of Figure F Syk from all clones          analyzed became tyrosine phosphorylated after BCR          stimulation lanes    and  It was possible that          more Syk in the immunoprecipitate was required for          detection by the antiphosphotyrosine antibody However          even when more protein was present in the          immunoprecipitate little if any phosphotyrosine was          detected in unstimulated cells lanes  and  These          results indicate that Syk activation does not require          tyrosine phosphorylation          Two hypotheses were considered to explain the high          level of Syk autophosphorylation in the ICKA In          unstimulated clones expressing the KAFSyk          molecule the possibility existed that the intense band          observed in the ICKA Figure Dlanes   and  was          not due to increased Syk activity but rather to the          ability of the background levels of active endogenous Syk          to preferentially phosphorylate the KAFSyk          molecule due to possible changes in its threedimensional          structure If the kinase activity of Syk was truly higher          in cells expressing KAFSyk enhanced          phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate would also be          observed To examine the ability of Syk from cells that          expressed KAFSyk to phosphorylate an exogenous Syk          target cbGST was added to the Syk ICKA Figure           lower panels The exogenous substrate was phosphorylated          by Syk from unstimulated clones expressing the          KAFSyk molecule lane  lower panel          demonstrating that the Syk enzyme isolated from these          cells was highly active          Although activated endogenous Syk was the likely          source of the constitutive Syk activity observed in          clones that expressed the KAFSyk molecule the          possibility remained that the activity might originate          from the KAFSyk molecule itself As proof that the          KAFSyk molecule was inactive as predicted          KAFSyk and wildtype Syk expression constructs were          transfected into           syk negative DT cells and          activity measured by the ICKA Figure  While wildtype          human Syk was capable of autophosphorylation lane           upper panel the KAFSyk mutant was not lanes           and  demonstrating that this molecule was kinasedead          This result indicates that the constitutive Syk activity          identified in BCL            B clones expressing KAFSyk          was likely due to endogenous Syk and not the          KAFSyk mutant          Expression of the KAFSyk molecule resulted in          constitutive activation of Syk However overexpression          of a fulllength unmutated Syk might also generate the          same phenotype To determine if the constitutive          phenotype was a result of the specific mutations          introduced or if overexpression of a fulllength Syk          molecule was sufficient to give high basal kinase          activity Syk activity was analyzed from BCL            B cells that expressed a wildtype          human Syk transgene Figure  The levels of wildtype          human Syk expression were determined using the          threeprimer RTPCR assay described earlier Figure A          Shown are representative clones that expressed low levels          or equivalent levels of human Syk mRNA as compared with          the levels of endogenous Syk mRNA lanes  and  upper          panel The levels of Syk activity in unstimulated cells          expressing wildtype Syk were indistinguishable from the          levels in unstimulated controls Figure B compare lanes           and  None of the clones analyzed contained          elevated constitutive Syk activity in unstimulated cells          demonstrating that this phenotype requires the presence          of the unique mutations introduced                          Constitutive Syk activity is insufficient for          downstream signaling          In           syk deficient DT cells BCR          induced apoptosis was abrogated indicating that Syk was           necessary for this cellular          response     Having established cells with          constitutive Syk activity it was now possible to          establish if Syk activation is           sufficient for any of the signaling          responses However no impact on cell growth in culture          was found in clones with high constitutive Syk activity          nor was the growth suppressive effect of antiIgM          treatment enhanced Figure A Likewise no significant          difference in apoptosis was observed between clones with          constitutive Syk activity and controls Figure B          Thus Syk kinase activity alone was insufficient to          signal a cellular response in BCL            B However the presence of Syk          kinase activity was still expected to lead to increased          phosphorylation of protein targets in the absence of          stimulation through the BCR To examine this possibility          the levels of protein phosphotyrosine were evaluated by          immunoblotting Figure C Basal levels of          phosphotyrosinecontaining protein were detected in all          clones analyzed lanes  and  However no          increase was observed in cells with constitutive Syk          activity After stimulation of BCR many intracellular          proteins became highly phosphorylated on tyrosine to          equivalent levels in all clones regardless of the level          of Syk kinase activity lanes    and  These data          indicate that despite elevated basal and induced Syk          kinase activity in clones carrying the KAFSyk          mutant global phosphorylation of cellular proteins was          not increased          The antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot used is a          relatively crude measure of Syk kinase activity           in vivo  The possibility remained          that any specific effects of constitutive Syk on its          downstream targets might be masked by the combined          effects of the other tyrosine kinases activated in          response to BCR signaling To focus the investigation on          downstream events of Syk activation the phosphorylation          state of PLC an authentic direct downstream target of          Syk     was evaluated No PLC phosphorylation was          detected in unstimulated clones containing constitutive          Syk activity Figure D lanes  and  upper panel In          contrast PLC was rapidly and highly phosphorylated          after stimulation of BCR lanes  and  As in the total          cellular phosphotyrosine analysis the levels of          phosphotyrosine on PLC were indistinguishable between          control and experimental cell lines                            Discussion        Previous studies have identified apoptosis and cell        cycle arrest as mechanisms of BCRinduced growth arrest in        BCL          B cells     The studies        presented here have demonstrated that stimulation of the        BCR resulted in the rapid and transient activation of the        nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk Previous studies have        implicated Syk in BCRinduced apoptosis in other cell lines             To examine the putative role of Syk in        BCRinduced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in BCL          B we attempted to alter Syk        activity through the expression of mutant forms of Syk        When the KAFSyk mutant was coexpressed with        endogenous Syk in BCL          B cells a constitutive Syk        activation phenotype was observed The presence of elevated        Syk activity allowed us to evaluate the role of Syk        activation on the growth and viability of BCL          B and on other biochemical changes        associated with BCR signaling To our surprise no evidence        for downstream signaling was found in cells with high        levels of Syk kinase activity        Two novel observations were obtained from these studies        First expression of the KAFSyk molecule in BCL          B results in constitutive        activation of endogenous Syk Since KAFSyk was        enzymatically inactive when transfected into Sykdeficient        DT cells the observed constitutive kinase activity must        be derived from endogenous Syk and not from the        KAFSyk protein Mutant molecules that inhibit the        activation or function of the wildtype counterpart in the        same cell have been defined as dominantnegative molecules        Since KAFSyk has an activating effect on endogenous        wildtype Syk we propose that KAFSyk is a        dominantpositive molecule        It is likely that the replacement of the three        carboxyterminal tyrosine residues with phenylalanine is        necessary for the dominantpositive phenotype Zeitlmann et        al found that transfection of a mutant Syk expression        construct carrying only the F alteration into a T cell        lines could overcome the need for TCR occupancy for IL        expression in PMAtreated cells     However since the        mutant Syk used retained kinase activity these studies        could not distinguish between a gainoffunction effect        versus a dominantpositive effect as found here        The mechanism by which the KAFSyk molecule        activates endogenous Syk is unknown One hypothesis is that        a negative regulator of Syk is bound and sequestered by the        KAFSyk molecule By sequestering this negative        regulator expression of the mutant Syk molecules gives        rise to the activation of the endogenous wildtype protein        in the absence of specific stimulation leading to a        constitutively active Syk phenotype Several negative        regulators of Syk have been reported BCRinduced        interaction between Cbl and Syk increases the        susceptibility of Syk to proteolysis     possibly        through enhancement of ubiquitination     Expression        of a dominantnegative SHP phosphatase in the mature        murine B cell line K resulted in an increase in        BCRinduced Syk kinase activity as measured by Cb        phosphorylation in an ICKA and enhanced BCRinduced Ca        fluxes     It remains to be determined if        interference with any of these known regulatory proteins is        responsible for the dominantpositive effect        The second novel observation that Syk kinase enzymatic        activity was insufficient for signal transduction suggests        that multiple biochemical processes may be required for the        Sykdependent step of signal transduction Presently it is        unclear what biochemical changes other than enzymatic        activation are required However in light of the present        model of signaling through the BCR perhaps appropriate        subcellular localization to the BCR protein complex and the        ITAMs of CDb Ig is also required In support of this        hypothesis Syk did not coprecipitate with IgM in        KAFSykcontaining cells without stimulation data        not shown This is not surprising since the ITAMs in CD        which are proposed to be docking sites for Syk are        unlikely to be phosphorylated in the absence of BCR        stimulation since phosphorylation of these residues likely        requires activation of Src family tyrosine kinases        expressed in B cells Therefore despite constitutive Syk        kinase activity the ITAMs in the        dominantpositiveexpressing cells remain        hypophosphorylated because kinases that are upstream of Syk        andor are Syk independent are not active in the absence of        BCR crosslinking        This result implies that in addition to enzymatic        activation localization of Syk to the BCR might be        required for functional signal transduction There is        precedence for this model Mutation of tyrosine  in Syk        to glutamic acid had two effects First the YE mutation        resulted in constitutive activity of Syk Second molecules        with the YE mutations did not coimmunoprecipitate with        the BCR     A second example involves an         in vitro model of histamine release        in the Sykdeficient RBLH cell line     When        tyrosines  and  were mutated and introduced into        Sykdeficient RBLH cells these Syk molecules were        capable of phosphorylation of cb substrate in an ICKA        However despite this activity there was no high affinity        IgE receptor FcRIinduced degranulation Further        analysis demonstrated neither increases in phosphotyrosine        nor phosphorylation of PLC        Alternatively the absence of signal transduction in the        presence of Syk activity may be related to its ability to        interact with its downstream targets Within Syk there are        two phosphotyrosinebinding SH domains allowing for        proteinprotein interactions In addition phosphotyrosine        residues in Syk would provide additional sites for        proteinprotein interactions Perhaps further modification        is necessary to increase its affinity for downstream        binding partners eg BLNK or PLC        The absence of signaling in the presence of constitutive        enzymatic activity described for Syk in different systems        implies that execution of the Sykdependent step in this        signaling cascade is a multistep process Multiple        requirements for progression through this step in the        signal transduction pathway may serve to integrate the        cellular response to multiple environmental cues In this        case the ultimate cellular response to the activation of        the BCR signaling pathway is cell death Each of these        required steps may provide a regulatory site where other        signal transduction pathways could intersect the default        response to antigenic stimulation giving rise to an altered        cellular outcome                    Conclusions        In summary here we describe the use of a mutant Syk        construct to produce a dominantpositive effect on        endogenous Syk activation in the absence of BCR engagement        The presence of a dominantpositive effect under these        conditions suggests that the Syk kinase is kept inactive in        resting cells by an active suppression mechanisms which is        disrupted by the presence of the KAFSyk mutant The        specific target for this dominantpositive effect remains        to be identified Although the Syk enzyme is active under        these conditions it lacks any detectable phosphorylation        on tyrosine residues This observation indicates that the        current paradigm that Syk activation results from tyrosine        phosphorylation may be incorrect Finally the presence of        a highly active Syk enzyme in cells was insufficient for        downstream signal transduction as evidenced by a lack of        change in global tyrosine phosphorylation phosphorylation        of PLC or enhanced spontaneous or induced apoptosis        These data suggest that the Sykdependent step in signal        transduction requires biochemical changes in addition to        enzymatic activation perhaps proper localization of the        active enzyme to a signaling receptor complex                    Methods
