                                 Quibbles and Corrections            Dear Culturebox            Im not sure why booksellers dont want the hard numbers but theirinstincts are dead right Soundscan has done nothing but harm to the creativeend of rock  rollnot because it has made information available butbecause it has made information available too quickly to people who in turnovervalue the importance of information gotten too quickly            Put another way Soundscan has killed off word of mouth It used to be thata critic could get behind an album or an influential DJ or a cohort ofcollege kidsand bingo an interesting album becomes a hit album Now itswhambam An album isnt catching on in a week or two as measured bySoundscan and the plug gets pulled on promotion the CD gets pulled fromracks etc            Further the industry itself starts pushing albums that will openbigalbums with a catchy single and maybe little else and did somebody saysynergy soundtrack albums Look at this weeks Pop Top  for the resultsof Soundscan If you want a Lorrie Moore to sneak onto the bestseller listevery once in a while you better hope Bookscan never catches on GerryMarzorati                                       Dear Gerry                                       I think theres a risk of such shortsighted thinking but I dont thinkit would prevail in the end There just wouldnt be enough blockbusters to keepthe book market going as a blockbusteronly concern If all publishers andbooksellers pursued that strategy in the end some of them would be forced toreenter the quality books market just to get themselves back in the game Itend to think thats whats happening in Hollywood actually which is why thewhole indie scene has become so hot                                       In response to your Lorrie Moore point Id think Bookscan would have theopposite effect By allowing publishers target their marketing dollars moreeffectively Bookscan would help them sell the smaller books Thepublisher could pinpoint exactly where Lorrie Moore sells and dispatch herthere on a book tour could test whether her books were responsive toadvertising and what kind a test run on Moore might also work for Alice Munroand so on In short with real numbers publishers would be able to maximizethe audience for a serious book Culturebox            Dear Culturebox            With the consumer trade book category exceeding  billion in  inretail dollars the stakes are now too high not to begin to finetune themarketing mix For every  books shipped in  over  came back to thepublisher for full credit and a one percent reduction in returns would save theindustry over  million per year            Its important to note though that SoundScans launch in the music worldin  was not an easy task Several of the same issues that you address inFuzzy Logic existed in the music industry in the early s            Also the scanning device that you mention has existed for over two decadesand has been utilized by package goods manufactures to target market theirproducts onto the shelves of retailers across the world The system is the UPCor in the case of books a EANISBN number that when a book is scanned by aretailer identifies the book format suggested price point genre etcTom Fogarty Soundscan executive in charge of Bookscan
