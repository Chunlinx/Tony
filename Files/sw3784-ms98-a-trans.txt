            yeah as far as im concerned and probably apt that your calls at this time because we just got through watching uh Reasonable Doubts which had a you know capital case in it   uhhuh   and uh  my i personally have uh my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony   i do too   mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day   umhum why is it you know i im im in that same i think if its uh if its a convicted  if its a convicted uh felon on parole   umhum   uh and he goes out and and commits another crime or kills somebody i you know i i feel the same way i dont think i think that person is is beyond uh rehabilitation and and he should be taken out   well i i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation   uhhuh   but i do know that some people almost all people usually die before that point   umhum   they just get too old   umhum   um as far as capital punishment on on its own merits i have the trouble with the way its applied i think it should be applied  on a little bit more fair manner uh  and ive ive said this very often and i believe it to be the a a very true axiom so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent   uhhuh   because if youre  if youre black and you kill a white guy youre going to fry period they will kill you   right yeah   if youre black and you kill a black guy you know its you know two hundred hours of community service   yeah you dont hear you dont hear too much of that of those cases   yeah well its a social disease that we have called one upsmanship   yeah   you know were the majority so we can do whatever the hell we wanna do   yeah thats right   and youre the minority and youre stuck with it but uh   huh   you know we had this in the Vietnam war you know we had  you know population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent   right   but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent   huh   the handwritings on the wall there isnt it   yep it sure is   you know but thats another issue altogether   yeah its   as as far as capital punishment i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment i think the guy should have ninety days and if he cant produce evidence not argument but evidence   umhum see the only thing i dont you know i dont understand i guess i i dont understand our judicial system uh as it is right now because i        you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution execution i mean how you know is there   well that that goes back to when uh America was a a colony of England      umhum   in England you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty you know the judge said hes guilty kill him well there there were some people that uh had a problem with that   uhhuh   because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed and hell say you know hey that guy did it you know not me   right yeah   and uh or hell have somebody lie for him you know people lie its a strange thing but they do that   yeah   and to prevent that kind of misuse of power they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap   umhum hm   and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy look at that guy uh at E Systems   yep   they were going to they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit   yeah   he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were you know they werent dope dealers they werent drug fiends they were employees of a an establishment that had a very high level of security sensitivity and these were really responsible people   hm   you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy          you know they all look the same to me you know   yeah   big lips flat nose yep that was him      yep what do you think about um uh convicted um
