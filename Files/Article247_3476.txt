                                 Net Gains                        Dear Joe            I am glad you bit my wellbaited hook about the impact of the Internetsince it has become one of our most frothy debates these days In fact I justgot back from a book tour with two other technology writers one of whom heldyour exact sentiments about the current development of the Web He and Idebated intensely over the course of two weeks and we never really changed eachothers mind I ended up calling him a whiney Luddite and he said I wasWebaddled In any case you hit all the high points of the arguments pro andcon that are taking place so let me address them one by one            First you are right that the Web is being usedand aggressivelybyfomenters of hate who are spewing their poisonous attitudes out to the widerworld using these powerful new technologies My general attitude is still thatthis is probably a good thing because Ive always held the position thatsunlight is the best disinfectant and all speech needs to be spoken All thesesites are surely loathsome to see but havent these attitudes been inexistence since the dawn of time Frankly I would rather be able to moreclearly see exactly what these sites are spouting than to have them hide awaydangerously in dark corners ready to pounce For the vast majority of peoplebeing able to witness this dreck tends to remove its mystery and points out itsidiocy only more clearly When you know that the Internet seems to bring outthe worst in people I think your problem may be with the darker side ofhumanity more than anything else            Second you are right that it is unlikely that the Internet will live up toits potential But what does really Not me and not you and not television andnot anything else Some of what is on the Web right now is silly somedepressing some crazy and some just plain stupid A lot of what is beingcreated now is aimed only at getting people to buy more stuff they probablydont need And Amazons oneclick shopping AOLs Buddy List and eBaysbidding frenzies are not going to change the world for the better            But I firmly posit that the increasingly free flow of information that theInternet allows can only benefit people in the long run by educating them onthe wider world outside their windows What is undeniably powerful is theability to selfpublish for low cost I cant own a telephone company or atelevision network or even a fine newspaper like the Wall StreetJournal  but I can put up anything I want to on the Web To me it doesntreally matter if people go there or not Perhaps all this communication willonly result in pointless cacophony but I like the noise            I am troubled by the kind of behavior that the Internet seems to engenderand am often offended by the cruel and mindless blather that is too easy tofind The stock chat rooms are a good example since most of them have turnedinto places of little value But I encounter rage and misbehavior when I driveto work every morning as people seem to have lost a lot of the civility thatused to rule But again I dont think the Internet is to blame for this Itsjust a fact of life that people can be beastly            CheersKara
