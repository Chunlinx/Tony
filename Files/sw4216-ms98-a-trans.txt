                 okay i guess we can just go ahead and start   sure enough   so what i did while they were uh a matter they i made some notes while they were calling around and they called quite a few different number before anybody answered   ooh   is uh some notes that i wrote down about our budget and that is uh the biggest problem that we have is that uh my wife and i both work and i get a fixed amount and im paid once every two weeks and my pay check always the same   okay umhum   she also get paid once every two weeks but her pay checks dont come at the same time mine do   okay   and she doesnt get a fixed amount every everytime she gets paid   oh geez   and so trying to put together a budget from pay dates that are different and change all the time and where her amount change uh has been probably been one of the biggest budget problems that that we have   wow   and uh so what weve done is kind of taken everything that we have had to pay out over a an extended period of time and then tried to average it   umhum   so that we could approximate how much each bill would be and then budget our pay checks accordingly base on the minimum amount that we would expect to receive   okay   and thats thats been fairly effective   what happens if you get hit with some extraordinary expense   hum you mean like recently  right   well i mean you know  you know before you have a chance to say well geez we have a couple of months where we been low and put some off uh in the bank   exactly and thats uh that recently happen we had to have break jobs on both of our cars and uh so then we end up doing a couple of things uh dipping into saving is one   uhhuh ooh yeah   and uh scrimping on other thing to uh get the extra money and then uh also weve got uh a an investment plan with a mutual fund   umhum umhum   and thats kind of like a savings account so between all of those varies sources and uh that is obviously not a very good way of doing thing   sure   so uh   well i mean you dont want to do it that way you rather just keep it all in the in the bank but uh  my gosh no i you know its its funny because when they came on they talked about   no right   a home budget and what not i stopped and thought to myself geez we dont have a  or turns out that you know   dont even have one   uh my wife and i also work   umhum   and uh she work for the federal government and i work almost for the federal government and but its you know fixed income basically you know from pay check to pay check how much youre going to get   yeah right umhum   and uh im the only guy that pays any bills   umhum   i mean she carries the check book but when it comes time  everybody who mails a bill like gas company and the telephone and all of that kind of stuff comes to the house and one of them gets plopped in to my mailbox and then once a week or once every two weeks ill sit down and and write checks   uhhuh hum   well just recently weve weve found out that um weve had her money direct deposited to one account and my money direct deposited to another account   a different account huh umhum   correct and weve been trying to live off my money which is not working out   right so you can the her money and then save it or right   exactly weve been trying to well basically we wanted to use her money just to pay the mortgage on the house   umhum   you know that was that way we wouldnt have to worry about the mortgage it would be covered and then we would have our living expenses on mine     uhhum   and it just hasnt work out you know and it i ive read these budget book and they say well you know you sit down and you figure out how much its costing you to live and all that kind of stuff but   right umhum   uh what ive notice is that its extremely difficult for us to come up with a   right   uh it usually it it well cost it cost us you know uh five hundred dollars a month to live it doesnt work that  one month its five hundred the next month its   a valuable uh budget yeah umhum right umhum   its a thousand because you get the car insurance bill and then and then it goes down to two hundred because uh youre off on vacation or something or you know you you went traveling and and you didnt spend as much but then you come back and it goes up again and i mean its uh thats been my problem   umhum hum weve got bill for example like the uh car insurance you mentioned that come and and this is the other problem when it comes to budgeting is that we have bills that dont come on a uh monthly or or once every two week bases like we get paid the the car insurance comes every three months   right   so that means that uh uh everytime because we havent uh disciplined ourselves where we can have a uh certain amount set aside each month for when that bill comes we end up       paying that whole bill every every three or four month and then that cuts into everything else on it   um yeah well i do have to say that uh when you know when we were real serious about budgeting the money and doing all of this my uh sister sent me a book and it was the book uh Wealth Without Risk by Charles Given   umhum   and i do have to admit he had one suggestion in there that really
