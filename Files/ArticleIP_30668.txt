                                  Shooting Script            You have to be true to yourself as a writer but Idont think you have a responsibility beyond that said Brian Helgeland theopening speaker at Guns Dont Kill People  Writers Do a panel discussionsponsored by the Writers Guild of America earlier this month Hopefully thatsenough if you take yourself seriously Enough for what or for whom Helgelanddidnt specify The writerdirector of the ultraviolent Mel Gibson moviePayback squirmed uncomfortably in his chair on a dais in a Santa Monicahotel ballroom a few hundred yards from the Pacific Ocean pondering thequestion of whether people who make violent movies are morally responsible forinciting realworld violence Dressed in frayed shorts and sandals blond hairflowing Helgeland looked as if he had stashed his surfboard behind the stageand couldnt wait to escape into the waves crashing outside            On the opposite end of the stage was Motion PictureAssociation of America Chairman Jack Valenti suited and tied camerareadyand eager to pontificate Other panelists included scripters of major screenmayhem Steven De Souza  Die Hard  Callie Khouri  Thelma andLouise  Miguel TejadaFlores  Fright Night Part II  WilliamMastrosimone  Extremities  Sy Gomberg  When Willie Comes MarchingHome  moderator Dan Petrie Jr  Beverly Hills Cop  and producerSean Daniel  The Mummy  The audience was packed with worried industryinsiders still reeling from President Clintons justannounced call for aJustice DepartmentFTC investigation to determine if Hollywood markets violentproduct to children For this we need a federal investigation Does anyonethink it was overs who bought  million worth of tickets to TheMatrix  The town was awash in rumors of imminent subpoenas and talk ofDemocratic Sen Joseph Lieberman of Connecticuts threats of criminalprosecution and censorship            Adopting the cigarettesdont cause cancer posture studio heads have declined credit for encouragingchildren to commit murder Apparently they were counting on Clintonwhosecoffers are stuffed with Hollywood cashto go easy on them On Valentisrecommendation they snubbed Clintons invitation to a White House conferenceon violence in the media letting slip their best chance to get out in front ofthe issue Now Clinton appeared to be punishing them for their hubris Youturn down the president of the United States at your own peril says one movieproducer Valenti should know that He worked for Lyndon Johnson            While the Hollywood suits block feelings of guilt withreiterations of their commitment to shareholders the Writers Guild talkrevealed a creative community roiled by emotions ranging from angry defiance toextreme remorse to abject terror Sparring over their role in instigatinghighschool gun battles they fell into lock step on one point God save usfrom regulation by Bob Barr and Tom DeLay If the First Amendment has lostluster elsewhere it is ever the rallying cry in Hollywood where free speechcan be relied upon to protect profitable dreck At the same time thisoverwhelmingly liberal community happy to jettison the Second Amendment issteamed that Washington has gone soft on the gun lobby            I feel that theviewpoint I just heard is a very dangerous ivory towerism said Mastrosimonethe prickliest conscience in the group countering Helgelands be true toyourself as a writer remarks The people who say its all our fault areextremists and I think the people who say we have no responsibilities are alsoextremists If were really looking for the truth well find it somewhere inbetween It is unquestionable there is a causeandeffect between what goes uponscreen and behaviorthere are thousands of scientific studies since the sthat people choose to ignore because its really not lucrative to obey themAnd we have become very spoiled because we enjoy this freedom and we dontwant anybody on the outside telling us what to do            De Souza was up next a flinty showman who played the sceneaggressively This is the first time Ive ever volunteered to come and be ascapegoat he said De Souza disputed the link between screen violence andrealworld violence but also ranted against gun proliferation arguing thatJapanese and British kids watch violent movies but dont go out and kill eachother Like a fifthgrader at showandtell De Souza held up the Nazipropaganda magazine Signal and pointed out sanitized images of Hitleryouth groups Here you had the most wholesome upstanding media you canimagine and meanwhile offstage is the most mechanized bloodbath in historyhe said He spread the moral responsibility around noting that legally thestudio is the author of a movie I tell you every picture I have done hascome out more violent than what I wrote I have sat at the screening of one ofmy movies and been stunned at the level of mayhem that somebody put onscreenSo now do I feel guilty He didnt answer his own question            Khouri a native ofPaducah Ky site of a major school shooting cited the familiar litany ofparental neglect breakdown of education and community and the Internet ascauses of teen violence Yet she was ambivalent about blaming HollywoodTheres no one person that can be held responsible for this she said Butfor us to sit here and say feed em a steady diet of whatever they want andthen when they act out its your fault  it doesnt add up Were trying tomake sense out of something that will never make sense People read TheCatcher in the Rye and shoot John Lennon Theres always going to besomebody who is going to misinterpret something Khouri added that she wasstunned at Thelma and Louise s first screening when the audience cheeredthe heroine for shooting a male attacker I had hoped for a completelydifferent reaction from the audience a realization that this character hadjust sealed her fate in a horrible way I was terrified And I realized that Icant control how my work is perceived After Thelma and Louise  Khourichallenged herself to write a movie with no guns in it Its harder shesays            Do we want the world to be as frightened as so many of usare and so many children are asked Gomberg who organized the Committee toEnd Violence after the Jonesboro Ark killings Do we have the right toimpose this gun culture on the world They all want to be like us I dontthink we do Gomberg advocated the elimination of excessive or gratuitous orunpunished violence in movies and television De Souza rankled barked Whenyou say unpunished violence it reminds me of the old green code UndeterredGomberg continued We have to aim our sights higher  I hate to use theterm aim sights  but the easiest thing in the world to write is a villainyou get the audience so involved in hating that you scream inside for the heroto demolish him Creatively we can find ways to get the same kind of tensionsand passions going            By that definitionRichard                the Third is a terrible evil play responded De Souzaknowing that no discussion of violence in art is complete without an invocationof the Bard It spends all of its time making us hate hate that villain Andtheres a gory bloody end and a lot of bodies Lets not even go to TitusAndronicus  That got a big laugh which encouraged Helgeland to drop theother bit of Shakespearean boilerplate What if a teenager who was hopelesslyin love saw Romeo and Juliet and decided to kill himself Should we notperform Romeo and Juliet any more            Patiently awaiting his moment Valenti erupted in a burstof his usual flowery oratory If Ive learned one thing in the movie businessand the world of politics he intoned it is that the First Amendmentthe spare unadorned words bleached dry of all ambiguityis the one clause in theConstitution that guarantees all others And its not easy to be a FirstAmendment person because then you have to allow into this marketplace thatwhich you believe to be soiling and meretricious and tawdry and unwholesome andsometimes vile And then sometimes people get so vexed they want to call theircongressman and say pass a law to stop all this stuff But I always say tothis person be wary and be cautious Before you make that call remember thatwhen a tyrant first appears he always comes as your protector Hoots ofapproval rose up from the crowd            Billed as a session ofselfscrutiny the discussion was turning into a call to arms against enemiesof the First Amendment Daniel wrapping up the session soberly reminded hiscolleagues that those who have abused their absolute freedoms by making moviesthat are soiling and unwholesome have only themselves to blame if Hollywoodsera of unregulated bliss is over All of us have to understand that we arecitizens whether we like it or not he warned Both Steve and Jack haverendered articulate and righteous defenses of the Bill of Rights and theConstitution But none of us should leave the room without an understandingthat for parents all over the country the fear is real the problems ofraising kids are real            The ballroom emptied leaving the days topic frustratinglyunprobed No one had bothered to press Valenti on whether the government shouldproperly give more weight to the safety of its citizens than to free speechNeither had there been any mention of the roots of Hollywoods love affair withviolence As writeractor Harry Shearer who spoke later on a panel on comedypointed out The thing that is rarely mentioned is that because this is apuritanical society and you cant show sex we eroticize violence It startedwith The Wild Bunch  We sexualized violence we made it beautiful            Was Littleton a watershed Under pressure fromPresident Clinton the leading theater trade association says it will now barthe under crowd from Rrated movies rumors have it that the MPAA will bestricter about slapping R ratings onto violent movies Disney plans to stopfeaturing guns in its marketing materials and studios have canceled thedevelopment of some teen horror movies            Are these serious measures by moviemakers andpoliticians With so much money and so many votes at stake both Hollywood andWashington are driven by fear and committed to appearances If there were alittle bit less finger pointing and a little more assumption of responsibilityfor a problem whose causes are many it would be easier to have faith
