                surprised to get anybody this time of day but ive been ive been trying all different times and i dont get anybody at five thirty i dont get anybody at nine at night so i thought ill try a really weird     uhhuh oh well im at work and i just happened to walk back into my office ive been gone for a little while   oh  well well i go to school so im home certain days and um i really havent been making many of these phone calls have you got   uhhuh i dont make i havent ever made any i just receive them   have you have you received many   here i havent here lately yeah   yeah it its uh well the first time we were on this it came just about every day i never had to make one they just always came   yeah yeah exactly   people must be tired of it or something well well anyway i guess were supposed to discuss this uh       subject what do you think   well i never gave it any thought myself i was hoping you could tell me what you thought     oh well i dont have any objection to people doing that i think it might be good for them but as a mother of   uhhuh   two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent is im just concerned about their safety more than because if they do good works in America theyll probably be sent to a ghetto   exactly umhum umhum umhum   and if they were sent to a third world country i couldnt help but worry worried you know   yeah yeah   but that would be my main objection   umhum   um   i dont know i think maybe its it should stay on a voluntary basis   i dont think itll probably never happen but   yeah  yeah i i i think it would be good for uh everyone to do something like that but i i guess i dont feel like it should be something forced upon you   yeah well it it probably wont i dont i dont even know how wed pay for it anyway we cant uh     umhum umhum   seem to pay for all the things we have going now  thats another consideration   umhum exactly   but uh i dont know some some kids are so spoiled nowadays it might be a real eye opener you know   really   i mean sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes and then they think theyre just kind of shocked at that side of town you know i probably lived in one of those when my i was a little girl   uhhuh umhum i have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while  wouldnt it though   oh boy thatd be an eye opener wouldnt it i mean right next to us is such a pitiful country   uhhuh it is   i know sometimes i wish wed help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries i never even heard of   uhhuh umhum i know it   seems to me we uh it be to our benefit to strengthen that country   umhum umhum   right on our borders   umhum   but what do i know right  im just sitting at home and and uh doing laundry today and certainly not up nobody has called me from Washington  oh but um       oh shoot   anyway how did you get on this program   i work at TI   oh you do work at TI oh youre in Lewisville oh yeah i just went by that place we were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost and  we went by thats the first time id seen it looked really nice a lot of trees there it looked like a pretty little uh site   uhhuh   yeah hang on a minute   sure   hm do you need a bag no i dont think so yeah Patty might okay im back   oh sure   but howd you get on it   did well my husband works at TI over on uh Central uh why were living in Arlington im not so sure but he works over there and thats we did it last time   oh   uhhuh   and uh so  just my daughter and i are registered this time i dont know they didnt even ask him back  that was weird wasnt it   really huh   but like i said i hardly ever get any calls this time and i can never find anybody   uhhuh i dont get too many hm   i so um     the first time i used to get calls from far away too   right umhum   like Maryland and New Jersey and but now it just seems like its in the Dallas Fort Worth area that i get calls from   yeah ive had the same experiences all right around here   umhum umhum   yeah i dont know uh i wonder if they really i dont know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize the all different accents theres just       theres so many within this one town   uhhuh uhhuh   you know even even in some families some people talk a little bit different   oh yeah yeah   my husbands from New Jersey and one of his sisters says things that really sound funny to me and he doesnt pronounce them at all that way and thats one family right         course i think everyb ody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny but you you know how that goes  oh God   oh i agree  oh shoot   well im surprised she hasnt told us to cut it off yet sometimes she says at night   yeah   uh our switch are are overloads so please end your conversation   uhhuh uhhuh   right well well do you have anymore words of wisdom about the subject  you dont have any kids you wanna send over there   no i sure dont no no kids  oh shoot   well it is  well uh i dont know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto well one of them is real idealistic she might   my sister is id be more suited to that than her shes just bugs
