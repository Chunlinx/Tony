          good morning   uh hi you mentioned model railroading that uh ive been watching a program on the Public Broadcasting Station here uh about model railroading have you ever seen that   yes i i always turn on the TV set and it seems like i catch that program in the last five minutes and   uh well its been very interesting   i i think it you know what i see is fascinating and i kind of enjoy it uh ive always had that hobby ever since i was a child   uhhuh   and uh i refuse to get involved because i never had space for a permanent layout   yeah   and then here about five years ago we bought a big old house out in Oaktown Virginia and there was uh there was two basements   wow   there were two two separate furnace rooms and so i took the smaller furnace room and now its full of trains     you should have taken the larger one huh       well uh my uh brother had a Lionel train set he was a a bit older than i and so when i came along i was interested in uh fooling with the train and since he was was past that stage why he didnt have any objections and uh in fact i started doing a layout uh in our garage at one time but i got about as far as sort of painting some uh streets and things on a piece of plywood and putting up a few things and it got to be hot summertime when i gave it up   um   but uh ive always enjoyed uh the train and you know fooling with it and all   do you still have the uh train set   he has it   he has it   yeah i mean since it was his i couldnt very well keep it forever   um   but uh actually i have had an idea not long ago uh hope to build another house some day and i was thinking i might uh incorporate some sort of a display space and ask him if he would let me put the train up you know not not as a working type of thing but just to   put it on display   uhhuh   well those uh the early Lionels can be quite valuable   yeah i dont know what year his was bought but probably around nineteen forty forty two maybe im im just guessing but something like that i would think   yeah well some of those around the war years were uh kind of difficult to get a hold of because Lionel got involved in manufacturing a lot of uh uh war equipment   uhhuh   and uh i think they almost discontinued production uh in nineteen forty two and forty three   oh really   so some of the prewar models are quite valuable   yeah i dont know i dont know if i dont know if he knows i know theres some uh booklets and things you know showing different models and stuff that are quite old that were with it but i dont know if they were original or if they were picked up you know in later years   well i managed to sweet talk my brother out of uh his Lionel train set that uh dated back to about nineteen thirty three   um   and uh hes kind of unhappy ive got it now       but im not going to give it back   yeah thats probably the way it goes sometimes   and i had a uh post uh World War version of the Pennsylvania Electric uh GT locomotives and it happened to be one of the rare paint jobs   oh   so i understand that that locomotive is worth around seven hundred and fifty dollars now   wow   so its its sitting on display on top of my bookcase     it has a prominent spot huh   yeah   well i think those things are neat and and as i say i watch that show and there are some uh really interesting museums around that uh have good displays and uh i said that well if i ever took a trip i you know might ignore some of these museums because a lot of them are called childrens museums or toy museums and   umhum   that wouldnt really catch my attention but if i knew that they had you know really good train layouts i would wanna go and see what they had   well Pennsylvania used to have uh some commercial displays there was one place that was halfway between Harrisburg and Allenstown Pennsylvania in a community called Midway which suggest it was halfway   um   and uh they had a huge room which was probably uh forty feet wide and a hundred and forty feet long uh and the central portion of that room was occupied by one huge O gauge layout running uh uh Lionel train and American Flyer trains   wow huh   and they had done a lot of work on that with uh scenery and buildings and they had trolleys running around and uh a lot of animation in there and uh it was in business for a long long time i dont know it it still maybe in business   it might be   yeah   well um you mentioned another hobby sailing do you have a sailboat   yes uh i bought a uh Bristol thirty five five for my wife   um   and we keep it on the Chesapeake Bay and uh starting next weekend im gonna have to go down and uh fill out for the summer season   yeah   we have a cruise plan to sail from uh Solomon to Maryland up to Philadelphia this summer   uhhuh   about a two week cruise and uh two or three lay days in Philadelphia   oh thatll be nice   they have a a new waterfront uh marina in Philadelphia it isnt as developed as uh Water Side in Norfolk or the Baltimore uh waterfront but uh the marina is only about uh two or three blocks from the historic district   oh   so thats quite uh handy for our our youngsters we can take them up and   yeah   show them Independence Hall the Liberty Bell and uh Franklin uh   yeah and just be right there huh   Franklin Square   yeah well uh were not uh really sailors but i want some summer soon to um hire a sailboat with a captain since were not you know versed in that and uh go to the Caribbean   um well there are some uh good opportunities for that in the British Virgins   right yeah   uh thats uh that is almost an ideal sailing area uh if you have a little even a little bit of experience uh ive seen a number of people go through a uh a cruising class in Annapolis   uhhuh   where they might get uh maybe ten or fifteen hours of sailing experience go down to uh uh British Tortolla and charter a boat for a week and they take it out and have a grand time   yeah   uh its fairly sheltered waters right there and uh you dont need any fancy navigation equipment because you can see all your destinations from one spot   right uh it just sound fascinating to me i would love to just go down ive always liked islands and water and that sort of thing anyway and um been on a couple of big cruise ships so uh you know i kind of had seen it from that point of view but i i think i would like the sailboat   umhum uh ive been there several times uh the first trip uh we flew down and uh chartered a uh Morgan uh forty five   um   and i had fun that then a few years later a guy i was racing with uh decided to take his boat down for a winter season and so i went offshore with him to uh Saint Thomas and then we cruised uh the American Virgins for a week before i flew home   which do you think is best American or British Virgins   i think the better sight seeing is in the uh British Virgins   uhhuh   uh theres uh some very nice places like the bass which is a uh sort of a huge monolithic rocks that you can you can walk up the beach and into these uh enormous caverns that are partially submerged and you can wade in the pools and so forth very popular tourist spot   uhhuh   uh the Bitter End is an excellent resort up in uh which is very easy to get into and theres some very nice reefs in that uh vicinity if you like snorkeling and uh scuba diving   yeah yeah thats neat   and uh there are some very nice resort hotels so you can go in and uh enjoy a very classy dinner uh the Peter Island Yacht Club is uh extremely exclusive like uh i think theyre probably charging five hundred dollars a day for a room now   ooh         thats getting up there   and uh its there kind of a nice place to visit uh uh its better being on a boat than being on land because uh your boat becomes your hotel your uh your dining room your taxi cab and uh everything else   everything yeah thats why i think it would be neat um   well id recommend it   sounds good
