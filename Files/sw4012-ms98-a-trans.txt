              hi   im Bridget   im Paul   nice to meet you   pleased to meet you   where are you   im in Texas   are you so am i where are you in Texas   Dallas   okay im in Lubbock   oh okay   okay are you ready for me to push one   sure anytime   okay   so what do you think about capital punishment   well i think its a necessary uh a necessary tool that uh needs to be used uh to establish justice in some cases and to that that it if used properly   uhhuh   uh i think it can be uh it would it would be a useful deterrent   umhum what do you think about Jeffrey Dahmer like not getting since they dont have it in   yeah well i think that i think there are certain people in society that have no redeeming   yeah   uh worth to them and that its it its a waste for society to continue to support those people those people should be you know disposed of   yeah i know because its like its kind of like a tough call because all they do is sit in jail and the jails are overcrowded you know its like problem upon problem upon problem   thats right   its like you could put them in jail for the rest of his life well all the jails are already overcrowded you know and they add more problems you know since jails are overcrowded they have to reduce you know time to like one third of what youre supposed to do it you know it gets kind of ridiculous   yeah thats right i mean they probably you know we the you know our our justice system is not designed to be either efficient or effective or just you know it its designed   yeah   as a set of artificial rules that you know judges and lawyers play with each other   umhum i know i i guess i could be for it and against it in some ways i mean i think im definitely for it and stuff when i think of someone like like him that killed all those people and has no remorse or anything you know i feel like thats the right thing to do and i guess i would have to say it would be for more circumstances you know   well it it it uh yeah but it you know the the problem is it when when we administer it by you know i i mean like like in Texas we have the death penalty right and they killed a guy a while back and you know hed been in jail for twelve or fifteen years or something like that waiting   uhhuh right   uh you know waiting waiting waiting waiting his sentence   yeah see i think that   what is the point of that   what what there theres no point in it i mean   where did that come from   well it its because its because you know people dont wanna recognize how to make you know how to how to make a punishment effective   yeah   i mean it punishing the person by killing them doesnt do anybody any good   umhum   the only reason the only way it does some good is if it convinces convinces somebody else that they shouldnt do something like that   yeah thats true definitely true   and you know if the guy waits around ten or twenty years or whatever it is you know how is that a deterrent to anybody   see why do you have any clue why that they sit on like death row that long   because the courts require it i mean they they they have said that well everybody has to have certain you know has to have the the the right to appeal well   see yeah i understand that   but not only do they have the right to appeal they must appeal and you know they the the lawyers go in there and they generate   it takes prolong it forever   well they generate all kinds of possible reasons that they might be able to appeal uh you know they theyre theyre trying to generate   umhum   technicalities you know things which arent really related to whether the guy did it or not but as to whether something in the process was right or wrong   yeah   yeah the the yeah see   and you know it it it doesnt work you know our whole justice system doesnt work like that   yeah itd be easier if at least if someone was you know sentenced to death then if they were to have to have an appeal it should be taken care of as quickly as possible you know   yes thats right   and i understand appeals take a long time and everything else but you know i mean they should have like God theres something so itd be done faster you know because then they complain about the jails and the this and that and this and that and people sitting on death row for like fifteen years well thats dumb   yes umhum it is its terrible   mean mean at least if youre going to do it do it like because i mean thats like even torture kind of you know   oh i again i i dont feel sorry for the for the for the victim that thats on you know for the for the criminal   yeah
