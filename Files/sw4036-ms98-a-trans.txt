                 i think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you dont uh convict someone who uh really shouldnt be convicted um   definitely   and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you wouldnt convict someone who maybe should be convicted   umhum   have you ever served on a jury before   uh i have twice it was pretty wild experience   oh uh what sorts of cases were they   they were just you know small town cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know   so were they criminal or civil   they were civil they werent they werent any criminal   oh okay what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision   uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people   yeah   so it was they and uh the one changed his vote at the end   so did it become   so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous so   yeah ah    oh but since it was a civil case it really didnt matter right you just needed a majority   right   what was what was the other case that was also civil   the the uh other case was just traffic the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didnt even hardly   yeah oh didnt really even count   go through so   yeah im im a college student so i havent been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um   yeah   and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point but i declined it which im able to do because im a student because it was uh a very bad time   yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though   yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um but uh i i havent um one one thing that i i think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh i i i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesnt work as well   it   uh especially sort of   i wouldnt think that it does   ow well   i mean from from my experience from what i experienced in them it didnt you know it didnt   the   didnt turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go it   ah but you thought it turned out pretty well   yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and it was it was just wasnt organized enough for me so   yeah   im not used to it not being organized and i just assumed assumed that it would have been   oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on   thats thats about what it was   hum thats interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or   yeah they well they picked the one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have so   so it worked it did end up working out pretty well   yeah it ended up working all right   the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like product product liability or medical malpractice where theres um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes   yes   you know its not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and its just a matter of interpreting a contract its sort of a matter of uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if theres really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion   uh i dont think that they they they educate them enough to to really know whats going on   in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so   yeah  the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer   yeah   that which was assumingly their property it was on his property   ah oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadnt made the payments   right so they came to get it   yeah   and then when they came to get it well it it was on the landlords property and he wouldnt let them take it off   ah so they were suing to get it back   so and theyd already it was a double wide so theyd already taken it apart   ah   so they left it there   yeah   and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it   uh   so they were suing him for the money and you know theres no way they could because its it was the moving company
