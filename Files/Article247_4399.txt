                                 The Mark of McCain                           USAToday leads with President Clintons expected proposal today of a million increase in federal funds targeting the enforcement of current guncontrol laws a move the paper says is explicitly calculated to meet arecurring NRA criticism that federal firearms prosecutions have steeplydeclined under Clinton The New York Times carries the gunenforcement money inside but joins the Los AngelesTimes in leading with the abrupt postponement of the IsraelSyria talksthat had been scheduled to resume in West Virginia this week Both papersreport that one factor was the publication in the Israeli press last week ofthe working paper for the talks which displeased Syria by revealing some ofits heretofore unpublicized concessions such as allowing some sort of Israeliintelligence ground station to remain in the Golan Heights and endorsing theexchange of ambassadors and the opening of borders The story also sits atopthe Wall Street Journal s frontpage news index box andis fronted below the fold by the Washington Post  whose top nonlocal story is the papersnew polling on the New Hampshire primaries showing that both the Democratic andRepublican races are up for grabs Meanwhile the LAT s frontpagepoll detects strong leads for Bush and Gore in the Iowa caucuses            The NYT take on the IsraelSyria talks mentions a prosaic angle behind the sudden turnof events Yasser Arafat is scheduled to see President Clinton at the WhiteHouse on Thursday and the Syrians didnt much relish languishing down in WestVirginia during those festivities            The NYT topfronts Kofi Annans choice of former UN arms monitorRolf Ekeus to lead a new UN commission that will attempt to complete the taskof assessing the chemical biological and nuclear weapons capabilities ofSaddam Hussein The NYT goes on to note that last night Russiaregistered its objection to the appointment throwing it into doubt andinducing tension between Washington and Moscow but the paper should have likethe LAT does over its inside story on the matter mentioned the Russianbalk in the headline            The NYT reefers last nights GoreBradley debate centering on racialissues while the others stuff it The coverage notes that the only real harshdisagreement between the two came on the question of police racial profilingBradley challenged Gore to get President Clinton to sign an executive orderbanning the practice immediately and Gore replied that he didnt think his bossneeds a lecture from Bill Bradley Both the NYT and LATtopfront pictures of some  marchers in Columbia SC protesting thestates practice of flying the Confederate battle flag on the state CapitolThe NYT says the protest was perhaps the greatest civil rights rallysince the s and that it drew a surprisingly high number of whitemarchersabout  percent to  percent of the crowd Todays Papers doesntknow whats more depressingthat the white turnout was so small or that itsseen as so large USAT sees only a smattering of whites inattendance            The WSJ reports that a study to be released today finds that whilethe income gap between rich and poor widened in the US overall during thes the size of the gap depended on the state in question The average incomeof the top  percent of families was  or more than  times that ofthe poorest  percent which was  but in nine statesNew YorkArizona New Mexico Louisiana California Rhode Island Texas Oregon andKentuckythe top figure was more than  times the bottom            A gap of another sort is detailed on the USAT front The death ratefor liposuction is  times to  times higher than the death rate for alloperations performed in hospitals according to a new study The main reasongiven by the paper is that liposuction is mostly performed in doctors officeswhere the procedures arent required to be so strict But the reader cant tellif this is enough of an explanation because the story doesnt say what theoverall mortality rate is for all inoffice procedures            Look for John McCain to take a bit of a beating over a remark reported inside the WP  In New HampshireMcCain said hed served in the Navy with many gays When asked how he knew thatgiven that they hadnt come out to him he responded Well I think we know bybehavior and by attitudes He went on to say that he wouldnt pursue suchsailors meaning apparently that he wouldnt try to get them expelled from theservice The Post reports that an official of the Human Rights Campaigna major gay rights group said McCains remark was a form of prejudice Thepaper doesnt say it but its worth noting that if McCain is right that gaydaris pretty much universal and suppressing awareness of gays in a unit so as tomaintain cohesion is the point of Dont Ask Dont Tella doctrine McCainsupportsthen well the doctrine has no point since everybody already knowsand hence unit cohesion is already threatened
