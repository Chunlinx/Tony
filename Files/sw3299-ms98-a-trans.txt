                okay i dont have a budget my wife and i i should make that clear ive been married thirty three years and weve never had and we dont follow budgets but ive got the greatest system going  i just dont handle any money       and i told her when we got married that i am going to earn so much money and she can spend it on what she wants but if she ever spends more than i earn shes got to go to work shes never gone to work yet so   smart woman   so it worked   so its so you know its really great so i you know to answer their question i we dont we dont have a budget   yeah we dont we dont uh  we didnt when we first got married uh ive been married only about four years my wife always wanted to write something down and keep track and i said look Mary  i said you you get money we should save a little bit   umhum   and uh whatever else you know play it by ear go spend on whatever you spend it on and if at the end of the month our checking account is no good then we got to sit down and and decide what were going to stop spending it on but until that happens lets not worry about it   yep   um and since then weve both been done pretty well regarding uh raises and stuff at our jobs and and our rent has stayed relatively low   umhum   and now we havent had that problem yet and then my we we just had our first child about two months ago and then i said well well see what happens then because she she had to take some time off work and she probably will even quit her job now and maybe do some part time work   umhum   but we still havent had a problem paying the rent so i dont know what the i guess im blessed in the sense that i have a good enough job that i dont have to worry about that   yeah you live right in New York City   yeah i live in Manhattan i work out in Queens oh which is also part of New York City theres just five boroughs   uhhuh uhhuh so your rent is quite expensive as compared to what were accustomed to back here probably   yeah except for i have a a rent um stabilized apartment um so the rent is only seven hundred and fifty dollars a month which for New York is extremely inexpensive in a very good neighborhood   oh i see oh yeah yeah well thats great  no i can you know again i can see the reason for them i have  i have two grown kids and one my youngest son is Ken they both have very very good jobs they live in Chicago they have absolutely no problem they have no need for it  and my eldest son he very definitely has to live by a budget because he just cannot control control his finances but i dont you know i cannot see this  which i have a very close sisterinlaw that  everything she does at the beginning of the month or every payday she sits sits down and fills envelopes  and ive i find that thats a tedious bore i mean if we had to live like that im not so sure id want to continue working       but for them it works so i mean whatever  uh our system works for us we we have a policy my wife and i both that we dont everything we have is ours as far as money we dont holdout holdout on each other or anything else and never really had a problem  but i do believe in uh retirement investment programs very much so uh nowadays you sound like youre fairly young so i you know i keep telling my kids for Gods sakes get involved in it because when they retire they should have a half dollars   yeah i i i i agree the same i mean you know i i see too many elderly people with my mother uh is a social worker and she works with the elderly   umhum   and uh you know in in your i dont know how how much older youre im thirty and   im fifty eight so   yeah uh youre generation has gotten pretty lucky regarding or at least in this area regarding real estate you know they went and bought a house for fourteen thousand dollars and then they they were sixty years old and retired     umhum   and sold that same house for two hundred fifty thousand dollars and you know moved down to Florida or did whatever they had to do but they had all this capital um i dont know if the real estate markets gonna say the same for one thing im thirty im an attorney and uh i dont own a house   yeah umhum   which i think is unusual because all the my parents friends owned houses when we were growing up and now i grew up in suburbia as opposed to in the city but still   yeah   um but someday id like to own a house and and i ive certainly um make it a point that that i will put some money away um uh maybe a little less now while my wife isnt working so that someday we can have a house and we can that would be our capital and in addition to that i have at work they have you know uh investment plans where you can avoid having to go through um paying taxes but your entire   umhum right oh those things are great i boy i encourage those  yeah youre you dont own a house and im fifty eight and i just built my fourth home   yeah really   so i just took on another mortgage dont ask me why i really dont but its tax   fourth you have four homes now or four okay   ive had no ive had four no not all at the same time but this is the fourth one ive owned and this one i built but  im looking at this as an investment so i hope real estate keeps climbing and its a brand new area so it should   yeah yeah  i mean at this point in this area i mean its its absolutely ludicrous my my uh just the main you know just the taxes and upkeep of a house would cost me more than im paying in rent now obviously i get the   right
