                                 BatteredRepublican Syndrome            Back when men were men andwomen were women conservatives were conservative on the subject of childabuse That is they were in favor of it We all got the belt that night PatBuchanan wrote in his autobiography describing his fathers preferred form ofpunishment On Crossfire  Buchanan could always be counted upon todefend the educational advantages of a good lashing whether in Singapore orChevy Chase In Depressionera Russell Kan it was Bob Doles mother Binawho acquainted her children with the salubrious effects of the strap onSaturday afternoons For Republicans a sound whipping always meant goodvalues            Thosedays it appears are gone With Shine and Sling Blade filmsabout men damaged by their abusive fathersnominated for Best Picture andKathryn Harrisons The Kiss moving up the bestseller listconservatives want to tell you We were abused too As adult children ofalcoholics sons of deadbeat dads witnesses to batteredspouse syndrome andvictims of every sort of paddling and walloping and thwacking Republicans areno longer ceding ground to Bill Clinton when it comes to feeling the pain of adysfunctional nation            The latest example of this weird phenomenon is Dan Burtonthe superrightwing representative from Indiana who is set to run the Houseinvestigation into Democratic fundraising practices Burton is the one withthe Vince Foster fetish whose AIDS hypochondria prevents him from eating soupin restaurants In a profile in the Washington Post last week Burtonrecounted the story he has told beforein People  among otherplacesof how his father a footinch pound bully used to pummel thewhole family Charles Burton hit his son for getting up to go to the bathroomin the middle of the night and hit him for wetting his bed if he didnt get upto go When Burton was an infant his father beat him black and blue for cryingin a movie theater After his wife tried to leave him Charles Burton abductedher Charged with kidnapping he was convicted and spent two years in prisonWhen he got out of prison and came around to where the family lived DanBurton age  faced him down with a shotgun            Burtonfirst raised the subject of his experiences to underscore his support for abill to aid battered wives Now he is deploying his pain in a legislativelyless specific way to try to show that he is not the reactionary bogeyman mostpeople think he is One doesnt wish to indicate any lack of sympathy for whatsounds like a truly wretched and brutal childhood But if we are to draw alesson from Burtons story it is not that he is a sympathetic and caring manbecause of his experiences but rather that he is working out an inheriteddisposition to abuse children on a more ambitious level It was Burton whoadvocated using nuclear weapons against Iraq during the Gulf War He doesntbeat his own three kidshe just wants to kill hundreds of thousands ofinnocent Arabs            Burton has company that includes the Republicanleaders in both houses Trent Lott the Senate Majority Leader is not the kindof fellow who wears his heart on his sleeve so it came as something of a shockwhen several weeks ago he revealed his own wretched childhood to a reporterfor the New York Times Magazine  Lotts father a shipyard worker inPascagoula Miss was an alcoholic who died in a drunkendriving accident in That sort of problem does affect you You are forced into problemsbetween your mother and your father It makes you grow up maybe a littleearly Lott said But he added that his wasnt a dysfunctional family AfterI was  or  years old I dont think my father ever laid a hand on me            MostRepublicans must be satisfied with one abusive father Newt Gingrich had twoAccording to various profiles his natural father Newton McPherson stayed outlate at the pool hall one night soon after marrying Newts mom WhenMcPhersons young bride tried to wake him the next morning to go to work heslugged her The next man she married Bob Gingrich was not physicallyabusive but he was cold and uncommunicative toward his stepchildren Newt hascompared him to the Great Santini the inflexible military father in PatConroys novel It was a sort of classic broken home he has said When Newtage  married his highschool math teacher against his stepfathers wishesBob Gingrich not only refused to come to the wedding he wouldnt let Newtsmother or sisters attend either            Moving to the back benches one finds Jim Nussle aRepublican House member from Iowa dealing with his anger over an absentfather I have a deadbeat father I have never met Nussle said on the Housefloor in  arguing for a provision to compel states to get tougher onchildsupport collection or risk losing federal aid I dont want to haveanybody else go through it On his side in support of the measure was anotherRepublican representative John Ensign of Nevada who told of his own fatherabandoning his family forcing Ensigns mother to support three children byworking as a change girl in a Las Vegas casino            WhenRepublicans start talking about being neglected and abused you can bet thattheyre about to violate some sacrosanct conservative principle like statesrights or the need to shrink government Im a conservative Nussle saidapropos of the issue of childsupport enforcement and when I hear people talkabout states rights I say Hold it guys there is a duty here for thefederal government  Burton used the same phraseology when explaining hiswillingness to intervene against domestic violence despite the otherwisehighly constricted role he sees for the federal government Im not advocatingmore government or Big Brother in Washington trying to solve the problem hesaid But Im not saying that government shouldnt have a role in trying toget the job done The exceptions to conservative orthodoxy that theseRepublicans carve out are victimspecific narrowly tailored to their ownmiseries Burton is antiabuse but doesnt fret about missed childsupportpayments Nussle by contrast wants to punish deadbeat dads but not abusiveones hes a cosponsor of the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act whichsays its fine to smack the kids the phrase used is reasonable corporaldiscipline            These little contradictions aside one wonderswhy stodgy Caucasian Republicans are playing the victimology card at all Thebasic explanation the powerful lure of what Wendy Kaminer calls the RecoveryMovement A decade ago politicians didnt boast about being abused They allsounded like Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan In the early s even Bill Clintonran a TV ad in which he folksily asserted My daddy never had to whip me twicefor the same thing By  Clinton was telling the country about how hestood up to that same daddy for slapping his mom around Republicans a littlebehind in the game are trying to say We feel your pain too Theyre finallycottoning on to the political value of the confessional culture With theirparty intellectually adrift the appeal of this style of contentfreeOprahfied populism continues to grow for them            Or maybe theres a simplerexplanation These guys need professional help but are afraid to be seen neara psychiatrists office Pouring their hearts out to reporters is the onlytherapy Republican politicians can get
