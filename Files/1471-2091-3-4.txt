                    Background        The overuse of antibiotics in the clinic and for        agricultural uses has resulted in a tremendous selective        pressure for antibiotic resistant bacteria These bacteria        become resistant by a number of mechanisms such as        producing enzymes that hydrolyze or inactivate the        antibiotics producing efflux pumps that transport the        antibiotic out of the cell or modifying their cell wall        components so they no longer bind effectively to the        antibiotics       The most common least expensive        and effective antibiotics are the lactam containing        antibiotics such as the penicillins cephalosporins and        carbapenems       These antibiotics are        mechanismbased inhibitors of transpeptidase a bacterial        enzyme required for the production of a strong viable cell        wall      In response to the widespread use of        lactam containing antibiotics bacteria have acquired the        ability to produce lactamases which are enzymes that        hydrolyze and inactivate lactam containing antibiotics        There are over  distinct lactamases known and these        enzymes have been grouped by a number of classification        schemes            For example Bush has        developed a scheme based on the enzymes molecular        properties that has four distinct lactamase groups             One of the more alarming groups are the Bush group         enzymes which are ZnII dependent enzymes that hydrolyze        nearly all known lactam containing antibiotics and for        which there are no or very few known clinical inhibitors                 The metallolactamases have been        further divided by Bush into subgroups based on amino acid        sequence identity the Ba enzymes share a  sequence        identity require  ZnII ions for full activity prefer        penicillins and cephalosporins as substrates and are        represented by metallolactamase CcrA from         Bacteroides fragilis the Bb enzymes        share a  sequence identity with the Ba enzymes require        only  ZnII ion for full activity prefer carbapenems as        substrates and are represented by the metallolactamase        imiS from         Aeromonas sobria and the Bc enzymes        have only  conserved residues with the other        metallolactamases require  ZnII ions for activity        contain a different metal binding motif than the other        metallolactamases prefer penicillins as substrates and        are represented by the metallolactamase L from         Stenotrophomonas maltophilia            A similar grouping scheme B B and B based on        structural properties of the metallolactamases has        recently been offered     The diversity of the group         lactamases is best exemplified by the enzymes vastly        differing efficacies towards nonclinical inhibitors these        differences predict that one inhibitor may not inhibit all        metallolactamases                      To combat this problem we are characterizing a        metallolactamase from each of the subgroups in an effort        to identify a common structural or mechanistic aspect of        the enzymes that can be targeted for the generation of an        inhibitor It is hoped that this inhibitor when given in        combination with an existing antibiotic will prove to be        an effective therapy against bacteria that produce a        metallolactamase This work describes our efforts on        metallolactamase L from         S maltophilia                 S maltophilia is an important        pathogen in nosocomial infections of immunocompromised        patients suffering from cancer cystic fibrosis drug        addition AIDS and in patients with organ transplants and        on dialysis       This organism is inherently        resistant to most antibiotics due to its low outer membrane        permeability    and to lactam containing antibiotics        due to the production of a chromosomally expressed group e        lactamase L and a group c lactamase L             L has been cloned overexpressed and partially        characterized by kinetic and crystallographic studies             The enzyme exists as a homotetramer of         ca  kDa in solution and in the        crystalline state The enzyme tightly binds two ZnII ions        per subunit and requires both ZnII ions for full        catalytic activity The Zn          site has  histidine residues and         bridging hydroxide as ligands and the Zn          site has  histidines  aspartic        acid  terminallybound water and the bridging hydroxide        as ligands Spencer and coworkers used the crystal        structure and modeling studies to propose a substrate        binding model and identified several active site residues        that were involved in substrate binding Figure             However this model has not been tested experimentally In        order to prepare tight binding inhibitors of the        metallolactamases knowledge about how substrate binds        to the enzymes is needed so that all substrateenzyme        binding contacts can be maintained in any proposed        inhibitor This work describes our efforts at understanding        how substrates bind to metallolactamase L Several        sitedirected mutants of L were generated and        characterized and the results from these studies reveal        that none of the active site residues predicted from        earlier computational studies    are essential for        tight substrate binding                    Results                  Wild type L          Wildtype L was overexpressed in           Escherichia coli and purified as          previously described     This procedure produced an          average of  mg of  pure active protein per           L of growth culture Circular dichroism spectra were          collected on wildtype samples to ensure L expressed          using the pETb expression system had the correct          secondary structure The CD spectrum of wild type L          showed an intense broad feature at  nm and a smaller          feature at  nm see Additional file  CD spectra          These features are consistent with a sample with          significant  content The Compton and Johnson          algorithm    was used to estimate secondary structure          in the samples wildtype L was estimated to have           helix  structure  antiparallel sheet           parallel sheet and  turn and  other          structure These estimates are in excellent agreement          with the crystallographically determined secondary          structure of  helix and  structure              Metal analyses on multiple preparations of wildtype L          demonstrated that the enzyme binds    ZnII ions          per monomer Table  in agreement with previous results                       Steady state kinetic studies were performed on          multiple preparations of wild type L and the resulting          kinetic data are shown in Tables    When using          nitrocefin as substrate and  mM cacodylate pH  as          buffer wildtype L exhibited a           k           cat value of    s and a K           m value of    M The inclusion of           M ZnCl            in the assay buffer resulted in          slightly lower values of K           m and higher values for           k           cat     The inclusion of higher          concentrations of ZnII did not further affect the          steadystate kinetic constants Apparently the purified          recombinant enzyme does not bind its full complement of          ZnII therefore  M ZnII was included in all          subsequent kinetic studies          Wildtype L exhibited           k           cat values of    s     s              s  and    s for the cephalosporins          nitrocefin cefoxitin cefaclor and cephalothin For          these same substrates the K           m values were    M    M             M and    M respectively Two          penicillins were tested as substrates and penicillin G          and ampicillin exhibited K           m values of    M and    M          and           k           cat values of    s and             s  respectively Table  Three carbapenems were          also used as substrates for L and biapenem imipenem          and meropenem exhibited K           m values of    M    M and             M and           k           cat values of    s     s           and    s  respectively Table  Ls          preference for penicillins and carbapenems over          cephalosporins as exemplified by the           k           cat values is in agreement with          previous studies and supports Ls placement in the          lactamase c family              Rapidscanning visible spectra of  M wildtype L          with  M nitrocefin demonstrated a decrease in          absorbance at  nm an increase at  nm and a rapid          increase and slower decrease in absorbance at  nm          These spectra are similar to those previously reported          for wildtype L and nitrocefin     and the features          can be attributed to substrate decay product formation          and intermediate formation and decay respectively Under          these conditions  M intermediate was formed during          the first  milliseconds of the reaction Figure  and          the rate of decay of this intermediate corresponds to the          steadystate           k           cat Table  To probe further the          binding of nitrocefin to wildtype L stoppedflow          fluorescence studies were conducted as previously          described    Figure  The reaction of wildtype L          with nitrocefin under steadystate conditions at C          resulted in a rapid decrease in fluorescence followed by          a ratelimiting return of fluorescence Figure A          Fitting of the data as described by Spencer           et al     resulted in a K           S value for wildtype L of    M          Figure B                          Ser mutants          the BBL numbering scheme proposed in reference  was          used throughout this manuscript All sequenced subclass          Ba and Bb metallolactamases except VIM have a          lysine residue at position      and all          computational models for substrate binding to the          metallolactamases assume that the invariant          carboxylate on substrates forms an electrostatic          interaction with this lysine In L the residue at          position  is a serine     and the          substratebinding model for L predicts that this serine          residue interacts with the carboxylate on substrate via a          water molecule     To test the proposed role of          Ser in L serine was changed to an alanine SA          aspartic acid SD and lysine SK and these          mutants were characterized using metal analyses CD          spectroscopy steadystate kinetics and presteady state          kinetic studies          Smallscale growth cultures showed that all three          mutants were overexpressed at levels comparable to those          of wildtype L Largescale overexpression and          purification of the mutants showed that all three mutants          were isolatable at levels comparable to those of          wildtype L Metal analyses of the SA and SD          mutants showed that both mutants bind nearly two ZnII          ions Table  like wildtype L     however the          SK mutant binds only  ZnII per protein CD          spectra of the mutants were similar to those of wildtype          L see Figure in Additional materials Steadystate          kinetic studies were conducted with all three mutants in          buffer containing  M ZnCl            to ensure that both ZnII binding          sites were saturated in these studies Addition of higher          concentrations of ZnII did not result in different          values for the steadystate kinetic constants in Tables                      When the cephalosporins were used as substrates the          SA and SK mutants exhibited  to fold changes in          K           m values Table  In studies with          cefoxitin cefaclor and cephalothin as substrate the          observed           k           cat values for the SA and SK          mutants were  to fold lower however the           k           cat values when using nitrocefin as          substrate were slightly higher  fold On the          other hand the SD mutant exhibited  to fold          higher K           m values and  to fold lower           k           cat values for the cephalosporins          tested A similar trend was observed in kinetic studies          when using penicillins as substrates Table           Generally the SA and SK mutants exhibited small          changes in K           m and           k           cat  while the SD mutant yielded           to fold increased values for K           m and fold decreases in           k           cat when using the penicillins as          substrates When the carbapenems were used as substrates          however the changes in K           m values were relatively smaller than          with the other substrates and  to fold changes in           k           cat were observed Table           Rapidscanning Vis studies of the SX mutants were          conducted to probe whether the mutations caused changes          in the amount of intermediate that accumulates during          catalysis When  M SA was reacted with  M          nitrocefin  M intermediate formed during the first           milliseconds of the reaction Figure  and rate of          decay of this intermediate was equal to the steadystate           k           cat Table  In spite of utilizing a          number of reaction conditions the SK and SD          mutants yielded rapidscan spectra with no detectable          absorbances at  nm Figure  indicating that the          intermediate is not stabilized as well in these mutants          as in wildtype L Stoppedflow fluorescence studies at          C with the SA SD and SK mutants and          nitrocefin as the substrate resulted in K           S values of       and             M respectively                          Asn mutants          Twothirds of all sequenced metallolactamases have          an Asn at position      and this residue was          predicted    and shown    to be involved with          substrate binding and activation by interacting          electrostatically with the substrate lactam carbonyl          However in L Asn is   away from the modeled          position of the substrate lactam carbonyl     To          test the role of Asn in substrate binding the Asn was          changed to a leucine NL and to an aspartic acid          ND and these mutants were characterized by using          metal analyses CD spectroscopy steadystate kinetics          and presteady state kinetic studies          Smallscale growth cultures showed that both mutants          were overexpressed at levels comparable to that of          wildtype L Largescale overexpression and          purification of the mutants showed that both mutants were          isolatable at levels comparable to that of wildtype L          Metal analyses of the NL and ND mutants showed that          both bind nearly two ZnII ions Table  like          wildtype L     CD spectra of the mutants were          similar to those of wildtype L Steadystate kinetic          studies were conducted with both mutants in buffer          containing  M ZnCl            to ensure that both ZnII binding          sites were saturated in these studies Addition of higher          concentrations of ZnII did not result in different          values for the steadystate kinetic constants in Tables                      With all substrates tested the NL and ND          mutants exhibited K           m values that differed less than a          factor of  than that observed for wildtype L Tables             The           k           cat values exhibited by these mutants          for all substrates also differed by less than a factor of           except when biapenem and meropenem were used as          substrates for the ND mutant With these two          substrates there was a fold and fold decrease in          the           k           cat values when using biapenem and          meropenem respectively Table  The steadystate          kinetic data generally support the prediction that Asn          does not play a large role in binding or catalysis          However rapidscanning Vis studies of NL and ND          with nitrocefin demonstrate that no detectable amounts of          intermediate are formed during the reaction even when          using a wide number of reaction conditions Figure           Stoppedflow fluorescence studies at C with the NL          and ND mutants and nitrocefin as substrate resulted in          K           S values of    and    M          respectively                          Tyr mutants          The substratebinding model showed that Tyr in L          was positionconserved with Asn in the other          crystallographically characterized metallolactamases                  Spencer and coworkers postulated that          Tyr is part of an oxyanion hole that interacts with          the lactam carbonyl on substrate and helps to stabilize          the putative tetrahedral intermediate formed during          substrate turnover     To test this hypothesis          Tyr was changed to an alanine and to a phenylalanine          to afford the YA and YF mutants respectively          Smallscale growth cultures showed that both mutants          were overexpressed at levels comparable to those of          wildtype L Largescale overexpression and          purification of the YA and YF mutants showed that          both mutants were isolatable at levels comparable to          those of wildtype L Metal analyses of the mutants          showed that both bind nearly two ZnII ions Table           like wildtype L     and CD spectra of the mutants          were similar to those of wildtype L Steadystate          kinetic studies were conducted with both mutants in          buffer containing  M ZnCl            to ensure that both ZnII binding          sites were saturated in these studies Addition of higher          concentrations of ZnII did not result in different          values for the steadystate kinetic constants in Tables                      When cephalosporins were used as substrates the YA          and YF mutants exhibited K           m values that were  to fold          higher than those observed for wildtype L Table           The largest change in K           m was observed when cefaclor was used          as substrate and the smallest change was observed when          nitrocefin was used as substrate The Tyr mutants          exhibited  fold change in           k           cat values for the cephalosporins          tested Table  suggesting that Tyr is not playing a          large role in catalysis When penicillins were used as          substrates the Tyr mutants exhibited  to fold          increased K           m values and  fold changes in           k           cat  as compared to the values          ascertained using wildtype L Table  On the other          hand when carbapenems were used as substrates the Tyr          mutants exhibited  fold increases in K           m values as compared to those values          for wildtype L Table  Interestingly there was a           to fold drop in           k           cat values for the Tyr mutants as          compared to values observed for wildtype L when using          the carbapenems as substrates          Rapidscanning Vis spectra of the reaction of the          YA and YF mutants with nitrocefin demonstrated a          marked decrease in the amount of intermediate formed with          these mutants Figure  In reactions with  M mutant          and  M nitrocefin only  and   M          intermediate formed for the YF and YA mutants          respectively The concentration of mutants were varied          between  to  M to ensure that all of the substrate          was bound however none of the reactions resulted in the          detection of intermediate at levels observed for          wildtype L data not shown Stoppedflow fluorescence          studies at C of nitrocefin hydrolysis by YA and          YF resulted in K           S values of    and    M          respectively                          Ile and Phe mutants          All crystallographically characterized          metallolactamases have a flexible amino acid chain          that extends over the active site                     Previous NMR studies on CcrA have shown that this          loop clamps down on substrate or inhibitor upon          binding and there is speculation that the distortion of          substrate upon clamping down of the loop may drive          catalysis     The crystal structure of L showed          that there is a large loop that extends over the active          site and modeling studies have predicted that two          residues Ile and Phe make significant contacts          with large hydrophobic substituents at the  or           positions on penicillins cephalosporins or carbapenems              To test this prediction Ile  and Phe were          changed from large hydrophobic residues to alanines to          afford the IA and FA mutants          Smallscale growth cultures demonstrated the IA and          FA mutants were overexpressed at levels comparable to          that of wildtype L data not shown Largescale          overexpression and purification of the mutants resulted          in comparable quantities of isolatable enzymes which had          identical CD spectra as wildtype L and bound slightly          less ZnII than wildtype L Table  All steadystate          kinetic studies were conducted in buffers containing           M ZnCl            to ensure that both metal binding          sites were saturated during the studies          When using the cephalosporins nitrocefin cefoxitin          and cephalothin as substrates and the IA mutant          there were  to fold only for cefoxitin increases          in K           m and  to fold increases in           k           cat observed Table  However when          cefaclor was used as substrate the IA mutant          exhibited a fold decrease in K           m and a fold decrease in           k           cat Table  On the other hand the          K           m and           k           cat values for the IA mutant when          the penicillins or carbapenems were used as substrates          were very similar to those numbers exhibited by wildtype          L Tables and           When the cephalosporins were used as substrates for          the FA mutant the K           m values observed were  to fold          higher than those determined for wildtype L and          surprisingly the           k           cat values were  to fold higher          than those exhibited by wildtype L Table  As with          the IA mutant the changes in K           m and           k           cat for the penicillins and          carbapenems were relatively small as compared with the          values obtained with the cephalosporins Table           Rapidscanning Vis studies on nitrocefin hydrolysis by          IA and FA showed a marked decrease in intermediate          accumulation with the IA mutant generating            M intermediate and the FA producing no detectable          intermediate Figure  Stoppedflow fluorescence          studies at C resulted in a K           S value of    M for the IA          mutant The reaction of FA with nitrocefin was so          rapid we could not determine a K           S value for this mutant                            Discussion        Lactam containing antibiotics constitute the largest        class of antibiotics and these compounds are relatively        inexpensive to produce cause minor side effects and are        effective towards a number of bacterial strains        Nonetheless bacterial resistance to these antibiotics is        extensive most commonly due to the bacterial production of        lactamases      In fact there have been over         distinct lactamases reported and most of these enzymes        utilize an active site serine group to nucleophilically        attack the lactam carbonyl resulting in a hydrolyzed        product that is covalently attached to the active site To        combat these enzymes lactamase inhibitors such as        clavulanic acid sulbactam and tazobactam have been given        in combination with a lactam containing antibiotic to        treat bacterial infections     One class of        lactamases that are particularly unaffected by the known        lactamase inhibitors and have been shown to hydrolyze        almost all known lactam containing antibiotics including        late generation carbapenems at high rates are the        metallolactamases          Although there        are no reports of metallolactamases isolated from major        pathogens      these enzymes are produced by        pathogens such as         B fragilis S maltophilia and         P aeruginosa It is inevitable that        the continued and extensive use of lactam antibiotics        will result in a major pathogen that produces a        metallolactamase        Efforts to solve the crystal structure of one of the        metallolactamases with a bound substrate molecule have        failed most likely due to the high activity of the enzymes        towards all lactam containing antibiotics             Therefore computational studies have been used extensively        to study substrate binding the role of the ZnII ions in        catalysis the protonation state of the active site and        inhibitor binding           All of the        substrate binding models have made assumptions before the        substrate was docked into the active site      and        some of these assumptions have been shown to be invalid for        certain substrates     With L two key assumptions        were made  the bridging hydroxide functions as the        nucleophile during catalysis and  Zn          coordinates the lactam carbonyl            With these assumptions and after energy minimizations        Ser was predicted to hydrogen bond to the substrate        carboxylate     reminiscent of the role predicted for        Lys in CcrA     Ullah         et al predicted that Phe and Ile         form hydrophobic interactions with bulky substituents        on the substrate suggesting that the loss of these        residues would only affect binding of substrates with large        aromatic substituents     In the modeling studies on        CcrA     Asn was predicted to interact with the        lactam carbonyl on substrate and mutagenesis studies        have supported this prediction     Although Asn is        sequence conserved in L     it is located  away        from the modeled position of the lactam carbonyl and was        predicted not to play a role in substrate binding to L            On the other hand the substratebinding model        predicted that Tyr was in position to offer a hydrogen        bond to the lactam carbonyl and participate in an        oxyanion hole that was proposed to form as the substrate        was hydrolyzed     By using the crystal structure and        modeling studies on L Ullah         et al proposed a reaction mechanism        for the enzyme     To test this proposed mechanism and        the proposed roles of the amino acids discussed above        sitedirected mutagenesis studies were conducted on        metallolactamase L and reported herein        The overlap extension method    was used to prepare        the sitedirected mutants and a variety of studies were        used to probe whether the single point mutations resulted        in large structural changes in the mutant enzymes  The        overexpression levels of mutants were analyzed with        SDSPAGE to ensure that the mutations did not result in        changes in the overexpression levels of the enzymes With        a few L mutants and with other enzyme systems in the lab        single point mutations often result in depressed levels of        overexpression     In the case of the mutants        described here all of the mutants overexpressed at levels        comparable to wildtype L data not shown  The total        amounts of the mutants isolatable after chromatography were        compared with wildtype L levels We have found in        particular with metal binding mutants of L G Periyannan        RB Yates and MW Crowder unpublished results and        glyoxalase II     that single point mutations can        result in overexpressed mutants being processed into        inclusion bodies and unisolatable as soluble proteins In        the case of the mutants described here all of the mutants        were isolated at levels comparable to wildtype L  CD        spectra were collected for all mutants and compared to the        spectrum of wildtype L Although we did not expect a        large change in the secondary structure of L upon single        point mutations CD spectroscopy is the most common        structural technique to characterize sitedirected mutants        All of the mutants described here exhibited CD spectra that        were very similar or identical to that of wildtype L        see Additional file  CD spectra  Metal analyses on        the mutants were used to probe whether point mutations        caused a significant change to the metal binding site as to        preclude metal binding The crystal structures of the        metallolactamases reveal a complex and farreaching        hydrogenbonding network around the metal binding sites        and disruption of this network is predicted to affect metal        binding            With all of the        mutants described here except the SK mutant each mutant        binds wildtype or nearwildtype levels of ZnII after        purification The SK mutant exhibited a  reduction in        metal binding Table  and we postulate this is due to        electrostatic repulsions between the newly introduced Lys        with Zn           In spite of the mutants binding        significant amounts of ZnII we included  M ZnCl          in all of the kinetic buffers to        ensure saturation of the metal binding sites and to        facilitate direct comparison of the kinetic data  All        mutants were stable to multiple freezethaw cycles and to        prolonged storage   weeks at C retaining          of their activity With these five lines of evidence we        were confident that none of the point mutations resulted in        large structural changes in L and that any kinetic        differences could be attributed to the changed amino        acid        As a first approximation of substrate binding we        examined the steadystate kinetics of  cephalosporins         penicillins and  carbapenems Tables    and        compared the K         m values of the mutants with those of        wildtype L The substrates tested were chosen because        they exhibited low K         m values in previous kinetic studies            and we believed that we could saturate the enzymes        with substrate even if there was large change in binding        with the point mutations The Tyr mutants exhibited        increased K         m values for  of the  substrates        tested with the smallest changes in K         m observed when the carbapenems were        used as the substrate This result supports the proposed        role of Tyr in substrate binding In contrast the        results on the Ser mutants suggest that this residue is        not important in substrate binding since the SA and        SK mutants did not exhibit any significant increases by        a factor of   in K         m for any of the substrates tested Only        when Ser was replaced with an Asp residue was there        significant increases in the observed K         m value for  of the  substrates        tested and the largest changes were exhibited when the        penicillins were used as substrates This result supports        the observation of differential binding modes of substrates        to the lactamases depending on the structure of the        substrate       The only remaining mutants that        exhibited significant changes in the K         m values were the IA and FA        mutants The IA mutant exhibited increased K         m values only when using cefoxitin as        the substrate suggesting an interaction of the isoleucine        group with the methoxy group on cefoxitin The FA mutant        exhibited higher K         m values when using the cephalosporins        as substrates suggesting an interaction of the        cephalosporins substituents with the phenylalanine on the        loop that extends over the active site None of the other        mutants exhibited vastly different values for K         m with any of the substrates tested        An examination of the         k         cat values of the mutants revealed some        surprising results The SD mutants displayed decreased         k         cat values for  of the  substrates        tested Since similar results were not observed with the        SK and SA mutants we do not propose a catalytic role        for Ser Instead we predict that the insertion of an        aspartic acid into the active site at position  results        in a change in the hydrogen bonding network in L this        hydrogen bonding network is extensive in all        metallolactamases that have been characterized        crystallographically            The        ND mutant also exhibited greatly reduced         k         cat values for biapenem and meropenem        but not for imipenem or any of the other substrates tested        This mutation is also predicted to affect the hydrogen        bonding network around the active site and apparently        interactions of the enzyme with the  substituent of the        carbapenems has an effect on catalysis More surprisingly        are the increases in         k         cat of the FA mutants We are        uncertain why the mutation of residues on the loop that        extends over the active site would affect         k         cat  since substrate and product        binding have been predicted to be very fast in the reaction        of nitrocefin with L However we do note that the k         cat K         m values of wildtype L and FA        differ by a factor less than         The inability to propose a consistent binding model also        supports the recent proposal that different substrates of        L are hydrolyzed by different mechanisms and further        suggests that using steadystate kinetic constants may not        be a valid way to probe substrate binding to L In        addition the minimal kinetic mechanism of nitrocefin        hydrolysis by L has been reported and this mechanism        predicts that K         m does not accurately reflect substrate        binding By using this mechanism     K         m is equal to k           k          k          k            k          k          k           k          k           k          k           To probe more directly the        reaction stoppedflow absorbance studies were conducted        and the substrate decay rates  nm were studied as a        function of nitrocefin concentration While nitrocefin is a        nontypical substrate as a result of the        dinitrosubstituted styryl substituent     it is the        substrate about which the most is known about its        hydrolysis mechanism Therefore kinetic studies with        nitrocefin as substrate allowed for us to evaluate the        effect of point mutations on the reaction mechanism of L        There was no clear dependence on substrate decay rates with        nitrocefin concentration data not shown We did note        though that the amount of intermediate formed during the        reactions varied considerably depending upon which mutant        of L was used in the study All of the mutants exhibited        decreases in intermediate formation and the SD SK        FA ND and NL mutants yielded rapidscanning data        consistent with no detectable intermediate These same        mutants exhibited vastly differing K         m values Clearly there is no        correlation of K         m with the presence of the reaction        intermediate Apparently the ability to observe the        intermediate is not governed entirely by the choice of        substrate     and it also depends on precise        arrangement of active site residues It is also possible        that the sitedirected mutants could be utilizing a        different mechanism to hydrolyze nitrocefin            Recently Spencer and coworkers reported that        stoppedflow fluorescence studies can be used to monitor        the reaction of L with nitrocefin and that an initial        binding step can be directly monitored     By        increasing the concentration of nitrocefin the rate of the        initial binding step increased to a maximum and fitting of        these data yielded a binding constant called K         S herein for nitrocefin Each of the L        mutants were studied using the stoppedflow fluorescence        studies and the resulting data were fitted as reported by        Spencer         et al    Table  All of the        mutants exhibited K         S values identical within error to        wildtype L except the SD and the YA mutants The        placement of a negative charge at position  drastically        affects nitrocefin binding and results in a fold decrease        in binding affinity Table  To a lesser degree the        aromatic portion of Tyr must have an effect on the        binding site as the K         S value for nitrocefin binding to this        mutant is decreased by a factor of  however the hydroxyl        group probably does not form a hydrogen bond to the        substrate as proposed By using nitrocefin as substrate and        K         m values alone a completely different        conclusion is reached regarding important substrate binding        residues The results presented here suggests that none of        the residues in this study are essential for tight        nitrocefin binding possibly because other parts of the        active site accommodate the loss of certain binding        contacts        Spencer         et al also reported stoppedflow        fluorescence studies when using cefaclor and meropenem as        substrates and K         S values for these substrates were        reported to be    and    M respectively            However in our hands the rates of substrate        hydrolysis were so fast when using wildtype L that we        could not use substrate concentrations high enough to        saturate the enzyme Similarly we could not determine K         S values for penicillin G or ampicillin        because the observed rates of hydrolysis at low substrate        concentrations were too fast to observe data even at        C                    Conclusions        The results presented herein indicate that none of the        active site residues identified with computational studies        are essential for tight substrate binding These data also        indicate that the use of K         m values to describe substrate binding        to L is unreliable and that there is no correlation        between intermediate accumulation and substrate binding        affinity These results demonstrate that new computational        studies are now needed to probe substrate binding to L        and these studies are currently underway The results        presented herein can be used to guide these new        computational studies which will lead to the design of        potential inhibitors and hopefully a way to combat        penicillin resistance in bacteria                    Materials and Methods                  Materials                    E coli strains DH and BLDE          pLysS were
