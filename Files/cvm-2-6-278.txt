                            Angiogenesis is the growth of blood vessels from a        preexisting vessel bed Clinical interest in the control        of angiogenesis arises from two distinct quarters In one        case the goal is to block the growth of new vessels as a        means to suppress andor regress tumor growth or to        suppress vessel proliferation in pathologies such as        diabetes In the second case the objective is to induce or        stimulate vessel growth in patients with conditions        characterized by insufficient blood flow such as ischemic        heart disease and peripheral vascular diseases The latter        applications are the focus of this review We discuss some        of the recent efforts to induce new vessel growth and we        highlight challenges that have arisen regarding the means        of delivery and efficacy of angiogenesis induction                    Angiogenic stimuli                  Fibroblast growth factor          The fibroblast growth factor FGF family consists of          an everincreasing number of peptide growth factors with          diverse cellular targets and biological effects   Two          family members acidic fibroblast growth factor FGF          and FGF have a strong affinity for heparin and have          been studied for their effects on vascular cells          including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells          Extensive evidence indicates that both FGF and FGF          are potent angiogenic factors providing support for          their use as stimuli for therapeutic angiogenesis           in vivo  It is also important to          note that many cell types express one of the four FGF          receptors and that FGF has been shown to have biological          effects in a number of cell systems including induction          of neurite outgrowth suppression of skeletal muscle          differentiation induction of bone formation and          neuroprotection to name just a few                          Vascular endothelial growth factorA          VEGFA is the prototypic member of a family of          secreted homodimeric glycoproteins with endothelial          cellspecific mitogenic activity and the ability to          stimulate angiogenesis           in vivo   VEGFA also increases          vascular permeability with an effect  times more          potent than that of the vasoactive substance histamine          VEGFA was originally purified based on this property          and was named vascular permeability factor   The          VEGFA family of polypeptides consists of a number of          biochemically distinct isoforms three isoforms in the          mouse and up to five in humans that are generated          through alternative mRNA splicing of a single gene             The isoforms are named by the number of amino acids          that comprise the proteins the human isoforms include          VEGF VEGF VEGF VEGF and VEGF                            Preclinical studies        Current clinical trials of angiogenesis factors were        preceded by a large number of studies using animal models        of cardiac or peripheral ischemia Early studies involved        protein administration whereas later efforts began to        employ gene therapy In one early study using recombinant        protein a single intraarterial injection of  g        VEGF into rabbits with severe experimental hind limb        ischemia increased collateral vessels as detected by        angiography and histological analysis   Naked plasmid        DNA injected directly into the skeletal muscle in a later        study using the same hind limb ischemia model also        yielded increased collateral vessels as determined by        angiography and improved perfusion          Although such reports of increased vessel growth and        functional improvement in response to exogenously        administered angiogenic factors are encouraging it is        essential to note that animal models such as the ischemic        hind limb model have definite limitations Whereas the        ischemia in the animal models is acute produced by        surgical procedure the ischemia that characterizes the        human disease often arises over an extended time and occurs        in the context of complex atherosclerotic processes The        responses seen in the experimental models may thus be quite        different in terms of the kinetics of vessel growth as well        as the nature of the resultant vessels        In a study assessing the effects of VEGFA on myocardial        ischemia in a porcine model of progressive coronary artery        occlusion VEGFA was delivered by osmotic pump and        magnetic resonance mapping revealed a reduction in the size        of the ischemic zone and improved cardiac function   A        single bolus injection was also found to produce        significant improvements in myocardial blood flow and        function   Myocardial ischemia in animals has also been        treated with FGF Delivery of FGF via implantation of        heparinalginate beads led to an  reduction in infarct        size and improved cardiac function in pigs with        experimentally induced coronary artery constrictions as        compared with untreated controls   These studies were        followed closely by the demonstration of gene therapy in a        porcine model of stressinduced myocardial ischemia        Intracoronary injection of a recombinant adenovirus        expressing another member of the FGF family human FGF        led to improvements in stressinduced function and blood        flow that were maintained for  weeks                      Clinical trials                  Fibroblast growth factor          In one study human recombinant FGF was administered          intraoperatively to areas of the coronary artery in           patients who were undergoing surgical revascularization            Angiographic analysis revealed evidence of          collateralization Local sustained release of high dose          but not low dose FGF to ischemic areas in           patients during bypass surgery led to a reduction in          stress defect size   In a recent study involving           patients with coronary disease the response to          intravenous or intracoronary human recombinant FGF was          monitored by single photon emission computed tomography          SPECT imaging   Perfusion was monitored at          approximately   and  months after growth factor          administration Analysis of global stress perfusion or          inducible ischemia revealed a consistent and sustained          reduction in the extent and severity of stressinducible          ischemia as well as an improvement in resting perfusion          in areas where there was a risk of ischemia                          Vascular endothelial growth factor          In an early phase I trial to test the safety and          bioactivity of VEGFA naked VEGF DNA was injected          into the myocardium of five patients who had failed          standard therapy SPECT imaging demonstrated reduced          ischemia   Adenoviral delivery of VEGF to the          myocardium of  patients by direct injection either as          an adjunct to coronary bypass grafting or as the sole          therapy led to improvement in the area injected as          measured by angiography angina was also reduced            Administration of recombinant VEGF improved function          as detected by SPECT   Furthermore this study          revealed a dosedependent improvement in both stress          perfusion and rest perfusion there was an infrequent          response in patients who received low dose VEGF and an          improvement in five out of six patients who received high          dose VEGF In a different approach VEGF cDNA was          delivered via liposomes by catheter to coronary arteries          following angioplasty   While this phase I safety          trial did not show an effect of VEGFA on the degree of          coronary ischemia it did prove that the treatment was          well tolerated          It is important to note that no phase II controlled          studies using defined and quantifiable endpoints have          demonstrated efficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis This          highlights the main obstacles for assessing a therapeutic          response to angiogenesis therapy the reliability of the          assessment methods and the possible complications of the          placebo effect There is thus a critical need for more          controlled trials and for the development of better          defined and more quantifiable endpoints                            Modes of delivery                  Protein therapy          At present the administration of protein seems to be          preferable to gene therapy   This is mainly because          dosage modulation in most clinical settings is far easier          with purified protein than with gene therapy which is          hampered by the lack of a regulable expression vector          Although protein therapy has many advantages there are          nevertheless technical problems associated with protein          administration including optimization of purification          and formulation of delivery for single andor multiple          angiogenic factors          Recent advances in drug delivery methods using          bioerodible polymer matrices will allow longterm          sustained release of the growth factors   This will          resolve one of the major problems associated with protein          administration namely the limited tissue halflife of          the purified angiogenic factors in patients An important          consideration however is that protein therapy is          limited to secreted factors Delivery of intracellular          modulators for therapeutic angiogenesis including          transcription factors that control angiogenesis such as          hypoxia inducible factor alpha HIF is only          possible through gene therapy                          Gene therapy          Viral vectors have been the most commonly used means          of gene delivery for both VEGFA and FGF Gene therapy          presents an attractive alternative to purified proteins          because it offers the possibility of sustained production          of one or more factors following a single administration          Furthermore tissuespecific and highly localized          production of the therapeutic factor is possible through          the use of tissuespecific promoters          However a variety of issues have implications for the          use of viral vectors in gene therapy Obvious potential          concerns are the immune and inflammatory responses to          viral vectors Patients who received VEGF via an          adenoviral vector had increased levels of serum          antiadenoviral neutralizing antibodies but there was no          report on an inflammatory response in these patients            The use of adenovirusmediated gene therapy in          treating brain tumors has been reported to lead to active          brain inflammation as well as persistent up to  months          after treatment transgene expression            The lack of regulable gene expression is another          potential barrier Some systems for inducible gene          expressions have proved to be effective and safe in          animal models   but have not yet been tested in          humans Recent advances in stem cell research provide the          possibility of combining gene therapy with           ex vivo gene transfer into stem          cells for angiogenesis therapy as will be discussed          later If successful this approach may overcome most of          the obstacles presented by gene therapy                            Considerations for the future                  Interpatient variability          It is not clear why some individuals develop a          collateral circulation sufficient to compensate for their          ischemic vascular disease whereas others do not          Certainly features such as the extent of the disease and          the time frame over which the ischemia develops are          contributing factors However other previously          unconsidered variables appear to play important          roles          Collateral vessel development as measured by blood          pressure angiography and vessel density was          significantly reduced in old  years old versus young           months old animals   in a rabbit model of hind          limb ischemia Endothelial cell dysfunction and reduced          VEGFA levels were the reasons suggested for the reduced          collateral response A subsequent study demonstrating an          agedependent reduction in HIF activity provides one          explanation for the lower VEGFA expression in response          to hypoxia in aged animals   A reduced response to          hypoxia might translate into a weaker angiogenic          response This is supported by the fact that the extent          of hypoxic induction of VEGFA in monocytes correlates          strongly with the presence of collateral vessels in          patients            It is possible that genetic variability may also play          a significant role in an individuals ability to generate          collateral vessels in response to ischemia as well as          their capacity to respond to an exogenous angiogenic          agent Not surprisingly a recent report that assessed          the angiogenic response in a murine corneal pocket model          to a fixed dosage of FGF in various strains of mice          suggested that genetic backgrounds may influence          angiogenic response   A nearly fold range of          response to the fixed dosage of FGF was observed among          different inbred strains of mice suggesting that genetic          variability may indeed play a significant role in          determining the magnitude of angiogenic response to          FGF                          Systemic effects          If VEGFA delivery leads to significant circulating          levels as has been observed following myocardial          transfection with VEGFA cDNA   then it may possibly          affect angiogenesis elsewhere   As plaque          progression might be dependent on angiogenesis            investigators were prompted to examine the effect of          VEGFA administration on this process Mice that were          double deficient in apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein            were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection          of VEGF recombinant human protein  gkg This led          to significant increases in plaque area compared with          untreated controls   In contrast there has been no          evidence of disease progression to date in  patients          treated with intraarterial gene transfer of naked VEGFA          cDNA This has been delivered either to promote          therapeutic angiogenesis  patients or to accelerate          reendothelization  patients   Although these          observations suggest that human sensitivity to VEGFA may          be lower than in animal models it will be necessary to          study a larger cohort of patients with appropriate          controls over a longer time period to confirm this                     VEGF has also been shown to mediate the vessel growth          that characterizes tumor expansion as well as the          neovascularization that is associated with diabetic          retinopathy Although VEGF is produced locally in both of          these circumstances it is not known whether systemic          administration of the factor could exacerbate these          conditions by further stimulating vessel growth          Selection of the patient population that may benefit from          angiogenic therapy may thus have to involve screening for          coexisting conditions that could be activated or worsened          by exposure to proangiogenic agents          VEGFA FGF and FGF have all demonstrated          systemic vascular effects FGF and FGF have been          shown to reduce blood pressure in a dosedependent manner          in rats   Similarly VEGFA has been reported to          cause hypotension and death in pigs following an          intracoronary bolus administration   Subsequent          studies have revealed that VEGFA administration causes          greater vasodilatation of coronary vessels than serotonin          or nitroglycerin and also causes tachyphylaxis via a          nitric oxidedependent mechanism   VEGFA          administration to the extremities of patients has also          been associated with hypotension and edema   These          side effects can be partly explained by the fact that          VEGFA is a potent vascular permeability factor                          VEGFA isoforms in angiogenesis therapy          The five VEGFA protein isoforms in humans and at          least three major isoforms in the mouse have different          biochemical and biological properties   It is          therefore important to determine whether different VEGFA          isoforms give rise to different quality or quantity of          vessels Expression of the various isoforms during          development is modulated both spatially and temporally            and observations from gene knockout studies have          proven that these isoforms do not have equivalent          biological functions during vessel development             Furthermore there is considerable variability in the          phenotype of vessels in tumors expressing different          isoforms   For example vessels within tumors          expressing predominantly the VEGF isoform which has a          strong heparinbinding affinity and thus is highly          localized are much less leaky than the vessels in tumors          expressing the more diffusible VEGF and VEGF          isoforms   It will be interesting and important to          determine whether these observations from experimental          systems can help predict the results of clinical trials          which primarily employ the VEGF isoform Finally          since multiple VEGFA isoforms are expressed during          vascular development   it will also be important to          determine whether the use of multiple isoforms in          angiogenesis therapy will be necessary to replicate           in vivo conditions                            Achieving vessel stability        The induction of new vessels to supply ischemic tissues        is the primary goal of angiogenic therapy Reaching this        objective is however highly complex Vessels formed in        response to artificial angiogenic stimuli are prone to        regression unless they are remodeled into mature stable        vessels   Thus as the level of knowledge regarding        the mechanisms of vessel growth and stabilization        increases there is increasing concern that the simple        application of a bolus of angiogenic factor may be        insufficient for stable vessel formation or may even be        dangerous        Early studies involving the administration of VEGFA        showed angiographic evidence of new vessel formation but        these vessels did not persist and they regressed within         months   It was recently reported that continuous        delivery of VEGFA into murine hearts by retroviral        transfer led to the formation of aberrant vessels and        hemangiomalike structures   One of the major problems        encountered in the use of VEGFA is that vessels formed are        unstable and leaky   It has been speculated that        VEGFA alone may not be sufficient to form stable mature        vessels that are characterized by the recruitment of the        perivascular mural cells such as pericytes or smooth        muscle cells   This process of vessel maturation is        called arteriogenesis and is arguably the ideal way to form        stable vessels for therapeutic purposes                      Administration of multiple factors        Various growth factors such as angiopoietin ang        plateletderived growth factor transforming growth        factor as well as VEGFA are also involved in        arteriogenesis and it may therefore be necessary to use        combinations of these factors to obtain stable and mature        vessels Fig  Indeed when VEGFA and ang are        administered together in animal models the resulting        vessels are much more stable and less leaky than those that        are induced by VEGFA alone   Similarly        administration of submaximal doses of ang and VEGFA in a        rabbit ischemic hind limb model led to a stronger effect on        resting and maximal blood flow and capillary formation than        either of the agents alone                      Using a master switch gene        Another approach that addresses the involvement of        multiple factors in therapeutic angiogenesis is the use of        a socalled master switch gene of angiogenesis such as        HIF   This transcription factor can activate a        collection of different genes that are involved in        angiogenesis including those encoding VEGFA VEGF        receptor  Flt and ang    It is hoped that        using a master switch gene will result in more stable        vessels because the processes by which they are formed        would resemble more closely those of normal vessel        development                    Stem cells in therapeutic angiogenesis        The existence of circulating endothelial precursor CEP        cells in adults has been reported    It has also        been demonstrated that similar precursor cells may give        rise to both endothelial cells and perivascular mural cells          Furthermore in an         in vitro model of angiogenesis        normal vascular development has been shown to require the        presence of the CD cKit CD hematopoietic stem        cells   which are similar and may be related to adult        CEP cells        It has been reported that CEP cells are able to        participate in new vessel growth in a variety of animal        models including the rabbit ischemic hind limb model          In patients with inoperable coronary disease        increased circulating VEGFA resulting from transfection of        myocardium with VEGF cDNA led to a significant        mobilization of CEP cells   Another recent publication        has shown that granulocytecolony stimulating factor        mobilized CD cells including endothelial cell        precursors with phenotypic and functional characteristics        of embryonic angioblasts   When injected into rats        with experimental myocardial infarction these CD cells        contributed to new vessel growth which led to decreased        cardiomyocyte apoptosis to reduced remodeling and to        improved cardiac function        Further studies of how CEP cells are released from bone        marrow and to what extent they participate in postnatal        angiogenesis will certainly provide valuable information        regarding the therapeutic potential of CEP cells The        possibility of using CEP cells both alone and in        combination with different angiogenic growth factors        represents a promising means of obtaining stable vessels        Finally since the use of CEP cells would allow easy         ex vivo gene transfer combining        growth factorinduced therapeutic angiogenesis with gene        therapy delivered via CEP should also be a promising        approach                    Conclusion        As research into therapeutic angiogenesis progresses        new information regarding the control of vessel remodeling        and stability will be incorporated into treatment        strategies Better designed studies and clinical trials        that consider the issues discussed coupled with        welldefined and quantitative endpoints will facilitate        the development of novel and effective therapeutic        approaches for ischemic diseases                    Competing
