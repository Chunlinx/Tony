                                 BigBang Theology            Did God cause the big bangThat is what half a dozen new books about science and religionwhose authorsrange from a Reaganadministration official to an Israeli physicist to anelementaryparticletheoristturnedAnglicanpriestare saying The fact thatthe universe abruptly exploded into existence out of apparent nothingness some billion years ago they submit means it must have had a supernaturalcreator A couple of months ago the same claim was enthusiastically aired at aWashington conference sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center underthe rubric Beyond the Death of God with eminent thinkers such as FredBarnes Mona Charen and Elliott Abrams in attendance And the idea received asympathetic hearing on William F Buckleys show Firing Line a few weeksago                         The ideathat only God could have caused the big bang is scarcely new In fact the bigbang is probably the only idea in the history of science that was ever resistedbecause of its proGod import            For much of the modern era scientists followed NicolausCopernicus Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton in believing the cosmos to beeternal and unchanging But in  when Albert Einstein applied his theory ofrelativity to spacetime as a whole his equations implied that the universecould not be static it must be either expanding or contracting This struckEinstein as grotesque so he added to his theory a fiddle factor called thecosmological constant that eliminated the implication and held the universestill            It was anordained priest who took relativity to its logical conclusion In  GeorgesLematre of the University of Louvain in Belgium worked out an expanding modelof the universe Reasoning backward he proposed that at some definite point inthe past it must have originated from a primeval atom of infinitelyconcentrated energy Two years later Lematres model was confirmed by theAmerican astronomer Edwin Hubble who had observed that the galaxies everywherearound us were receding Both theory and empirical evidence pointed to the sameverdict The universe had an abrupt beginning in time            Churchmen rejoiced Proof of the biblicalaccount of creation had dropped into their laps Pope Pius XII opening aconference at the Vatican in  declared that this scientific theory ofcosmic origins bore witness to that primordial Fiat lux  uttered atthe moment when along with matter there burst forth from nothing a sea oflight and radiation  Hence creation took place in time therefore there isa creator therefore God exists            Marxists meanwhile gnashedtheir teeth Quite aside from its religious aura the new theory contradictedtheir belief in the infinity and eternity of matterone of the axioms ofLenins dialectical materialismand was accordingly dismissed as idealisticThe Marxist physicist David Bohm rebuked the developers of the theory asscientists who effectively turn traitor to science and discard scientificfacts to reach conclusions that are convenient to the Catholic ChurchAtheists of a nonMarxist stripe were also recalcitrant Some youngerscientists were so upset by these theological trends that they resolved simplyto block their cosmological source commented the German astronomer OttoHeckmann a prominent investigator of cosmic expansion The dean of theprofession Sir Arthur Eddington wrote The notion of a beginning isrepugnant to me  I simply do not believe that the present order of thingsstarted off with a bang  The expanding Universe is preposterous incredible  it leaves me cold             Even somebelieving scientists were troubled The cosmologist Sir Fred Hoyle simply feltthat an explosion was an undignified way for the world to begin rather like aparty girl jumping out of a cake In a BBC interview in the s Hoylesardonically referred to the hypothesized origin as the big bang The termstuck            Einstein overcame his metaphysical scruples about the bigbang not long before his death in  referring to his earlier attempt tododge it by an ad hoc theoretical device as the greatest blunder of mycareer As for Hoyle and the rest of the skeptics they were finally won overin  when two scientists at Bell Labs in New Jersey accidentally detected apervasive microwave hiss that turned out to be the echo of the big bang atfirst they thought it was caused by pigeon droppings on their antenna If youturn on your television and tune it between stations about  percent of thatblackandwhitespeckled static you see is caused by photons left over from thecosmogonic event What greater proof of the reality of the big bangyou canwatch it on television            Since thes scientists have been busy working out and feuding over the details ofthe bigbang cosmology But God is not in the detailshis existence isdeducible from the mere fact that there is a world at all So goes thecosmological argument  one of the three traditional arguments toward aSupreme Being Click to read the ontological argument and theteleological argument             The reasoning starts off like this            Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence                         The universe began toexist                         Therefore the universehas a cause of its existence Click to learn more about the surprisingIslamic origins of this argument and what Ludwig Wittgenstein had to say aboutit            There aremany options for attacking the logic of this cosmological argument andcontemporary opponents of theism have tried them all            If everything needs a cause for its existence then so doesGod More frequently heard in the form But Mummy who made God Thisobjection fails because it gets Premise  wrong The premise does not say thateverything needs a cause but that everything that begins to existdoes God never began to existhe is eternal So he does not need a cause forhis existence                           Maybethe universe had a natural cause But the big bang could not have beencaused by prior physical processes That is because it began with pointlikesingularity  which according to relativity theory is not a thing buta boundary or an edge in time Since no causal lines can be extended throughit the cause of the big bang must transcend the physical world            Well then perhaps it had no cause at all Itis hard to think of a principle more amply confirmed by our experience thanthat things do not just pop into existence uncaused No one can really pull arabbit out of a hat Ex nihilo nihil fit Yet something of the sort doesseem to happen in the quantum world where owing to Heisenbergs uncertaintyprinciple tiny virtual particles spontaneously appear and disappear all thetime An entire universe could do the same claim some cosmologists Callingthemselves nothing theorists they have produced models showing how thecosmos could have burst into being all by itself out of a patch of falsevacuum or a D geometry of zero volume orin the case of AlexanderVilenkin of Tufts Universityliterally nothing at all this took Vilenkin fourpages of math So the universe is summoned out of the void by the laws ofphysics But this cant be right The laws of physics are just a set ofequations a mathematical pattern They cannot cause the world to exist AsStephen Hawking has written A scientific theory  exists only in our mindsand does not have any other reality whatever that might mean                           Just because the universeis temporally finite does not mean it had a beginning Speaking of Hawkingthis is his famous no boundary proposal So long as the universe had abeginning we could suppose it had a creator Hawking wrote in A BriefHistory of Time  But if the universe is completely selfcontained havingno boundary or edge it would have neither beginning or end it would simplybe What place then for a creator In Hawkings quantum cosmology thepointlike singularity of the big bang is replaced by a smooth hemisphere inwhich space and time are commingled Time zero becomes an arbitrary pointnot a true beginning it is no more a boundary than the North Pole is            Hawkingsproposal is extremely popular with laymen who are hostile to the cosmologicalargument judging from the mail I get Apparently they enjoy being baffled byimaginary time a theoretical fiction Hawking uses to redescribe the big bangso that there is no beginning In real time there still is a beginningSometimes Hawking says that imaginary time is earlier than real time whichis a logical contradiction sometimes he suggests it might be more real thanreal time which is an absurdity            OK so the universe had a beginning and hence a FirstCause which is moreover transcendent How does it follow that this cause isGod or even Godlike Now there is an acute question Philosopher Thomas Nagelhas suggested that something humanly inconceivable lies behind the big bangWhat if anything can really be inferred about the First Cause Well supposethat it were something mechanical An ideal machine produces its effect eitheralways or never it does not just suddenly start to operate at some momentunless someone gives it a kick If a mechanical cause produced the universe attime T there is no reason it should not have done so at time T minus  Theargument can be repeated to T minus infinity A mechanical cause would haveeither produced the universe from eternity or not at all But the universe wascreated at one moment out of an infinity of other indistinguishable momentsThis implies that the moment was freely chosen and hence that the creator hada will and to that extent a personal nature And power            Yet the bigbang cosmologyhas one unwelcome consequence for theists It seems to suggest that the Creatorwas a bungler A singularity is inherently lawless Anything at all can comeout of one It is exceedingly unlikely that a bigbang singularity should giverise to a universe whose conditions are precisely suitable for life let alonethe best of all possible worlds As the American philosopher Quentin Smith haspointed out If God created the universe with the aim of making it animate itis illogical that he would have created as its first state something whosenatural evolution would lead with high probability only to inanimatestates  The only way God could have ensured the appearance of creatures inhis own image was by repeatedly intervening and making adjustments to steer theevolution of the world away from lifeless disaster But a competent Creatordoes not create things he immediately or subsequently needs to set arightobserves Smith Remember we are talking about the universes physicalinfrastructure not sinners with free will            So did God cause the bigbang Overcome by metaphysical lassitude I finally reach over to my bookshelffor The Devils Bible  Turning to Genesis I read In the beginningthere was nothing And God said Let there be light And there was stillnothing but now you could see it
