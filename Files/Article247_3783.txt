                                 Nixon I Am Not an AntiSemite            The National Archives latest release of Nixon White House tapes is asusual a bracing antidote to historical revisionism Whenever the academicworld is tempted to adopt a more favorable view of Nixons character new Nixontapes always seem to appear that squelch the impulse To read                  Slate               s David Greenberg on Nixon revisionists click here The theme of thelatest release according to articles in yesterdays Washington Post and todays New York Times  is Nixons antiSemitism We alreadyknew of course that Nixon had a pathological hatred of Jews Scroll down tothe bottom of Deep Throat The Game Is Afoot to see Nixons outrage on discovering thatMark Felt a highranking FBI official believed by both Nixon and Chatterbox tohave been Deep Throat is Jewish But even Chatterbox was taken aback at thevirulence of some of Nixons comments on the new tapeswhich sadly are notavailable either in audio or in transcript form on the Web The bestChatterbox can do is refer you to the quotations in the Post and Times stories which were based on the reportersown transcriptions            Heres a fairly stunning snippet from George Lardners Postpiece                                             Washington is full of Jews the president asserted Most Jews aredisloyal He made exceptions for some of his top aides such as nationalsecurity adviser Henry Kissinger his White House counsel Leonard Garment andone of his speechwriters William Safire and then added                              But Bob generally speaking you cant trust the bastards They turn onyou Am I wrong or right               Haldeman agreed wholeheartedly Their whole orientation is against you Inthis administration anyway And they are smart They have the ability to dowhat they want to dowhich is to hurt us                        And heres a similarly outrageous example from Irvin Molotskys story in theTimes                                              The only two nonJews in the communist conspiracy Nixon saidwere Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss Many felt that Hisswas He could have been a half but he was not by religion The only twononJews Every other one was a Jew And it raised hell with us                                       Most stunning of all however was the Times assertion that theRichard Nixon Libraryand Birthplace in Yorba Linda which purports to be a serious researchinstitution issued a statement saying the President was notantiSemitic  italics Chatterboxs Chatterbox always wary ofparaphrase decided to take a closer look at the Nixon Librarys statementwhich you can read by going to the Library Web site and clicking on The White House TapeRecordings February to July  A Guide to the Major Themes andPersonalities            Actually the Nixon Library document nowhere says that Nixon was notantiSemitic The phrases antiSemite and antiSemitic dont appear in theNixon Library document at all  aside from this passage                                             President Nixon after expressing the view that most Jewish Americans areinsisting that the Administration go along with what he regards as Israeliintransigence on the Suez Canal and other Mideast peace issues while refusingto give him support on his Vietnam policy remarks If anybody whos been inthis chair ever had reason to be antiSemitic                   italicsChatterboxs  I did HR Haldeman replies Thats for damn sure ThePresident continues And Im not you know what I mean Accepted Im notproIsrael Im not going to let Israels tail wag the dog                                                      However  the overall thrust of the portion of the Nixon Librarydocument that interprets Nixons remarks on Jewish Americans is indeed todownplay Nixons comicbook antiSemitism                                             As with his attitudes toward African Americans the Presidents wordsabout the Jewish community on these tapes show that his basic sense ofcompassion and support for these communities tends to coexist with terminologyfrom an earlier time                                       An earlier time This was  not  Attitudes toward African Americanswere appalling many would say they still are but attitudes towardJews particularly in Washingtonwere fairly benign The Nixon Libraryseems eager to blame Haldeman for egging Nixon on                                             It should be noted that the Presidents comments regarding lack ofpolitical support for the Administration among many Jewish Americans frequentlyoccur when Haldeman is present and that Haldeman is generally quick to notewhen some person who is the subject of adverse comment happens to be Jewish                                       It should further be noted that Haldemans eagerness to enable NixonsJewhating which may have stemmed from his tendency to pander to all ofNixons worst instincts or may have reflected sincere antiSemitism of hisownChatterbox has no ideadoes nothing to mitigate the appalling bigotry ofNixons comments The Nixon Librarys gloss on Nixons remarks about Jews endsby pointing out that despite Nixons initial misgivings about appointingHerbert Stein to chair the Council on Economic Advisors Stein who prior tohis recent death wasa                   Slate                contributor was also Jewish                                             the President within months would make Stein his Chairman of theCEAjust as he would give the Jewish state unequivocal lifesaving support inthe  ArabIsraeli War  The actions of the President as well as thesubstantial documentary record of the Nixon Administration should always bekept in mind when evaluating his words on the White House tapes                                       Chatterbox wont dispute that this century has seen bigger antiSemites thanRichard Nixon On the other hand Nixons comments about Jews make say PatBuchanans seem comparatively benign This is not to excuse Buchanan who inthe latest issue of George OK in a profile written byChatterboximplores preposterously that if he were an antiSemite Would Ihave a Jewish doctor who deals with my heart Would I have a Jewish brokerChatterbox would think that part of the burden of working at the Nixon Libraryis conceding that Richard Nixon while no doubt misunderstood in many ways wasone wicked antiSemite But a glance back at the Nixon Librarys Web sitereminds Chatterbox that for the Nixon Library the fundraising hence the needto downplay controversy never stops FOR
