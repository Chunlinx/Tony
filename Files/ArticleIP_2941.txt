                                 Innocence Abroad            Mavis Gallant is one ofthose strangely positioned writers whose fans rank her near the top of theliterary ladder but who remains to the rest of the world not much more than aname A quick rundown then of her long and impressive career It begins inQuebec where Gallant was born and lived till the age of  In  she quita newspaper job and moved to Paris allowing herself two years to publishfiction or find another line of work You might expect a painful drama tofollow a piling up of drafts and rejections Instead she was instantlymature prolific and publishable Her first submission to The NewYorker was returned with a friendly letter but on the second try she gotin Since then shes published over  stories there more than any writer sofar            Ifarithmetic is the measure Gallant must be the quintessential New Yorkerfiction writer For four decades up until a few years agowhen the magazinechanged editors and began to emphasize the newsher quiet professionalism herwry mildly gloomy sensibility and her knack for perfect detail were anearperfect fit This last gift of observation Gallant explains in theintroduction to her huge new Collected Stories  dates back to abifurcated childhood                           Ones beginnings are regional Mine are wholly Quebec English andProtestant yes but with a strong current of French and Catholic My youngparents sent me off on that current by placing me in a French convent schoolfor reasons never made plain I remember my grandmothers saying Well I giveup It was a singular thing to do and in those days unheard of It left mewith two systems of behavior divided by syntax and tradition two environmentsto consider one becalmed in a long twilight of nineteenthcentury religiositytwo codes of social behavior much practical experience of the differencebetween a rule and a moral point                        Here is the split mind of a Henry James heroine raised inthis hemisphere with excessive propriety and then thrust unprotected into oldand indecipherable European traditions Note the characteristically airtightyet elliptical prose the worldweary delicacy that records the differencebetween a rule and a moral point but commits neither to one nor the other            Laterliving in Paris Gallant took up the Jamesian theme of innocents abroad thoughshe sometimes sketched her expatriates with the quicker more economicalstrokes of a Hemingway Yet she arrived in France in the s a time of drabpoverty and rubble one century after rich New World travelers made their firstbewildering return trips to Europe and one long shockfilled war after the jazzage and its tremors To that Europe Gallant brought a new bemused realism andan acquaintance with such petty facts as train schedules and plumbing Shebecame a deromanticizer an adjuster of expectations A Gallant character whocultivates decadent aristocratic airs or tries too hard to hold on to Puritanfreshness is at best a selfpunishing neurotic at worst a fool            As if to emphasize the documentary nature ofthese pieces Gallant has arranged them chronologically in her collection bydecade from the s through the s The stories werent necessarily writtenin the decade theyre filed under The opening work The Moslem Wife aboutNetta a strangely sheltered Englishwoman who lives in Southern France with hercallow husband Jack evokes the Vichy period but was written in  Netta andJack run a small hotel Jack is a philanderer and eventually leaves andGallant traces them through separation and World War II and a pragmaticlastminute reconciliationthe same voyage at the same speed as the firsttime around in their disastrous affairin a bus station            Gallantsstories of men and womenand these include a few tales of trusting men letdown by untrustworthy womenfollow a basic pattern Someone possessing anaivet perhaps reminiscent of the yearold who ran off to Paris to writeoffers someone else his or her love and is let down but still manages to getup in the morning for the next several decades These stories are the tightestand the best designed and they yield her most memorable lines dark ironiccompressions of incompatible worldviews Netta for instance took it forgranted now she was married that Jack felt as she did about light darkdeath and love and from that we understand that separation is inevitable Ortake this moment from Between Zero and One                           WhenI was young I thought that men had small lives of their own creation I couldnot see why born enfranchised without the obstacles and constraints attendanton women they set such close limits for themselves and why once the limitshad been reached they seemed so taken aback                        Elsewhere the wandering observer predominates and thestories gain weight in the quest for clinical accuracy Besides the English inthe south of France we get lifestyle portraits of Romanians scraping by onfake passports in Paris Americans slumming in dirty Madrid a German soldierreturned from prison camp to Berlin in the later stories we meet Canadianscoping with European strays Often Gallant keeps the plot to a minimum merelyvisiting her characters several times over a span of years The young grow upand we learn about French school exams and then the petty hierarchies in thecivil service The elderly are defined by their memory of past events From theopening to In Plain Sight                           Onthe first Wednesday of every month sharp at noon an airraid siren wailsacross Paris startling pigeons and lending an edge to the midday news OlderParisians say it has the tone and pitch of a newsreel sound track They thinkBefore the war and remember things in blackandwhite Some wonder how oldHitler would be today and if he really did escape to South Africa Others sayan order to test warning equipment was given in  at the time of the Suezcrisis and never taken off the books                        This passage could easily belong to a piece ofnonfictionto one of the witty old Letters from Europe that used to run inThe New Yorker  And in fact in the best of these character studies avivid picture of Cold War Europeinfected with mediocre rhetoric imprisonedby fake boundaries inhabited by numb and ambivalent peoplebegins to takeshape James and Hemingway give way to the shabby backdrops of John Le Carrsnovels Yet unlike Le Carr Gallant does not believe in plot or inspeculating on the meaning of her stories Character is everything facts makethe man If Gallant sometimes achieves the same high notes that great reportingdoes her lesssuccessful stories resemble the more meandering old NewYorker humaninterest profiles in which a persons fleeting thoughtsneurotic habits and random memories are woven into a pattering portraitConsider the opening to The End of the World which introduces an angry sonwho as the story goes on will be called to Paris to care for a selfish dyingfather                           I never like to leaveCanada because Im disappointed every time Ive felt disappointed aboutplaces I havent even seen My wife went to Florida with her mother once Whenthey arrived there they met some neighbors from home who told them about asign saying NO CANADIANS They never saw this sign anywhere but they kepthearing about others who did or whose friends had seen it always in differentplaces and it spoiled their trip for them Many people like them have nevercome across it but have heard about it so it must be there somewhere Anothertime I had to go and look after my brother Kenny in Buffalo                        Theres a healthy faith inthe concrete in this kind of story and a democratic interest in human natureBut theres also a cool complacency an indifferent shrug By Gallants ownadmission in the introduction she composes with an eye to craft not thedeeper heart of a story Each local ironic effect has to be placed preciselyeach street name has to be gotten right the first time I could not move on tothe second sentence until the first sentence sounded true she writes somewhatdiffidently True to what Some arrangement in my head I suppose  Thefirst flash of fiction arrives without words It consists of a fixed imagelike a slide or closer still a freeze frame  Whole scenes then followcomplete in themselves but like disconnected parts of the film But a film anda slide show are not the same thing as fully imagined fiction These storiesmake up a time capsule assembled by a skilled social historian a rich galleryof plausible lives They are well observed well written and remote and nomore than a handful if that will last
