        all right well on this subject i really hadnt had to deal with putting someone in there yet but my mothers always been administrator of a nursing home so ive always been involved you know in one   uhhuh how do you feel about them i mean since youve kind of been close to that   well ive yes well i can kind of see both sides you know  i really can um  nursing homes to me i i would personally be the last resort you know i really you know if i had to put someone in there   uhhuh well ive had a touch of experience my um dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldnt take care of him   yeah if its a have to thing yeah i yeah   and uh she put him in but he wasnt there very long before he died but   uhhuh   um i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay   uhhuh   but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and thats always kind of bothered me   yeah uhhuh yeah well i kind of think thats true too i guess because its so under staffed you know   umhum   thats like everything else though   i have a sisterinlaw who runs a nursing home but ive never actually been there and i know that shes the kind of person who wouldnt allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about   uhhuh yeah yes but yeah   but still im sure there are you know aspects to it that arent really desirable   yeah yeah i know because ive always well my sisters involved in one also and i really think they really do a wonderful job but still theres those little things that happens you know there really is which i think its a wonderful place you know if it comes to that   yeah   you know if you just cant take care of them any more   well sometimes you dont have any other alternative after all family and friends are usually well familys tied up with   uhhuh thats it yeah uhhuh   their own lives and things and usually working and   other things yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at   its hard to yes umhum i think thats important too in fact theres a   not just i do too outsides awful deceiving sometimes   yes   you know   theres one uh close to where my mother is but in order to get in you have to be able to um walk in on your own in other words you cant be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate um   yeah yeah   they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time   cares yeah yeah   but its always well and they have a long waiting list too so theres always this feeling of well golly gee you know youve got to be able to walk in the door so you cant wait until youre too bad off   off yeah   but then you dont want to go do that when you dont have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever   to oh umhum and everything you worked for so hard for all your life yeah   yeah and if youre still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee im you know im isolating myself here for no reason at the moment   uhhuh uhhuh   so its kind of a thats a hard one but it is a very nice nursing home   now there is some really nice ones theres also you know some private ones you know   umhum   but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in  something like that you know thats way out of my reach   yeah thats the problem the expense of it all is       and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately   uhhuh yeah oh yeah yeah   but those who dont have money can go in and get the same care   uhhuh the very same yeah yeah   you know so i dont like that aspect   yeah but i theres i think theres ways around it though that you know like they could put it in one of their childrens names or something   yeah   you know but still a lot of them doesnt feel comfortable doing that you know its their money     this is thats right   you know thats how i feel about it anyway   well yeah ive talked to my mother about that several times lately and i i said i want you to have control of your own business   yes yeah   but you know what if   yeah my mothers seventy now so naturally shes retired but shes still on her own i mean you know   yeah yeah my mothers uh seventy five and still has her own home and everything   yeah i think thats wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand ive seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know   yeah thats true they have a lot of people around to do things with some of those places have wonderful activities and things   uhhuh theyre not lonely   you know lots of stuff going on and theyll take them places and   oh yes uhhuh yeah   so i dont know its not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really   no   have some problems if you cant get around and do things   around yeah but i really dont know what the other solution would be you know i really dont   no   But no when the time comes im really hopefully well really look around before i decide on one for my parents   umhum   really do because i have been raised in one you know so theres lot of things i know to look for   yeah   and i dont think theyd want to go where they used to work either  you know  i really dont it really would yes     yeah that might be kind of tough huh   yes and like like i said my sisters still in it and i really  dont think my mother want to be there  either       oh well its been nice talking to you and i guess wed better get back to work huh all right byebye   well you too okay  bye
