                                 Booze You Can Use            I love beer but lately Ive been wondering Am Igetting full value for my beer dollar As Ive stocked up on microbrews andfancy imports Ive told myself that their taste is deeper richer morecomplicated more compellingand therefore worth the  percent to  percentpremium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud And yetIve started to wonder is this just costly snobbery If I didnt know what Iwas drinking could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium vssomething from Pabst            Im afraid well never know the answer to thatexact question since Im not brave enough to expose my own taste to a realtest But Im brave enough to expose my friends This summer while working atMicrosoft I put out a call for volunteers for a science of beer experimentTesting candidates had to meet two criteria  they had to like beer and they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and highendmicrobrews            Twelve tasters wereselected mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer Afew were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft departmentwhere I worked All were software managers or developers  all were male but Irepeat myself Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or livedabroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews Mosttasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates When theyentered the laboratory which mere moments before had been a Microsoftconference room they discovered an experiment set up on the followinglines             Philosophy                Theexperiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions The firstsession whose results are revealed here involved beers exclusively from thelager group Lagers are the lightcolored relatively lightlyflavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in theUnited States Imported lagers include Fosters Corona and HeinekenBudweiser is a lager so are Coors Miller most light beers and mostbargainbasement beers            Beer snobs sneer at lagers because they look sowatery and because so many bad beers are in the group But the lager test camefirst for two reasons One lagers pose the only honest test of the ability totell expensive from dirtcheap beers There are very few inexpensive nut brownales India pale ales extra special bitters or other fancypantsymicrobrewstyle nonlager drinks So if you want to see whether people cantaste a money difference among beers of the same type youve got to go lagerTwo the ideal of public service requires lager coverage This is what mostpeople drink so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest goodfor the greatest number            In the second stage ofthe experiment held several weeks later the same testers reassembled to trythe fancier beers The results of that tasting will be reported separatelyonce Microsofts mighty Windows powered central computers have              Materials                Ten lagerswere selected for testing representing three distinct priceandqualitygroups Through the magic of the market it turns out that lager prices nearlyall fall into one of three ranges            a High end at  to  per pint Per pintwas the unitpricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue Wash that was thestandard supply source for the experiment There are  pints per six pack sothe highend price point is around  per six pack            b Middle at around  cents per pint or under per six pack            c Low at  cents to  cents per pint or under per six pack            The neat mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted The highendbeers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones and twice as muchas the middle range The beers used in the experiment were as follows                           High End                                       Grolsch Import lager Holland  perpint See an

down before an array of  plastic cups labeled A through J TheAtoJ coding scheme was the same for all tasters Each cup held  ounces ofone of the sample beers Total intake for a taster who drank all of everysample  ounces or two and a half normal beers Not lethal also they werejust going back to software coding when they were done Saltines wereavailable to cleanse the palate The cups were red opaque plastic so tasterscould judge the beers color only from above There was no time limit for thetasting apart from the twohour limit in which we had reserved the conferenceroom One experimenter the boss of most of the others there rushed throughhis rankings in  minutes and gave the lowest overall scores The taster whotook the longest nearly the full two hours had the ratings that came closestto the relative price of the beers This man grew up in Russia Theexperimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test wasover            After tasting the beers each taster rated beers Athrough J on the following standards                           Overall quality points Zero to  zero asundrinkable and  as dream beer Purely subjective measure of how well eachtaster liked each beer                           Price category The tasters knew that eachbeer came from the expensive medium or cheap categoryand they had to guesswhere A through J belonged A rating of  was most expensive  for

they would call it if this were a winetest            When the session was over results for each beerwere collected in a grid like this                         To see all the grids forall the beers

atsimilar trends The beers were ranked on corrected average preferencepointsan average of the zeroto points assigned by each tastercorrected just like ice skating scores by throwing out the highest and lowestscore each beer received The tasters used widely varying scalesone confiningall beers to the range between zero and  another giving  as his lowestmark But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted suchdifficulties to provide these results                         Here again one costly beer SamAdams shows up well while another Grolsch continues to struggle but not as badly as the mediumprice MillerGenuine Draft  Sams success could reflect its quasimislabelingpresenting a strongflavored beer as a lager It could also reflect thatparticipants simply thought it was good Only one guessed it was Sam AdamsAs for Grolsch  it is very strongly hopped which can seem exotic if youknow youre drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you dont MGD overtookGrolsch in the race for the bottom because while many people hated Grolschsome actually liked it no one liked MGD There are some other importantfindings buried in the chart but theyre clearest if we move to              Value for Money theTasteometer  Since this experiments real purpose was tofind the connection between cost and taste the next step was to adjustsubjective preference points by objective cost The Tasteometer rating foreach beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preferencerating by its price per pint  If Beer X had ratings twice as high asBeer Y but it cost three times as much Beer Y would have the higherTasteometer rating When the  beers are reranked this way the resultsare                         In a familiar pattern we haveGrolsch bringing up the rear with less than onequarter theTasteometer power of Busch  the No  value beer The realnews in this ranking is the success of Busch  theembarrassment of Heineken and Miller GenuineDraft  an expensive and a medium beer respectively which share thecellar with the hapless Grolsch  and the nearly Buschlikevalue of Milwaukees Best and Schmidts  Itis safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for BuschMilwaukees Best or Schmidts before the contest began But when they didntknow what they were drinking they found these beers much closer in quality tobest beers than the prices would indicate                            Social Value for Money theSnobometer  In addition to saying which beers theypreferred the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensiveor notin effect to judge whether other people would like and be impressed bythe beers One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure whenhe said in comments about Beer B Heineken I dont like it but I bet itswhat the snobs buy The Snobometer rating for each beer is similar to theTasteometer You start with the group rankingwhether the tasters thoughtthe beer belonged in Group  cheap  or and then divide by the price perpint The result tells you the socialmobility power of the beerhowimpressive it will seem relative to how much it costs The Snobometerrankings are                         We wont even speak ofpoor Grolsch or MGD any more The story here is the amazingsnobpowerperdollar of Busch  closely followed by Schmidts  Adollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spentin Grolsch useful information when planning a party Not everyone likedBuschone called it crap another Water LITE But the magic ofstatistics lets us see the larger trends             Conclusions                Furtherstudy is needed But on the basis of evidence to date we can say                           One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test This is SamAdams  which  tasters independently ranked best without knowing theywere drinking a fancy beer They knew it was darker than the others butcouldnt have known whether this was some trick offbrand sneaked into thetest               Dont serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exoticor unless youve invited me               Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch the tasters really had trouble tellingone beer from another  This conclusion is implicit in many of thefindings but it was really obvious during the experiment itself when theconfident look of menwhoknowtheirbeer quickly turned to dismay and panic asthey realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same                        The evidence suggests other implications aboutspecific beers For instance the comments about Coors Light are muchless enthusiastic than the averageorbetter numerical rankings Most tasterspaused to complain about itfizzy and soapybefore giving it reasonablemarks But the main implication and the most useful consumer news from thisstudy is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beersBased on this study rational consumers should             Buy Sam Adams when they want an individualglass of lager to be as good as it can be             Buy Busch at all other times since itgives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested            The detailed rankings and comments
