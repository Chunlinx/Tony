                the subject is how we feel about immigration   yes   would you like to get started or would you like me to   well i am very much in favor of closing our door to some extent im afraid ive gotten a little bit America first when i get a cab in   umhum   almost any large city in the United States and the driver barely speaks English   yes   uh   thats happened to me too   yes of course it also happened to us in Sidney Australia this Summer uh or last Summer we got a cab and again it was an oriental person and we asked him to take us to the opera house and he did not know what we were talking about   oh my   so maybe my isolation isnt for our country  might be a little bit for the world i dont know but uh i just feel like we are we have accepted people other people from other countries so well to the point that we have not taken care of our own how do you feel about   well i have im really torn on the subject im not a good candidate for this one i see what you see and i agree with you   however   well the other side i see because we have Mexico as a neighbor   uhhuh   and i can tell you right now   uhhuh   that if i were living in Mexico and trying to raise several children and i could see across the border where the good life would be for my children   uh uhhuh   would i swim that river every night twice if thats what it took you know i dont care whatever it would take i have real sympathy for those people i really do and you can   um you betcha i um however if you were living in Mexico in those conditions would you have several children   probably they dont have birth control   well   they have no concept of it its against their church   but yourself you yourself would not do that you would not have several children if you couldnt   well but they dont have if you know if i had to put myself in their shoes i have to do it one hundred percent   uh yeah but you dont have   their church doesnt teach birth control they preach against it   thats not my fault   i understand what youre saying but im saying   i know     i feel real sympathy for them so i really and and and by the way i feel the same way when i i just got back from Florida   um   and boy i tell you happily happily i can i can understand just a little bit of Cuban English   uh uhhuh   just a little bit       which was about all i wanted to understand   uhhuh   uh but i its amazing because theyre theyre bilingual   uhhuh uh   everything is is Spanish English in Florida and i didnt particularly enjoy it quite frankly   uhhuh uhhuh at one point and i cannot say that its true now but at one point the city of Chicago was required by federal law to hire teachers who spoke Spanish so that they could teach to the the children there who only spoke Spanish   yes   but this is America and our language is English   thats right and im sorry that business thats right and im sorry that business of making it mandatory i dont like mandatory anything   no   because it just doesnt work all the time it doesnt fit there are circumstances that are different but i do think if you come to America and youre going to live here and youre going to go to our schools and do all of this speak our language   uh um i think so too   i really do and its only fair to the children i think making giving the children an out that they dont have to speak English is just encouraging them to drop out later on because theyll never make it through high school   yeah huhuh well its English   and if they do it wont make any difference because theres not a job for them   its encouraging them to not speak English   thats exactly right and that is the wrong message   uhhuh   i just i dont know i feel so sorry for them but at the same time   but thats the same thing youre saying about the little Mexican children that you feel sorry for them and you would swim the river twice but i   i would if it were if they were my kids i would so i have to sympathize with the people that come over here and work and send money back   sure but uhhuh   you know its its right on the survival level and we do what we do to survive   uhhuh absolutely and and i know what youre saying we do what we have to do for our children regardless regardless of what that is but im a little bit unsympathetic with the families right here in our own small town of five thousand who have not limited their family we have three children and that happens to be what we could afford but i dont really feel like i ought to help even if theyre people from Indiana support ten children thats not fair i didnt get a say whether they had them or not so i dont think i ought to have to help raise them too critical i im concerned about world birth control and   oh im im thats thats one on me too i mean   uhhum   there are too many children that are just conceived and produced and dropped on society   uhhuh   without a thought these crack babies   oh isnt that awful i was just reading this thing in the Chicago Tribune yesterday about this little girl who was a crack baby and she was put in a foster home for five years and was having a wonderful life and then her mother   are so sad   claimed to have her self her act together and she was given back to her birth mother who she had never seen i mean it was just one of those awful things where the Child Protection Service completely broke down and now two years later the court ordered that she be given back to the foster people i its just awful its just awful the whole thing   doesnt make any sense   its just awful i i as i say im isolationist i think we need to to close our doors to some of the immigration and now theyre talking about how were bound to have an influx of immigrants from the latest war from Iraq Iran Saudi Arabia so on and so forth and uh im im really sorry that i feel the way i do but i just think that we need to not take people as we have over the many last many many years   well we had there theres a little background here but it it builds up to what were talking about our church had a long long discussion group and basically the question started out that as at the time when there were starving people in India i believe   uhhuh   and the question was should we save these people   yeah because   and our bottom line answer was no because we cannot save the world   because well and   we cannot feed the world and we should not please the world this   and i think probably they have said that if you save these people by feeding them then they reproduce and then you have a later more serious famine yeah   this and the other thing is we can feed them today but theyll be hungry tomorrow whatll we do with them tomorrow do we feed them again tomorrow well how long how long can we continue to feed the world we cant do it are they starving to death yes and thats very sad   yeah yeah umhum um uhhuh   sad but we cannot save them we you know okay we can save one   uhhuh   and thats good but whats you know back to what youre saying if you want to save somebody theres plenty in the United States that need it to   when our children were all three at home our oldest daughter uh is still a very giving caring wonderful person shes making a career of uh well shes a director at a care center close to here in fact my mothers a resident there anyhow was uh she got us involved in the Christian Childrens Fund and we were sponsoring a young boy in Chattanooga Tennessee in a home then and that went on for oh four or five years and finally we had a letter from the Christian Childrens Fund that they were no longer going to uh sponsor children within the continental United States that all of the money would be going to children overseas because for however much money we were sending a month they could buy so much more milk and bread and rice and so on and so forth for children overseas well at   so theyre taking the world viewpoint   yeah well at that point we said no were not doing this any more we wanted to help somebody here within the continental United States it wasnt our choice to to send and then too i think that money gets watered down in administrative costs when it all goes overseas and i always wonder if people who need it actually get it   umhum but by profession i negotiate for Texas Instruments a lot and im somewhat cynical   um   about humans and their behavior   um uhhuh   because i have had many interesting examples of human behavior   uhhuh   when youre talking about money youd be surprised how human we all get very quickly   it all turns different doesnt it   uhhuh um   we were on a cruise ship one time and some people from the Methodist Church were talking about how their church diocese had poured thousands of dollars into Haiti and it had been used for Papa Docs daughters wedding   uhhuh there you go   which  im sure thats not what they had in mind when they were pouring that money in the   but see thats what happens And the other sad thing i heard about the Kurds
