        so what do you think   uh the causes of crime  um  i think it was an imbalance of of power in the United States thats causing the lower class class to rebel thats why theres such such high crime in uh theres crime in uh young people because they dont have real role models   yep   see too much crime on TV and they think its way to go i dont know what do you think   what about i agree with the upper and lower level you know   umhum   because thats the lowest thing for themselves plus theres nobody for them to look up to   yeah   but i also blame some of it on parents   okay   because parents arent parents   yeah   because i remember even when i was growing up im thirty five  i remember when i was growing up and i had friends   okay   that used to do stuff like you know go to the store and steal stuff my mother warned us its like i dont care what your friends do if you do it then that was it i mean i knew that i would get mean more trouble from my mother than from   yeah from anybody else   from anybody else and i think thats the basic is they have no morals anymore so they dont care   yeah yeah   so   yeah i think i can agree with that too   but now as far as what they can do about it i dont know       you cant make parents be parents   thats true you got to kind of make want people wanna do the right thing   you know   i dont know how you do that   i guess if you gave the gave them jobs that thats another problem with the United States theres no jobs anymore   yeah well i ive heard this one theory that if you know if a kid commits a crime that theyve instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent or both of them   but   now put put the blame on the parent   thatll work to a point well thatd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway i dont care what you do to them   yeah   you know so i think it depends on how much trouble that kids has been in you know   yeah   because uh a child can get into anything regardless i dont care who how good you they are   yeah yeah   eventually at least one time but now if its a repeated thing here with this child in juvenile and all this to me yeah both of them because that means shes still not doing what shes supposed to do   yeah   because i just watched it on TV one night on one of them um Twenty Twenty Forty Eight Hours one of them  shows where this boy had been stealing cars   umhum yeah   i dont know if you seen  they was the gang a little it was a little gang of them stealing cars you know and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there now theyre gonna take me away from you that means she was warned   hm no i didnt see it yeah   but see by that i think that sometimes it a little late   yeah   you know but im sure theres something can be done   yeah what about with adults you think they can do anything about just adult regular adult crime   yeah start prosecuting they but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system     yeah huh for well the major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded   well they should start with the the if they would get rid of seems to me i know theres a lot about courts that people dont understand theres more people in jail right now for child support   umhum   okay  then there are for people doing drugs   hm   they ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them go let them go   yeah yeah   you know give them a fine whatever make them do civic duty whatever put them fools in there thats what they need to put i call i call them all fools idiots whatever little rock stars put all them in there   yeah i mean seriously they ought to put those good people to work yeah hm   you know the murderers the the drug dealers the user put them all in jail you know and let all the normal people go   yeah   you know because okay   yeah   if you write a bad check you go to jail right   yeah   okay let them people go   yeah   not let them go and get out of it let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else   well they yeah they you still have to punish yeah   you know like cleaning up the city or however they do they community time you know whatever that is  but   yeah thats you know   put dont put them in jail because theyre not hardened criminals   yeah and theyre theyre still they can provide for society whereas some of them are so far gone that they cant do anything good for society   umhum   yeah   so i dont know them people boy they got the i think the United States has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else   yeah thats true   now how they gonna fix it i dont know the i dont think there is a ready solution   no i dont think so either um   because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it   yeah   uh hes gonna have to work extra hard just to make ends meet   and they keep taking more money from us yeah people and get and they dont have any incentive to work if were just gonna take fifty percent of it   umhum yeah   they might as well steal it then they dont have to pay taxes on it   thats it   yeah   so you know they i i know thats bad but you know the just like Texas now   umhum   they could of had a lottery they dont want a lottery why not i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever im paying you know a week or whatever   theyd have a yeah   and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck   yeah   because you know they take and Uncle Sam takes his the Social Security which probably wont be here when i get that old you know   hm   because were payin g for Social Security they using now whos gonna pay for mine   yeah   yeah  but its its  nah you dont count on Social Security but its its thats what im saying they need to do something else   no i dont know  definitely im not counting on it yeah hm   but        crime is gonna go up as long as the economy stays down   yeah   and its gonna get worse thats just like last night they killed them people in that store where you at   yeah uh im in Raleigh North Carolina   oh  no wonder you dont know then   why where are you from   they killed im in Dallas   okay   but last night  they killed uh uh four people in a chain food   oh man   and killed them well it was two stores side by side   umhum   one was a store and one was like a a fast food place i think it chicken or something i dont know  anyway they raped the women   yeah   beat them all up including the women i mean they just beat them stuffed them in the freezer and then shot them all   ow   now  why was you know  dumb   why did they do it in the freezer   you know why didnt they just if they was gonna lock just lock them in the freezer take the money you know they didnt have to kill them or rape them or anything   yeah hm hm thats awful  yeah we still get some in Raleigh i mean not not too often real bad ones but   umhum its just getting really ridiculous down here i wish i could move somewhere where this you know you got to like in the country but   i dont think theres anywhere where there isnt gonna be crime so   well i think if its the town is smaller   umhum   and everybody knows everybody its harder to come in there and do something   yeah yeah   where is and and and see thats another thing neighborhoods arent neighborhoods anymore   yeah   theres nobody next door to you you dont know your neighbors and stuff like that   yeah   its just huhuh  you know because i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers   hm   and you didnt even and the what the manager the manager wont even do anything   hes probably drug dealer himself  never know   umhum you dont and so i moved because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up   wow   you know and this is like across the street this was a nice part of town   hm   and then across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that making that um crack stuff and then the other time i saw the cops break down somebodys apartment around the corner i said see this is it   hm time to go   thats it and i moved and you know now i live in like a family a neighborhood in a townhouse but its nice i dont you know   yeah yeah im kind of in the same same kind of deal townhouse in the neighborhood   but   its pretty nice   i dont know how they can let a neighborhood or apartment complex thats what happened thats whats wrong you know       i dont think dont rent to them  or rent to them evict them because they drug dealers put it on the lease if you deal drugs you cant live here   yeah yeah yeah most of them too scared to do anything about it   umhum thats it   yeah all right well listen i got to go its good talking to you   well alrighty and i thank you byebye   alrighty byebye
