          okay Carolyn what kind of dress do you have to wear when you go to work   uh i can actually wear anything i want to however i generally wear uh suits or dresses   yeah   how about you   uh well in my company we do have to dress up and they dont say that you have to um dress in a dress for women but they strongly urge it so its its kind of an unwritten law   well the company that i work for uh we its very casual we dont see any people theres a plant out in the back and then im in the office section and we always had casual day on Friday which meant you could wear jeans or whatever you wanted to which to me dressing down is you know like wearing pants and a jacket or something   right   but uh even though i dont have to dress during the day you know in anything that dressy i still feel better i feel more professional when im dressed up   exactly its puts puts forth a better image its uh my company doesnt usually have casual days we had our first one in four at least since ive been there which is four years not too long ago and i didnt feel comfortable dressing like many people came in like warm ups and no and i   youre kidding thats casual   yeah and i dont feel i i wore you know a nice pair of pants and and blouse but i i i just couldnt feel comfortable in my warm ups around everybody at work   uhhuh would i assume that perhaps they did that one time and that was it   oh well it was just recently so i dont know if theyll do it again the way some people looked i would doubt it     well thats what i always thought actually uh the gals in our customer service department quite honestly came in every day in what i considered casual but   umhum i dont know i it just seems if you want to get ahead or even if you just want everybody to think of you you know as a a professionally you you dont just want to have the real casual look all the time   umhum do you work for a large company   well weve got two hundred people in our office but were the corporate office so um its its relatively large but i mean i have a job very much longer so i i dont want to say too much   well and it and it affects uh you know being in the corporate office how you have to dress too do you   exactly we have to hold the image for everybody   do you tend to dress up toward your superiors as the books kind of   i would like to you know i dress as nicely as my budget allows   i understand     and and you know i mean its its a lot better than some people there and its not as nice because i dont have the money of others you know what about you   umhum uh i have never i really have not worked for very many companies that i had a female role model   uhhuh   um the we have some im sure in our corporate office but ive not met them yet but uh the last few jobs ive had well there was two jobs ago there was a girl in the office uh that i tended to try to emulate somewhat but uh   umhum so you dont work with many women   no not too many   and i work with all women   ive do you really   and my husband does well not all but the majority and my husband he works in a bank and he works with all women   majority im sure thats true i used to be in banking and youre right the majority of the people there   yeah at least at the lower levels you know   uh exactly   what oh someone never mind thats a call coming in but   okay   well pass that   what about season to season do you change   um i probably get a little bit more casual in summer in then in that i would wear a more casual top under some of my suits   umhum   than i would wear in the winter   umhum   but our offices are rather cold so i ill tend to try to dress warmly too   exactly i i do the same and thats what basically keeps my wardrobe i may wear a few really warm dresses in the winter but i dont i dont change a whole lot because its its were environmentally controlled you know you end up wearing the same thing   well tell  me another thing uh how do you wear your skirt lengths   below the knee         i i i dont have nice knees  theyre kind of knobby so   on the knobby side i what about you   well i they go from everywhere to just like halfway up the knee to uh mid calf   uhhuh halfway up the knee you must have better   not halfway not halfway up my leg halfway up my knee   oh okay   okay my half of my knee might   oh okay i i im thinking halfway between the knee and your say your hip   uh and my im a little too old for that for one thing and its terribly unprofessional     well it that it is but i know a lot of women who who do wear those skirts and they have been reprimanded in our company before     really   yeah       also i was going to just mention that i wear what you know my my wardrobe my wardrobe how should i say it i wear what i can fit into           you mean you have fat days and thin days   oh yeah fat months thin months you know   well right now im having a fat month i know half of my clothes dont fit me since the holiday season   exactly the same for me but im working on it but im not doing a very good job at this point i havent gotten serious yet   well we have to get all of this junk food out of the house from Christmas     thats right thats right but im so used to eating now its hard to get out of the habit   well
