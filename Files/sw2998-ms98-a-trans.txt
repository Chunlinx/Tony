                um what do you think  the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas   well the the the major major major cause it seems up here is simply i live right on the ocean so its kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution we dont have too much industrial pollution   umhum yeah yeah   uh car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that that i can really put my finger on here   um that isnt the same in the Washington area because we dont have any major um industry except for uh government and services and the the transportation situation is such that uh all the car pollution is is absolutely awful um  also the worth of the hub of three airports in this general area there is uh National Dulles and then uh Baltimore Washington and it interestingly some of the information ive been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh uh airplanes is extraordinary   is that so i didnt know that   yeah and thats always something that you know you just dont real you dont think about   well most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution   uh but the uh apparently the air pollution and the fact that its delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor   yeah i would think so you know uh i i guess it talked about all types of pollution i happen to read just read something the other day       at least in the Boston paper there were three things that that come to note one is that the carbon fluorides that are uh being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer and again and now theyve located another one or  rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere so car   um   so im quite concerned i dont think its involved any longer with with uh hair sprays or those those no i think its now is what uh from what i understand its air conditioning units and and we certainly turned into an air conditioned society   yeah yeah umhum society has especially recently   yeah i know in Florida theres no place you go that isnt air conditioned and i do quite a bit of business in Washington  and   i mean you know what its like here   oh yeah its quite is is the  its really out of the norm not to find something that isnt air conditioned   yeah yeah yeah we just had the   and and i guess refrigerators are the same way they release that   thats right so solutions to this would be i i you know improved   yeah well   well i guess the first the to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights   yeah   i mean this is so so basic its human rights in the sense but uh in terms of demanding its just not caused but demanding that um uh we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward um improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses um  planes that something can be done i mean i cant imagine that well if we cant send people to the moon that we cant improve these things   well i i think yeah no i think that it can be done simply because uh uh weve weve every car now in America thats been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter   converter yeah umhum   and no lead gas was came to the pumps and and thats been done theres the lead pollution has that problem essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was was licked   umhum   and i think that there are there there are solutions certainly we dont even need a need a research anymore its just a matter of passing the law and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry the automobile lobby is   and that uh for buses thats right well and also to make it economically feasible   thats right thats right   uh and particular also in buses i dont know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus   oh yeah well  that that the the smell is awful and but you know i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes   that you know umhum yeah umhum uhhum   so i guess youre better off sitting behind a bus than a car although i can never i could never uh really a a rationalize that while i was sitting there   yeah but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels   yeah   i mean im im thinking of research in that direction rather than we weve taken the intermediate step but i dont think fossil fuels are the answer   well we you know up here in New England uh where ive right close to where i live is the Seabrook Nucleus site which is practically a you know guerrilla war up here went on for years   umhum yes i mean   uh my my daughters marched in the uh uh against the Seabrook and i kind of uh my feelings were that we needed this bridge to to uh to     yeah   jump from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be   yeah you dont throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use   yeah unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years   yeah yeah   so we really dont know whether theres enough fossil fuel left or there isnt and uh and uh i   but with the pollution issue uh fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway   no   uh so youve to look youve got to look elsewhere so uh but it is something thats a little frightening and in fact well i within our family we have said said my husband i have two sons uh well one one is already in college in New England   yeah yeah   and the other will be going in September and we just feel that when we leave uh this area were were going north not south   yes   uh i like the mentality north and i also like the fresher air up there   thats right   so i mean thats the way we will be going   yeah   but um so i i id be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how they their attitudes are   well since since Texas and Louisiana and uh California that in that ranking order the worst pollutants in America   umhum   i mean i read that the other day i mean Louisiana Louisiana for a small state was it was amazing but its the industrial pollution i should imagine and California seems to be taking steps i mean   umhum   you you read about the the fairly fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now theyre theyre enforcing but uh again uh that didnt occur without a crisis nothing will occur i guess without a crisis   the smog and yeah umhum yeah i mean even California was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issu e out here   yeah exactly exactly well the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as im concerned is the no smoking rules on airplanes and in restaurants and it it really is a pleasure for me although i guess smokers dont think that     well that thats thats personal thats personal air pollution   but that to me was pollution that was its most personal personal uh pollution that i can think of   yes yes yeah well i i definetely definitely advance that well listen i enjoyed speaking with you and lets hope some there are other people that feel the same way   surely something happen right on thank y ou byebye   youre welcome byebye
