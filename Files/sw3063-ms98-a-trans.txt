        uh we are to discuss air pollution and uh what we think the causes are   uhhuh   and i probably would uh target uh industry as being number one polluter     yeah thats probably a major one i think uh individually uh just by the vast number of people there are theres i think cars are also a major contributor to it   well vehicles and and yes and   yeah vehicles   but right because uh theres a lot of commercial vehicles out there especially those the big rigs like the busses and um the big uh eighteen wheelers and so forth     uhhuh uhhuh   i think they would generate probably uh one of them would probably generate enough for three cars         but thats not and i think it can be resolved if uh if they really let go with the technology that they have at uh at their hand and they havent released it yet   just a minute im on the phone uhhuh   i think theres a lot of hold back uh because of uh oh priorities that they have you know and um its you have some children   yeah  well it yes i have i have five in the kitchen at the moment  you need to shut the door please       shut the door right now we have the air conditioner running what do you need  hurry im on the phone yes you may and they keep turning the tape recorder up besides   oh okay  do you have do you watch children or do you   um i have three of my own and i have uh two that im tending for the summer off and on so   uhhuh well well thats interesting um is there anything   they cause more noise pollution than air pollution   well temporarily they do  then we get out of that phase   thats right thats right yeah   soon enough   but um i think another  you can tell when you go around cities you can smell specific things from from uh specific industries   um oh yes   i remember being i i grew up in New Jersey   umhum   and uh i can remember the smell of Newark vividly  and its the type of industry you know which obviously if you can smell it its in the air   uhhuh sure umhum  well i know uh uh in Michigan uh the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air   yeah   and um of course now   well people think you burn it its gone but its not gone   no and when they and you bury it and its not gone either because it has untold ramifications   umhum   and uh   then it just gets into the soil and into the water   and it gets into into people you know which is uh the the most important um   yeah   resource that we have is people and theyre and theyre destroying us they really are   yeah we really have to do more   so i think the cockroach will evolve uh safely safely   i think weve got to do more with the recycling thats im im really glad to see that theres more of that happening   so they say yes but theres not enough   yeah   and we need expert cooperation   well its a were getting at least theyre starting you know so at least theyre moving that direction   yeah education of the education of the people is primary i would think   yeah   and uh and were hard to teach   umhum well its going to its probably going to be a generation or two before   we are hard to teach absolutely yeah   before its really going very well because   umhum   now the adults are more aware of it and the children are being taught in the schools more itll be you know on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good   absolutely yes uh of course uh we would like to see it accelerated because uh of the critical nature of it   umhum   the the learning of it and the just to um think that way we have to be in that thought pattern and able to um motivate ourselves to um uh do what is right for the atmosphere   umhum   um i think were all contributors i mean every human being that lives is a contributor to pollution so   yeah yeah   we just um   i think youre right education is a big thing you know and as we educate them individually what they can do   umhum   people become more aware of the things in industry too that that are causing problems and and i think that theyll gradually theyll work towards solving those problems more too um   well hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past   umhum   that the time frame for cleaning up our air and our and our um  land you know which uh we get our nutrients from you know i mean everything goes back to the land   yeah  just a minute and ill turn it up ill turn it up in a minute honey when im done     so  um its just um very critical i think at this point to uh get that through to the people and get us educated   uhhuh yeah well i think science has come a long way to making it so that its possible to find ways to solve the problem   umhum       i i dont know if they offer classes in uh the uh in the grade school uh uh subjecting   um i think they teach it a lot in science   in science okay   yeah i would think that thats where it would come through   what grade level would that be would that be um perhaps the first grade level which would be   i i think theyre kind of getting it in all different grades   well i mean are they starting though at at with the children that are so their little minds are like sponges and they can really uh relate to that   yeah i think they are starting probably in the first grade theyre you know theyre hearing somewhat about it um i know uh Target has their program to make kids more aware of it and   target stores   yeah   oh okay   theyve got if you go in the entrance theyve got uh stands usually where they have um little uh kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read and and they can form a a group to   okay oh i see um help fight the pollution oh thats wonderful   uh yeah yeah so   well im sure that uh perhaps theyre the leaders you know and other will others will pick up on their example and carry it um  further   yeah   you know because um thoughts are   well i i know its hard its a hard problem to solve because you you know like McDonalds has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing and   umhum   and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more and then theres the paper and plastic bag question
