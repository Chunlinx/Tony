Tuesday Sept  and Friday Sept                        A Yugoslav paper claims tohave talked to Monica Lewinsky on the telephone According to a report fromBelgrade Thursday in LaStampa of Turin the weekly Nedjeljni Telegraf got in touch withMonicas mother Marcia Lewis through an exhairdresser of hers BozdimirBulent a Yugoslav immigrant living in Washington DC The paper called fromBelgrade continually for a week before Lewis finally allowed it to talk to herdaughter The clinching factor La Stampa said was the mention of amysterious Yugoslav by the name of Dusko with whom Lewis had allegedly fallenin love  years ago in Los Angeles Softened by thoughts of Dusko she gave inand arranged for Nedjeljni Telegraf to call Monica direct            This is how the interviewreportedly went Answering the phone in a rather hoarse and velvety voiceMonica said I was expecting your call My mother mentioned it I sincerelyhope you wont make bad use of it Asked if she had ever imagined she might bethe talk of the whole world she replied Not even in my dreams and Im notat all happy about it Did she love the president Perhaps but now its ofno importance Did she feel exploited In a certain sense yes I neverexpected all this Would money and fame change her life I dont think aboutsuch things Money has never been important to me            Monicasaid she now spends most of her time on the telephone and almost never watchestelevision Asked if she had a message for the readers of the NedjeljniTelegraf  she said They shouldnt believe everything they read in thepapers But when the weekly asked if during her meetings with PresidentClinton he had ever mentioned Serbia Monica decided she had had enough andput down the phone  La Stampa failed to vouch for the authenticity ofthis interview            In the continuing flood of international press comment onthe White House scandal there is very little favorable to Kenneth Starr ButNigerias independent Post Express said in an editorial Wednesday The fact that Monica Lewinsky amere intern could be protected by the State against such a mighty opponent asthe most powerful politician in the world reveals the beauty and thecostliness of democracy It is significant to note that even at the possiblecost of the presidency the right to fair hearing and enabling unconcealedinformation to the citizenry  sic  have been remarkably upheld in thiscase It is best imagined what would have happened to Lewinsky her family andany enthusiastic reporting press of this scandalous episode in any undemocraticsociety            In Canada the TorontoGlobe andMail said in an editorial Thursday that it is time for Americas punditspollsters and prognosticators to take a vacation because if Americans aretired of hearing about President Bill Clintons sexual life they aredoubtlessly doubly weary of hearing experts tell them how they feel about thewhole thing The theme of the editorial was the distinction that should bemade between feelings and deeds The endless mood monitoring of the peopleand their president has revealed a swirl of conflicting feelings but the endproduct is the same as it was when the whole thing started Mr Clintonremains the President and the citizens remain guardedly content to keep himthere            Americansmay be experiencing all kinds of feelings about their President but they areremarkably consistent when they are asked what they want to do about thoseemotions the Globe and Mail went on Impeachment No a majority ofthe US public has answered from the start to the finish of this story It isthe ability of the American public to distinguish between feelings and deedsthat will save Clinton it said They show no interest in punishing him forhis private feelings but a clear desire to see him pay a limited price for hisdeeds  Americans have clearly stated that feelings arent the issue hereSooner or later the pollsters and the pundits will understand that too            In South Africa the Johannesburg Star rana eulogistic editorial Thursday about President Nelson Mandelas visit to theUnited States He fired the pride of African Americans and touched a deepdesire in the psyche of Americans both black and white for a leader who mightrekindle the biracial coalition that destroyed their countrys own version ofapartheid in the s the racism they are still fighting to eradicate todayand the neverending scandals  Mandela may lack the rousing Americanoratory of a President Kennedy Martin Luther King or Jesse Jackson but hismanner and his unflappable dignity show him as a disciplined persistent leaderwho is willing to sacrifice shortterm gratification for longterm achievementthe kind of moral leadership we need everywhere A real untarnished hero in atime of flawed public figures such as Clinton
