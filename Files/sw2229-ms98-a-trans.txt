        do you are you on a regular regular exercise program right now   yes and i hate it  how about you     oh well im kind of off and on   off and on well i guess ive been kind of off and on ive um   right now im kind of off   had some health problems that have led me to uh stay more on than off   okay what type of exercise do you do   uh i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics   okay i guess you dont enjoy that very much   not  not really   you find that uh to be boring   yeah yeah and time consuming i mean its its not just the exercise thats boring and time consuming its uh you know afterwards you know then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know   yeah well im trying to get back in shape for softball this spring   i know you go through this this is something you go through like every year   but i yeah i havent decided whether youre whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i dont know if youve seen those advertised on TV   humum   its one of those uh universal type machines exercise machine but i havent really sat down and used it much yet so its collecting dust right now   yeah a lot of things do that i have a negative i had an exercise bike i used to have one and finally got rid of it because i never used it but i do use my treadmill   i used to jog somewhat uhhuh well thats good yeah my parents have a treadmill its when i go visit them uh ill get on that thing every now and then   yeah its nice because when the weathers bad you cant you dont have any excuse   umhum no i just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something   yeah i cant ride a bike so   i been sitting in here uh in the house all weekend with a cold so i thought id better uh better get outside and do something and not waste the day   oh yeah its too nice been too nice of a weekend   but uh yeah i need to start jogging again ive always found that to be uh uh really one of the best forms of exercise but its terribly boring and so i really dont ever keep a a program up consistently   uh you had any injuries from jogging   no i never have well i dont jog enough i think to develop any injuries i usually only go about a mile or two   i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that its very hard on your body and and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse   yeah its its tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt supposed to be much better if you find uh grass or or uh dirt to jog on   umhum yeah thats not quite so so easy yeah yeah   have to have the right type of uh shoes too thats very important   i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts   but yeah i dont have to buy jogging shoes all too often mine dont get very much use   well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every six months   uhhuh   so   ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but uh like i said im just not very consistent about maintaining a a program so ill ill bicycle i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out and uh on a consistent basis every couple a days and ride a bike for awhile but then ill get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week       but uh that gets old too in a very short order im im hoping that this uh solo flex will uh   yeah   uh change things a little bit i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis   yeah well dont let it collect dust you least exercise while dusting it off   yeah   well   so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can uh start some type of uh regular program   yeah that thatll be good   ive always found that that when you write things down and set goals its a lot easier to keep uh keep something going   umhum   uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise and uh one of those involved a six week session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that   oh   and that was very helpful and we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently uh increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks   umhum   i found that to be uh very helpful   so are you gonna do that   uh i need to i havent started yet but  its a thought     well that sounds like something good to do then   sounds like something i should do   yeah nice way to start off the spring   uhhuh   get back in shape   how often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking   well i do i switch every other day one day i walk and one day i do the aerobics   okay how far about how far do you go walking   well im trying build up my tolerance now i just surgery um less than two months ago and right now im just a little over about a mile and a half but i try try to workup to three miles   okay yeah thats good well they say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging   yeah it takes its just that it takes longer to get the same effect yeah but   it sure well if you keep up a a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going uh   my walkman broke so im upset now i just have to turn the stereo up real loud   yeah   yeah but its a lot less stressful on the joints than jogging is   yeah it is and it this has an you know my treadmill has an incline and you know you can get a really good workout on it   umhum  do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch on TV   no i i just do it on TV i have a cassette   okay which uh shows do you watch on TV   um its just a its a tape i use tapes   oh okay okay like a Kathy Smith workout or Jane Fonda   Richard or Richard Simmons   Sweating to the Oldies   okay right i will every every now and then ill watch uh ESPN i i get cable on TV and they have uh a couple of shows called Basic Training and um what is the other o ne called   uhhuh there was one guy i used to watch on ESPN i dont know if hes still on it anymore or not i dont i dont know if i get ESPN or not   uhhuh   but um well yeah i used to watch one watch one on the air but that was back   Bodies In Motion thats thats the name of the one i was thinking of   that was yeah   with Gil Janklowicz   yeah yeah i watched that cause he was cute   yeah well hes hes he he hes not bad and his assistants usually arent either   but uh   theyre always in in in Hawaii someplace on on the on the beach   yeah yeah but then that was back when um you know the high impact and   yeah well they they do low impact stuff now theyre on everyday   do they are they yeah okay theyre so theyre still hes still doing it then huh oh ill have to tune in   yeah every morning its on ESPN uh at what time i cant remember what time its uh well i cant remember offhand what time   ill have to check it check check it back up then but the thing is is everybody always looks so good on there show least on some of the other ones not everybody has a picture perfect body   they have that show on yeah every now and then umhum well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on TV   i havent watched any other ones on TV um just on some of the tapes so   theyre on weekdays at eleven oclock everyday Monday through Friday   ill have to okay thanks   case youre interested in that i actually taped a few of the sessions that they had on there but uh i havent done so much as uh watch the tape that i made   now thats a thought well thats a thought i hadnt thought about doing that   so im kind of bad about that myself   well theyre gonna beep us pretty soon   okay well i sure enjoyed talking to you about uh exercise and fitness   uhhuh nice talking to you okay thanks talk to you later bye   so all right good night bye
