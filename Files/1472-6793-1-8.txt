                    Background        In skeletal muscle the dihydropyridine receptor DHPR        consists of          S                      a and           subunits   This complex is        responsible for the Ltype Ca current and serves as the        voltage sensor for excitationcontraction EC coupling In        the latter process the movement of electrical charges in        the          S subunit promotes a conformational        change that opens the ryanodine receptor type RyR in        the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane SR leading to an        increase in cytosolic Ca    The functional        interactions between the DHPR subunits necessary for        opening the Ca channel are only partially known Further        the interactions between DHPR subunits and RyR also are        incompletely understood The           subunit is a large protein that        contains the basic functional elements of the Ltype Ca        channel including the Ca selectivity        voltagedependent gating and sensitivity to        dihydropyridines The cytoplasmic loop between repeats II        and III of the          S subunit interacts closely with RyR        and is an important determinant of skeletal type EC        coupling    A region in the cytoplasmic loop between        repeats I and II of the           subunit referred to as the AID          binds tightly with a  amino acid region on the           subunit referred to as the BID           subunits are   to  kDa proteins essential for        channel assembly andor membrane targeting as well as for        modulation of channel kinetics   The            subunit is a highly glycosylated          kDa protein formed by two disulfidelinked peptides        encoded by the same gene Transmembrane topology and        functional analyses suggest the            subunit is composed of a single        transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail of only        five residues    Given this topology the            subunit is most likely to interact        with the           andor the           subunits The           subunit is a   kDa skeletal        musclespecific protein with four presumptive transmembrane        domains     The transmembrane topology of the           subunit and the critical binding        domains are unknown at this time        EC coupling is initiated by voltagedependent charge        movements in the S segments of the DHPR          S subunit whose expression is        dependent on the presence of the          a subunit   The Cterminus of the                 a subunit has also been shown to be        important in EC coupling presumably by interaction with        RyR   The role of the            subunit on skeletal EC coupling is        unknown but in heterologous expression systems it has been        demonstrated to increase the amount of charge movement          The role of the           subunit in Ca channel function is of        particular interest given the discovery of a second         subunit           or         stargazin  which is expressed in        neurons and is responsible for the         stargazer mutation in mice          Subsequently several other  subunit genes have been        identified and shown to be expressed in brain and        peripheral tissues    In the present study we        examined the role of the           subunit in Ltype Ca current and EC        coupling in skeletal myotubes Absence of the           subunit slows inactivation and        produces a depolarizing shift in the Ca current        inactivation vs voltage curve in agreement with results        from an independently produced           knockout mouse   However absence        of           does not affect the voltage dependence        or the magnitude of charge movements and Ca transients        Overall the           subunit appears to promote inhibition        of the Ca channel function of the skeletal DHPR While        this subunit is clearly nonessential for activation of the        Ltype Ca channel and for triggering skeletaltype EC        coupling           appears to specifically modulate the        Ca channel function of the skeletal DHPR                    Results and Discussion                  Inactivation of the DHPR  subunit by gene          targeting          Gene targeting was used to replace the entire coding          region of the             gene with the           neo gene as described in Materials          and Methods Fig  Targeted ES cell clones were          injected into CBlJ blastocysts and chimeras obtained          After additional breeding a line containing the             targeted allele was obtained Fig          Ashows Southern blots from DNA of control              het  and             null  mice after digestion          with           Eco RI and hybridization to probe           The             het and             null mice show the predicted  kb          restriction fragment indicative of the targeted allele          Fig B Similarly for the Southern blot of DNA          digested with           Hind III and hybridized to probe           the             het and             null mice show the predicted  kb          restriction fragment indicative of the targeted allele          Fig C The             het and             null mice have no visible          abnormalities and are fertile Western blots showing the          expression of the DHPR subunits are shown in Fig D The          amount of the             subunit present in control             het and             null samples as a function of total          membrane protein was determined in two independent          membrane preparations These data indicate that the          amount of             expression in membranes from             null muscle was not detectable above          background no primary antibody as expected from the          fact that the entire gene was deleted In membranes          isolated from the             het mice the level of expression of          the             subunit was  of control values          for each of the two independent determinations          consistent with what might be expected from the loss of          one allele Whether there is compensation by increased          expression of other  subunits such as the             and             subunits which were shown recently          to be present in skeletal muscle by RTPCR   or          alteration of the amount of the other subunits remains to          be determined in the future                          Increase in Ca current density and decrease in          inactivation in  null and  het myotubes          We examined the impact of the             null mutation on DHPR properties          using electrophysiological techniques in primary cultures          of skeletal myotubes derived from mouse embryos Fig          Ashows wholecell Ca currents in control             het and             null myotubes in response to ms          depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of           mV Current traces for only three voltage steps are          shown for clarity All three cell types displayed the          slow highvoltage activated Ltype Ca current typical          of skeletal myotubes When the holding potential was           mV we also observed a Ttype Ca current which was          seen in approximately half of the cells tested data not          shown Ca conductance vs voltage curves were computed          in Fig Bfor the three cell types The sigmoidal lines          correspond to a Boltzmann fit to the population mean          while parameters fitted to each cell are shown in Table           These data show that the maximum conductance G           max  for both the             het and             null cells are significantly larger          p than the values for control cells However          the halfactivation potential V             and the steepness of the curve          factor k were not significantly different see Table           Thus full or partial elimination of the             subunit produced a significant          increase in the Ca current density without a change in          the voltagedependence of the Ca conductance          At intermediate potentials such as  mV Fig A          the Ca current of             het and             null cells inactivated more slowly          than that of control cells To examine changes in          inactivation we used the pairedpulse protocol shown in          Fig A which measured the Ca current not inactivated          by the prepulse It has been shown that inactivation of          skeletal Ltype Ca channels approaches steadystate          extremely slowly on the time scale of tens of seconds            However for comparative purposes and to be          consistent with previous measurements in Ca channels          lacking                we chose a much shorter          protocol Cells were held at  mV then stepped to a          series of depolarizing prepulse voltages for  s to          promote inactivation then stepped to  mV for  ms          to close noninactivated channels The noninactivated Ca          current was measured during a ms test pulse to           mV In control cells there was almost complete          inactivation of the Ca current when the prepulse          potential was in the positive range This can be seen by          comparing the amplitude of the Ca current during the          test pulse in traces   and  corresponding to          prepulse potentials to  mV  mV and  mV          respectively In contrast             het and             null cells showed less inactivation          during the prepulse and thus a significantly larger Ca          current during the test pulse Furthermore prepulse          potentials larger than  mV did not promote additional          inactivation which can be seen by comparing traces  and           in the             het and             null cells Fig Bshows the maximum          Ca current during the test pulse plotted as a function          of the prepulse potential In control cells          inactivation was complete when the prepulse potential          was above  mV    pApF at  mV vs             pApF at  mV n   cells In             null cells inactivation reached a          plateau when the prepulse potential was more positive          than  mV    pApF at  mV vs             pApF at  mV n   cells Incomplete inactivation          was also seen in             het cells although this was less          pronounced than in             null cells Since the prepulse was          not sufficiently long for inactivation to reach          steadystate we are not certain whether the observed          incomplete inactivation reflects a component of the             null Ca current that inactivates          extremely slowly or a truly noninactivating component          To compare the voltagedependence of the inactivation          produced by the second prepulse the Ca current          during the test pulse was normalized and fit to the          Boltzmann equation Fig C The curves for             het and             null cells showed a significant          p shift to more positive potentials compared to          control cells The same conclusion was reached by          comparing the Boltzmann parameters of individual cells in          Table  Since control cells had a more negative half          inactivation potential the higher Ca conductance of             het and             null cells reported in Fig could          be explained by a larger steadystate inactivation of the          control Ca current at the  mV holding potential To          determine if this was the case we measured the Ca          conductance during the prepulse for the same cells          analyzed in Fig BC The prepulse was delivered from a          holding potential of  mV and therefore the prepulse          current should be less contaminated by steadystate          inactivation G           max at the peak of the Ca current          during the prepulse was    pSpF for controls             pSpF             het and    pSpF for             null cells with ttest statistical          significance for controls vs             null cells of p   and for          controls vs             het cells of p   Thus the          higher Ca conductance of             het and             null cells persisted at the more          negative holding potential These Ca conductances were          approximately  higher than those at the  mV holding          potential reported in Table  The additional current          could have been contributed by Ttype Ca channels not          shown which are available at the  mV holding          potential but are inactivated at the more positive          holding potential Also since the Ttype Ca current          density was highly variable see above this could          explain the higher p values compared to those reported in          Table  In summary decreasing the amount of the             subunit protein or eliminating it          completely resulted in myotubes with a higher Ca          current density a similar voltagedependence of          activation and a reduced rate of inactivation These          results with the exception of the change in Ca current          density are in remarkable agreement with those obtained          when Ltype Ca channel subunits are coexpressed without          the             subunit in heterologous cells see          below They also are similar to results obtained          elsewhere in             null myotubes using a second          prepulse   Furthermore the incomplete inactivation          of the             null Ca current resembles that          observed in ts A cells expressing DHPRs specifically          lacking             and using a second inactivation          protocol            The effect of the             subunit on Ca current kinetics has          been somewhat confusing until now because it has not          been possible to examine its role using homologous          subunits and a homologous expression system In amphibian          oocytes             was assayed in a complex with            C             a and                 These investigators          found             produced a slight decrease in Ca          current density no change in activation kinetics and a          positive shift in the peak Ca current vs voltage          curve In HEK cells using the same subunit          composition the             subunit did not alter the kinetics          or density of Ca currents   However in both          oocytes and HEK cells the             subunit increased the rate of Ca          channel inactivation and produced a large          hyperpolarizing shift in steadystate inactivation              The results obtained here in skeletal muscle          demonstrate that absence of the             subunit increases Ca current          density decreases the inactivation rate and shifts the          voltagedependence of inactivation in the depolarizing          direction Freise et al   showed that the increase          in Ca current was not a result of changes in single          channel conductance and suggested the effects were due to          changes in channel open probability However this          remains to be tested directly Expression of the             subunit in BHK cells expressing            A               and            a also shifts the voltagedependence          of inactivation   mV in the hyperpolarizing direction            In summary the two  subunits that have been          characterized to date namely             in the homologous skeletal myotube          system described here and             described above in heterologous BHK          cells   appear to be inhibitory In each case the          presence of  results in fewer Ca channels available          for activation                          Absence of changes in the EC coupling voltage          sensor of  nullmyotubes          The impact of the             null mutation on myotube EC coupling          was inferred from intramembrane charge movements the          bulk of which have been shown to originate from the DHPR          voltage sensor    Additionally we measured Ca          transients evoked by voltage ie by the movement of          the voltage sensor and compared these two sets of data          To measure DHPR charge movements and to separate these          charge movements from those produced by other          voltagegated channels a ionic currents were blocked          b the linear component of the cell capacity was          subtracted using a P procedure and by analog          compensation and c we used a pulse protocol that          eliminated the immobilizationsensitive charge movements          from voltagegated Na channels and presumably also from          Ttype Ca channels Previous studies in dysgenic            S null myotubes transfected with            S showed that the pulse protocol and          the internal and external solutions used here see          Materials and Methods detected charge movements of a          magnitude  to  fold larger than those present in          nontransfected dysgenic myotubes   Thus we are          confident that the technique adequately measures          intramembrane charge movements in DHPR voltage sensors          present in the plasma membrane Fig Ashows          gatingtype currents produced by charge movements in          response to  of  step voltages delivered to each cell            and  mV Charge movements did not occur at           mV in any of the cell types Traces at  mV and           mV show a transient current at the onset of the voltage          step the ON charge and an equal inverted current at the          end of the voltage step the OFF charge The          voltagedependence of the OFF charge estimated by          integration is shown in Fig B The OFF transient was          usually less contaminated by ionic current than the ON          transient and for that reason it provides a better          estimate of the total DHPR charge The main contaminant          of the ON transient was a nonlinear outward current          presumably a K channel that was not always completely          blocked by the pipette solution The OFF charge increased          in a sigmoidal fashion and saturated at potentials more          positive than  mV in all cases These data were          adequately fit by a Boltzmann equation shown by the          lines We found that the fitted maximum charge Q           max  expressed by the  cell types          was   fCpF in agreement with previous determinations          in normal myotubes   Furthermore Boltzmann          parameters determined for each cell and then averaged          were not significantly different in any of twobytwo          comparisons between control             het or             null cells Table  In summary          the magnitude of intramembrane charge movements and its          voltage dependence were unaltered by partial or complete          removal of the             subunit Furthermore in agreement          with previous data   no additional charges moved          when pulses were delivered from a holding potential of           mV data not shown Thus failure to detect changes          in the charge vs voltage characteristics of             null myotubes compared to controls          cannot be explained by charge movements in the             null myotubes occurring at          potentials more negative than the chosen  mV holding          potential          Absence of alterations in the voltage dependence of          charge movement in the             null cells should also be reflected          in the voltagedependence of Ca transients Changes in          intracellular Ca were measured using confocal linescan          imaging of fluo fluorescence Fig Ashows a linescan          image of a Ca transient stimulated by a  ms          depolarization to  mV from a holding potential of           mV in each cell type The scan direction was          perpendicular to the long axis of the myotube in a region          selected on the basis of a low resting fluorescence and a          high stimulated fluorescence redyellow color The two          traces on top of each image correspond to the time course          of the fluo fluorescence averaged across the entire          linescan at  mV which is close to the threshold and          at  mV which produced the maximum Ca transient          Increase in cytosolic Ca started at the onset of the          depolarization and peaked   ms later in the three          cell types For all cells the peak fluorescence change          for the depolarization to  mV was  FFo units          which is equivalent to  times the resting          fluorescence The relatively long recovery time following          the depolarization is due to the low Ca buffering power          of the internal recording solution and is in agreement          with previous studies    The voltage dependence          of FFo measured at the peak of the transient is shown          in Fig B All curves had the same profile which          consisted of a threshold for peak Ca release at  mV          an increase in peak Ca with pulse potential from  mV          to  mV and a plateau at more positive potentials          Furthermore twobytwo comparisons of Boltzmann          parameters fitted to each cell did not reveal          statistically significant differences see Table  In          summary the voltagedependence of Ca transients and          the maximum cytosolic Ca concentration during the          transient were not significantly affected by partial or          total absence of the             subunit However we cannot rule out          changes in the rate of SR Ca release since this          measurement requires an entirely different internal          solution   A recent report indicates that the SR Ca          release rate is slightly higher in             null myotubes                            Involvement of DHPR subunits in voltage sensing and          EC coupling          The            S pore subunit of the skeletal DHPR          is the main determinant of charge movements and EC          coupling     However other subunits of the          DHPR are critical modulators of both functions In          heterologous expression systems the              subunit was shown to affect the          rate of Ca current inactivation and charge movement          immobilization   Studies investigating the role of          the  subunit on charge movement vary with the expression          system used In amphibian oocytes  subunits increase          the coupling between charge movements and channel opening             We have shown in skeletal muscle cells lacking          the             subunit that reintroduction of          variants of             has little effect on either charge          movement or the kinetics of activation of the expressed          Ca current   However the carboxyl terminus of a          is an important determinant of the efficiency of the          coupling between charge movement and Ca release            In contrast to these results earlier studies in which          similar  subunits were coexpressed with             subunits in oocytes indicated           subunits had major effects on Ca current density and          gating kinetics    While the reason for these          discrepancies is unknown they highlight the fact that in          skeletal muscle the gating characteristics of the Ltype          Ca channel might be controlled by interactions beyond          those taking place among subunits of the DHPR For          example a region of RyR has been shown to be essential          for Ltype Ca current expression   Such          interaction is critical for skeletal DHPR function and is          unlikely to occur in heterologous expression systems                            Conclusions        The ability of the           subunit to selectively modulate the        pore function of the DHPR without modulation of charge        movements or the voltage dependence of Ca transients is        unique especially since other DHPR subunits participate in        both functions In all likelihood the charge movement        protocol failed to detect gating currents responsible for        opening the Ca channel which are quite small and are        only resolved for depolarizations  ms   compared        to the  ms used here Fig  A possible shift in the        voltagedependence of these charges recruited by long        depolarizations would be consistent with the shift in Ca        current inactivation and remains to be resolved in           null myotubes However the protocol        accurately measures the immobilizationresistant charge        movements that are known to be required for skeletaltype        EC coupling    Therefore the           subunit is unlikely to play a critical        role in the activation of SR Ca release in agreement        with a recent report   However shifts in voltage        dependence below the limit of resolution see Materials and        Methods and effects on charge movement and Ca release        inactivation cannot be completely ruled out The           knockout mice provide a unique        resource to understand the function of this protein in        myotubes in molecular detail                    Materials and Methods                  Gene targeting          Bacteriophage clones containing portions of the             gene were isolated from a mouse          Sv genomic library Stratagene La Jolla CA           To inactivate the             gene a  kb           Bam HI           Xho I fragment upstream of exon           was subcloned into a multiple cloning site  of the           neo and Herpes virus TK gene that          was in pBluescript Stratagene A second  kb           EcoR I           BamH I fragment  of exon  of the                      gene was cloned into a site between          the           neo and TK genes Fig Aii Thus          the targeting vector contains  kb of identity with the          native             gene  and  kb of identity           of the           neo cassette respectively The          targeting vector also contains the HSV TK gene to allow          for negative selection of nonrecombinants A unique           Bam HI restriction site was used to          linearize the plasmid prior to its introduction into          mouse ES cells by electroporation The             gene contains  exons and correct          targeting results in the deletion of all  exons which          will inactivate the gene Fig Aiii Probe  was used          for identification of targeted clones    g of the          targeting vector was electroporated into    AB ES          cells G and FIAU          deoxyfluoroDarabinofuranosyliodouracil          resistant

allele were viable with no apparent          abnormalities Mice heterozygous and homozygous for the          targeted mutation are referred to as             het and             null respectively                          Western blots          Total microsomes were prepared from the forelimb and          hind limb muscles of control             het and             null adult mice as previously          described   Total microsomes were washed twice with           M KCl buffer and  g of total membrane protein was          applied to a  SDS polyacrylamide gel Proteins were          transferred to PVDF membranes and analyzed with either          anti           S mAb IIC antibody   or anti                      protein Gpurified guinea pig          antibody    or anti           a affinitypurified sheep  antibody            or with anti            affinitypurified guinea pig           antibody and the appropriate secondary antibodies            The subunits were visualized using SuperSignal ECL          reagent Pierce Rockford IL The images were captured          on a ChemiImager Alpha Innotech San Leandro CA set          to a level just below saturation                          Primary

       M the voltage error was  to  mV All          experiments were performed at room temperature Patch          pipettes had an open tip resistance of  M when filled          with the pipette solution Ca currents were measured          from a holding potential of  mV Test pulses of  ms          in  mV increments ranged from  mV to  mV Ca          conductance vs voltage curves were obtained by          extrapolation of the Ca current to the reversal          potential of the cell To measure inactivation cells          were held at  mV then stepped to a series of          depolarizing prepulse voltages from  mV to  mV          in  mV increments for  seconds to promote          inactivation then stepped to  mV for  ms to close          noninactivated channels then stepped for  ms to the          test potential of  mV to measure Ca currents then          stepped to the  mV holding potential for  seconds to          permit recovery from inactivation Charge movement was          measured using a protocol that eliminated          immobilizationsensitive components              Voltage was stepped from a holding potential of  mV to           mV for  ms then to  mV for  ms then to test          potential for  ms then to  mV for  ms and finally          to the  mV holding potential Subtraction of the          linear component was assisted by a P procedure          following the pulse paradigm listed above P pulses          were separated by  ms and had a duration of  ms          Previous studies showed this choice of pulse protocol and          internal and external solutions resulted in          nifedipinesensitive charge movements of a magnitude            fold larger than those detected in dysgenic myotubes          lacking            S                            Solutions          The external solution in all cases was in mM  TEA          methanesulfonate  CaCl              MgCl              HEPES titrated with TEAOH to          pH  For Ca transients and Ca currents the          pipette solution was in mM  Ca Aspartate  MgCl              EGTA Ca transients or  mM          EGTA Ca currents and  MOPSCsOH pH  For charge          movements the pipette solution was in mM  NMG          Nmethyl glucamineGlutamate  HEPESNMG  EGTANMG          pH  For charge movements the external solution was          supplemented with  mM CdCl            and  mM LaCl            to block the Ca current and           mM TTX to block residual Na current                          Ca transient measurements          Ca transients were measured using a confocal          microscope in linescan mode as described previously              Cells were loaded with  mM fluo fluo          acetoxymethyl AM ester Molecular Probes Eugene OR          for  to  min at room temperature Stocks of fluo           mgml were made in DMSO and stored frozen All          experiments were performed at room temperature Cells          were viewed with an inverted Olympus microscope with a          X objective NA   and a Fluoview confocal          attachment Olympus Melville NY The  nm spectrum          line necessary for fluo excitation was provided by a           mW argon laser attenuated to  with neutral density          filters The fluorescence intensity F was calculated by          densitometric scanning of linescan images and was          averaged over the entire width of the cell The          background fluorescence intensity Fo was averaged in          the same manner from areas of the same image prior to the          voltage pulse The fluorescence unit FFo corresponds to          FFoFo The limit of fluorescence detection based on          microscope settings and the average resting fluo          fluorescence was   FFo units That is we could          detect a   change above the cell resting          fluorescence Using a pseudoratiometric equation for          estimating the cytosolic free Ca   and assuming a          resting free Ca of  nM   the nominal limit of          resolution of free Ca change was   nM                          Data and error analysis          For each cell or for the population average the          voltage dependence of charge movements Q Ca          conductance G and peak intracellular Ca FFo          were fitted according to a Boltzmann equation A  A           max expVV            k where A           max was either Q           max  G           max or FFo           max  V            is the potential at which A  A           max  and k is the slope factor For          a fit of steadystate inactivation the term VV             in the equation above was          replaced by V            V Ca conductance for each          cell was computed from the extrapolated reversal          potential and the maximal Ca current at each voltage          In all figures the symbols and error bars correspond to          the population mean   SEM The curves correspond to a          Boltzmann fit of the mean In addition to Student ttests          reported in Table  oneway ANOVA tests were conducted          among the  sets of Boltzmann parameters of control             het and             null cells of Table  The null          hypothesis equality of means was not rejected at a          level of significance p except in the two cases          also identified by ttests namely G           max and V            inactivation An Ftest which          formally tests for the difference between the variances          of independent populations was used to determine which          of the fitted Boltzmann parameters A           max  V             k had the largest variance and          thus the largest experimental error The ranking order in          variance error was V            A           max k Furthermore the error in V                     was the largest for the          fluorescence measurement and the smallest for the          conductance measurement This result was expected since          the size of the voltage step used in the V            determination was  mV for          conductance  mV for charge movements and  mV for          fluorescence The number of voltage steps in fluorescence          measurements was kept to a minimum to avoid rundown of          the Ca transient due to photobleaching The limit of          resolution of V             the parameter with the largest          error was estimated with a ztest which formally tests          for the difference between the mean of a population and a          hypothetical mean We determined the smallest difference          between a experimental and a hypothesized V            resolvable at a level of          statistical confidence p In the calculations we          used the data with the largest V            variance for each measurement          conductance charge movement and fluorescence Also we          assumed a hypothetical SD equal to the experimental          SD The estimated limits of statistical resolution were            mV for conductance   mV for charge movements          and   mV for fluorescence measurements Thus a          difference in population mean V            of less than the indicated limit          would not be statistically significant given the          variance and the number of determinations of the present          study Statistical analyses were performed with          Analyseit software
