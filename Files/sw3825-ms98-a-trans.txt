               well this is an unusual topic what do you think about it   yeah i at first i it took eight times to find you you  so i told my husband um you know what should i say and then he reminded me but um um  his in his family uh what they usually do on his dads side his mom or um the aunts will send out little postcards like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the where to meet and you know just to bring anything and so they just notify everyone by mail and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a a short um or a small um dinner type thing   well that sounds great Ellen how far away do they come from right   um they come from well they all meet in Portland and they come as far as oh Seattle and and sometimes weve gone and we were from we were living in Utah at the time   oh okay   and um but his his dads family is all around the area and his moms side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern Utah and people would come from Seattle to there and um lets see Nevada and in that area Washington and Nevada to southern Utah and they would um assign a different person each time they had a reunion theyd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody   oh okay that makes sense nobodys out of a lot of trouble more than once   yeah yeah and the people who are down there like theyll assign one person in the Utah area one person in the Washington area and that person can call you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too   umhum   and then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyones sort of involved   yeah thats interesting you sound like youve had a lot of experience with this then   oh well  thats my husbands side and my moms my moms or my family family uh we we all live in southern California so we just have to either call or       give a formal invite and were all there so   southern Californias still pretty large   yeah well i mean LA Orange County area i mean everyones you know mostly not farther than an hour away   i see and yeah well my experience um has been limited pretty much lately to my mothers side of the family uh   uhhuh   years ago there was a big dispute on my dads side and uh they havent had a reunion since then they just show up at funerals and weddings   oh   it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that but anyway my mothers side   wow   we had our our first real reunion that ive ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from out of town and they took some some rooms down at a Holiday Inn and uh they had some activity they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and you know a lot of that sort of thing since it was the first one that wed had the you you could do that once now next time we have one well have to think of something more creative to do   well you know thats interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husbands mothers side together is um they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time and everyone inevitably everyone is just very interested and and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someones been born or someone passed away or you know something like that and so everyone has to update their little   oh well have have you do you have an interest in genealogy   books or whatever um  uh i do but not to very much compared to my motherinlaw   not a passion huh um i suspect well do quite a bit more genealogy and i i suspect we will do more of it um i found out some about some of the relatives i didnt you know i i didnt even know their names some of the   oh   two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles and uh theres a lot of things there you have to stop theyre really kind of fascinating i found out my grandmother was one of a twin and we dont even know where the twin   oh   we have virtually no no background on on her on the twin   really is that your your grandmas own sibling and she   uh my grandmothers uh sister who would be somewhere in in West Virginia im sure shes you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago   oh i see oh so   im im quite a bit im probably a lot older than you are um   well maybe um they just moved away and then just sort of lost contact and   i dont know
