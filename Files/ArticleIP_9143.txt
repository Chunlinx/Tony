take birth control pills The woman claimsthat she became pregnant accidentally That factual issue may be settled attrial but it seems that there is a larger legal issue well worth addressingSince court findings of paternity cost the imputed fathers eighteen yearsworth of support it seems only fair that women be held accountable for anypromises they make about attempting to remain childless In the absence ofthat a womans promise to take charge of birth control and then not doing soremains the only form of monetary fraud Todays Papers can think of that is notonly not punished but is in fact
