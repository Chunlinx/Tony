                                 Give This Subsidy a D            Before Bill Clinton startslooking for ways to pay for the new aid to collegebound students hesproposingor Congress returns to its budgetcutting fervorboth ought to takea refresher course in the perversities and absurdities that abound in ourcurrent studentsubsidy programs Theres big money to be saved Just twoprogramsPell Grants and subsidized student loansmade up  billion of theDepartment of Education budget about twothirds and a lot of that money isspent in dubious ways            About  percent of that billion goes down the rat hole to students who either because they lie abouttheir qualifications or because the government makes a mistake dont in factqualify Another few billion goes to students whose major qualification is thattheir parents are divorced Billions more send middle and upperclass kids toexpensive private schools Still more millions subsidize such odd groups assingle mothers with rich parents            To befair Clinton inherited this mess But he also made a big deal out of reformingit His accomplishment Hes stopped banks from taking advantage of the systemto skim a few hundred dollars off the top of each new student loan Meanwhilethe systems other much bigger abuses some created on Clintons watchcontinue unabated                           Silly SocialIncentives                        The Department of Education has the commonsense idea thatif parents have the means they ought to help their kids with their collegecosts before taxpayers are asked to assist But Congress has created a handfulof handy ways to ditch rich parents Follow these rules to become anindependent student and no matter how much your parents make the governmentwill consider you poor and in need of aid            Tie the knot Suddenlyparents income and assets no longer count toward determining whether or not astudent is poor Of course young marriage is the most likely to end indivorce            Do nothing If a kid sitsaround till hes  he becomes an independent student too not because hisparents kicked him out of the house but because well just because And forthe kid who cant quite get his or her act together the government is willingto pay for up to six years of undergraduate education Has this subsidycontributed to an increase in the number of years it takes to graduate Todayfewer than  percent of college students graduate in four years a quartercentury ago the number was  percent            Have an illegitimate childThis special qualifying factor added by Clinton and the  rdCongress is solely for the benefit of upper and middleclass single motherswho are now allowed to disregard their parents income in applying for loansand grants Remember getting married already separates college students fromtheir parents in Washingtons eyes and poor kids are already eligible for PellGrants and subsidized loans As a result of these and other ways to makestudents legally independent of their parents the number of independentstudents has skyrocketedin the s fewer than  percent of undergrads wereindependent today more than half are            Dump dadThe granddaddy of all the stupid social incentives isnt for kids its fordads If youre a middleclass dad who cant afford to send your child tocollege divorce your wife The taxpayer will end up sending your kid to schoolbecause divorced fathers income isnt counted under current rules Eventhough married dads arent legally required to pay for their kids collegeeither their income is always counted by the feds This policy helps explainwhy there are  percent more kids with divorced parents among studentaidrecipients more than a million in total than among the general studentpopulation according to the Center for Education Statistics Private schoolscount the fathers income in determining if his kids are in needUncle Samshould too                           Waste                        In  a National Research Council studyfound that more than  percent of all federal financial aid was awarded inerror This was the  th study since and all studies showedsimilar problems A  General Accounting Office report showed the breadth ofincompetence in financialaid administrationbetween  and  ineligible students received subsidized loans Between  and  students received Pell Grant overpayments  received Pell Grants from twoseparate schools simultaneously and  students ineligible for PellGrants because they had defaulted on federally guaranteed loans received themanyway            Considerjust the Pell Grants for students who have already defaulted on past loansThat one mistake cost  million                           Money Games                        When is a dollar not a dollar Well thats complicatedinterms of being in need heres the list of dollars that dont count asdollars            If parents made less than last year none of their assets count as available to help pay forcollege            Dollars invested in ahouseeven a  million housedont count this also brought to you byClinton in             Dollars in retirementaccounts including deferred salary K plans and IRAs dont count            Dollars put in the names ofother kids in the same family dont count            Whatdifference do all these rules make People who know how to use them usuallynot the poor can makes themselves look awfully pitiable About  percent ofundergraduates whose parents have incomes in excess of  get federalgrants and subsidized loans costing the government on average whichis several hundred dollars more than is spent for those whose parents earn lessthan                            Money Games TakeTwo                        Need doesnt depend only on how parents arrangetheir income and assets It also depends on where students want to go toschool If Bobby Middleclass decides to go to State U the feds will offer nohelp But if he wants to go to Harvard well thats a different story Whatthe Department of Education really measures with its financialaid programs isrelative need If the same rules were applied to food stamps heres how itwould work Take the food stamps into a store and pick out hamburger and cannedgreen beans the stamps are worth a dollar Pick out lobster and truffles andthe food stamps are worth             The Department ofEducations statistics speak for themselves At twoyear public colleges whichClinton says all Americans should be able to afford  percent get financialaid At private fouryear colleges  percent get help from the taxpayer            This strategy is even morecostly to nonsubsidized students than to taxpayers Consider the incentive thefinancialaid system sends even lowcost collegesthe more you charge themore aid your needy students will get and since need is determinedrelative to cost the more needy students you will have Its hard to find aneconomist who doesnt believe this is a recipe for inflation And indeed sincethe mids the cost of attending college has more than quadrupled in realterms            So heres todays lesson forboth Congress and the president Whether you want to save money on federaleducation aid or add benefits for more needy students the way to come up withthe needed dollars is to stop subsidizing a stupid system
