        okay while i was waiting for you to connect i i thought of a couple of menus i decided itd to be if its informal or not you know if it was informal id probably choose something i mean just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill     umhum umhum   because thats a lot of fun especially this time of year where its so nice out   yes   um it was formal id probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something im not  im not into formal dinner parties but   i see   id probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread   so what what do you use for cookbooks   um i have a Pillsbury cookbook i got when i was married but its kind of the bible of cooking for me then i have some from like church   umhum umhum   that are more family recipes that are more useful  you know budget cookbooks but   umhum umhum   and of course you get a lot from when youre growing up   umhum   um i cook a lot the same as as my mom did of course ive added several different recipes but what would you serve or what would you   right well i i i think we come from from different backgrounds um so the the   well thats good   i i i start with different you know have different perspectives that you are i find the Joy of Cooking to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on because it has almost everything in it   umhum   but on the other hand  its not very inspiring uh its a good reference when you need to dig something up   uhhuh   what weve find very useful is a a book called The Thirty Minute Cookbook i think thats the title uh by Marion Burrows   huh   uh which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes you know the whole meal   yeah that would be wonderful in these times   and so shes yeah now now i i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes   yeah either theyre really fast or   but but theyre but theyre but theyre interesting theyre interesting menus um   uhhuh   combinations that you wouldnt have normally thought of   uhhuh   um   whats one of your favorites   um gee the one i had most recently was was one that was had  she she describes as Jim Beards favorite um summer menu or something and it consisted of uh grilled kielbasa sausage um a   uhhuh   potato salad with olive oil and uh some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there   wow sounds pretty good   um and that and that was you know thats that thats certain you can do in thirty minutes   yeah   but there are a whole lot of you know i mean i i would recommend you look at that book if youre if you are a busy person Thirty Minute Cookbook   yeah those Thirty Minute Cookbook that sounds fun i find a lot of the cookbooks that i dont know that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things i dont keep on hand all the time   umhum   and i have young children and our budgets set you know at this time but i want to use simple recipes that i have things on hand i dont have to run to the store to buy   umhum   or look for something i havent heard of  so thats why sometimes i shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbooks but   yes yes umhum   but  well it was interesting talking to you its a fun subject food is one of my favorite things too   yes   anything else you wanted to add   well you had said dinner you know you know what would i put together for a formal dinner we had we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night and and um   oh wow umhum   put here here the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert well you know a chocolate mousse recipe   umhum thats good   and a sort of palate cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken Marabella   uhhuh   um which is this wonderful thing you can do um basically youre baking baking chicken in a in an open pan um having marinated it first hand my my wife did this part so i dont remember all the details but its marinated in olive oil and some seasoning   uhhuh uhhuh   um and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh theres a little bit of brown sugar in there and it bakes up its a delicious thing and its easy   that sounds good   comparatively so i   that sounds really good   um im sorry i just love food   it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am im pretty simple right now but   well maybe we had a little more leisure time to do it i dont know   yeah thats probably thats true i have little ones and we and they wont eat you know too many different foods right now so   yeah i found my kids were very frustrating when they were little   yeah   in terms of their tastes   yeah   on the other hand sometimes it was easy theyd you know canned ravioli was was one of their favorites and so it was easy to     yeah spaghettis a pretty  staple every other week or so  so and it goes a long ways too so   open a can of ravioli or yes well nice talking to you Cheryl   all righty well talk to you later maybe   okay bye
