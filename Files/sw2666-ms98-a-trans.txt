        well i guess uh the topic uh being favorite TV shows i uh i guess i could start by saying im just looking forward to uh watching the astronomers on PBS   oh yes that   and uh unfortunately theyre having a  like but theyre having the uh a uh not telethon but a uh auction on on PBS here and   oh uhhuh id noticed that in the in the TV Guide and id totally forgotten all about that   umhum and   and it looks like it would be an a good series   well the first uh episode started out pretty slow but after that it uh obviously has been preempted by the auction the last week or so so it uh i guess ill never know       but uh and you   oh i i have a very wide range of uh uh different shows that i like uh   umhum   uh its i mean i mean even the what is it Americas Funniest Videos theres just theres something about that i dont i dont know if its the simplicity of it or just the total stupidity of it  that is good   yeah yeah   yeah well its it is enjoyable ill give you that its funny   yeah and uh uh i i dont i dont get to watch TV that often or sit back and enjoy it i have a nine month old so that occupies a lot of the time   but uh umhum umhum i would imagine about the only time i usually preempt for i think like Monday night we usually uh watch a lot of TV because thats when Murphy Brown and uh and Designing Women a lot of those shows are on we tend to watch always catch those   yeah yeah those are good i like uh In the Heat of the Night   and In the Heat of the Night   yes   thats uh that is Carroll OConnor yeah   uh yeah right uh that thats had some good episodes to it   umhum   and then plus and then of course you have to have at least one soap opera   well okay   uh right i i i mean at least Knots Landing or something on that order   yeah well i guess i guess now that theyve uh got rid of Dallas which we uh we tend to watch religiously here at uh at at least were getting ready for the big final episode     right right ive been uh i tend to i try to catch that every now and then and i mean you still catch up with it you know every couple of weeks   yeah i its its funny how theyre uh now that the shows over theyre kind of trying to complete all of these uh stories   umhum   in a very short period of time so its like you turn on about eighty seven things happen in an episode now   right yeah i been trying to catch it the last few weeks so i can see how it ends   and uh umhum i guess uh the only rumor ive heard that they had in the papers so far is that uh the last episode is supposed to be like uh its a wonderful life for JR   oh no   so its uh what what would life had been like if he would had not been born there something like that so uh its     should be interesting right lots of tongue in cheek   its going to be funny i bet something something tells me Larry Hagmans going to milk this role that uh all its worth   right hes uh uh with him producing it it it he hasnt done a bad job   but uh no no not at all not at all thats uh thats true but   we uh sort of get a kick out of the Simpsons   oh do you i i very rarely unfortunately it it comes on a little early here and i sometimes im usually at work but they moved it to Thursdays and i guess thats what uh but uh yeah the the few times that ive been able to see it its uh at first i didnt think so   uhhuh   and when i first saw it i i havent been able to see it very often but when i first saw it i said well well this looks like its its going to you know go over like a lead balloon it uh doesnt look like its going to be good at all   right   but the few times ive seen it i guess its something that grows on you   it it definitely grows on you and you think that its   yeah   so far fetched you know with the normal family life that uh but   umhum   every now and then theyll surprise you and have a moral to it and they do the right thing   umhum the the big thing i always hear about is i guess at the beginning they always open it a little differently where they all run to the sofa   yeah right and uh the things that uh Bart will write on the uh chalk board at school   yeah thats it and then sometimes you know the its like one episode i guess the sofa wasnt even there and they all just stood there and looked at each other and and stuff like that so so i hear a lot about that   right   and uh its almost its almost up there with uh Saturday Night Live i guess is the big now with that is the the guy with uh you know like Steve uh Steve Meister and and its like wherever i go anymore ive uh i get got a chance not only to to visit a few companies and all that around here and uh   yeah   its like you walk into a lobbies of those places its like you know Ralph Ralph Meister Ralphster and uh its uh   right we do that a lot at work   yep so its like thats something thats really really taken off but uh   right uh yeah there therere a lot of things come off of Saturday Night Live that uh   umhum   get caught up into the normal everyday routine   right right because uh isnt that special i guess is the last one with uh with the church lady but uh   yeah right and uh oh what was the one that Gilda Radner did   oh uh uh its always not its always something but uh   oh and and im im and im real good at it too well well no its not in that special that uh well anyway but you know what im saying theres you know things will get picked up from it and uh   when she oh what was that yeah uhhuh umhum get caught in the regular conversation anymore   right   and uh   right oh yeah well TVs on constantly here whenever were at home   well especially if you have a nine month that nine month old that probably how about uh have you watched the the whats that new show Baby Talk or or the one with where they take off of Whos Talking   uh ive seen one of  ive seen one part of an episode   yeah i havent seen any of it yet but was it was it any good   it didnt do anything for me i       uh uh we like Look Whos Talking you know and this just wasnt anything to me like it   yeah umhum   you know with uh wasnt it Bruce Willis that did the voice but uh you know theres just something with that   yeah umhum i guess were also looking forward to the uh boy its its terrible that i guess we watch so much television but uh i guess the one other thing were watching for i guess LA Law has uh last couple couple episodes coming up here   yes right ive been catching that thats been real interesting   and uh that was that was so wild when they when they got rid of uh the one uh actress uh Dey   yes the one that fell down the yes   a an elevator shaft that was that was pretty  its like we we were all   i was like wait i missed that rewind rewind rewind here     yeah it was like we were all sitting here going what just happened  id say if you if if you if you werent watching it was like boom you missed it and its like next thing you know theyre all just looking down the shaft going you know what happened   right right   uh so it uh and now with uh all the lawyers you know rising in arms and going off to join uh Michael i guess whoever uh   umhum it looks like its gonna the last few episodes are going to be good   yeah yeah matter of fact uh i guess thats going to be the same same same uh what Dallas and uh LA Law and a lot of these are really uh i guess are really going for a lot of cliffhangers this year   right and well and LA Law is getting rid of several of their characters   and they keep uh thats what i heard i guess uh like like Susan Dey and a few of them are up for contract renewal and they didnt do it or something like that   yeah uh see i heard that uh they wanted to keep it fresh and did not have the same ones there forever and so they would be bringing in new ones or whatever   yeah    yeah because i it its pretty obvious though like Corbin Benson is probably not going to be there long because hes been starring in these uh miniseries and and his parts gotten smaller and smaller and theyre bringing on the uh like the British uh lawyer who uh   uhhuh yeah   i guess her and and the blonde uh district attorney or went went to teach that seminar to the Russian uh Russian lawyers at the uh   yes oh yeah uh at the swimming pool   at the swimming pool there in Palm Springs and uh you can see theyre really starting to build up their characters and theyve theyve kind of really down played like uh Corbin Benson and uh few of those uh the top ones Harry Hamlin a lot of them     yeah see i think yeah and those i know that those three were supposed to leave and i dont remember about uh   okay   oh what is it uh Sprinchez   umhum   i dont know if i dont know if hes supposed to leave either or not   oh really huh   but uh are you out on the west coast   uh no im in the uh where im in Texas   oh youre in Texas okay   yeah umhum   uh you mentioned the time and i was i uh the time frame and i got confused there   oh with the Simpsons and all that   yeah umhum   yeah because i i because i guess its on at seven oclock on on Thursdays yeah and sometimes i dont uh dont usually make it that on on that late in the week   right on Thursdays yeah   usually by then im working a little later and later it seems and uh and never get home to watch it but uh it was better when it was on Saturday i couldnt uh didnt have an excuse then       but uh oh well   yeah   well i guess uh guess weve run out of TV shows havent we   right weve weve covered a lot of them   i guess uh you show it shows we you too Michelle you have a good evening byebye   well i enjoyed talking to you you too byebye
