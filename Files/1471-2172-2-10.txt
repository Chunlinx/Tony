                    Introduction        Elderly people show an increased incidence of        infectious neoplastic and inflammatory diseases that may        be linked to declining functional competence of the        peripheral T cells         At the cellular level        this decline in immune response is reflected in aged T cell                in vitro proliferation decreased        production of interleukin       and  receptor              and defective progression thought the cell cycle             HIV infection likewise induces a progressive        suppression in proliferation of both CD and CD T cells         in vitro that correlates with        clinical severity as well as diminished  production               However even stronger parallels exist        between immune phenomena in aging and AIDS than suppression        of T cell proliferation and  production There is a        relative increase in the memory cell repertoire               and an increase in absolute counts in the CD CD        populations in both aged    and HIV donors               The CD CD T cell in the HIV state appears to        be the major cytotoxic T cell CTL     but curiously        has shortened telemer lengths as well            Previous studies indicate considerable inconsistency        regarding production of the immune regulatory cytokine        interferon IFN and the preinflammatory cytokine        tumor necrosis factor TNF from T cells of HFV and        aged individuals The disparity in IFN expression is        reflected in reports of decreased        normal            or increased        synthesis in both        aged and HIV T cells Similarly with TNF there are        contradictory reports of decreased      normal            or increased       production in the HIV and        aged T cells Explanations for the divergent findings can        be attributed to many factors including cell preparation        choice of activators and quantitative methodology        Recently we showed    that IFN production in HIV        derived CD T cells was strongly stimulated by upon        activation antiCD and PMA Using this mode of activation        we selected flow cytometry for analysis of HIV and aged T        cells in this study since this method obviates the inherent        complications association with experimental variability of        T cell purification and activation Subsequently the flow        cytometric data based on the percentage of active cells        was supported by cytokine mRNA and ELISA data We find by        all three methods that IFN and TNF production is        enhanced several fold in CD T cells from aged and HIV        individuals and it is the CD CD subset as shown by        flow cytometry which is primarily responsible These        findings assume clinical importance since they may explain        in part the chronic and autoimmune pathologies in the        elderly particularly rheumatoid arthritis Crohns        disease sepsis and myelodysplastic syndromes which are        exacerbated by the inflammatory cytokines IFN and TNF            Likewise the elevation of these cytokines        particularly TNF potentially may contribute to the        deterioration in the HIV or AIDS patient by promoting        wasting and cachexia                        Results                  Enhanced IFN and TNF production in aged and HIV          CD T cells          Representative examples of the cytometric profile of          aged and HIV human T cells CD and CD and controls          normal young donors are shown in Fig  the cells          producing IFN and TNF appear in the upper quadrants          The percentages of either CD or CD T cells producing          cytokine upper quadrant are shown In these studies          the peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were          prepared and activated for  hrs with antiCD plus          PMA and processed with the appropriate          fluorescentlabeled antibodies For  color FC analysis          the samples were first gated for the CD positive cells          thus eliminating B cells NK cells and macrophages and          then examined for CD and cytokinecontaining cells          Based on past studies the non CD T cells are primarily          composed of CD T cells and are designated as such          Controls not shown for every sample were also examined          for cytokineproducing cells upper quadrants in which          no activators were added  positive cells were          observed Previously we found    that activation by          antiCD and PMA was far superior to other activation          modes such as Con A plus PMA in stimulating IFN          synthesis AntiCD or PMA alone did not induce cytokine          production     In all instances with antiCD as          coactivator the IFN and TNF responses were low          rarely exceeding  of that produced by PMAantiCD          activation          The production of IFN and TNF from aged and HIV T          cells CD and CD  activated by antiCD and PMA is          shown in Table I The data were derived from the flow          cytometric analysis of the CD and CD T cell profiles          of forty aged thirtytwo HIV and fortyeight normal          young donors Experiments with the HrV derived cells          were performed separately from those with aged cells with           control donors used in each case The cytokine          analysis relies on the intracellular accumulation of          cytokines in the Golgi compartment over the  hr          activation period induced by either brefeldin A or          monensin Both inhibitors block Golgi function and thus          cytokine secretion the former by inhibition of protein          vesicle transport     the latter by inhibition of Na          gradients              Flow cytometric analysis of cells from the aged donors          activated by antiCD and PMA shows that IFN production          is enhanced significantly approximately  fold in the          CD T cell compartment in terms of percent of producing          cells compared to young control donors Table I Even          with Con A and PMA activation the aged CD T cell          response was  fold enhanced over young controls           and  respectivelydata not shown The response of          brefeldintreated CD cells was somewhat greater than in          the monensintreated cells for both aged and controls          For the HiV group the number of IFN producing CD T          cells was similarly enhanced over normal controls with          both types of Golgi inhibitors Interestingly although          the CD T cell is a target for the HIV the IFN          response is not significantly changed from the normal CD          T cell response Likewise with the aged CD cells          there is no significant difference with the responses of          the cells from young donors          The changes in TNF production in CD T cells from          HIV and aged individuals are comparable to that for          IFN production Fig and Table I Aged CD T cells          show a significant increase approximately  fold over          young cells in the percentage producing TNF           versus  In the HIV cases also the CD T cells          show significantly enhanced TNF production  fold          However in contrast to the IFN data the aged CD T          cells are modestly but significantly increased over the          young CD T cells  versus  The CD T cells          from HIV donors also are slightly more capable of TNF          production than the normal CD T cells  versus           a difference that is significant Thus in the          aging and HIV scenario it is apparent that the CD T          cells show an enhanced capacity for both TNF production          and IFN production The CD T cells show a small but          significant capacity for TNF production in both          scenarios                          Comparative analysis of the CD CD and CD          CD T cells by flow cytometry          For each blood sample a nonactivated control was          prepared in which the PBMC were incubated in the absence          of activators antiCD and PMA and then examined by          flow cytometry Such controls showed no significant          cytokinecontaining cells and these samples were used to          calculate the resting CD CD distribution and the          CD CD distribution As shown in Table III there          is a dramatic phenotypic change in the CD subsets in          the aged and HIV states in relation to young healthy          controls In our IFN studies the CD population          accounts for  aged to  HIV  of the total          CD population In healthy controls the CD CD          subset accounts for only  of the CD cells In          the TNF studies the CD cells are  aged to           HIV  of the total CD population The TNF and          IFN studies were carried out separately These results          indicate that in the HIV and aged states the CD          subset becomes dominant assuming approximately          twothirds of the total CD cells whereas in the normal          healthy state the CD T cell subset accounts for          approximately twothirds Thus in terms of cell numbers          the CD cells constitute the majority of the CD T          cells and explains our previous findings  that the          mitogenic signal arising from coactivation by antiCD          was greatly suppressed in CD T cells from HIV donors          compared to normal donors          The data Table III show that the CD CD T cells          also account for the increased production of TNF and          IFN in both the HIV and aged states In these states          the percent of CD cells producing each cytokine          dominates the normal young controls by a  to           margin Thus not only are the CD cells greater in          number but they are proportionately much more active in          cytokine production As a consequence the data show that          the CD population accounts for the majority of the          cytokineproducing CD T cells  in the HIV          and aged populations Typical examples of the CD CD          profiles are shown in Fig  It is evident that the          cells from the HIV and aged states have a greater          capacity for TNF and IFN production compared to the          normal control CD or CD population                          Production of other cytokines I   and                    The ability of CD and CD T cells from aged and HIV          donors to synthesize    and  were          also studied by flow cytometry Only in the case of           was an appreciable number of cytokineproducing cells          observed     For normal young cells at least           of CD cells were positive for  while only  of          the CD cells were positive With HIV and aged T cells          there was a significant  response also but it was          generally smaller than from the young normal control          cells data not shown The percentage of cells positive          for production of   and  was extremely low          The number of productive cells was often  and only          rarely exceeded  of either the CD or CD population          No significant difference was observed between the          control cells and those derived from HIV or aged          donors                          Production of IFN and TNF mRNA determined by          Quantitative PCR          The mRNA isolated from CD T cells from  aged           HIV and  controls were purified and used in these          studies The results shown in Fig are expressed as          IFN or TNF cDNA copiesug total RNA CD T cells          were incubated for  hrs with PMA and antiCD prior to          total RNA extraction For IFN CD T cells from both          the HIV and aged states show a  fold enhancement in          cDNA copies  and  respectively versus          controls of  and  Likewise the TNF cDNA          copies are enhanced approximately  fold in the CD T          cells from aged and HIV states In view of the flow          cytometric data we can infer that the enhanced mRNA in          the CD T cells derives primarily from the CD CD T          cells                          Secreted IFN and TNF determined by ELISA          The PBMC and purified CD T cells from eight donors          and seven control donors were incubated for  hrs and          the media examined by ELISA The results shown in Table          III demonstrate that production of IFN is upregulated          over controls from  fold for the CD T cells from          HIV and aged donors For TNF the increase was also          substantial  fold                            Discussion        Our data show that the HIV and aged conditions foster a        change in the CD T cell repertoire characterized by        expansion of a CD CD phenotype capable of enhanced        IFN and TNF production These results contrast with        other studies concluding that the production of these        cytokines was downregulated or unchanged in T cells from        HIV and aged individuals                   Reliability in our findings derives from use of flow        cytometric analysis which measures         de novo synthesis per cell and thus        obviates numerous artifacts possibly associated with ELISA        or procedures that measure mRNA synthesis Secondly        similar results were obtained with two different inhibitors        of Golgi transport Thirdly of the cytokines examined        including   and  only IFN and TNF were        enhanced in the HIV or aged states Fourthly CD T cells        did not show a significant change in IFN production but        did show a small but significant increase in TNF        production in aged and HIV derived cells Fifthly the        mRNA and ELISA studies support the conclusions of the flow        cytometric data        The question arises whether or not our results have        physiological relevance since PMA and antiCD was used to        elicit the cytokine responses we observed The question        resolves into two parts are TNF and IFN levels        increased in the HIV and aged states and do the CD T        cells show increased production of these cytokines There        is considerable evidence supporting both parts of this        question Regarding part one IFN levels are elevated in        the sera of HIV patients     Serum levels of both        TNF and IFN were markedly higher in HIV patients over        controls but varied depending on the skin disease        exhibited by the patient     AIDS patients also showed        elevated TNF levels in the plasma     Studies of        lymphocytes from aged donors showed increase serum levels        of TNF and IFN that correlate with upregulation of        HLADR on CD lymphocytes            Regarding part two there are many studies showing that        physiological activation of CD T cells from HIV or aged        donors prompts increased IFN andor TNF production HIV        lymph nodes exhibit a large  fold increase in CD T        cells most of which are involved in IFN production            Amison et al    concluded that IFN is secreted by        the CD T cell in HIV infections In CD T cells from        African HIV patients stimulated with env peptide both        IFN and TNF production were increased over controls            PBMC from the elderly almost healthy donors showed        upregulation of TNF in unstimulated cultures            HLADR activation of CD CD cells from elderly subjects        strongly produced TNF            Lipopolysaccharideactivation of T cells from aged donors        induced higher levels of TNF than controls in two        separate studies      Finally in HIV patients        receiving HIV type  antigen both INF and TNF were        significantly increased in memory T cells activated by        antigen            Thus there appears to be considerable support for the        enhanced presence of TNF and INF in the HIV and the        aged states and for a physiologic role of the CD T cell        subset in their production Our data shows that it is the        CD CD cell that is primarily responsible Why the CD        CD subset should dominated in such apparently diverse        conditions as the HIV and the aged states is not known        However the notion that similarities exist between the HIV        and the aged states with respect to the CD CD T cell        has been presented previously     It has also been        proposed that the CD CD T cell in the HIV state is        derived from the CD CD cells by clonal expansion        induced by massive antigenic stimulus HIV proteins since        both showed the same epitope repertoire     Dolad et        al    have shown that the CD CD cell not the CD        CD cell comprises the major CTL activity in the HIV        state a finding confirmed by Vingerhoets et al            who associated cytotoxic T cell activity with the CD CD        T cell in HIVinfected subjects Thus the CD CD T        cell assumes a crucial role in HIV infection Likewise in        the aged state we can speculate that chronic viral and        bacterial exposure over a lifetime may induce the clonal        expansion of the CD CD T cell        There is evidence that the cytotoxic activity of the        CD cell can lyse and suppress HIVinfected cells            and thus play a protective role in HIV infection Perhaps        in the aged cell as well the CD memory cell serves a        similar protective role against a variety of viruses The        production of IFN and TNF can result in strong        antiviral consequences as shown with hepatitis B virus            but the cytokines have a dual role since they are        associated with inflammatory activity IFN in its        defensive role against infection is a foremost factor in        converting resting macrophages into the active state           where they produce reactive oxidants     nitric oxide            TNF     and neopterin Not only can these        factors damage DNA and host tissues but can modulate        inflammatory reactions    and stimulate apoptosis            a major mechanism leading to loss of CD T cells            TNF also has the capacity to perturb the clinical        condition in AIDS by strongly upregulating the        transcription of the HIV genome     In fact it has        been proposed    that AIDS is in many ways a TNF        disease since this cytokine it is a potent activator of        NFkB and an inducer of HIV genome transcription and        apoptosis in HIVinfected T cells Moreover the wasting        weight loss and cachexia associated with AIDS has also        been related to TNF activity     Thus both IFN and        TNF have the potential for a double role in the        pathogenesis associated with AIDS ie antiviral and        inflammatory responses        Based on the AIDS scenario it is reasonable to propose        that chronic viral and bacterial infections suffered by an        individual over a lifetime may lead to similar consequences        as those occurring in acute HIV infection ie clonal        expansion of the CD CD subset at the expense of the        CD CD subset The data argue that the CD cell may        serve as a natural endpoint in the differentiation of CD        cells as proposed by Effros et al     where aging        represents a normal endpoint that occurs after many years        of immune activity while AIDS represents an accelerated        endpoint due to the increase rate in T cell formation        during attempted compensation for CD loss induced by HIV        By virtue of their inflammatory roles TNF and IFN        likely contribute to the exacerbation of the inflammatory        conditions associated with the aged For example        autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in the aged where        certain diseases such as arthritis are often associated        with chronic debilitation Interestingly both IFN and        TNF are prominent in the pathogenesis of autoimmune        diseases in general the former by activation of local auto        antigen presentation to appropriate T cells and the latter        by mediation of inflammatory tissue damage            Apparently TNF plays a central role in the chronic        release of highly arthritogenic II     and thus        serves as a major factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid        arthritis RA     Recent studies show that treatment        with antiTNF gives significant clinical improvement in        RA     Thus our findings in aged individuals of a        prominent CD CD T cell subset with enhanced ability to        produce TNF may assume clinical relevance It is logical        to infer that the increased susceptibility of aged        individuals to rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune        pathologies may be due to increased TNF and IFN        production by the CD CD T cell It should be noted        that the action of IFN on macrophages induces TNF        production     thus amplifying the effects of the        latter        Although IFN production in the HIV individual by the        CD T cells T         H  has been emphasized             there appears to be little doubt that the production of        IFN by CD CD cells may have greater clinical        relevance as discussed above on the increased serum levels             With TNF as well our data suggest it is        likely that the increased serum levels in AIDS             may derive in part from increased numbers of CD CD        cells However TNF levels could also originate from        monocytes stimulated by the enhanced IFN production In        any case the HIV state is replete with antagonistic        complexities of antiviral effects of IFN and TNF on one        hand and their inflammatory effects on the other Overall        our data presents an intriguing parallel between AIDS and        the aging state with regard to their cytokine and CD T        cell profiles and the potential for new insight into aging        mechanisms It is noteworthy that our results are        compatible with recent aging studies using gene arrays to        measure gene expression in the neocortex and cerebellum of        aged and young mice Lee et al    found that in both        brain regions one hallmark of aging was enhanced gene        expression of the inflammatory response including        proinflammatory peptides and many interferonrelated        proteins Thus the advent of the CD CD cell in aging        with its potential for proinflammatory cytokines could        have profound effects not only on autoimmune diseases but        on Alzheimers disease as well since cytokines may        contribute to the neuropathology                        Materials and Methods                  Materials          Con A phorbol myristate acetate

from  based          on the starting number of PBMC For the preparation of          purified CD T cells    purified T cells were          incubated for  minutes on ice with BioMag mouse          antihuman CD IgG monoclonal Ab  ul in  ml          RPMI plus  FCS diluted  for  min on ice with          rocking Similarly to obtain purified CD T cells the          same procedure was followed except BioMag mouse          antihuman CD IgGa monoclonal Ab  ul was used          The cell suspension was brought to  ml with cold RPMI          media and the desired T cell subset was obtained by          magnetic removal of the contaminating cells Flow          cytometric analysis indicated that the T cell subsets          were  purified The yield of control and aged cells          varied from  generally whereas the yield from HIV          blood generally fell between  Accessory cells          were effectively removed during T cell isolation as shown          by the failure of mitogeninduced proliferation in the          absence of coactivators All cell purification steps were          completed and assays initiated within  hrs after blood          donation The purified CD T cells were used for the          ELISA and quantitative PCR studies                          Flow cytometric analysis FC          Prior to FC analysis PBMC     suspended in           ul media were incubated at C overnight in  CO            with antiCD  dilution of          acetates fluid and PMA  ngml as described          previously     Either monensin  uM or brefeldin A           ugml was used in all cases to block Golgi function          and allow cytokine accumulation with the cell For          analysis of CD and CD T cells the PBMC activated          and non activated controls were treated as described by          the PharMingen Flow Cytometry and Cell Analysis Catalog           Immunofluorescent Staining of Intracellular          Cytokines for Flow Cytometric Analysis pp          Briefly PBMCs were washed twice with staining buffer          PBS plus  bovine serum albumin and then fixed by          suspending in cold  paraformaldehyde PFA After          incubation for  min at  the

BectonDickinson and           ul peridinin chlorophyll PerCP mouse antiCD Leu          BectonDickinson were added followed by incubation in          the dark for  min at room temperature After washing          with  ml of staining buffer the cells were fixed with           ul of  PFA for approximately  day and then          analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer          BectonDickinson equipped with a FL channel          As an alternative to FC analysis of activated PBMC          described above we also studied activated CD and CD          T cells purified as described in the previous sections          These studies we carried out in order to completely          eliminate the possibility however remote that our FC          procedure did not discriminate between the CD T cells          and NK cells which have low density CD receptors          However our FC procedure used a sufficiently high          anchor gate to examine only the high density CD          receptors which are uniquely characteristic of the CD          T cell This is accomplished by using an anchor gate          which is sufficiently high As expected our analysis of          CD T cells using either the purified cells or the PBMC          were in complete agreement in  experiments in which they          were compared ie both showed the same increased          production of IFN and TNF from HIV derived or aged          CD T cells                          Analysis of CD and CD T cells          Fourcolor cytometric analysis was performed with a          PowerMacintosh  computer with Cellquest software          Statistical analysis was performed on data collected from           events data points per cell sample To          distinguish t cell subsets a gate was drawn around          lymphocytes by forward scatter and side scatter region           R T cells were identified as a CD FL positive          population R thereby excluding CD populations such          as B cells macrophages and NK cells In order to          analyze T cell subsets CD and CD cells for each          cytokine production contour plots on CD FL          cytokine FL of logical gate  events R  R were          obtained The event numbers and percentages of each          quadrant event were recorded For simplicity the CD          CD T cell subset are assumed to be CD and labeled as          such in Fig  In our experience the CD CD comprise           or more of the CD CD T cell subset in normal          blood In HIV blood a few CD T cells may be masked by          soluble gp but this would not affect the CD CD          population                          Analysis of CD and CD T cells using          fourcolor cytometry          For this study PBMC were treated as described above          except that antihuman CD FL coupled to          allophycocyanin APC was used along with antiIFN FITC          FL antiCD PE FL and antiCDS PerCP FL          Region  R was drawn to identify lymphocytes by          forward scatter and side scatter and R was drawn to          identify T cells FL positive Logical gate  RR          was used to identify CD FL negative and CD FL          positive subsets that were designated as R and R          respectively Logical gate  RRR events were          analyzed for cytokine production by CD FL or CD          subpopulations by plotting two dimensional contour          plots Logical gate  RRR events were similarly          analyzed                          Competitive PCR          The competitive PCR was performed using both IFN          mRNA and TNF mRNA detection kits from BioSource Corp          The mRNA was highly purified from purified CD cells          activated for  hrs with the Ambion RNAqueous kit for          total RNA and the Micro Poly A pure kit for mRNA          Generally the mRNA obtained was near  of total RNA The          cDNA was obtained by use of reverse transcriptase          Invitrogen PCR was performed in  ul final volume

         molecular weight standards to determine the fragment          size Bands were visualized under UV light and          photographed using Polaroid film          After cDNA amplification  ul of PCR mix was removed          and transferred to a microcenterfuge tube The same          volume of denaturation solution alkaline pH was added          to the tube and incubated for  min at room temperature          The material was neutralized by the addition of  ul of          hybridization solution prior to addition to the ICS or          IFN oligonucleotide capture wells OCW In order to          acquire quantitative results the denatured amplicons were          analyzed at    dilution in hybridization          buffer          Following hybridization unbound material was removed          by washing the wells four times with  ul diluted wash          buffer  ul of streptavidin  HPR was then added to          each well and incubated for  min at room temperature          The wells were washed again and  ul of stabilized          chromogen substrate was added After a  minute          incubation in the dark the reaction was stopped by          addition of  ul stop solution and the observance was          measured at  nm The optical density OD in each well          is proportional to the amount of amplicon present which          can be related to the copy number of either ICS or IFN          in the original PCR reaction The total OD is calculated          as sample OD multiplied by the amplicon dilution The          number of copies of IFN in each PCR reaction are          calculated from the ratio of total OD for the IFN          specific well to the total OD for the ICS well times the          and input copies of the ICS                          ELISA          The IFN

 hours in precisely          the same way as for mitogenic assay except volumes were          doubled and  cells were used Samples were run in          duplicate the results were highly reproducible SD           for any given assay and sensitive However          sensitivity was not important since with most samples it          was necessary to dilute the culture fluid by  or          more The procedure was followed as recommended by the          manufacturer The standard curves for IFN and TNF          which intersected the origin was generally linear up to           pgml for recombinant IFN and  pgml for          TNF
