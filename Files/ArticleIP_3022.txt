                                 Boston vs Austin            It started innocentlyenough Bobby Kennedy gearing up in the fall of  to manage his brothersupcoming presidential run visited Lyndon Johnsons Texas ranch to inquireafter the Senate majority leaders presidential ambitions Johnson assured theyounger man that he had none Then as was his wont Johnson took his guesthunting Bobby a Navy vet who never saw action in World War II fixed a deerin his sights squeezed the triggerand landed flat on his back from therecoil Son said Johnson helping him up with a smirk youve got to learnto handle a gun like a man He went on to break his word by giving JackKennedy a fight for the  Democratic presidential nomination            BobbyKennedy never forgave Johnson the slight loathing him to the end Johnson forhis part never gave up trying to knock Kennedy on his ass And while theirfeud may not have defined a decade as Jeff Shesol claims in this wonderfullyentertaining original and exceptionally researched book it certainly makesfor a hell of a gripping yarn            It is hard to imagine two politicians more opposed intemperament than Lyndon Baines Johnson and Robert Francis Kennedy Kennedy wassupremely selfconfident and unyielding Johnson was selfpitying and prone tothe blackest paranoia For his paranoia readers owe the  thpresident a debt Johnson recorded just about every telephone call he everplaced and Shesol deploys impressive documentary gifts to knock the resultingtranscripts into one of the most intimate portraits of the inner life of aWhite House yet committed to print The kinds of things Johnson reveledinlockerroom talk and stiff belts of whiskey the muted grays of theSenates wellturned compromises even his own hardearned influence andwealthwere the kinds of things against which the Harvardeducated Kennedydefined his very identity            Indeedone senses that nothing less than the deepest matters of personal identityfueled their intense and bitter rivalry The Bostonian must have sensed thatcompared with the Texan he came off as snobbish petulant and obtusely richKennedy certainly made Johnson feel like a wheedling country bumpkin who wasunable to pick out the right suit jacket Kennedy who cherished his very ownLBJ voodoo doll called Johnson mean bitter and viciousan animal in manyways Johnson found Kennedy a little shitass and a grandstanding littlerunt It is not surprising that they didnt care to be in the same place atthe same time            But circumstances forever conspired to placethem in the same place at the same time namely in John F Kennedys shadowTheir enmity began in earnest at the  Democratic National Convention in LosAngeles where JFK decisively turned back Johnsons lastminute bid for thenomination Not however before Johnsons reckless attempt to derail him byreminding delegates of rumors that Joseph Kennedy Sr while he was ambassadorto England had appeased Hitler Now protocol demanded that JFK offer Johnsonthe second spot on the ticket and honor demanded that Johnson given that hehad insulted the candidates father turn Kennedy down            InsteadJohnson accepted Bobby was given the unenviable job of marching into Johnsonshotel suite to talk him out of it To make a long storyit takes up thegreater part of a gripping chaptershort The dust lifted with Lyndon thevicepresidential candidate loathing Bobby for plotting against him here wasLyndons paranoia or maybe his ability to spot the hustle and Bobby thecampaign manager loathing Lyndon for having the audacity to take a job forwhich he knew he wasnt the first choice here was Bobbys East Coastarrogance or maybe his idealism Thither to the White House where AttorneyGeneral Kennedy whose only previous public service had been as lawyer for twoSenate committees earned from journalists the label assistant president forhis ubiquity at the highest levels of executive influence while Vice PresidentJohnson who practically ran the government from his Senate chamber in thes found himself so insignificant that he was only informed of Cabinetmeetings five minutes in advance            JFKs assassination changed everything but the feud whichonly intensified as the martyrs shadow loomed ever larger In his grief eachman blamed the other for the tragedy Bobby had been point man for theadministrations Cuban counterinsurgency programwhose activities Lyndoninsisted privately had certainly brought on the assassination as an act ofrevenge from Castro QED Bobby killed Jack And Lyndon thought Bobby wasresponsible for his brothers being in Dallas at allto heal a wound in theTexas Democratic Party that Lyndon should never have let fester in the firstplace QED Lyndon killed Jack The executive branch clearly wasnt bigenough for the two of them and Kennedy wisely decamped for his successfulSenate run Johnson for his part seriously considered dropping out of the election altogether foreshadowing his  decision not to seekreelection            Up to thispoint Shesols book is nearly flawless though Texan readers might be forgivenfor wondering whether Shesol doesnt tip his evidence a little to favor Bostonover Austin When the chronicle enters the second half of the s howeverit loses a little of its aplomb This is the period when a singleissueVietnamcame to trump all others in establishing the political order ofbattle With President Johnsons Great Society sluicing off up to  billionper month in expenditures on Vietnam and Sen Kennedy being elevated forbetter or for worse to the role of standardbearer for a generation repulsedby Americas imperial presumptions the antagonists became symbols for opposingforces larger than either man could discern By the time they faced each otherfor the  Democratic presidential nomination the story had outgrown thebackroom atmospherics Shesol excels in reconstructing            This is perhaps why the lesson that Shesoldraws from the denouement of the KennedyJohnson feud feels so unsatisfying Heclaims that Kennedy is the archetype of todays New Democrat This is not acompletely untenable proposition since as Shesol demonstrates toward the endof his life Kennedy began to experiment with some uncannily Clintonesquegestures such as financing urban renewal through marketbased publicprivatepartnerships It is however hard to square Bobby Kennedy whosecharacteristic response to Johnsons poverty proposals was that they didnt gofar enough with the end of welfare as we know it And Shesol overlooks a farmore abiding division in contemporary politics than those that divide todaysDemocrats Like so much that polarizes us these days it is more cultural thanstrictly political            Take aremarkable statistic that Shesol cites but lets pass relatively unexamined InMay  Gallup found that the number of people who said they intenselydisliked RFKwho was also probably more intensely liked than any otherpracticing politicianwas twice as high as the number who intensely dislikedJohnson the architect of the increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam Exactlywho reviled the young senator to such a degree is not broken down further Butit is easy to guess Consider the results of another poll this one from in which Louis Harris found that RFKs presence on a Democratic ticket wouldgravely hurt the partys chances in the South and border states amongbusinessmen and among fencesitters in both parties            That is a rough description of what Kevin Phillips latercalled the emerging Republican majority the crowd whose voting habits weremolded by the act of detesting the likes of Bobby Kennedypoliticians whonever worked a day in their lives who were eager so the perception went tooppress the plain folk with burdensome taxes in order to fatten the undeservingpoor eager to sell out Americas military supremacy out of some guiltriddenmoralism Politicians who seemed not to know how to handle rifles like men By that annus horribilis when Johnson cracked from the pressure ofmediating an increasingly centripetal Democratic Party and Kennedy fell to anassassins bullet two political idealtypes had solidified a silentmajority who supported Johnsons war on Vietnam and voted in Richard Nixonand a new class of liberal professionals and youth who supported Johnsonswar on poverty but detested everything Richard Nixon represented                           This is the mutualcontempt hinted at but not developed in this valuable book that haunts ustoday
