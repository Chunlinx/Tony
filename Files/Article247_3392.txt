                                 Armbands But No Arms Banned            The LosAngeles Times leads with the surrender to the FBI of the suspect in theLA Jewish community center shootings a development that offleads at theNew York Times and USA Today andis fronted below the fold at the Washington Post  The NYT leads instead with Kansasdecision to stop requiring the teaching of evolution as part of the statesscience curriculum The decision also deletes most classroom references to thebig bang theory One likely result observed by the Times  Kansasstudents will be unprepared for college admissions tests and college sciencecourses The story is carried inside at the WP  USAT leads withthe tornado that hit Salt Lake City yesterday killing one person as far asanyone can tell the first tornado death in the state and injuring  Thetornado is also fronted at the LAT and is the top nonlocal story at theWP  which leads with the worsening drought in Maryland and Virginia            The LA shooting coverage reports that the subject of a nationwide manhuntBuford Furrow materialized yesterday morning unarmed at the FBIs offices inLas Vegas and surrendered telling agents he was the shooter in fact say thepapers he confessed to murdering children at the center but none of thoseshot there have died and that his purpose in committing the crime was to issuea wakeup call for America to start killing Jews By the days end Furrowwas brought back to Los Angeles where today sources say he will be chargedwith attempted murder in the community center shootings and first degree murderin the death of a US letter carrier about an hour later            The papers report that Furrow is speaking freely to the cops particularlyhelpful to them in the murder case for which there are no witnesses Thecoverage includes the de rigueur interviews with shocked neighborsand depicts Furrow as a neoNazi racist who has been involved with each of thethree most dangerous white hate groups The LAT front features a picture of Furrow in a Nazistyle uniform And also as a troubled loser whoafter his prior arrest for pulling a knife on staffers at a mental hospital inWashington state where he lived told cops he often thought of killing othersand himself The WP and LAT report that several times he cuthimself with a knife once says the Post almost severing a finger            The NYT says Furrows arsenal included an Uzi assault pistol TheLAT says the police wont confirm this One wonders how a rabidantiSemite justifies or trusts using an Uzi an Israeli weapon TheLAT runs a separate story inside reporting that one of Furrows weaponswas an AR assault rifle apparently purchased piecemeal andcustomassembled The central part of the weapon was manufactured says thepaper by a company in Maine presided over by a man who had been the statefinance chairman for George W Bush before his day job became an issue TheAR possession wasnt legal because Furrow is a convicted felon but easierto do prior to the Brady Bill the paper notes The story also says that Furrowtold authorities when arrested previously that in his glove compartment healways carried a mm Taurus pistol a gun featured in an unrelated Wall Street Journal frontpager yesterday            The NYT lead editorial about the shooting makes a pitch for Congressto do something serious about gun control The LAT lead editorial saysthat the event shows that hate crime laws are justified that the criminaljustice system should keep better tabs on people like Furrow and they shouldbe getting better access to psychiatric help One mystery the coverage doesntmake much progress on is How did Furrow come to target the day care centerUSAT fascinates with the news that a tour guide at the Museum ofTolerance in Los Angeles says Furrow visited there several weeks ago andattracted the attention of security personnel  but disappeared before he couldbe questioned                           USAT fronts word that so far this year  children havedied in hot cars Papers should avoid inflicting this sort of informationon the reader sans context For instance how many children have been killed incar crashes this year or shot The story doesnt say            The WP runs a Reuters dispatch relating the latest in a series ofgoofball comments by Prince Philip While on a factory tour near Edinburgh PPsaw a poorly wired fuse box and said It looks as though it was put in by anIndian            Note to editors Enough with the automatic fullthreename treatment ofheinous criminals Thats a convention from Wanted posters that you shouldadopt only if you also agree to run only frontandprofile pictures ofthem            The NYTs Richard Berke picking up on and crediting a column byArianna Huffington in yesterdays LAT  reports that Warren Beatty is considering running for president Beatty alongtime liberal Democrat is unhappy about the failure of campaign financereform and tells the Times hes talked to people instrumental inprevious Jesse Jackson campaigns Oddly the story doesnt mentionBulworth  nor does it mention a Beatty campaigns epidemic bimbonicplague possibilities
