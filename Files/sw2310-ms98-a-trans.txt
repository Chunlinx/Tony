        want me to press the one button   im ready whenever you are   okay sir   Jack do you have any pets   Jim   Jim im sorry about that do you have any pets     no no i do not i uh i live in an apartment   okay well that would kind of preclude having a pet   well well not really most of my neighbors   hum   have pets dogs   uhhuh   of course   well weve got weve got a cat and this is a very very special cat because uh we lived in the Philippines for thirty months we worked for TI in in Biejo City in the Philippines and uh as you know uh the Filipinos are quite poor and and uh they dont uh generally they eat their pets       uh well not generally but dogs they do uh so having a pet uh is is a luxury most of them dont have and we uh were able to find one that was born in a store and the uh a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away and we took him home with us when he was uh about three weeks old and uh ultimately my family moved back to Dallas and i had to stay on in the Philippines ten months after they went back and uh eventually i shipped him home by air and you know you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred and forty dollars to ship him across the ocean   i agree and how they you know the uh the uh health officials let him in the country   yeah there was no problem because there was a veterinarian in our neighborhood and we had all the proper paperwork and and i shipped him uh uh by air and uh let my family know when he was going to be in and they went out to the freight claiming area out at uh DFW airport and claimed him       it was it was it was it was pretty interesting uh did you have any pets when you were growing up   i always had pets when i grew up   oh okay what did you have   oh i had uh i started with a cat   umhum   uh an old you know alley cat an old Tom but i had dogs primarily and uh   umhum umhum   mostly purebreds   oh yeah   but uh we had a large yard   yeah   and uh we did not have the pets in the house uh they all they were always outdoors   yeah they they they lived outdoors and you know     but i had a cat i have a i had a cat uh uh when i was living in in uh Pensacola Florida uh we had a uh cat that i got from again from a friend it was born in a barn uh it was they had a a small farm so there were lots of cats around   umhum   so i picked out one and got it for my daughter and uh had it uh spayed and declawed and we did keep it in the house restricted to the uh first floor   oh yeah   and it was uh not a bad experience but for the most part im im reluctant to have animals in the house i just i just dont do not feel that particularly dogs uh i do not feel that they fare well   yeah theyre theyre   uh in the in the house   and its amazing how they how they adapt to the outside i was raised in New England and we had an Eskimo Spitz and he was never in the house a day in his life and i can you know i remember like this sounds like old grandfather stories but i can remember thirty five below zero and thirty inches of snow on the ground     umhum well i yeah i had a malamute at one time   and huh   and uh stayed outside   umhum   i was raised in southern West Virginia   oh okay   so the winters would get fairly cold the only problem with it is that the bloody thing would sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night  and uh you know its uh       wolf origins uh came to the fore particularly during the full moon and but i always had uh dogs i had a terrier       first and then i had a uh lets see i had a terrier then i had a cocker spaniel then a then the uh malamute and then the last dog i had was a uh basset hound   umhum   but they all stayed outside   oh for goodness sakes yeah uh the only dog we ever had uh we lived prior to living in the Philippines with TI we lived in Malaysia and we were told when we got there that itd be good to get a dog because uh there were a lot of uh breaking and entering and robberies   umhum   and the uh native Malays by religion are scared of dogs in fact the lick of a dog is supposed to be something very very bad something very evil   umhum   so what happened uh was anybody that had a dog at least the native Malays made up fifty percent of the population if you had a dog uh you wouldnt get ripped off by a Malay now the other fifty percent was part some Chinese some Indians and they might then they didnt have any qualms any qualms about dogs so we went down to the local SPCA       uh the American association in in Gautolompora uh actually had uh uh an SPCA there and we went down and picked us up a little old female mongrel and uh and brought her home and she made an excellent pet   um   uh except the only problem is we played badminton in the yard a lot and we used to have to get the little shovel and scoop and go clean the yard at night before we went and play badminton     right   but im im a runner by by hobby and she used to love to get outside the gate and id put her leash on and take her running with me   umhum   and it was only years later i read that you shouldnt do it particularly in the tropical climates where we were and when she came back shed drink about three panfuls of water   yeah i bet   but anyway it wasnt it wasnt in the heat of the day id always go running about seven oclock in the evening or something like that but boy she was ready id get that leash and shed come over and start jumping all over me to get ready to go and and   well the you know the last one we had the the uh my uh my father owned a plumbing and heating business and my brother and i frequently worked for him during the summer when my brother was in college and i was in high school and so uh this was the only dog that we trained to ride in the automobile       and so we used to take it to work with us when we would go on a job pack it a lunch and it would you know get out of the car and find a nice cool spot to rest and my brother and i would go work and wed come uh break for lunch and and the uh unpack the dogs lunch and so forth and the other workers the the carpenters and so forth used to get just a hell of a charge out of it because you know here are these two guys you know walked in with clean clothes you know every day my my of course my mother wouldnt let us leave the house without the clean clothes     oh yeah   you know with a dog and bringing a dog on the job an d they didnt realize we were working for my father so  that uh     oh for goodness sake   it was uh but the people around here theyre you know as i mention them the uh the neighbors a lot of the neighbors have uh pets   umhum   of course they you see them out walking every evening but they range you know the couple upstairs that uh above me uh has a long hair dachshund   right   uh the lady is German but uh there are some huge dogs around here its really phenomenal i cannot see i mean ive seen everything from you know Great Danes and German Shepherds and just really huge animals and how they keep them confined uh the the apartments are are fine theyre relatively large but   im sure   to stay there all day is fantastic you know fantastic   well we we we live in a in a in a residential neighborhood and the animals pretty well run a lot of people have fences in their backyards and and dogs are kept inside fences uh cat cats are pretty well on the run   umhum   fortunately people are responsible and theyve all been spayed or neutered so we dont have gigantic litters of kittens running around here but they uh its interesting the lady across from us has always taken in strays and shes got six or seven cats and one of her cats somehow or other must have get into our house accidentally uh when the door was open and found where our cats food dish is and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers and when i pull my car up in the evening i can hear him she leaves her garage door open most of them sleep in the garage at night       and no matter what time of night it is he hears my car stop and hes over here and hes forcing his head in the door when i open the door and i go in he goes in he gets a great big mouthful of food because he knows im going to pick him up right off and put him back out again and some days       hell follow me up the front walk so ill run around the back of the house and try to go in the back door and hell hell go around and beat me there so ive got so that now i fake him i make a move toward the back so he runs around the back then i go in the front door       so i i can i can get in without him but hes hes hes fat as a   its amazing yeah its amazing how they get conditioned it it really is   yeah hes hes hes hes fat as a little pig and she took him to the vet and the vet said you got to stop feeding him so much or hes going to die of a heart attack and so she said to me youve got to stop feeding and i said i dont do it intentionally i and if im in the house already sometimes i can keep him out if im trying to come in the house and hes trying to come in too i just kind of put my foot out uh against his neck while im im trying to uh get in the door and that works but other times ill forget that hes out there at the door and as soon as i open it to go out hes by me like a shot and by the time i can get him hes got a great big gigantic mouthful of food     well he might be canvassing the neighborhood you just might be the last stop on his uh on his route during the day   no i i think i i i think he he likes our food best uh somehow or another our cat has become a housecat       and he uh he sleeps with us he sleeps with my wife and i and either he sleeps across the foot of the bed on top of either my feet or her feet or above the covers and uh except when its extremely cold and we dont get many days like that here in Texas
