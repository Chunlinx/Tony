grammatically complex ways of doing thisas study of the transcript of any Eisenhower press conference will demonstrateThere are also sundry offtherack locutions that can dress up language tosimilar effect such as the longestablished blah                blah               blah  which in a famous Far                Side cartoon is what animalsperceive human beings to be saying to one another
