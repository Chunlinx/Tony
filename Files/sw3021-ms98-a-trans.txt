                 well i grew up out in the country and uh was used to having uh guns around the place and uh im   uhhuh   im not for gun control in the strictest sense of the uh word   uhhuh i i think im kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself you know i have quite a collection myself and you know im a good hunter and i   yeah   started hunting when i was twelve years old of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes and you know i dont want to see them ban guns completely but i dont want them to completely turn loose of their controls either   yeah yeah well i i feel that its uh i think the what was it the National Rifle Association uh had this bumper sticker a few years back if uh about if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns then   so i believe that   and i believe that too because the person thats wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun gun gun a knife a a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with   yeah yeah   and its the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns uh we can handle it but theres a element that cant   yeah and its you know its got to the point now where even our our police departments and our DEA agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons because everybody thats in drug trafficking trafficking has got them   you have got them outgunned   you know yeah so   there was a an article in the paper just this week where i think its uh one of the gun companies i cant remember which was developing a ten millimeter ten millimeter automatic pistol for the FBI which would give them additional firepower it had held like a fifteen shot clip which uh would be able they they would be able to put down anything that came at them   um yeah yeah that would be   but if you figure you got some drug guy out there thats got an Uzi machine gun uh a a a thirty eight uh Smith and Wesson revolver isnt going to do you much good   yeah thats no its sure not huhuh   yeah i have lived in uh Illinois at one time and they they passed a uh it wasnt really gun control but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didnt have to list your guns   yeah   but you had to have this card it was like a drivers license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition   hum   and thats the first uh this was twenty years ago but they had that so that uh they were trying to control it a little bit uh in that respect   yeah see in California they   pardon   in California they make you register when you buy ammunition   yeah uhhuh   you have to sign a they you know take your name and drivers license number hunter hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition   yeah yeah   especially for handguns now rifles arent too bad but   yeah   you know any kind of handgun at all if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you still have to buy it or sign up for it so     yeah we lived in Tennessee for awhile and i bought a pistol there and there was a fifteen day waiting period you had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriffs office and get fingerprinted   uhhuh gee   and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing   gee thats not a bad idea   and no i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh can make a difference but again its going to be the law abiding citizen thats going to comply with that   yeah yeah yeah it is   so theres i dont think theres any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because   no the the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun   right right   you know i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i i feel kind of weird about that anyway i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot so   yeah im  we were getting into capital punishment now  but i i agree with you there that uh     yeah but you know it would definitely be gun control   yeah the uh the again the purpose of gun control is to control how its being used is what the purpose should be   yeah yeah   its not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy thats illegal from getting his hands on one   yeah yeah yeah   and im in favor of keeping the the illegal guy from getting one in his hands but the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element   myself yeah well and the theyre actually a necessity in life you know theyre not you know not everybody needs a gun but   oh yes   sooner or later i need one you know whether im out hunting or you know ive never had to protect my life or well i did in the service but not you know not on the street   yeah     so i dont really need one in the aspect in the aspects   you dont have to carry one in your car or your uh  or your pocket all the time yeah   no huhuh oh so mine are you know i use mine for recreation i dont and i enjoyed my guns i have a good time with them so   yeah yeah well i know what uh i took my kids out and taught them how to shoot a gun gun my wife the same thing uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not not that i have an arsenal or anything but we have several guns around the house   yeah   one of these days my grandkids probably   probably yeah   but i think its uh you got to have have the places living in Dallas theres not that many places to go shoot   no huhuh   but uh still i think they ought to know how to use one and it is not just a toy and that when its not like on TV when someone gets shot uh they get back up if someone gets shot with a real gun they dont get back up   yeah yeah i had to explain that to my ive got a six year old now and and he you know i have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old well they understand now   yeah   you know ive taken time to teach them and now the young boy wants to know and you know like i told him youre a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and you know wed start with the BB gun deal you know so he started with the BB gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and i took it away from him i said now   yeah       you know so hes learning the hard way but at least it was a BB gun not a twenty two or a four ten or something so   yeah uh i remember i had an old uncle up by Tulsa Oklahoma that took me out and uh showed me this was it was not my it was my mothers uncle this was a gentleman in his sixties   gee   and he took me out with him and uh single shot twenty two and taught me how to shoot we went squirrel hunting and   uhhuh all right   and uh he taught me how to shoot uh an old single shot twenty two and i probably i was probably about twelve at the time and i thought that was the neatest thing at first and Uncle Sam took me out took me hunting with h im and he let me shoot and showed me how   uhhuh yeah all right       i think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one   right   you know i dont want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away so   oh  yeah well thats about all i we agreed pretty well on this i think so okay well its been real nice talking with you okay bye     yeah i think so uh all right have a good one byebye
