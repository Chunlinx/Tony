                okay  well uh some of the books ive read lately have to do with crafty type things where ive where ive um learned things that im going to do for my children for Christmas   umhum   and they were really uh helpful because i didnt know how to do this one stitching and so that was very helpful to me as far as books otherwise um i like to read childrens books and things like that what about you   oh goodness well i was an English major so i like to read period   oh   uh lately ive been on the whole very practical and uh im trying uh to to uh furnish a home   hm   so ive been looking at im not sure reading is the word but looking at books on uh antiques and paintings and uh interior decoration hints   uhhuh   and uh lots of books on plants and and and gardens because we started a garden   oh   and things things like that and so ive been doing very little reading except i i did finally dip into a couple of biographies um all of sort of literary figures of this century   uhhuh its interesting that you said that my husband and i had uh took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden   oh   um with   good for you i havent gotten around to that   oh  yeah and our our uh cantaloupes and and um peppers and tomatoes are on right now so its been really fun and and we learned that you know um some of the gardening skills we had were before but some of them we learned from a book   uhhuh   and so that was helpful to us now ive read two books uh that were uh nonfiction lately and uh   yes   i well one was nonfiction and one was fiction and the fiction one uh was about a boy in uh during the time of Adolf Hitler   hm   and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp   hm   and that was not enjoyment  that that was too realistic and really um mind   no   a real eye opener  uh and i guess its good to read those things too uh but i didnt enjoy it necessarily   umhum   and uh the other one was quite enjoyable it was uh about a a Chinese lady and her generations down her what happened to her family through the years   oh   so that one was good i think all of uh well even if theyre not enjoyable they bring you uh a some kind of of learning so even if its the country that theyre from or anything like that so i i i like to read the the childrens books i think thats the most animated and imaginative so i like those a lot   uh what are your favorite childrens books   oh there are a couple of Newbery Award winners uh A Wrinkle in Time is one  and i dont know if youve ever read that but but um   umhum no   oh theres one about an Indian girl and i cant think of that Island of the Blue Dolphins is another   hm   and thats a good one now some of the ones that have just received the awards this year i havent read and i would like to read those   umhum   but uh its funny because ive read some from like nineteen twenty three and nineteen forty five and things like that   umhum   and i didnt enjoy those as much and i dont know if its just because they didnt come from my era or what but uh   thats interesting i i i well i mean you cant be an English major major unless you like reading things from the past   yeah   so ive read a a great deal of old things i tend to go go back i dont have any children   uhhuh   so i dont read the new ones but i occasionally if no ones looking   uhhuh   dip into something like Winnie the Pooh or   uhhuh no even thats good   or uh uh the the Grimms Fairy Tales or something like that   umhum   um just because its sheer magic   yeah uh my children and i uh i started a thing where i read a book with them before they went   uhhuh   to bed at night and there was one called The Pig Princess and it was a a princess from a long long time ago and she came through a a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig um sty and the people that she came to were just   hm   farm people and she didnt understand them and they didnt understand her but it came together in this book and it was really a lot of fun   yes yes i think that uh we we
