                                 The Secret Services Real Secret            Last week the federalcourts accomplished something no president congressional committee governmentagency or private organization has been able to They said no to the SecretService            The fightover the protective function privilege has raised complicated delicate andimportant questions about presidential privacy and the obligations of theSecret Service Is the Secret Service a Praetorian Guard that can abet animperial president in sleaze and coverup How do we reconcile the presidentsprivacy with law enforcements demands While the courts have settled the legalissue for the moment pundits continue to masticate these questionsdutifully            But something is being overlooked in the privilegesquabble other complicated delicate and even more important questions aboutthe Secret Service Notably Are there any limits on the amount of money wewill spend to protect the president Is it healthy for a democracy to surroundits president with a bloated paramilitary security apparatus            The realworry about the Secret Service is not as the privilege spat suggests that thepresident has too much control over it The real worry is that no onehas control over it The Secret Services rise is one of the most remarkableand unremarked stories of government in the last  years In an age of openand ostensibly frugal public administration the Secret Service is ananomaly an agency that operates with nearly as much secrecy as the CIA andspends almost as freely as its heart desires How has this happened            As David Greenberg chronicles in                  Slate               s Backstory the Secret Service was established in  to fightcounterfeiting It began guarding the president regularly in  after theassassination of President William McKinley but remained a modest enterpriseuntil John F Kennedys murder            Sincethen the Secret Service has experienced the kind of growth that well onlystockholders in software companies have come to expect In  it spent million and employed  This year the Secret Service costs taxpayers about million and employs more than  peopleincluding  special agentswhose responsibilities include presidential protection and  officers inthe Uniformed Division Click for more details about its proliferation            The Secret Service is evidence of the Iron Law ofBureaucratic Growth An agency unchecked by outside forces expands The serviceasks and it is given For fiscal  it requested  in federalfunding an increase of more than  percent over its  million baseitreceives about  million more in other appropriations The House just passedthe Secret Service appropriations bill and how much did the agency getExactly             Congressstiffs other federal programs but all the Secret Services desires arefulfilled  million for four armorplated limousines  million for YKconversion millions to pay for extra travel expenses  million to beef upWhite House security including new bulletproof windows air defenses and extra security staffers Not that the public can find out much about how theSecret Service spends its money Details about how the president is protectedare classified The agency has even removed White House floor plans from theLibrary of Congress            The Secret Service is untouchable Congress isterrified of scrimping on it No one ever wants to not fully fund it says acongressional appropriations staffer No one ever wants to be the one who isresponsible for risk or danger to the president Another staffer asks Ifthey say its necessary for the safety of the president who is going to sayno The media too are reluctant to criticize The last major story toquestion the Secret Service appeared in the New Republic in January Two months later Reagan was shot When the Secret Service does attractnotice it tends to receive coverage best described as Protection Porn Clickfor an explanation            TheSecret Service does not hesitate to exploit its Dead President advantagepracticing an elegant variation of Fireman First a classic bureaucraticdefense mechanismwhen your budget is threatened propose cutting the firedepartment On the rare occasions the service is queried it invokes the DeadPresident A month after the Oklahoma City bombing and without a hearing theSecret Service shut Pennsylvania Avenue and surrounding streets to trafficWashingtonians complained The service declared it was necessary for the safetyof the White House and the president The avenue stays closed            The privilege squabble in fact marks the first time theDead President defense has failed In Justice Department briefs and in privatemeetings the Secret Service insisted that the failure to recognize theprivilege would result in profound and predictable peril to the presidentcould mean the difference between life or death would endanger theintegrity of our national security etc The appeals court rapped the agencyfor its scare tactics saying it must base its conclusions on solid facts anda realistic appraisal of the danger rather than on vague fears extrapolatedbeyond any foreseeable threat            The SecretService is not incompetent or corrupt or even especially greedy In fact itis almost universally admired for its professionalism and efficiency Even soits ascendancy is troublesome It has made standardeven admiredmeasuresthat ought to be intolerable in a democracy A halfcentury ago a presidentcould drive through city streets in a normal car with a few bodyguards andanyone could stroll up to the front door of the White House Of course ours isa different and more dangerous age There are undoubtedly more and moresophisticated threats to the president than we can imagine            But the expansion of the Secret Service hasnormalized a paramilitary presidency No one blinks at car motorcades thatshut down interstates and gridlock traffic the plusstrong Secret Servicedelegation that accompanies the president abroad the transformation of theopen White House into an impenetrable fortress During public events it isperfectly acceptable for Secret Service agents to approach crowd members andyank their hands out of their pockets to confirm they are not hiding weaponsIt is unquestioned that the president should be chauffeured in a car that costs million  It has become a deep inconvenience for average citizens tosee their president and a deep inconvenience for the president to see averagecitizens There is something unseemly about this excessive security andsomething undemocratic            SenDaniel Patrick Moynihan DNY perhaps the only lawmaker who ever criticizedthe Secret Service before the privilege flap said in a  Senate speech thatthe agency has made the insufferable routine I dont know if the agencyitself is aware of how arrogant and presumptuous it has become Two years agoMoynihan remarked that soon the service will have a billiondollar budgetAnd still just one president one vice president            It isnt that the Secret Services precautions aredefinitively unnecessary Its that no one knows whether they are necessary andno one is willing to ask Perfection is impossible in presidential security Nomatter how much we spend the goal will always recede A determined assassinwill be able to find a way to kill the president And the Secret Service willbe able to find a way to spend more money to prevent it In fact the agencyseems to have found most of those ways already            No onewants the president assassinated But should it be forbidden to ask if we couldspend less and do less to protect him                           If youmissed the link to the
