                                 A Bridge to the World            I met Alfred Kazin becauseof IB Singer It was  and Id been working at the Forward forless than a year when Singer the Nobel Prizewinning master of Yiddishfiction died The next day the phone rang This is Alfred Kazin Id like towrite something about Singer If Singer himself had been on the line I couldhardly have been more surprisedor more delighted Both men to my mindinhabited a peak of the literary Olympus but I had not understood howconnected Singers Yiddishspeaking world was to Kazins mandarin Americanliterary milieu Of course the evidence was everywhere            In A Walker in theCity  his first and best volume of autobiography Kazin describes his firstwalk across the Brooklyn Bridge when he was  years old Hed becomeseparated from classmates who were headed to City Hall but he decided tocontinue across the bridge alone In rhapsodic language reminiscent of HenryRoth Kazin takes in all the crackling sounds and sights of the emerging citythe trolleys and the crush of people and the dark roofs of Manhattan Only theelectric sign of the Jewish Daily                Forward  burning high over thetenements of the East Side he writes suddenly stilled the riot in myheart            Whetherthat sign stilled his heart with calming thoughts of home where theForward was read in Yiddish by his housepainter father and dressmakermother or whether it momentarily halted the reach of his escaping imaginationis not explained For Kazin both were no doubt true for he was able toexpress multiple selves simultaneously He once told me that he had consideredcalling his final and fourth volume of autobiography published in  simplyJews  He opted instead for A Lifetime Burning in Every Moment  aline taken from TS Eliots Four Quartets Jews  he decided wouldbe too much But it isnt as if he chose the lines of the antiSemite at theexpense of his own American impulse toward ethnic selfassertion He hadafter all called his third memoir New York Jew  When I suggested thatwhat he was really doing was Judaizing Eliot making him serve as an epigraphto Kazins AmericanJewish lifehungry odyssey he laughed approvingly Yeshe said I like that            In  at the age of only  Kazin had published OnNative Grounds  The grandeur of the title and the immodesty of thesubtitle An Interpretation of Modern                American ProseLiterature mark it as the sort of book only a grateful child of immigrantscould write Who else would tune his ear so finely for traces of an emergingnational consciousness while teasing out the finer points of its economicsocial and moral awareness His openarmed embrace of American literature hismagisterial we in speaking about literary matters in this country had theassertiveness of the newly enfranchised Once after I got to know him betterhe told me that his daughter Kate had moved to Israel and I jokingly observedthat she was really on native ground Kazin was not amused He hadlabored too long to make America his own to feel it pulled out from under himeven in jest            He neverdenied the Jewish piece of his identity Its just that America was where hefelt it was possible to express all the pieces of himself at once Kazin wasdifferent from many firstgeneration intellectuals who sailed into Americanhigh culture and sent for their past only long after they had establishedthemselves like immigrants bringing over the rest of the family Kazin broughteverything with him at once            The story Kazin wound up telling in theForward about Singer recounted the Yiddish writers desire to see thegrave of Edmund Wilson Singer was Kazin recalled fascinated to learn thatWilson that patrician WASP man of letters had chosen a Hebrew inscription forhis headstone Kazin was clearly delighted with this confluence ofelementsWilson translating himself into Hebrew Singer translating himselfinto English and Kazin himself telling the story presiding over bothknitting together the two disparate elements that fueled his own uniquestyle            No wonderKazin was drawn to the bridge in A                Walker in the City Brownsville the neighborhood in Brooklyn where he came from had one foot ineastern Europe and one in the New World Kazin himself had one foot inBrownsville and one foot in the highbrow literary world of Manhattan Criticssuch as Kazin and writers such as Saul Bellowborn the same year asKazinstretched out their intellect and imagination across disparate worldsand helped a generation of bookhungry immigrant offspring walk into Americancultural life            Kazin was a bridge for me as well It was hisintroductionsto Henry Roth to D H Lawrence to Henry James that helpedme feel at home with great modernist writers Kazin wrote about Americanliterature in particular as if he had discovered it himself He imparted toeverything he wrote that same feeling of magical discovery he describesexperiencing when he walked as a young man out of immigrant Brooklyn intosophisticated Manhattan            One day this past winter mywife and I went to a party in Westchester also attended by Kazin and his wifeJudith My wife and I had taken the train and the Kazins offered us a rideback to the citybut only if I drove His wife told me they didnt mindrisking their own lives in the dark but that younger people were anothermatter Needless to say I was terrified creeping along the Saw Mill Parkwayas if all of Western literature were in the back seat Kazins conversationalstyle now closely resembled a memoir in progresshe chatted casually aboutHarry Levin the great Joyce scholar at Harvard and about critic CliftonFadimans TV appearances and about Singer whom he had recently written aboutfor the New York Review of Books             We came to the West SideHighway There in the distance was the George Washington Bridge lit up inthe darkness This was the same approach to Manhattan I suddenly realizedthat I had known when I was a teenager making the drive to New York from theWestchester suburb where I grew up Though Id had a very different childhoodfrom Kazin and approached Manhattan from a direction completely different fromKazins Brownsville I remembered vividly the sense of possibility the drivesuggested And I understood that it was partly because of Alfred Kazin that NewYork seemed a place of the imagination a place where life opened up My heartfilled with gratitude Here was Kazin  years older than I but stilltraveling happily toward New York still talking about books and people withpassion and devotion and still holding out the promise of a New World
