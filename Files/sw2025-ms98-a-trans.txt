        all right Amy how are you doing today   fine fine   oh all righty i think we know what were going to speak about um tell you what ill start off hows that   yeah okay you go ahead   um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and were talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back   umhum     hangings on weekends   in public places   in public places there is one state that does that by the way   yeah really what is that   i want to say Oklahoma i saw report something the other night about it   hm   they dont do them real often which is obviously the death penalty   yeah yeah   um but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs and sixty dollars sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and lets just screwing up the system uh   yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before hes paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months   thats pathetic thats pathetic its   because they just say theres either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or you know its just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what hes going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know whats his whim to decide it should be two months   this is true and and and and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to   you know its crazy   life in prison then hes available for parole if its if its life and a day then hes not eligible for parole so what you know lets quit BSing with the system   yeah well even if its life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for starving children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that   exactly   so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really   a life for a life   i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and its not just like one instance or something its just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on   the old Charles Manson case i mean the guy is really   yeah and the yeah theres just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um     just shouldnt be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge   yeah umhum   the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene uh when theres uh my understanding when theres uh a verdict and it for example theres a hung jury here in Fort Worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay   right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah   um kind of gets back to the second request weve been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that id say no lets just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight theres a percentage certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey   right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a fortune you know a fortune to keep doing that   the guys guilty exactly   and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution   exactly because its not next day they have the start the trial which is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more   right yeah yeah   i think that that if its if its not a split decision uh go with the highest number and lets just get on with the program   yeah yeah   uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since theres a jury because thats what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings   yeah yeah well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or you know had good a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i dont know if it prevents it but  seems like the jury system does have its advantages but i also ive also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know and i dont know how much theyre getting just a jury of their peers at that point theyre really getting a select group its not just random people   hm   it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and thats it   yeah yeah i get back to Prices comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didnt have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know   you know   hed have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like hes got his peers or something yeah   exactly yeah yeah i mean youre youre in Dallas so everybody i cant believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who dont know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence youd have to be pretty dense   yeah   youd be in have to be in a cave not to know whats going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer   yeah oh theyd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically   this is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation   yeah yeah well really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no im at home with two little kids preschoolers  my husband works for TI   oh so youre at the house youre not at the plant oh hold it oh thats good thats good i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasnt sure   so yeah oh yeah ive got the dog and two kids waiting here i am locked up in the laundry room  okay thanks a lot byebye   oh goodness well ill let you get i enjoyed it bye
