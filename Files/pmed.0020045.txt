                    Introduction        Diabetic nephropathy DNP is a serious and common complication of type  and type         diabetes mellitus leading to endstage renal failure in up to  of individuals with        diabetes Early abnormalities of DNP affect glomeruli and include an increase in glomerular        filtration rate microalbuminuria glomerular hypertrophy and thickening of the glomerular        basement membrane followed by expansion of mesangial extracellular matrix and        glomerulosclerosis  As with most chronic degenerative kidney diseases the gradual        decline of renal function at later stages of DNP is invariably associated with tubular        epithelial degeneration TED also called tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis IF        hallmarks of degeneration to endstage renal failure  Pathomechanisms that may initiate        andor mediate TED in DNP remain poorly understood While glomerular lesions consistent        with human DNP have been described in various mouse models of diabetes TED and IF have not        been described in diabetic mice         Combining detailed renal phenotype analysis with gene expression profiling of        hyperglycemic mouse models of type  streptozotocin STZ and type  dbdb diabetes we        recently reported that decreased mRNA levels of CD in kidneys were strongly correlated        with albuminuria  CD is a transmembrane protein of the class B scavenger receptor        family and is involved in multiple biological processes  CD is widely expressed and        may interact with multiple extracellular ligands including thrombospondin TSP        longchain free fatty acids FFAs modified oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein oxLDL        advanced glycation end AGE products and collagens I and IV  CD mediates        phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and malariaparasitized erythrocytes  Furthermore CD        mediates antiangiogenic activity associated with endothelial cell apoptosis induced by        TSP through p MAP kinase MAPK and caspase   Hyperglycemiainduced synthesis of        CD protein in macrophages has been associated with increased uptake of oxLDL by        macrophages and foam cell formation in atherosclerotic lesions in people with diabetes         While diabetic cardiovascular complications are closely linked epidemiologically        with albuminuria and DNP a role for CD in DNP and renal pathophysiology has not to our        knowledge been described to date        Here we report a novel functional role for CD scavenger receptor and AGE and FFA        palmitate PA in tubular epithelial apoptosis associated with TED and progression of DNP        Specifically we show that glucose stimulates CD cell surface expression in proximal        tubular epithelial cells PTECs and increased CD renders PTECs susceptible to both AGE        and PAinduced PTEC apoptosis by mediating sequential activation of src kinase        proapoptotic p MAPK and caspase  Based on these findings we propose a new twostep        metabolic hit model for TED in the progression of DNP                    Methods                  Animals          Kidneys were obtained from wkold CBLKSJlepr

glomerulosclerosis FSGS were obtained from archived kidney biopsy samples or          from discarded nephrectomy specimens All diabetic samples were from patients with          biopsyproven advanced DNP with serum creatinine ranging from  to  mgdl  to           Ml heavy proteinuria  by dipstick or  grd and hypertension All patients          with FSGS were from patients with creatinine levels of  to  mgdl  to           Ml heavy proteinuria  by dipstick and hypertension The diagnosis of FSGS was          made on Periodic acidSchiff staining in the absence of immunodeposits on electron          microscopy The diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy was based on the presence of diabetes          proteinuria and the characteristic light microscopy findings Institutional Review Board          approval was obtained for procurement of kidney specimens at the Thomas Jefferson          University Hospital                          Statistical Methods          Data are reported as mean and standard error of the mean SEM for continuous          variables All cell culture experiments were performed at least three times and          summarized Standard software packages SPSS and Excel for Windows were used to provide          descriptive statistical plots unpaired           t tests The Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons          Significance for the quantification of the CD staining in human biopsy samples was          calculated via the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test                            Results                  Increased Expression of CD Specifically in Proximal Tubules of Human Diabetic          Kidneys Is Associated with TED          Using microarraybased gene expression profiling on whole kidney RNA together with          supervised clustering methods we previously identified and validated gene expression          patterns for molecular classification of diabetic mice with albuminuria and mesangial          expansion  Reduced renal mRNA levels of the class B scavenger receptor CD were          characteristic for diabetic mice with albuminuria  Here we examined patterns of CD          protein expression in kidneys of nondiabetic and diabetic mice and humans CD protein          was detectable in the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle and in the collecting duct          and absent in proximal tubules in both control and diabetic mouse kidneys Figure AD          In contrast CD was detectable only rarely in individual proximal tubular cells in          sections from nondiabetic human kidneys controls Figure E and H but was markedly          increased specifically in PTECs in human diabetic kidneys Figure F and I In          addition we did not observe increased proximal tubular CD expression in kidney biopsy          samples from patients with FSGS Figure J that were matched with DNP samples for the          severity of proteinuria all in the nephrotic range and renal insufficiency all with          elevated serum creatinine  mgdl Semiquantitative analysis of the distribution          and intensity of CDpositive PTECs CD PTEC score which was performed by two          independent pathologists in a blinded manner demonstrated that mean CD PTEC scores          were not different between FSGS kidneys and normal human kidneys but were significantly          increased in DNP kidneys Figure K          Periodic acidSchiffstained sections of kidneys from mice exposed to type  diabetes          dbdb mice for  wk Figure A or type  diabetes STZtreated CBLJ mice for           wk data not shown demonstrated moderate to advanced mesangial expansion and          glomerulosclerosis Figure A Tubular abnormalities were not detectable in either model          Figure A In contrast TED and IF were associated with moderate to advanced mesangial          expansion and glomerulosclerosis on kidney sections of human DNP Figure B These          findings indicate that in humans with DNP diabetesinduced upregulation of CD          expression in proximal tubules was associated with moderate to advanced stages of TED and          IF In contrast in diabetic mice with albuminuria mesangial expansion and          glomerulosclerosis absence of CD expression was associated with normal appearance of          the tubular epithelium and interstitial space These findings suggest an association          between diabetesinduced proximal tubular CD expression and TED                          Coincidence of Increased CD Expression and Increased Tubular Epithelial Cell          Apoptosis in Human DNP          CD has been shown to mediate apoptosis signaling induced by TSP in endothelial          cells  and by oxLDL in macrophages  We examined whether the strong upregulation          of CD protein in PTECs observed specifically in human DNP was associated with tubular          epithelial cell apoptosis in vivo TUNELpositive tubular epithelial cells also stained          positive for CD protein Figure D and aquaporin Figure C indicating that          apoptosis and CD expression coincided in PTECs in human DNP In contrast CD was not          detectable in TUNELpositive PTECs in nondiabetic FSGS kidneys and in normal human          kidney data not shown Statistical analysis showed that the rate of TUNELpositive          tubular cells was significantly increased in kidneys of human DNP compared with normal          control human kidney Figure E In addition tubular epithelial apoptosis was          increased but highly variable in FSGS kidneys data not shown In contrast tubular          epithelial apoptosis rates were comparable between nondiabetic control and all diabetic          mouse kidneys Figure E The diabetic mouse group included wkold STZtreated          diabetic CBLJ or SvJ mice    TUNELpositive cells per  tubular cells          and wkold lepr          dbdb mice    TUNELpositive cells per  tubular cells          Together these findings indicate that CD expression in PTECs is associated with          apoptotic events of proximal tubular cells and TED specifically in human DNP but not in          FSGS with matched functional and clinical abnormalities These in vivo findings          demonstrate a strong association of diabetesinduced CD expression and apoptosis in          PTECs in human DNP suggesting that CD may play a critical role in TED by mediating          PTEC apoptosis in progressive human DNP                          High Ambient Glucose Induces CD Expression in Human PTECs          High ambient glucose has been shown to induce CD protein synthesis in macrophages           Because CD protein was markedly increased in proximal tubules in human DNP we          examined the effects of high ambient glucose on CD mRNA and protein expression in the          human PTEC line HK Figure  Exposure of cells to  mM Dglucose for  h but not          to control Lglucose significantly increased levels of CD mRNA Figure A CD cell          surface protein Figure C and CD protein expression in cell lysates Figure D In          contrast CD mRNA and protein were not detectable in the murine PTEC line MCT at either          normal or high ambient glucose concentrations data not shown Interestingly glucose          stimulation decreased CD mRNA levels Figure B and CD cell surface protein Figure          C in the murine collecting duct cell line M consistent with our previously reported          findings in diabetic mouse kidney  Exposure of human HK and murine M cell lines to          defined preparations of FFA PA or AGEBSA had no effect on CD mRNA and protein          expression levels data not shown These findings demonstrate that high ambient glucose          causes upregulation of CD mRNA and protein specifically in human but not in mouse          PTECs Together with our in vivo observations these results suggest that hyperglycemia          may induce upregulation of CD mRNA and protein selectively in proximal tubules in          kidneys of human DNP but not diabetic mice with albuminuria                          AGEBSA CMLBSA and FFA PA Induce Apoptosis in Human PTECs via CD          AGE albumin  and FFAs  have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic          complications including tubular degeneration  and tubular epithelialtomesenchymal          transition  In addition AGE albumin and FFA are known to interact with CD           However it is not known whether AGE andor FFA can activate CD signaling and          apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells Treatment with AGEBSA for   or  wk or with          CMLBSA induced a significant increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei in CDpositive          HK cells compared with control BSAtreated or untreated HK cells Figure A In          contrast AGEBSA and CMLBSA had no effect on the rate of apoptotic nuclei in          CDnegative murine MCT PTECs data not shown Because AGEBSA glycated for  wk          AGEBSA induced robust apoptosis at concentrations between  and  M Figure A          we chose this preparation and concentration for further analysis in all subsequent          experiments AGEBSAinduced apoptosis was blocked when cells were preincubated with          neutralizing antiCD antibody while preincubation with control IgG antibody had no          effect Figure A These results were confirmed by DNA laddering assay data not          shown          Among the most abundant glucosemodified proteins detectable in the plasma of diabetic          individuals are CML proteins  which are typically present at  to  M          concentrations in the plasma and urine of diabetic individuals  To use          physiologically relevant CML proteins in our in vitro experiments we prepared          CMLminBSA characterized by glycation of approximately  of lysine residues  When          applied to HK PTECs at concentrations ranging from  to  M CMLminBSA increased          apoptosis rates significantly Figure B The proapoptotic effect of CMLminBSA was          blocked by CD neutralizing antibody but not by control IgG Figure B          CD has been shown to transport fatty acids in adipocytes  and in muscle cells           Concentrations of FFAs may be substantially elevated to levels of up to  M in          individuals with type  diabetes or obesity  Thus we examined the effects of          saturated FFA PA and monounsaturated FFA oleate on apoptosis of HK PTECs in the absence          or presence of antiCD neutralizing antibody PA significantly increased rates of          apoptotic nuclei in a concentrationdependent manner in HK PTECs Figure C AntiCD          neutralizing antibody but not control IgG blocked PAinduced apoptosis Figure C In          contrast oleate did not induce apoptosis even at concentrations as high as  M          Figure C neither did it prevent PAinduced apoptosis data not shown Of note these          experiments were performed using a total fatty acidBSA ratio of  in order to          closely model pathophysiologic states in which unbound FFA concentration is high           Taken together our findings demonstrate that pathophysiologically relevant species of          AGEBSA and CMLBSA as well as saturated FFA PA induce apoptosis in human PTECs at          concentrations previously observed in plasma andor urine in humans with diabetes                          AGEBSA and PA Sequentially Activate src kinase Proapoptotic p MAPK and Caspase           through CD Receptor          CD has previously been shown to trigger the activation of pfyn p MAPK and          caspase  GeneID  in response to thrombospondin in endothelial cells  Therefore          we examined phosphosrc phosphop levels and caspase  activation in HK PTECs          treated with AGEBSA and PA in the absence or presence of antiCD neutralizing          antibody Both AGEBSA and PA increased phosphosrc levels rapidly after as little as           min and over a prolonged time interval up to  h Figure A and B Phosphorylation          of src kinase was blocked by antiCD neutralizing antibody Figure A and B This          observation is consistent with previous findings demonstrating direct interaction between          CD and pfyn  however the involvement of other src kinases cannot be excluded We          also observed increased levels of phosphorylation of p MAPK beginning  to  h after          treatment and p activation was also completely blocked by antiCD neutralizing          antibody Figure C and D These findings indicate that CD activates proapoptotic p          MAPK possibly via src kinase activation in human PTECs when stimulated with AGEBSA and          PA Chemical inhibition of p MAPK prevented the increase in the rate of apoptotic          nuclei induced by both AGEBSA and PA in HK PTECs Figure G indicating that p          MAPK function is required for apoptosis induced by AGEBSA and PA through CD receptor          AGEBSA and PA significantly increased activity of effector caspase  in human PTECs          Figure E and F Caspase  activation was blocked by antiCD neutralizing antibody          but not by control IgG Figure E and F Pancaspase inhibitor zVADfmk and the          specific caspase  inhibitor zDEVDfmk prevented apoptosis induced by PA and AGEBSA          while the specific caspase  inhibitor zLEHDfmk had no significant inhibitor effect          Figure G Together these findings indicate that CD receptor mediates sequential          phosphorylation of src kinases and p MAPK leading to activation of caspase  and          apoptosis in human PTECs exposed to AGEBSA and PA ligands Interestingly we did not          observe phosphorylation of Smad and p ERK MAPK under these conditions as          previously reported for AGE binding to the RAGE receptor                           CD Is Sufficient to Mediate Apoptosis Induced by AGEBSA and FFA          In contrast with CDpositive human HK PTECs we found that treatment of          CDnegative mouse MCT PTECs with AGEBSA had no effect on rates of apoptotic nuclei          data not shown To test whether CD was sufficient to mediate AGEBSAinduced          apoptosis we transfected CDnegative mouse MCT PTECs with a plasmid expressing human          CD or empty control vector followed by treatment with control BSA or AGEBSA          AGEBSA treatment had no significant effect on rates of apoptotic nuclei in MCT PTECs          transfected with control vector Figure  In contrast AGEBSA significantly increased          apoptotic nuclei compared with unglycated BSA in MCT PTECs transiently transfected with          CD expression vector Figure  Nonglycated control albumin did not cause apoptosis          Thus transgenic de novo expression of human CD in CDnegative mouse PTECs was          sufficient to mediate apoptosis induced by AGEBSA                            Discussion        Advanced diabetic nephropathies in humans with type  or type  diabetes are uniformly        characterized by TED or tubular atrophy and IF leading to renal failure  Although        TED and IF are the strongest predictors for progression of DNP  mechanisms that        underlie TED in DNP remain poorly understood Based on our in vitro and in vivo findings we        propose a twostep metabolic hit model for TED in DNP High ambient glucose but not AGE or        FFA cause stimulation of CD expression in PTECs specifically in diabetic kidneys        Increased CD expression mediates sequential activation of src kinase proapoptotic p        MAPK and caspase  in PTECs in the presence of AGE and FFA PA resulting in PTEC        apoptosis Proximal tubular epithelial apoptosis may be an initial mechanism for TED in        DNP        Our conclusions are supported by several key observations First we identify a new        functional role for CD as an essential mediator of proximal tubular epithelial apoptosis        inducible by AGEBSA CMLminBSA and FFA PA Previous reports demonstrated a role for CD        in mediating apoptosis induced by TSP in endothelial cells and oxLDL in macrophages         In the present study we show for the first time to our knowledge that CD        mediates apoptosis in differentiated epithelial cells that are exposed to AGEBSA        CMLminBSA and FFAinduced metabolic injury characteristic of the diabetic milieu        Interestingly AGE albumins and CML are present in the urine of individuals with diabetes        with albuminuria due to DNP and have been shown to bind proximal tubular epithelium         While the presence or absence of FFAs in the urine of diabetics with DNP has not        been determined to date FFAs may cause tubular apoptosis  It remains to be determined        whether FFA interacts with CD to activate CD receptor signaling or whether CD        mediates FFA uptake to activate src kinase and p MAPK signaling Irrespective of the        upstream mechanism of FFA and CD interaction our results demonstrate very rapid        activation of a wellcharacterized intracellular kinase cascade of proapoptotic signaling        Our finding that AGEBSA and PA induce apoptosis through a CDmediated and p and        caspasedependent mechanism in tubular epithelial cells similar to TSP and oxLDL in        endothelial cells and macrophages respectively suggests that multiple contextdependent        extracellular stimuli of apoptosis may converge on CD scavenger receptor to activate src        kinase and proapoptotic p MAPK pathway In the context of the diabetic milieu and        diabetic complications our findings provide new molecular insights into diabetesinduced        AGE and FFAdependent injury of renal epithelial cells        Almost all TUNELpositive apoptotic tubular epithelial cells showed increased expression        of CD suggesting a strong correlation between upregulation of CD expression and        increased apoptosis in PTECs specifically in human diabetic kidney in vivo Importantly        biopsy samples from cases of FSGS that were matched for degree of proteinuria renal        function and hypertension were characterized by TED IF and increased tubular epithelial        apoptosis however proximal tubular CD expression was similar to that in normal human        control kidney Therefore CD expression in PTECs is specifically associated with the        diabetic condition and appears to be independent of degree of proteinuria and renal        failure Indeed increased CD expression in PTECs in human DNP in vivo may be caused by        hyperglycemia as we show that high glucose concentration stimulates CD expression in        vitro It is intriguing that CD expression was not detected in PTECs in diabetic mice        with longstanding hyperglycemia in vivo although underlying mechanisms for the        speciesdependent differential regulation of CD in PTECs in vivo and in vitro between        mouse and human remain unclear at this time Comparisons of human         CD and mouse         Cd genes indicate a high degree of sequence and structural similarity        in both coding and regulatory regions suggesting that the mechanism or mechanisms that        underlie our findings are likely determined by sequenceindependent epigenetically        distinct response patterns to the diabetic milieu that differ between these species It is        also possible that dietary or metabolic factors account for the differences in CD        expression as mice were maintained on standard mouse chow characterized by significantly        lower fat and cholesterol contents than typical western diets consumed by humans However        dietary or other unknown environmental factors cannot explain the differential CD        regulation by glucose in human and mouse PTECs Thus we are exploring whether biochemical        or functional differences between mouse and human PTECs in glucose metabolism or        glucoseinduced signaling can be identified However current lack of understanding of the        observed differential regulation between human and mouse does not diminish the        translational research significance of our findings with their clear therapeutic        implications Thus the present study identifies a new CDdependent molecular signaling        pathway that mediates tubular epithelial apoptosis and may underlie TED and IF hallmarks        of disease progression specifically in human diabetic nephropathy        Third to our knowledge our report provides the first controlled study demonstrating        increased apoptosis specifically in PTECs in DNP with TED and IF These findings are        consistent with a recent uncontrolled case series of five patients with DNP  and with        previous reports demonstrating tubular apoptosis in kidneys of STZtreated diabetic rats         Interestingly our study shows that tubular epithelial apoptosis was associated        with TED and IF in human DNP while normal appearance of tubular epithelium and        interstitium was associated with baseline apoptosis rates in diabetic mouse models        Together published observations from experimental diabetes models in mouse and rat and        human DNP and our own findings in diabetic mouse models and human DNP suggest a striking        association of TED and tubular epithelial apoptosis However whether tubular epithelial        apoptosis causes TED in DNP will require further investigation Interestingly acute and        chronic chemical inhibition of caspase activity in a nephrotoxic serum nephritis model of        chronic progressive glomerulonephritis with TED and IF reduced tubular apoptosis and TED         Decreased tubular apoptosis and TED were associated with significantly reduced IF and        decreased collagen synthesis in this model This finding suggests that tubular epithelial        apoptosis may trigger TED and IF in this model of chronic glomerulonephritis in rat and        supports our conclusions that diabetesinduced tubular epithelial apoptosis may underlie        TED associated with IF in human DNP        In conclusion we report a new functional role for CD scavenger receptor in tubular        epithelial apoptosis associated with tubular degeneration and progression of DNP        Specifically we show for the first time that both AGE and FFA PA induce PTEC apoptosis        through CDmediated activation of src kinase p MAPK and caspase  Because high        glucose stimulates CD expression in human PTECs and because CD expression is increased        in apoptotic tubular epithelial cells in human DNP we propose a twostep metabolic hit        model relevant for TED a hallmark of progression of human DNP                    Supporting Information
