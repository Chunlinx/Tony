                    Background                Listeria monocytogenes is a        ubiquitous Grampositive soil bacterium and facultative        intracellular pathogen which on occasion causes severe        foodborne disease in newborns pregnant women or        immunocompromised individuals Although the epithelial        cells of the intestinal tract are in constant contact with        a diverse population of bacteria most are not stimulated        by these bacteria to produce strong immune responses        However these cells must be prepared to help fight off        infections by bacteria that have evolved mechanisms to        enter and replicate in their cytoplasm This study examines        the basis of host response specificity        The pathway of infection by         L monocytogenes is initiated by        binding of bacterial cell surface molecules including the        internalins InlA and InlB to specific receptors on the        surface of the intestinal epithelia such as Ecadherin in        the case of InlA     and Met or gCqR for InlB           The interaction between InlA and Ecadherin is        essential for infection of enterocytes in a mouse model of        listeriosis   After being engulfed the bacterium        secretes virulence factors to degrade the phagosome        Listeriolysin O LLO         hly       and two        phospholipases PlcA PlcB     work in concert        to disrupt the membrane of the phagocytic vacuole allowing        the bacterium to escape into the cytoplasm Once in the        cytoplasm         L monocytogenes recruits the actin        cytoskeletal machinery by expressing the protein ActA in a        polarized fashion on its surface    ActAdependent        actin polymerization generates force and thereby        cytoplasmic motility   Moving bacteria that reach the        cell plasma membrane form membranebound protrusions that        are engulfed by neighboring cells allowing the infection        to spread without the bacteria ever leaving the cytoplasmic        environment        Microarrays of cDNAs have become an important tool for        analyzing genomic transcriptional programs in diverse        biological processes Recently microarrays have also        become a widely used tool for studying hostpathogen        interactions from the perspective of both the host and the        pathogen        The goals of this work        were twofold to use cDNA microarrays to characterize the        primary response of intestinal epithelial cells to a        wellstudied intracellular pathogen         L monocytogenes  and to try to        identify host geneexpression programs which are induced by        specific stages of the infection by comparing the wildtype        expression profile to that of mutants which are either        incapable of intracellular growth and thus avirulent or        which cannot initiate actin polymerization in host cell        cytoplasm        To this end we have examined the global transcriptional        response of a human intestinal epithelial cell line        Caco to infection by         L monocytogenes and isogenic mutants        which are disrupted in the         actA or         prfA gene Caco cells were chosen        because they are a model human cell line for studying the        differentiation   transport biochemistry    and        immunology of intestinal epithelia      The         actA internal inframe deletion        mutant DPL   which cannot initiate the        polymerization of actin was used to assess transcriptional        responses specific to the motility phase of infection The         prfA gene codes for a transcriptional        regulator which controls the virulence genes         hly plcA plcB mpl and         actA  as well as negatively        regulating itself    Mutant bacteria with a        transposon insertion in         prfA DPL   adhere to the        hostcell surface and induce their own uptake into a        phagocytic vacuole presumably through lowlevel expression        of the internalins but cannot escape from the phagocytic        vacuole into the cytoplasm Several reports in the        literature indicate that LLO PlcA and PlcB of         L monocytogenes induce specific host        responses in macrophages and endothelial cells               We were therefore particularly interested        to see whether these virulencespecific responses would be        similar in intestinal epithelial cells the normal first        site of         L monocytogenes infection                    Results                  Predominance of the NFB pathway of activation in          the transcriptional response of Caco cells to L          monocytogenesinfection          We used DNA microarrays spotted with  human          cDNAs representing about half of the transcripts in the          human genome to examine the host transcriptional          response of cultured human intestinal epithelial cells          Caco over an hour period following infection by           L monocytogenes wildtype strain          S Samples for each time point               and  minutes postinfection were infected in          parallel The progress of each infection was monitored          using a combination of phasecontrast and fluorescence          microscopy Figure  Wildtype bacteria were highly          motile within the cytoplasm by  hours postinfection as          evidenced by filamentous actin tail structures stained          with rhodamine phalloidin Figure b Overall the time          course of cellular events following           L monocytogenes infection in          Caco cells closely parallels the time course reported          for macrophagelike cell lines and other epithelial cell          lines            Messenger RNA was isolated from each experimental          sample and used to prepare Cy labeled cDNA red by          reverse transcription   To provide an internal          standard for each measurement a pool of reference mRNA          labeled with Cy dUTP green derived from combining          mRNA from  different human cell lines was mixed with          the Cy labeled experimental samples before          hybridization with the cDNA microarray The reference          pool of RNA was designed to provide some signal for as          many genes on the array as possible permitting analysis          of changes in gene expression with respect to the ratio          of experimental signal red to a constant signal for          each gene the reference signal green   Temporal          changes in gene expression for each gene were evaluated          at each time point by subtracting log            redgreen of the time zero          measurement from the corresponding log            redgreen ratio at each time          point The resulting values represent log            red T            red T             or log            red T            red T             and so on and indicate changes          relative to the beginning of the infection A schematic          representation of this zero transformation is shown in          Figure           Many genes were strongly induced in response to the          infection Results for corresponding time points from two          independent hour time courses performed on different          days were averaged filtered to remove unnamed genes and          ranked by the average change for the entire time course          The  most highly induced named genes are shown in          Figure  Twenty percent of these genes are either          involved in NFB signal transduction or directly          activated by NFB These include the immediate early          response genes Fos Jun and Myc as well as inhibitors          of apoptosis IAP chemokines Gro and the          inhibitor of NFB IBalpha                          Wildtype and actAstrains of L monocytogenesinfect          Caco cells at similar rates and both induce strong NFB          responses          We were interested in determining whether any of the          responses we had detected were specific to the          actinbased motility phase of the infection To this end          we carried out similar hour time courses with an          isogenic           L monocytogenes strain deficient          in           actA DPL            actA  which is unable to nucleate          actin polymerization and hence has no capacity for          intracellular motility and intercellular spread   As          has been described for this mutant the visible          characteristics of the infection were quite different          from wild type and no actin structures are associated          with cytoplasmic microcolonies of           actA mutant bacteria Figure          c          Microarray analysis of the           actA time courses revealed that the          host transcriptional responses were remarkably similar to          those observed during infection with the wildtype          strain Genes in the NFB pathway were strongly induced          in both experiments although the amplitudes of responses          for specific genes were a bit different for each          experiment Daytoday variation for individual time          courses as well as overall similarity in the top           induced genes can be clearly seen when data from all          experiments including a parallel time course described          below are clustered together Figure  right          Despite the overall similarity of the geneexpression          patterns for the two wildtype infections and the two           actA infections there were          significant variations between replicants that could          compromise our ability to extract what might be subtle          differences between wildtype and mutant infections          Careful studies have demonstrated the correlation of          measurements from microarrays with changes in gene          expression   or genomic DNA content   suggesting          that the variability we observed was not attributable to          the microarray methodology To determine the source of          variability of our measurements we examined the          correlation of measurements from uninfected cells plated          at the same relative density and passage number where          mRNA was isolated on different days and hybridized at          different times or harvested and hybridized at the same          time We found that the correlations of the global mRNA          expression measurements for cultures harvested on          different days was only fair Figure a Pearson          correlation coefficient of  while the correlation          between two independent microarray analyses of the same          samples gave a correlation of  Figure b The          correlation of measurements for mRNA samples prepared in          parallel on the same day from the same batch of cells was          also very high Figure c average correlation of           These results indicate that primary source of variability          among the infections carried out on different days is the          true daytoday biological variation of the Caco cell          cultures We therefore decided to repeat the wildtype          and mutant infections on cells that had been expanded at          the same time and infected in parallel on a single          day                          Synchronized infections yielded consistent changes          in gene expression dominated by the NFB response          We repeated the experiments carrying out parallel          hour time courses simultaneously for mock infections          wildtype S            actA DPL and            prfA DPL with time points          taken at    and  minutes after infection In          this parallel experiment baseline T             mRNA from uninfected cells was          independently isolated from three different cultures The          correlation between the expression patterns of these          parallel uninfected cultured cell samples was much higher          than for samples isolated on different days albeit not          as high as for two independent hybridizations of the same          mRNA Figure  The three measurements of log            Caco T            reference from the parallel set          were averaged to define the pattern of expression in          uninfected cells at the beginning of the synchronized          parallel time course and was then used to zero transform          the mock wildtype           actA and           prfA parallel infections          Genes were ranked by the average of the log            T           n T             for all three infection time          courses then filtered to exclude any genes that were          induced in the mock infection the average log            T           n T               and not equal to zero          Of the  named genes most highly induced in all          infections  are either involved in NFB signaling or          are responsive to NFB activation When these genes were          subjected to hierarchical clustering many also had          similar patterns of gene expression as measured by the          Pearson correlation of their geneexpression vectors and          the bulk of NFBresponsive genes formed a single cluster          Figure           Significance analysis of microarrays   see          Materials and methods was used to search for genes whose          expression differed significantly between mockinfected          samples taken at  and  hours class  and samples          taken at  and  hours during the bacterial infections          class  As missing data for relatively small datasets          are not tolerated by the SAM algorithm the most          significantly induced genes identified in this way were          not identical to the list generated by ranking the          average log            T           n T             but this alternative approach did          confirm the observation that the NFBresponsive genes          were significantly induced by all bacterial infections          and that this induction was robust through a hour          window Interestingly far fewer genes were specifically          repressed than induced When we compared the expression          patterns at  and  hours after infection to the          corresponding time points of the mock infection           genes were considered significantly induced by SAM and          no genes significantly repressed          Throughout the time course of all infections many          genes regulated by NFB were induced at high levels          including some members of the NFB family itself Figure           Among the most highly induced were the genes encoding          NFB RelB IBalpha the inhibitor of NFB IK          IB kinaseepsilon and NFBinducing kinase or          Mapkinase NIK MAPK Interestingly CD and          TLR receptors involved in innate immune recognition of          microbial antigens were both induced A number of          chemokines and cytokines that are regulated by NFB were          also induced Figure  including IL Gro Gro          and a number of small inducible cytokine family members          SCY Uroldnase and uroldnase receptors were both          specifically induced as were cell adhesion molecules          such as ICAM Both of the gamma interferon IFNR          receptors were induced as well as a number of genes          induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF Genes not          shown in the figure can be seen in the tabdelimited text          files of the raw or filtered data                          ActAdependent cytoplasmic motility of L          monocytogenesdoes not appear to induce de novohost          transcription          Two primary methods were used to compare differences          in gene expression between wildtype and mutant          infections direct subtractive comparisons of mutant from          wild type and SAM analysis of the  and hour time          points as single classes All analyses of wildtype and          mutant time courses presented here were carried out on          the parallel time courses where the variability of          conditions was limited as much as possible No genes          appeared to be significantly induced by any single          genotype of           L monocytogenes  according to          either method of analysis We also used a variety of          additional approaches to search for genes differentially          affected by the mutants Primarily this included setting          filters for experimental time points with Microsoft          Excel asking for genes that were expressed more highly          in one case than another for example wildtype T          greater than mutant T or combinations such as          wildtype T greater than both ActA and PrfA T and          so on These methods were used to ensure that the          statistical and mathematical criteria were not being          influenced by the presence of any bad spot on the          microarrays causing us to miss an important gene To our          surprise we were unable to identify genes or clusters          that could be considered either motilityspecific or          specific to the presence of cytoplasmic bacteria by any          statistical method or filtering criterion          Many proteins directly involved in the actinbased          motility of           L monocytogenes have been          identified by biochemical and cell biological methods            We carefully examined the transcriptional responses          for genes encoding these motilityrelated proteins to          determine whether we might be overlooking interesting but          subtle changes in expression levels as a result of the          stringency of our statistical criteria Figure           bottom They are contrasted with genes involved in other          aspects of actincytoskeletal dynamics which did change          at least threefold at some time point in some infection          Figure  top It is immediately apparent that no genes          encoding proteins known to be involved in           L monocytogenes actinbased          motility are induced by infection                          No detectable transcriptional response to          cytoplasmic bacteria or virulence factors expressed          during entry          We were surprised to discover that virtually all of          the transcriptional response to           L monocytogenes infection of these          cells results from what is apparently the initial          interaction of the bacteria with the cell surface          regardless of virulence phenotype           prfA mutant bacteria could still be          seen associated with cells by phasecontrast microscopy          at  hours postinfection Figure d albeit at much          lower levels than wildtype or           actA bacteria as they were no          longer replicating It is not surprising that these          bacteria are adherent as InlA expression is only partly          dependent on PrfA   No actin structures were seen in          association with these bacteria implying that they were          indeed deficient in virulence gene expression and failed          to escape from the endosomes Figure d          By the same sets of criteria described above for          studying the difference between wildtype and           actA infections we examined          whether there were any genes reproducibly induced by          cytoplasmic bacteria wildtype or           actA  but not by the avirulent          organism            prfA  In this dataset no genes          passed these criteria during the first  hours of          infection It is likely that differences in the          transcriptional program would emerge at later stages of          infection as wildtype and           actA bacteria replicate and kill          the cells and           prfA do not                          The innate immune response of Caco cells occurs          independently of hostcell differentiation or of          bacterial genotype          We were interested to determine whether changes in          gene transcription levels correlated with changes in          protein expression We chose to look at Gro MSGA          production and secretion as it appeared to be one of the          most highly induced chemokines at the RNA level Figures            and is known to be a target of NFB activation            Indeed at  hours postinfection Gro was          induced as measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay          ELISA and was detected at similar levels in the          supernatants following infections with each of the three          genotypes tested as predicted by the array experiments          Figure a As infections were most efficient in          subconfluent Caco cells which do not have          differentiated apical and basolateral surfaces we chose          these conditions for our microarray experiments with the          goal of inducing as much actinbased motility as          possible However given the robust NFBdependent          response we saw from all three bacterial genotypes we          were interested to know whether the response we detected          might depend on the differentiation state of the host          cells          One might expect that polarized intestinal epithelial          cells would not react strongly to the presence of          bacteria on the apical surface where bacteria are          concentrated in the gut but that the basolateral          surface which           in vivo should encounter bacteria          only when epithelial integrity is breached might be more          sensitive We therefore compared the responses of          polarized cells to encounters with wildtype bacteria at          either the apical or basolateral membranes Caco cells          were grown as confluent monolayers on transwell filters          and tightjunction formation was confirmed by the          inability of inulin to diffuse from the apical to the          basolateral surface Despite infecting the polarized          monolayers at relatively high multiplicity of infection          MOI with wildtype           L monocytogenes strain S we          were not able to detect any intracellular bacteria by          either phasecontrast or fluorescence microscopy We          found however that the polarized cells secreted Gro          in response to exposure to wildtype bacteria at either          the apical or basolateral surface with most of the Gro          secreted from the basolateral membrane Figure b          Surprisingly the apical surface appeared to be most          sensitive to the presence of bacteria but this could be          explained by the fact that the membrane supporting the          basolateral cell surface reduced the amount of surface          area available for receptor expression It is also          possible that a very small amount of lipotechoic acid          LTA is penetrating the confluent monolayer thus          stimulating a response from the basolateral surface We          reproducibly demonstrated that our monolayers permitted          less than  inulin diffusion one standard for          polarization of Caco cells however this may not have          been sufficient to completely block LTA diffusion          We also found that Gro expression was not affected          the presence or absence of serum during these infections          implying that the events stimulated by the bacteria are          occurring primarily through interactions with          cellsurface moieties on both the bacteria and the host          cells Gro expression was also detected in response to          heatkilled bacteria data not shown confirming that          intracellular infection is not required for activation of          the pathway for Gro expression                            Discussion                  Cultured intestinal epithelial cell lines mount an          innate immune response to infection by L          monocytogenes          In this report we describe the transcriptional          response of human intestinal epithelial cells to          infection by both pathogenic and nonpathogenic           Listeria monocytogenes  Using cDNA          microarrays of  human cDNAs we have examined          transcriptional responses of Caco cells to wildtype          and mutant bacteria The predominant response has          pervasive similarities to the transcriptional program          mediated by the NFB system This response is not          specific to intestinal epithelial cells as a similar          suite of genes is induced in promyelocytic THP cells          infected by wildtype           L monocytogenes for  hours            Nor is it specific to infection by           L monocytogenes  for example          recent experiments using peripheral blood mononuclear          cells PBMCs have shown a similar response on exposure          to a variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes            The number of activated and repressed genes in the          PBMC experiments is higher than we have found here          perhaps reflecting the nature of a more professional or          specialized immune response It is also important to note          that the microarrays Lymphochips used in the PBMC          experiments were carefully designed to encompass all of          the genes known to be involved in the NFB pathway and          therefore may simply represent a more complete          dataset          In light of recent developments in understanding the          biology of Tolllike receptors the NFBdominated          responses we observe fit well within a model in which          undifferentiated subconfluent Caco cells can recognize          Grampositive cellsurface moieties and induce what is          termed an innate immune response The Tolllike          receptor family   which has evolutionary roots          throughout invertebrate metazoans for patternbased          recognition of bacterial and fungal cellsurface          components   activate NFB through convergent          pathways involving the IL receptorassociated kinase          IRAK the adaptor protein MyD TRAF NFBinducing          kinase NIK and IB kinase Ik   The Tolllike          receptors TLR and TLR are known to be present on a          number of different human intestinal epithelial cells          including primary cells H and Caco cells              In addition TLR has recently been shown to signal          in response to bacterial flagellin from both          Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria in a          MyDdependent manner   and TLR is constitutively          expressed on primary intestinal epithelium                            Caco cells respond similarly to infection by          pathogenic and nonpathogenic L monocytogenes          A critical property of the intestinal epithelium is          the ability to distinguish between pathogenic and          nonpathogenic bacteria and under stress to flush          pathogens from the lumen of the intestine           In vivo  intestinal cells are          specially adapted to coexist with very high          concentrations of commensal bacteria In the case of          newborn mice there appears to be an innate ability to          develop commensal relationships with microbes A recent          report indicates that during the development of          hostmicrobial interactions essentially no          proinflammatory or innate immune responses are detected          as the intestines of germfree mice become colonized            In contrast infection of the intestinal epithelium          by pathogenic bacteria elicits a strong inflammatory          response that includes disruption of the epithelial layer          by mechanisms of both cytopathicity and apoptosis            Intraepithelial lymphocytes lELs and          polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMNs which reside in the          epithelial mucosa are recruited to damaged regions          Indeed neutrophils are critical for controlling          infections by           L monocytogenes in a mouse model             NFB has an important role in the          proinflammatory process in the gut and chemokines and          cytokines involved in establishing an inflammatory or          immune response have also been implicated             Our results are in broad agreement with these studies          with respect to the central role of NFB in response to          infection but are also puzzling because we would not          expect intestinal cells to respond so strongly to the          presence of avirulent or heatkilled bacteria even when          presented on the apical surface of a confluent polarized          monolayer regardless of the presence or absence of          serum The mechanism of intestinal epithelial cell          discrimination between pathogens and nonpathogens           in vivo is unknown We assume that          the response we see in Caco cells is one that          intestinal epithelial cells are intrinsically capable of          mounting           in vivo as well as           in vitro  but that           in vivo there are other factors          which may contribute to the paucity or severity of the          response Other cell types may be able to better          distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic           L monocytogenes  for example          expression of the virulence factor LLO the hemolysin          responsible in part for invasion of           L monocytogenes into the host cell          cytoplasm is necessary for           L monocytogenes to activate          neutrophils   stimulate prolonged TNF production by          macrophages    and induce NFB nuclear          translocation and cytokine secretion by HUVEC human          vascular endothelial cells    It is possible that          intestinal cells are programmed for a more general          response and that controlling the severity of the          response is the critical level of regulation In the          intact intestine communication between intestinal          epithelial cells and resident immune cells may serve to          modulate the initial innate immune response mounted by          the epithelial cells                          Actinbased motility of L monocytogenesdoes not          induce a specific transcriptional response in infected          epithelial cells          Under the conditions tested we found little          difference between responses to wildtype and mutant          infections indicating that nearly all the          transcriptional response we observed was due to the          initial contact between bacteria and the hostcell          surface Detailed comparisons of the response to          wildtype and           actA mutant infections were          designed to uncover geneexpression programs specific to          the motility phase of the infection when bacterially          directed actin polymerization is induced to move the          bacteria through the cytoplasm While subtle          geneexpression responses were highly sensitive to          changes in culture conditions remarkably we found no          convincing evidence for a geneexpression response          specifically induced by entry of           L monocytogenes into the cytosol          or by bacterial subversion of the cells actin          cytoskeleton We cannot rule out the possibility that          specific alterations in hostcell transcription may have          subtle effects by altering the stoichiometry of molecules          involved in actinbased motility but we are not able to          detect such subtle changes using the methods described          here It remains possible that specific genes not present          on the microarrays used here representing about half the          human genome may be induced by actinbased motility but          it is nonetheless clear that bacterial subversion of the          actin cytoskeleton does not result in any largescale          coordinated transcriptional response          This result is exciting from the biochemical          perspective of actinbased motility although          disappointing with respect to discovery of novel genes          involved in the process We conclude that any cellular          alteration required for this dynamic actin polymerization          in an infected cell is supported posttranscriptionally          certainly with respect to known cytoskeletal genes and          that bacterial regulation of cellular systems required          for motility is therefore probably mediated by          biochemical events Although studies of global          transcriptional changes in both host cell and bacterial          pathogens have proved powerful tools in the study of          hostpathogen interactions they cannot fruitfully assist          investigation of these types of events                            Materials and methods                  Cell culture          The human cells used for all infections were Caco          ATCCHTB For microarray experiments cells were          maintained as a nonpolarized subconfluent population          All infections were performed on subconfluent cells that          were passaged between  and  times after arrival from          ATCC original stock was p Cells were grown in          Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium DME

All time courses were subject to identical infection          protocols Subconfluent monolayers of Caco cells were          infected with wildtype or mutant bacteria at an MOI of          approximately  Bacteria were grown overnight at room          temperature to promote flagellar assembly and          extracellular motility before infection and the OD            was monitored for MOI          normalization Typically bacterial cultures were in late          log phase after  h OD            around  Before infection          monolayers were rinsed  with DME containing no          antibiotics and left in DME   FBS PS for at          least  h After normalization for MOI bacteria were          pelleted at low speed IEC centra  rpm for           min and resuspended in DME   FBS Concentrated          bacteria were diluted into DME   FBS and distributed          to antibioticfree Caco monolayers Infections were          initiated for  min after which cellfree bacteria were          rinsed away by washing gx and then continued in DME            FBS After  h gentamycin was added at  gml to          kill any remaining extracellular bacteria Mock          infections were carried out in parallel omitting          bacteria at the time of inoculation          It should be noted that on a very small scale          infections may be more precisely synchronized by spinning          the bacteria down onto the target cells and washing soon          after Under these conditions differences in response to          the mutants might be teased out with more time point          measurements Although the sensitivity and reliability of          both mRNA amplification and detection have improved          immensely in the last few years these methods were not          possible at the time of our microarray analysis making          centrifugationmediated infections impossible                          Time courses          Infections were carried out under the guidelines of a          single protocol and several different experiments were          performed Four individual h time courses were carried          out at different times Two h wildtype time courses          and two h           actA time courses were initially          examined The time points for each of these were               and  min In addition a single          experiment was performed where a mock infection          wildtype           actA and           prfA mutants were all compared          under the same conditions For this parallel experiment          three independent mRNA samples were prepared before          infection for the zero time point for the purpose of          averaging during timezero transformation of the data          see Data extraction and analysis For the parallel time          course    and  min time points were measured          At each time point cells were lysed directly in the          culture dishes for mRNA isolation using oligodT binding          buffer

Cells used for infections and mRNA isolations were          seeded into dishes containing    mm coverslips At          each time point during a time course coverslips were          removed and fixed with  formaldehyde in PBS for           min Coverslips were washed  with PBS and stored at          room temperature before staining Rhodamine phalloidin          was used to stain and visualize actin structures in the          cell   Cells on coverslips were permeabilized and          blocked with PBS containing  mgml BSA Sigma and           Triton X Sigma for  h Cells were stained          with the above blocking buffer containing  gml          rhodamine phalloidin for  h and rinsed  with PBS          Coverslips were inverted and placed on  l sterile          glycerol on a glass microscope slide and sealed with          nail polish Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioplan           fluorescence microscope equipped with a Princeton          Instruments CCD camera and Metamorph imaging software          All images were initially acquired with a  objective          and multiplied  by the CCD camera for  final          magnification Phase and epifluorescence images were          acquired simultaneously                          cDNA microarrays          The microarrays used in these experiments were          generated in the Brown and Botstein laboratories at          Stanford University using standard techniques   All          experiments were performed with KSH arrays containing          spots representing  human transcripts and ESTs          from a number of different print runs The print list for          our data can be seen at   and print run cDNA          qualitycontrol information is archived at   The raw          data from these experiments including information about          genes present on these arrays and the array images can          be viewed searched or downloaded from the supplementary          website   which includes limited public

can be found at the Brown          laboratory website   cDNA from experimental samples          was generated by reverse transcription in the presence of          Cy dUTP and was mixed with a reference pool of cDNA          derived from  different cell lines Brown laboratory          control reference E labeled with Cy dUTP The          mixture of Cy and Cylabeled cDNA was hybridized to          PCRbased cDNA microarrays containing  genes          Microarrays were scanned using an Axon Instruments          twochannel scanner  nm and  nm and spots were          defined with GenePix  Pro software Axon          Instruments                          Data extraction and analysis          Termed the type II experimental approach          measurements for each gene during each condition were          made relative to a constant reference pool All          subsequent analysis was performed on log            of the ratio CyCy For all          arrays red and green channels were normalized by the          medians of the distribution of spot intensities and          transformed to the zero time point of each individual          time course Time zero transformation was carried out by          subtracting the log            ratio of the zero time point for          each gene from each time point in the time course By          subtracting the log            ratio of the zero time point from          each point in the time course one effectively eliminates          the reference from the analysis for example for the h          time point log            T            redREFgreen  log            T            redREFgreen  log            T            redT            red For the parallel time course          three zero timepoint measurements were averaged before          subtraction The behavior of each gene over the time          course of the experiment is presented as the relative          change from its own zero time point          Before statistical or simple mathematical comparison          of wildtype and mutant infections the dataset from the          parallel time course was filtered such that only genes          changing at least threefold at some point during the time          courses log            T           n T             of  were included for further          consideration          Significance analysis of microarrays SAM was applied          to both the parallel and individual datasets Both a          webbased version and an Excel macro containing the          algorithm for SAM are available for download to academic          users at   For wildtype and mutant comparisons of          the parallel time course the  and h time points were          grouped as single classes This analysis tests only for          genes induced specifically by wild type but not by mutant          infections at both  and h time points For the           actA analysis the wildtype and           prfA were grouped as a single          class For the           prfA analysis wildtype and           actA were a single class For          individual timecourse analysis which later included the          parallel time course indvidual time points remained as          single classes          Data were further analyzed by filtering with Microsoft          Excel thresholding many combinations of time points and          subsequently clustering for example the log            T           n T             for wildtype time points  and           h must both be greater than  and all other  and          h time points must have a logratio less than

analysis It should be noted that many of the original          printed spots on the arrays were ESTs which belong to a          new UniGene cluster It is possible that spots on these          arrays have been renamed since the data were analyzed for          this manuscript and we therefore recommend that if the          reader has a real interest in any particular gene that          they go to the Stanford Microarray Database    and          carefully examine the data as it stands today The raw          and filtered data are available in tabdelimited text          format which can be opened

  Caco cells were plated at high density    per          well on  m pore size transwell filters  cm          diameter and allowed to polarize for  weeks To test          for tightjunction formation  Hinulin was added to          the medium on the apical surface with cellfree  m          filters as a control for rapid diffusion Samples of           l from both apical and basolateral supernatants

Supernatants from infected cultures were harvested at          each time point and frozen before ELISA analysis Gro          Quantikine ELISA kit was purchased from RD Systems          and protocol was followed according to the manufacturers          instructions In each case reactions were stopped at           min and A            was measured on a fluorescence          plate reader The data shown are in absorbance units not          absolute quantities of Gro and have been normalized to          total volumes from the experiment but not cell number          used during the infections the
