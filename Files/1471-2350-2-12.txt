                    Background        Celiac disease CD is a common familial autoimmune        gastrointestinal disease It is caused by sensitivity to        the dietary protein gluten which is present in wheat rye        and barley Symptoms include growth failure abdominal        pain and diarrhea Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous        manifestation of CD Complications of CD include lymphoma        osteoporosis anemia and seizures The prevalence of CD in        the US is     and the ratio of symptomatic to        asymptomatic cases is between  and      Before        the advent of serological testing for diagnosing CD it was        considered a rare disease in the US        The clinical standard for diagnosis of CD is a small        intestinal biopsy showing villus atrophy and resolution of        symptoms on a glutenfree diet However small intestinal        biopsy is expensive invasive and often rejected by the US        patient population The serological IgA endomysial antibody        EMA test is a screening tool that has greatly facilitated        evaluation for CD in people with suggestive symptoms and in        highrisk populations IgA EMA testing has proven to be        greater than  sensitive for adults and children with        classic symptomatic CD           and greater        than  specific in controls without known clinical        disease      It is therefore an inexpensive and        specific method of screening family members for genetic        studies Moreover a recent study has identified        symptomatic EMA positive individuals who have CD in whom        intestinal biopsies were normal with only minor mucosal        lesions All the patients showed clinical and serological        recovery on a glutenfree diet They propose that        serologic criteria may be more definitive in the        diagnostic process than traditional biopsy criteria                   CD has a strong genetic association with the HLA class        II DQ genotype composed of the DQA and DQB alleles            However the HLA association alone is insufficient        to explain the hereditary nature of the disease and is        estimated to explain less than half the sibling risk               There appears to be genetic heterogeneity        implying that more than one additional gene is involved in        the disease With current analysis software it is possible        to map complex traits like CD where several genetic loci        are probably involved and the mode of inheritance is        unclear        One first step to identifying genes predisposing to CD        is to investigate candidate genes Likely candidates        include the classes of genes involved in immune function        eg Tcell receptor TCR genes and immunemodulating        genes Other candidate genes are those from associated        independent diseases in which there is a higher rate of CD        than in the general population eg other autoimmune        diseases such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus        IDDM These associations may be explained by common        genes responsible for both diseases or the diseases may        share a similar autoimmune pathogenic mechanism            There have been several European studies to localize genes        for CD but no significant evidence for linkage has been        reported other than at HLA                            In this first study of families with CD from North        America we investigated linkage to several candidate genes        that could play a role in the pathogenesis of CD using         families with at least two cases of CD                    Methods                  Ascertainment of families with CD          Families with at least two cases of CD or dermatitis          herpetiformis were ascertained through local          gastroenterologists gluten intolerance support groups          and advertising at local and national celiac disease          support meetings There was no selection of cases based          on sex or race although all individuals were Caucasian          None of the families appear to be related The research          study was approved by the University of Utah Health          Sciences Center Institutional Review Board Participants          ranged in age from  years to  years Blood samples          were collected from affected individuals and their          firstdegree relatives For more distantly related cases          we also collected blood from individuals that are          connections between the cases For example for two          affected grandchildren with different parents and an          affected grandparent we would collect samples from the          grandchildren their parents and the grandparent The          breakdown of the affected individuals is shown in Table                                    Diagnostic criteria          Medical records were obtained to confirm previous          biopsyproven CD or dermatitis herpetiformis IgA EMA          testing was performed for participants who did not have a          biopsy proven diagnosis of CD or dermatitis          herpetiformis Since IgA EMA is highly sensitive and          specific for CD we did not require biopsy confirmation          for phenotype assignment          IgA EMA was measured by indirect immunofluorescence          using primate smooth muscle IMCO Diagnostics Buffalo          New York as substrate     IgA EMA titers greater          than or equal to  were considered positive Limiting          dilution was performed on the positive sera                          Genotyping at short tandem repeat markers          STRs          DNA was extracted from lymphocytes using PureGene DNA          isolation kits Gentra Systems Inc HLA DQA and DQB          genotypes were determined as described in Feolo et al              Genotyping of DNA samples from  affected          individuals their parents and any connecting relatives          from  families was performed with  markers at           candidate gene regions and  markers at HLA However all          families were not genotyped with all markers because          some families were collected after genotyping had been          done for some of the STRs The candidate gene regions          markers and chromosomal locations are listed in Table           For all markers amplification of  ng genomic DNA in a          total reaction mix of  l was performed according to          standard PCR procedures with minor modifications to          optimize product clarity Genotyping was performed either          using an ABI or radioactively using polyacrylamide          gels Genotypic data were stored in the same database as          all kindred and phenotype information                          Linkage analysis methods          Analyses were performed using dominant and recessive          genetic models each with  liability classes of either          affected or unknownunaffected based on diagnostic          criteria Table  For each model unaffected          individuals and individuals with serology or biopsy based          diagnosis were given a penetrance function based on          disease prevalence For linkage analysis we used the          FASTLINK    implementation of the LINKAGE program              for twopoint analysis and the GENEHUNTER          program    for both parametric and nonparametric          NPL multipoint analyses Twopoint linkage in the          presence of locus heterogeneity was assessed by the          admixture test of Ott using HOMOG     We used a          heterogeneity LOD HLOD of   to indicate nominal          evidence for linkage for all linkage analyses                                         Results        Candidate genes were selected based on function of those        genes ie Tcell receptors         CTLA and         CD  or from loci of associated        diseases ie IDDM Although associated diseases were        not considered in the selection of families in several        families members had IDDM In one family a CD case his        sibling and  extended relatives had IDDM in a second        family the CD case had IDDM in a third family the        mother  siblings a daughter and a cousin of a CD case        had IDDM and in a fourth family the sister of a CD case        had IDDM        The highest point HLOD scores obtained with either        model are shown in Table  The multipoint HLODs were        obtained using the same model as the point HLOD shown        The largest twopoint and multipoint LOD scores were        obtained in the HLA region Under the dominant model the        twopoint HLOD was     at DS position         cM the multipoint HLOD was     position         cM and the NPL was  p  position        cM The estimate for the proportion of families linked        was  for the multipoint HLOD suggesting that        approximately half of the families are linked to an HLA        susceptibility locus for CD Of the  candidate gene        regions investigated none of the regions had even nominal        evidence for linkage HLOD   or an NPL score with p                             Discussion        In this study we examined linkage to a set of candidate        genes for CD This subset of genes was selected based on        genes that could be related to CD through function or an        associated disease For statistical and linkage analysis of        complex diseases we used general recessive and dominant        models Several biostatisticians have suggested that        general models provide power to distinguish linkage signals        independent of the true underlying disease mode of        inheritance provided both dominant and recessive models        are used       As expected the highest twopoint        and multipoint LOD scores were obtained in the HLA region        with a twopoint HLOD of  and a multipoint HLOD of         This result replicates the known association and linkage of        HLA to CD      and demonstrates the power of the        family resource to detect linkage in the set of candidate        gene markers        We were interested in identifying nonHLA loci for        celiac disease We were unable to detect even nominal        evidence for linkage at any of the loci investigated For        those regions where we examined only  marker it may be        that one marker was insufficient in order to detect linkage        even if it existed A number of candidate genes        investigated in this study were examined previously in        European populations Our results are in agreement with        previous linkage andor association studies of CD and        Tcell receptor genes TCR TCR TCR and TCR where        they saw no evidence for linkage or association although        sample sizes were small              CD and         CTLA two genes encoding receptors        that regulate Tlymphocyte activation are located at q        Holopainen et al    reported linkage and association to        this region in a study of  Finnish families with CD        which may suggest a possible founder effect in these        families In a casecontrol study the         CTLA polymorphism AG was        significantly associated with CD p   with an odds        ratio of   confidence interval             We did not find evidence for linkage with the         CTLA polymorphism        Genomic searches for CD have been conducted in several        European populations In  Zhong et al    studied         affected sib pairs from  families and reported        significant linkage at p and weak evidence at p        q cen q q p and q Houlston        et al     studying  families found significant        evidence for linkage to HLA but no evidence for linkage to        the regions suggested by Zhong except at q where         IDDM is localized Greco et al        conducted a genomewide search with  sib pairs and an        additional  pairs in regions of interest     They        found significant evidence for linkage at HLA and nominal        evidence for linkage on qter and  qter Using an        independent set of  sibpairs they reported additional        linkage evidence at q     King et al           performed a genomewide search with  CD families and        reported nominal evidence for linkage at q and        q In a followup study with  families King et al           reported heterogeneity LOD scores   at         regions including p previously reported by Zhong et        al     From these studies the only region with at        least nominal evidence for linkage which overlapped with        the candidate regions studied here was at         IDDM at q One study reported        possible evidence for linkage     one reported weak        evidence     and two reported no linkage             We were unable to detect linkage                    Conclusions        Our significant evidence of linkage to HLA replicates        the known linkage and association of HLA with CD In our        families likely candidate genesloci did not explain the        susceptibility to CD It may be that these genesloci are        not involved in CD that we had insufficient genotyping        within regions or that one or a number of these genes        has a small effect so that we were unable to detect linkage        with our set of families We were unable to detect linkage        at         IDDM and at         CTLA for which positive linkages        were previously reported This is similar to the experience        in most other reported studies of celiac disease        Nonreplication of linkage results in complex diseases is        common and may be due to the low power of studies to        detect genes of relatively small effect andor to a high        degree of genetic heterogeneity among families Larger data        sets with more power likely are needed in order to find        strong evidence for
