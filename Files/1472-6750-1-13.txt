                    Introduction        The RNA polymerase from bacteriophage T has a        relatively narrow specificity for a particular promoter        sequence making it an extremely useful tool for molecular        biology and biotechnology applications Most recently the        crystal structure of the polymerase in complex with a DNA        promoter has revealed the structural basis for this        specificity      In addition a number of researchers        have examined the contribution of various nucleotides and        functional groups in the promoter and various amino acids        in the polymerase to specificity       Based upon        both structural and mutagenic analyses it has proven        possible to identify polymerase variants with altered        specificities for promoters      Polymerase variants        with altered specificities have also been identified using        genetic selections     However the variant polymerases        and variant promoters that have so far been identified are        close in sequence to the wildtype For example the only        known polymerase variant that switches promoters contains a        single amino acid change recognizes a single nucleotide        change in the promoter and closely mimics interactions        known to occur for T RNA polymerase     The large        sequence space that surrounds both polymerases and        promoters has so far prevented more sweeping searches for        more diverse variants To address this problem we have        developed a combined         in vitro          in vivo selection method based on T        RNA polymerase autogene construct that allows large            libraries of T RNA polymerase variants to be        efficiently searched for specificity mutants The method is        novel in that it allows selection of polymerases based on        their         in vivo enzymatic activity is        generalizable and may have applications for other        polymerase phenotypes such as intracellular solubility or        thermostability                    Results and Discussion        Our combined         in vitro          in vivo selection scheme was designed        to foster the selfamplification of novel polymerase        variants Figure  The T RNA polymerase gene was linked        to a T RNA polymerase promoter creating a socalled        autogene     whose activity can be initiated by the        basal level expression of polymerase in the cell Upon        transformation into         E coli the autogene engendered the        production of large amounts of T RNA polymerase Figure         However when the polymerase was cloned adjacent to        mutant T RNA polymerase promoters little T RNA        polymerase expression was observed We reasoned that any        polymerase variant that could recognize the mutant promoter        would reestablish the feedback loop and concomitantly lead        not only to high protein expression levels but also to        high mRNA expression levels In consequence mRNA extracted        from a population of cells transformed with a polymerase        library should represent polymerase variants in rough        proportion to their ability to utilize the mutant promoter        These mRNAs could be amplified en masse recloned and        retransformed into         E coli Multiple cycles of selection        and amplification should ultimately lead to the        accumulation of those polymerase variants that were most        successful at facilitating their own expression        Of course high level expression of any protein product        can potentially be detrimental to cell growth which would        undermine the proposed selection In order to evaluate the        effect of toxicity of autogene on the selection process        the effect of the wildtype autogene construct pETTpT        on cell growth was studied before and after induction with        IPTG Figure  These initial studies showed that the        wildtype autogene did not affect cellular viability for at        least  hours after induction with IPTG Therefore we        reasoned that isolating the mRNA after an hour of induction        should not drastically affect the selection process        We initially searched for polymerase variants that could        utilize a promoter variant in which there was a G to C        change at position  This mutation resembles the        bacteriophage T promoter A single asparagine to aspartate        substitution at position  in T RNA polymerase was        already known to facilitate the utilization of the Tlike        promoter     A library of polymerase variants was        constructed in which amino acid residues   and         were completely randomized While we expected to obtain        sequence changes primarily at position  randomization        of residues  and  served as respectively positive        and negative controls for the experiment Residue  is        normally an arginine that interacts with the guanosine            at position  and should remain unchanged following        selection Residue  is a leucine residue that does not        make direct contacts to the promoter We therefore expected        that the leucine should vary during the course of the        selection or that one of six different leucine codons        might be chosen        The library of polymerase variants was cloned behind the        Tlike promoter and three rounds of selection and        amplification as described in Figure  were carried out        In each round at least  individual variants were        examined a number that encompassed a large fraction of the        possible variants  The progress of the selection        was monitored in two ways first the autogene constructs        were under the control of the lac repressor and we had        previously noted that complete depression of the wildtype        autogene by IPTG led to cell death Therefore the fraction        of colonies that were lost on replica plating to IPTG was        assumed to be proportional to the accumulation of active        autogene variants Second the number of PCR cycles that        were required to amplify recovered mRNA molecules was        assumed to follow the amount of mRNA that was produced in a        given round of selection Both of these variables showed        substantial improvement following two rounds of selection        but less improvement following three rounds for example        the proportion of IPTGsensitive colonies was  after one        round of selection  after two rounds and  after        three rounds The selection was therefore deemed to be        essentially complete following round three        Active polymerase variants were identified cloned and        sequenced following each round of selection As can be seen        in Table  the selection not only quickly reestablished        the wildtype amino acids at positions  arginine and         leucine but also converged on the known ND        change indicating that the combined         in vitro          in vivo selection method was working        as desired It is likely that the ND substitution that        arose in the first generation was passed to subsequent        generations since there was no variation in the codons        TTAG associated with this gene during the course of the        selection        Interestingly while the ND substitution eventually        dominates the selection a NQ substitution was also        prevalent in Round  The mutant is known to be able to        recognize the Tlike promoter    albeit less well than        the ND substitution Thus our selection scheme not only        identifies functional polymerases but the selected        population seems to represent variants in proportion to        their functionality        To examine a wider range of promoter and polymerase        combinations a promoter library was constructed in which        positions  through  in the promoter were completely        randomized each of these nucleotides had previously been        shown to be extremely important for the specificity of        interactions with T RNA polymerase               Conversely residues Asn  Arg  and Gln  were        known to form sequence specific contacts with this region        of the promoter     The promoter library was combined        with the gene library in order to create approximately             combinations of promoters and        polymerases The joint promoterpolymerase library was        transformed into         E coli and variants were again        selected according to their transcript representation        following RT  PCR amplification To begin each new cycle        the polymerase variants were recloned behind the promoter        library        The success of an individual polymerase variant relied        upon either being able to utilize several different        promoters in different rounds a generalist strategy or        upon being very active with the same promoter in different        rounds a specialist strategy Given the number of        promoter variants  the number of possible polymerase        variants  and the number of transformants that were        assessed in each round     it is likely that        there was a population bottleneck during the first round of        selection However selected polymerase variants should        have had access to all possible promoters following the        first round        After three cycles of selection and amplification there        was still some diversity in the population Table  but        after four cycles a single variant QC had largely        established itself The QC variant was frequently found        adjacent to the wildtype T RNA polymerase promoter GACT        at positions  through  but was also found adjacent to        a single mutant promoter GAC         G  double mutant promoters GA         TA  G         T C         A  a triple mutant promoter G         TTA  and a promoter in which all the        residues differed from wildtype          TGTA  Overall the generalist        polymerase appeared to prefer mutant promoters that        contained a T at position  and G or A at  positions        The QC mutant has previously been assayed for its        activity at position  with different bases and was shown        to prefer G or A at  compared to the wild type promoter        T     This finding was further borne out in our        experiments the QCGAC         G polymerasepromoter combination        yielded substantially more T RNA polymerase as judged by        gel electrophoresis than did QCGACT wt Figure        a        Another mutant polymerase R selected from round        three differed from the wildtype at all the three amino        acid positions NA RM QS Despite the fact that        this variant was extremely novel it was nonetheless        completely functional and yielded as much or more        polymerase expression when paired with its promoter G         GTA than did the wild type polymerase        paired with the wild type promoter GACT Figure b The        ability to use this triple mutant promoter had not        previously been observed To further explore the apparent        change in promoter specificity of this polymerase we        carried out an additional screen in which R was again        cloned adjacent to the library of promoter mutations and        replicaplated colonies that grew poorly or not at all upon        IPTG induction indicating polymerase overproduction were        picked and sequenced In addition to the original promoter        G         GTA  two other promoters          T A         TA and         TGTA  were identified It is        interesting that all of the promoters derived from the        screen have a cytidine to thymidine substitution at        position  and a thymidine to adenosine substitution at        position  This combination of residues has not        previously been shown to yield an active T RNA polymerase        promoter Consonant with our genetic screen the R        polymerase paired with each of the three promoters appeared        to yield as much or more T RNA polymerase as did wildtype        autogene paired with the wildtype promoter Figure b        Previous studies of T promoter recognition         in vitro have indicated that the        wildtype T RNA polymerase does not tolerate mutations        well particularly at positions  to  in the T        promoter      In agreement with these studies we        found no mutant promoters that could apparently pair with        the wildtype polymerase see Table         It is becoming increasingly clear that some protein        phenotypes can only be accessed by simultaneously        generating a large number of mutations               However conventional directed evolution and screening        techniques typically examine proteins that contain only one        or two amino acid substitutions For example the        incorporation of single base pair substitutions in the        promoter has identified nucleotides critical for polymerase        recognition but did not identify novel promoter        specificities     Similarly a series of polymerases        having all possible amino acid substitutions at position         were screened along with all possible single base pair        substitutions at positions  through  of the promoter        region     While the functional importance of the        nucleotides and amino acid residues was confirmed no new        promoter specificities were identified Our combined         in vitro          in vivo selection technique allows        the examination of a relatively large number of polymerase        sequence variants and has discovered promoter and enzyme        variants that would likely never have been observed by        rational mutagenesis or more limited screens        On the basis of the known crystal structure of T RNA        polymerase bound to a  basepair doublestranded        promoter sequence it appears that T promoter recognition        occurs largely through direct or watermediated hydrogen        bonding     The identities of at least some of the        selected mutants can be rationalized on the basis of the        known proteinDNA contacts For example residue N        recognizes G in the nontemplate strand via both direct        and indirect hydrogen bonds the ND substitution has        previously been hypothesized to form an alternate        hydrogenbonding network with the GC substitution            Similarly in the wildtype polymerase residue Q        makes a direct hydrogen bond to the adenosine at position         in the template strand The generalist polymerase        contains the single QC substitution and the shorter        cysteine residue may allow or at the least not interfere        with a larger range of nucleic acid interactions However        the selected substitutions cannot always be conveniently        rationalized the R mutant differs from the wildtype        T RNA polymerase at all the three amino acid positions        NA RM QS replacing some amino acids with        hydrophobic residues that do not likely form specific        hydrogenbonding interactions Moreover it is likely that        the promoter recognition differs during different stages of        transcription initiation      and it is unclear what        particular contacts are made during open and closed complex        formation and during productive versus abortive        initiation Additional characterization of the kinetics and        mechanism of the apparently altered promoter specificities        will be required before more secure models can be put        forth        Combined         in vitro          in vivo selections should generally        prove to be useful for altering the properties of many        molecular biology enzymes For example a compartmentalized        selfreplication has been reported for the selection of        thermostable variants of Taq DNA polymerase     This        method is similar to ours except that instead of        collecting mRNAs from intact cells the cellular test        tubes expressing Taq polymerase are first embedded in        waterinoil emulsions and lysed prior to recovery of        functional genes These methods are nicely complementary        our method potentially allows for in vivo properties to be        optimized eg the selection of strong cellular        promoters while cellular emulsion allows for         in vitro properties to be optimized        eg the utilization of unnatural nucleotides that might        not be taken up by cells Both methods allow similarly        large numbers of mutational variants to be simultaneously        compared and competed and both methods can potentially be        adapted to a range of molecular biology enzymes that act on        their own templates such as restriction endonucleases or        DNA ligases                    Conclusions        In this study we have developed a facile         in vitro          in vivo selection methodology using a        T RNA polymerase autogene to select polymerase variants        with apparently altered promoter specificities The        procedure allows large libraries of promoter variants to be        efficiently searched for their promoter recognition ability        in vivo The selection was successfully employed to        identify a mutant T RNA polymerase specialist which        could recognize and transcribe a Tlike promoter a        polymerase generalist which was able to recognize a        variety of T promoters and a novel RNA polymerase with an        apparently new promoter specificity The method can        potentially be adapted to evolve other polymerases with        novel phenotypes                    Materials and Methods                  Construction of the wild type autogene          Using plasmid pAR originally made by Studier et          al    and obtained from Dr David Hoffman          University of Texas at Austin as a template a  kb          fragment containing the T RNA polymerase gene was          amplified EcoRI and BsmBI restriction sites were added          during amplification The PCR product was cloned into the          vector pCR TA cloning kit Invitrogen Carlsbad CA          and then into plasmid pETa Novagen Madison WI          which contained the wildtype T RNA polymerase promoter          The wild type autogene thus obtained pETTpT was          transformed into strain HMS pLysS Novagen Madison          WI the same cell line Studier et al initially used to          express the autogene                              Construction of autogene libraries          Autogene libraries were constructed by first          generating vectors containing promoter mutations and          then ligating polymerase gene libraries into these          vectors A point mutation GC and the lac operator          region were introduced in and adjacent

      were in turn assembled by overlap PCR In the selection          in which both the promoter and the polymerase pool was          used T RNA polymerase was similarly randomized at amino

the possibility that wildtype RNA polymerases          could arise from vector background Unselected clones          from pools were sequenced and the distribution of random          sequence nucleotides was estimated to be  G  A           T and  C                          Selection and screening protocols          The autogene pool was transformed into DHlac pLysS          cells by electroporation The culture was incubated at          C for  hrs and T RNA polymerase expression was          induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of           mM After an hour of induction RNA was extracted using          the Masterpure RNA purification kit Epicenter          Technologies Madison WI The recovered mRNA was          reversetranscribed using AMVreverse transcriptase          Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc Newark NJ and the          primer gcpET The cDNA was then PCRamplified using the          primers gcTa and gcpET The PCR products were          gelpurified digested with AflII and EcoRI and cloned          back into the original autogene vector to form a          delimited autogene pool for subsequent rounds of          selection          A colony lift technique was used to monitor the          progress of the selection Cells containing active          autogene cease to grow when lifted to LB plates          containing IPTG Colonies from each round of selection          were lifted to plates containing IPTG using a butterfly          nitrcellulose membrane Midwest Scientific Valley Park          MO The plates were then incubated at C for  hrs          Clones that did not grow upon replating were picked from          the original plate          A similar protocol was used for the identification of          promoters that could be recognized by the R          polymerase In this instance the R polymerase gene          was first isolated via restriction digestion with AflII          and EcoRI cloned downstream of the T promoterpool and          the resultant promoter library was transformed as before          Colonies ca  were lifted to IPTG plates and          screened for their inability to thrive
