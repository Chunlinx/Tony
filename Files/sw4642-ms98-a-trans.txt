        i uh       try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of       repair actually uh that is really a sore spot with me i i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but uh like ten years ago um the reliability of automobiles at least US automobiles was pretty dismal and not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal and uh it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea   umhum yeah   but uh i   so do you have a car   pardon   do you have a car   well at that time actually i had a Volkswagen Rabbit   umhum   and um it was it it was a real lemon uh subsequently i got a uh Buick Century and it wasnt as bad   umhum   but uh last year i bought a Honda Accord and i take it in once every seventy five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it and its wonderful and   yeah we used to have a Honda Accord and theyre good theyre really good cars every time i get taken to an auto repair place you know every time i go i get taken bad you know woman goes in and they go all right we got a sucker   hm   lets get how see how much money we can get out of her you know thats what happens every time um so   hm hm so what do you what do you have   i have a Pontiac six thousand   all the more reason to uh have a a Honda   yep but our Honda just got old and just wore out it was eleven lets see eleven years old and it just just out of it so   so so you bought a Pontiac   no uhhuh my husband uh um exhusbands this this just happened couple of weeks ago hes my exhusband but just a few months ago when he was my husband um his father gave us this car and everything is wrong with it i mean the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks you know   now this what how old is the car   um eighty seven and he just doesnt take care of things and but i was awarded the car so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic and i can trust him   hm   so hes trying to get you know things fixed on it but its just you know leak leak leak everywhere but um   hm   you know i hate to go into a a repair place because theyll tell me somethings wrong with it and its not you know and charge me twice as much the last time i took it into a repair shop the man told me i needed a master cylinder so i said okay and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then um about a month later a man was looking at my car and he asked me you know not a man not a repair man but just a friend and i was telling him that i just had a new master cylinder put on and he said looked at and he said thats not a new master cylinder   hm   and i didnt even know what one was and um he showed it to me and it was old rusty just awful it was no more new than nothing   so apparently it was the same one that was on there   oh more than likely   oh we just uh refilled refilled uh probably filled the the brake fluid up and that was it   that was it probably it was very i was so irritated and thats happened to me more than once or twice just just just about every time ive went in somewhere   so whats the solution to that i guess find a reputable service   and and you just i cant hardly find one you know   hm   the guy thats doing most of my my car now um goes to my church and thats the only reason you know i go to him   umhum   because i know him and i know he will tell me the truth because he doesnt even charge me for for doing it so hes not gonna you know   hm   take me yeah i just pay for the parts and he does it so   right well thats wonderful   yeah yeah i am so   youre lucky   i dont know i dont know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car theyre usually the worst one of all we took our Honda to the Honda dealership and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car   oh really   yeah and so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars we you know they told us we just had to have one and we bought one we didnt no more need no new engine give me a break you know so it was it was not good   hm   and um
