                well are you in the market for a new car   uh well yeah i am as a matter of fact  well actually actually im looking for another car but uh uh new probably not   oh what sort of requirements to you have for your car   uh sports car  uh usually either black or red   uhhuh um   and and electric windows and power locks  no   i see top of top of the line   well uh not so much that as it is ive had so many times when uh uh you know i ill have a friend next to me or i see somebody uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window   oh   it is just a real pain or you know if im driving along and theres somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them its real difficult to drive reach reach over and try to roll down the window   umhum right right   and uh so power locks and power windows are just  just things that uh uh just really help a lot  what about you   umhum umhum well i guess im um more traditional in that i dont like power  power windows or power locks because  the people that i know have who have them always seem to have trouble with them     oh   and um  so i dont i just dont like anything that i cant figure out why it doesnt work  and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and   sure   uh i guess a good   have you ever had a car with an air bag   no i havent have you   no   somehow i just think you know i like the idea   well it it seems sure seems to save lives and uh  yeah i actually i like the antilock brakes   right right thats a good idea   and ive never had a chance to i have been in cars that have had them but  ive never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on ice or water just to see if they didnt lock up   umhum umhum   but uh you think youd buy uh an American car or a European or Japanese   well i actually i dont know a lot about different brands i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i i guess i did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically you know good repair record good mileage um and i needed airconditioning and um cant remember what my oh i wanted uh stickshift and so i didnt have a whole lot of choice there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stickshift in it it it turned out to be a a Chrysler um   what was that   Lancer   huh stick shift huh did it have what a three speed or a four speed   yeah no a five speed and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadnt picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it   wow   so i guess in this area at least you know if its not automatic it doesnt move   well actually i much prefer a stick shift and what im im curious i i know why i love a stick shift why do you  why did you want one   well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable   umhum   um   its hard to find stick shift cars anymore   i found that out  i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement         so   huh yeah no i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift   yeah well im not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area not that i was looking for sports cars but  now the people ive talked to  dont seem to have stick shift   huh huh   and so why do you like stick shift   um i guess i i grew up on it and its fun its its an enjoyable part of driving i do feel like i have uh more control   umhum   over the car and it it to me it gives me more a lot more control in the snow and ice and slick conditions   umhum right right   uh it it it does uh i dont know it its really more fun than anything else as long as youre not stuck in heavy traffic its fun   umhum right and actually its probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active   yeah yeah   so   yeah  uh of course i like gadgets and and uh fun things on on the cars which are all the things course the could
