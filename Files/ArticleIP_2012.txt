                                 Dead Head            Back when I was ajournalistbefore I became a provider of digital contentI thought life wouldalways be simple I would write articles and people would pay to read themBut then I heard about the impending death of intellectual property a scenariopainted by cyberfuturists John Perry Barlow and Esther Dyson As all media moveonline they say content will be so freely available that getting paid toproduce it will be hard if not impossible At first I dismissed this asgardenvariety breathless overextrapolation from digerati social theoristsBut even as I scoffed the BarlowDyson scenario climbed steadily toward therank of conventional wisdom            Barlow and Dyson do have asolution In the future people like me having cultivated a following byproviding free content on the Web will charge our devotees for services thatare hard to replicate en masse We will answer individual questions onlinesay or go around giving speeches or spew out insights at private seminars orthis one is actually my idea have sex with young readers The key writesBarlow will be not content but performance Barlow a former lyricist forthe Grateful Dead offers this analogy The Dead let people tape concerts andthe tapes then led more people to pay for the concerts            Theseminal version of the BarlowDyson thesis is Barlows word  essayin Wired  It is with some trepidation that I challenge the logic of thisargument Barlow is a noted visionary and he is famously derisive of peopleless insightful than himself a group which in his opinion includes roughlyeveryone He says for example that the ability of courts to deal correctlywith cyberissues depends on the depth of the presiding judgesclueimpairment Well at the risk of joining Barlows long roster of theclueimpaired here goes            Barlows argument begins with a cosmic premise Digitaltechnology is detaching information from the physical plane where property lawof all sorts has always found definition This is wrong on two counts Firstall information does take physical form Whether digital or analog whether inink or sound waves or synaptic firings or electrons information always residesin patterns of matter or energy which as Einstein noted are interchangeablemanifestations of the physical world            To besure the significance of information is independent of its particularphysical incarnation So is its value You download this article from Slatesservers and copy it onto your own hard disk and its still worthwellnothing but thats a  Suppose it were a Madonna video Youd get just as muchenjoyment out of it regardless of which particular bunch of electrons embodiedit                           B ut this independence of meaning and value from physical incarnationis nothing new It is as old as Sumerian tablets to say nothing of theGutenberg press Indeed the whole reason intellectualproperty law exists isthat people can acquire your information without acquiring the particularphysical version of it that you created Thus Barlows belief that propertylaw of all sorts has always found definition on the physical plane signalsa distressing confusion on his part The one sense in which its true thatinformation is detached from the physical planethe fact thatinformations value transcends its physical incarnationnot only fails toqualify as an original insight and not only fails to makeintellectualproperty rights obsolete its the very insight that led tointellectualproperty rights in the first place Barlow announces from themountaintop Its fairly paradigm warping to look at information through fresheyesto see how very little it is like pig iron or pork bellies Maybe sobut its hard to say for sure since the people who really did take that freshlook have been dead for centuries            If you somehow forced Barlowto articulate his thesis without the wacky metaphysics hed probably saysomething like this The cost of copying and distributing information isplummetingfor many purposes even approaching zero Millions of people cannow do it right at their desks So in principle content can multiply likefruit flies Why should anyone buy an article when a copy can be had fornothing            Answer Because it cantThe total cost of acquiring a free copy includes more than just thecopyingandtransmitting costs Theres  the costin time andor moneyoffinding someone who already has a copy and will give it to you for free or forcheap  the risk of getting caught stealing intellectual property  anypremiums you pay to others for incurring such risks as when you get copiesfrom bootleggers and  informal punishments such as being labeled a cheat ora cheapskate The size of this last cost will depend on how norms in this areaevolve            Even inthe distant future the total cost of cheating on the system thus figuredwill almost never be zero Yes it will be way way closer to zero than it usedto be But the BarlowDyson scenario still is wrong Why Because whetherpeople cheat doesnt depend on the absolute cost of cheating It depends on thecost of cheating compared with the cost of not cheating And the cost ofgetting data legally will plummet roughly as fast as the cost of getting itillegallymaybe faster                        In their writings Barlow and Dyson make clear theyreaware of this fact But they seems unaware of its fatal impact on their largerthesis How could cybersages have such a blind spot One theory Becausetheyre cyber sages You have to be a career paleohack like me gettingpaid for putting ink on paper to appreciate how much of the cost of legallyacquiring bits of information goes into the ink and paper and alliedanachronisms like shipping warehousing and displaying the inky paper Iwrote a book that costs  in paperback For each copy sold I get  The daymay well come as Barlow and Dyson seem to believe when book publishers as weknow them will disappear People will download books from Web sites and eitherprint them out on new cool printers or read them on superlight wirelesscomputers But if so it will then cost you only oh hell make it toget a copy of my book legally from my Web site            Nowimagine being at my Web site reading my promotional materials and decidingyoud like to read the book Thank you A single keystroke will give you thebook drain your bank account of five shiny quarters and leave you feelinglike an honest upstanding citizen Do you think youll choose instead tocall a few friends in hopes of scoring an illegal copy And dont imagine thatyou can just traipse on over to the blackmarket book store section of theWeb and find a hot copy of my book As in the regular world the easier it isfor Joe Consumer to track down an illegal distributor the easier it is forcops to do the same Black marketeers will have to charge enough to make up forthis risk making it hard to undersell my  by much And there are  toowhy the cost of cheating will be nontrivial                           M eanwhile on the other side of the ledger theres another reasonfor the cost of legal copies to drop Many journalists will reach a much largeraudience on the Web than they do now The magazine model of bringinginformation to the attention of readers is stunningly inefficient I hope itsnot egotistical of me to think that when I write an article for say theNew                Republic  I am not reaching nearly everyone who might have aninterest in it Granted the Web is not yet a picture of efficiency itselfSearch engines for example are in the reptilian phase of their evolution Butmost observerscertainly the Barlows of the worldexpect radical improvementIm not saying all journalists will see their audiences grow The likelytrend when you  will be for many obscure and semiobscure journalists to seetheir audiences grow while the few rich and famous journalists will see theiraudiences shrink Cool            Onemuchdiscussed cybertrend is especially relevant here the scenario in whichvarious data brokers offer a Daily Me a batch of articles tailored to yourtastes cheaply gleaned from all over the Web When this happens guys like mewill be living the life of Riley We will wake up at noon stumble over to thekeyboard in our pajamas hammer out  words and thenwithout talking to asingle bothersome editormake our work available to all data brokers Likelyfans of my article will be shown say the first couple of paragraphs If theywant to read more they deposit a quarter Will you try to steal a copyinstead Do you steal Tootsie pops at checkout counters The broker and theelectronic cash service will pocket a dime of that I take my  cents and headfor the liquor store            Of course this disaggregation of content may be ruinousfor magazines like Slate But consider the upside Not only will the efficiencyof the system permit rockbottom pricing that discourages cheating but thefluidity of content will disrupt channels of potential cheating If yousubscribe to a regular oldfashioned online magazine its easy to split thecost of a subscription with a few friends and furtively make copies Youwretched scum But if you subscribe to the Daily Me this arrangement makesno sense because every Me is different Sure you may email a friend theoccasional article from your Me You wretched scum And in general thissort of leakage will be higher than in preWeb days But it would have toreach massive proportions to negate the overall gains in efficiency that willkeep people like me in business            This argument like allarguments about the future is speculative It may even be wrong But it isconsistent with the history of the world The last halfmillennium has seen data getting cheaper and easier to copy and  datacreation occupying alarger and larger fraction of all economic activity Thus far in other wordsas the realm of information has gotten more lubricated it has becomeeasier  not harder to make a living by generating informationCyberspace is essentially a quantum leap in lubrication            Barlows insistence thatintellectual property will soon be worthless is especially puzzling since he isone of the biggest troubadours of the Third Wave information economy Sometimeshe seem to think its possible for a sector of a market economy to get biggerand bigger even while the connection between work and reward in that sectorbreaks down He writes Humanity now seems bent on creating a world economyprimarily based on goods that take no material form In doing so we may beeliminating any predictable connection between creators and a fair reward forthe utility or pleasure others may find in their works Far out man
