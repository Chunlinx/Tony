                                 Mea Culpa                           Aproposal to lure people into the District by slashing federal income tax ratesfor city residents got its second big boost in as many days yesterday whenSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott joined House Speaker Newt Gingrich inendorsing it                        Washington Post July             Forgive me reader for Ihave sinned I confess that I harbor a belief that contradicts much that I haveheld dear over the years that leads me to reject wellestablished economictheory and practice that has earned me the understandable scorn of my Slatecolleagues I confess I favor a substantial federal incometax break for thecitizens of the District of Columbia            So strongly moreover do Icling to this heretical belief that when one of my colleagues suggested Iwrite a column attacking the districts tax remission on wellaccepted economicgrounds I objected devotion to a free and fair airing of contrary opinions bedamned Such narrowminded accountancy I argued would destroy the fragilepolitical consensus on Capitol Hill that might actually produce a timelyrescue Yes yes I stole the central theme of this column from a subordinateAnother  days in Purgatory And finally oh Grand Inquisitor it will not have escaped your soulpiercing gazethat as a resident of the District of Columbia I stand personally to benefitshould the tax cut be enacted            And yet Ido not repent            Of course I know most economists believe that local taxbreaks do nothing to stimulate overall economic growth My files are as full asany policy wonks with scholarly studies demonstrating that using tax lures toattract jobs and taxpayers often ends up robbing not just Peter but Paul aswell Obviously much of the growth generated by such a break is merelystolen from other jurisdictionsleading them to offer breaks of their own inan ultimately futile race to the bottom Less obviously the new citizens andbusinesses may be a bad deal Meeting their needs may require for example newroads and schools without the extra tax revenues needed to pay for them            Nor doesmy heresy blind me to the inefficiency of tax transfers in affecting behavioreconomic or otherwise I will not deny that it has been shown that as much as or  percent of a tax incentive often goes to pay for activity that wouldhave taken place anyway As for the pious hope that the Internal RevenueService will be able to police the new tax breaksto assure that all claimantsare truly residents of the district and that the nations capital has notbecome a flagrant tax havenwell the IRS has a better chance here than in theCayman Islands            Surely you know argue my colleagues thatCongress could just give as much money directly to the district government asthe area would gain from a federal tax breakat a fraction of the cost to therest of the country Well this is where I start falling off the train Weretalking after all about a city government thatwith an annual budget ofabout  billion and a shrinking populationruns schools that cannot sheltermuch less educate its children cannot mend its roads or keep its drinkingwater potable cannot police its own police force let alone its streets orjails cannot care for the sick or elderly or homeless A government thatcannot resist the importuning of any special interest or union that lacks boththe will and the talent to reform itself What would make anyone think thatgiving more money to that government would fix anything            The only thing that willsave the district is more residents and more businesses able not only to paymore taxes but to take a lively interest in how they are governed And onlytax benefits big ones will persuade them to move into an illgovernedcrumbling capital city Yes they will come initially at the expense of otherespecially neighboring jurisdictions But the areas around the capital havelong prospered at the expense of the capital Their commuters benefit mightilyfrom the services provided by the district yet pay no taxes to support thoseservices The surrounding areas cannot ultimately flourish without a vibrantcore Moreover the district unlike other cities and because of its uniqueconstitutional origins cannot annex its fleeing middle class Nor can it claimthe voting representation in Congress that in Americas historical traditionhas been considered the essential tradeoff for taxation            That iswhy there is grumbling but little organized opposition in Virginia andMaryland to the tax grant to the districtworth perhaps  million ayearthat is gathering bipartisan support in Congress Still you may ask whyshould the residents of East St Louis or Detroit provide tax breaks to thedistrict when they have so many problems of their own Why should they allowthe districts residents to enjoy a federal tax rate of say  percent whenthey themselves may face rates close to  percent Because its the nationscapital and because its a good investment            No I do not profess that the tax breaks will pay forthemselves in no time at all How could I when I have so often written thatthey will not But the supplysiders are quite right when they say thateconomies are not a zerosum game Is it too large a leap of faith to believethat the right incentives ones that capitalize on the comparative advantagesof people or locations can reap positive returns not just for the directbeneficiaries but for the larger society            Here is a beautiful city onethat ought to make any American proud Its welltended by the federalgovernment parks monuments mansions embassies and museums can compare withthose of any city in the world Paris or New York it is not but its downtownstreets have a polyglot vitality they lacked only a few decades ago Itsneighborhoods are filled with solid housing and wellkept gardensand not justin the wealthy enclaves You can have a park in your backyard as I do andstill make it to work in  minutes if you keep a sharp eye out for thepotholes It would be nice if more of the newcomers were artists artisansand producers rather than lawyers and lobbyists but head for head Ill stackup Washingtons intellectual capital against any competitors A timelyexpenditure of tax revenues might just work wonders And even if the costs werea dead economic loss to other jurisdictions surely there are gains in nationalpride for recompense            I confess that I cannot proveI am right in my belief Costly error or painful recriminations lie on eitherside of my position The money might after all be wasted on windfalls On theother hand its also possible that the tax incentives would miraculously repaythe federal coffers many fold In either case my knees are ready If Paris isworth a mass Washington is worth a
