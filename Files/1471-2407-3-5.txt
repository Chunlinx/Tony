                    Background        After lung prostate and breast cancer colorectal        cancer ranks as a leading source of cancer mortality           Nationally although death rates have been declining since        the mids this trend is not consistent across all        ethnic groups    Specifically in the past  years the        death rate for Caucasians has been decreasing at nearly        twice the rate as that for African Americans and for        Native Americans the rate has actually been increasing            Among Asian ethnic groups Chinese and Filipinos suffer        a higher death rate than do the Japanese    These        ethnic disparities appear largely driven by differential        stage distribution eg more advanced stage cases at        presentation Underutilization of cancer screening appears        a key factor    However studies have found that even        after controlling for stage at diagnosis significant        ethnic differences remain           How can one explain cancer survival differences that        persist after adjustment for stage Biological theories        suggest that members of certain ethnic groups are        genetically predisposed to more aggressive forms of the        disease differ in hosttumor interactions or are more        likely to have contributing comorbid conditions Wudel et        al  recently reported that colorectal cancer        survival differences between Caucasians and African        Americans could not be explained by measurable differences        in treatment    Neuhausen has proposed a        multifactorial biologyutilization model           Environmental theories propose that behavioral or        socioeconomic factors leading to differential utilization        of medical care are responsible Varying utilization of as        well as access to health care has been reported as an        explanation      Schrijvers et al  have        described a relation between socioeconomic status and        comorbidity    Evidence of interaction between age and        socioeconomic status has also been reported           Hawaiis diverse ethnic composition combined with its        longstanding statewide cancer registry the Hawaii Tumor        Registry HTR offer an ideal setting for examining ethnic        differences in cancer survival Previous research has        documented significant survival disparities among the major        ethnic groups Caucasian Japanese Hawaiian Filipino and        Chinese in the state In  Nomura et al found that        Japanese patients had a nearly onethird higher survival        rate than Caucasians    Hirohata et al         described better survival rates among Japanese and        Caucasians than among Filipinos and Hawaiians even after        adjusting for age gender and extent of disease at        diagnosis    Wegner et al  analyzed HTR data        from  and found the same pattern of differences        which also could not be explained by any of the available        covariates           The goal of the present study is to examine trends in        recent survival rates The HTR data that was incorporated        in the Wegner  study is still available as is more        recent data up to the year  allowing for an        examination of survival patterns over time Improved        survival rates for cancer patients were observed by Hinds        et al  during the years     More        recently Maskarinec et al  have described improved        breast cancer survival among all ethnic groups for            Also for the years  it was        found that all ethnic disparities in breast cancer survival        were eliminated once TNM Stage had been controlled           These findings largely fail to support purely biologic        explanations of disparate colorectal cancer survival        Differential utilization of health care or access to health        care appears more important        In Hawaii the passage of time has brought general        improvements in medical care and also narrowed disparities        in access to medical care Utilization of screening        procedures continues to vary among ethnic groups however        At the onset of this study we hypothesized that over the        past  years improved cancer screening and treatment as        well as better access to medical care across all ethnic        groups has both improved survival rates and reduced ethnic        differences in colorectal cancer survival We further        predicted that stage at diagnosis age and gender could        explain most remaining survival differences although we        questioned the role of other factors such as treatment        utilization and comorbid disease                    Methods                  Population and Sample          The population of Hawaii resides on seven islands with           on the island of Oahu and is estimated at  million          with approximately  women    Close to  of          residents are  years and older and  are  years and          older The majority of the population is of Asian and          Pacific Islander descent  of the population in           were Caucasian  Japanese  Native Hawaiian           Filipino  Chinese and the rest other ethnic          groups However over the period of this study          differences in age distribution within various ethnic          groups in Hawaii have driven some differences in the          actual proportions of individuals with cancer          All data were ascertained through the Hawaii Tumor          Registry HTR which provides populationbased coverage          of all newly diagnosed cancer cases and subsequent          followup status for residents of Hawaii The HTR was          established in  and it became part of the          Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER          program in  Quality control reviews have shown that          caseascertainment through HTR is virtually complete          Over  of cancer cases reported to the registry are          histologically confirmed    and less than  of cases          are identified through death certificates only Whenever          possible the HTR follows cases until death through          regular linkages with the Hawaii Department of Healths          death records hospitalbased registries and additional          sources of mortality information In accordance with SEER          rules less than  of cases are lost to followup The          ethnicity classification in the HTR is based on          selfreports by patients Information on the first course          of treatment surgery chemotherapy radiation and          hormone therapy is also collected             From the HTR all patients diagnosed with colorectal          cancer ICDO codes CC C C          CC C from  were extracted Of the           pathologically confirmed cases of invasive          colorectal cancer we excluded  patients who were not          from the five major ethnic groups Caucasian Japanese          Hawaiian Filipino and Chinese and  patients for          whom the diagnosis date was unknown leaving a total          sample of  cases for analysis                          Statistical Analyses          Data were first examined for ethnic differences by          cohort across stage at diagnosis age sex and cause of          death using the likelihood ratio  statistic This          statistic is interpreted in the same manner as the          Pearson   but provides greater precision Next the          SAS procedure PHREG    which performs regression          analyses based on the Cox proportional hazards model was          used to conduct survival analyses As a test of the          validity of the proportional hazards assumption that the          hazard ratio does not change over time the Cox          proportional hazards regression was performed with a          variable calculated as the mean deviated natural log of          time Significance of this variable would imply a          violation of the proportional hazards assumption          Survival survivor function estimates used for figures          were based on the fitted proportional hazards model and          can be interpreted as the estimates for the survivor          functions controlling for the effects of the covariates             The same analyses were conducted in each of three          separate cohorts determined by the year of diagnosis            and  The years for the          first cohort were chosen to be consistent with the study          conducted by Wegner et al             The starting year for the third cohort was chosen as           because that was the first year in which TNM staging          data tumor size node status and metastases became          available in the HTR    With TNM stage data a          comparison between the predictive value of this more          comprehensive form of staging  I IIA IIB IIIA          IIIB and IV and the SEER staging local regional          distant could be made    The was accomplished by          computing the increment in model fit after the TNM stage          variable had been added to model containing the SEER          stage variable The likelihood ratio statistic provides          this information and is distributed as chisquare          allowing for determination of statistical significance          The years for the second cohort consisted simply of the          years between cohorts one and three          Within each cohort two sets of survival analyses were          performed In the first an event was considered to have          occurred if a patient died as a result of colorectal          cancer in the second death by any other cause was          considered an event This allowed for an assessment of          whether or not changing colorectal cancer survival trends          were consistent with general survival trends Censored          values included patients alive at the last data          collection and patients lost to followup In all          analyses the effect of ethnicity on survival while          controlling for the variables stage at diagnosis local          regional distant age sex and year of diagnosis to          control for any linear time trends existing within          cohorts was assessed using a hierarchical approach in          which a model including ethnicity was compared to one          that did not Age and year of diagnosis were treated as          continuous variables as examinations did not reveal any          nonlinear associations                            Results        Tables and provide frequency and percentage        distribution data for stage at diagnosis age sex and        cause of death by ethnicity and cohort The average ages        for each stage at diagnosis were  years for local         years for regional and  years for distant For each        variable significant ethnic differences were observed        When compared to the other ethnic groups Hawaiians in all        three cohorts were diagnosed at a more advanced stage        Likelihood Ratio      and          p           p   and         p   respectively and were        more likely to have died from colorectal cancer as opposed        to death by other causes or still alive Likelihood Ratio             and  p   for all        Hawaiians also were significantly younger within cohorts         and  Likelihood Ratio     and          p   for both When compared        to the other ethnic groups Filipinos had a significantly        higher proportion of males in all three cohorts Likelihood        Ratio      and          p   for all        Figure presents the survivor function plots stratified        by ethnicity for each cohort and for each cause of death        category controlled for stage at diagnosis year of        diagnosis age and sex The corresponding fiveyear        survivor estimates with  confidence intervals are shown        in Table  and the parameter estimates for each Cox        regression model are provided in Table  Unadjusted        fiveyear survival rates for each ethnic group were         for Japanese  for Caucasian  for Chinese         for Filipino and  for Hawaiian The test of the        validity of the proportional hazards assumption with the        variable          log                   e                   time  indicated no violation                    p          When an event was considered death by colorectal cancer        significant ethnic differences were found for all three        cohorts Likelihood Ratio      and          p           p   and         p   respectively An        examination of the confidence intervals for cohort         indicated that Japanese and Caucasian patients had        significantly longer fiveyear survival than Filipino and        Hawaiian patients For the second cohort the confidence        intervals indicated that Caucasians had a significantly        longer survival time than Filipinos and in the third        cohort Hawaiians had significantly shorter survival time        than all other ethnic groups When an event was considered        any death not caused by colorectal cancer significant        ethnic differences were again found for all three cohorts        Likelihood Ratio      and          p   for all Confidence        intervals indicated that the Japanese always had a        significantly higher survival rate than at least one other        ethnic group        Results were largely consistent with our hypothesis but        with one major exception the persistently low Hawaiian        colorectal cancer survival in cohort  This unpredicted        finding led to post hoc analyses that were identical to the        previous Cox regression models but included the available        treatment variables surgery chemotherapy radiation and        hormone therapy as additional predictors Table provides        the percentages of each ethnic group receiving a given        treatment by stage With the inclusion of treatment        variables ethnic differences were no longer significant in        the third cohort but remained significant in the first two        Likelihood Ratio      and          p           p   and         p   respectively See Figure                Additionally we tested the post hoc hypothesis that        Hawaiians have lower survival because they were both        younger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage than the        other groups If advanced disease is more aggressive in        young people this could explain why the Hawaiians had        lower survival An interaction term between age and stage        at diagnosis was created and added to the models run        previously However this interaction term did not show        statistical significance failing to support the post hoc        hypothesis        At least for cohort  our data also allowed us to        compare the predictive value of the SEER staging variable        local region and distant with that of the more        comprehensive TNM staging variable TNM staging provided        significantly improved predictive value over SEER staging        Likelihood Ratio             p   However inclusion of        TNM staging did not eliminate the Hawaiian ethnic disparity        in outcome Likelihood Ratio             p   again suggesting that        stage at diagnosis alone does not account for the        persistently low survival among Hawaiians                    Discussion        With few exceptions results clearly supported the        stated hypothesis that ethnic disparities in colorectal        cancer survival have been diminishing over time Figure         showing the convergence of survival over time best        exemplifies this The one discrepancy in this overall trend        is the unchanged life expectancy for the Hawaiian group in        cohort  A comparison with the survival curves for other        causes of death within cohort  reveals that this effect is        specific to colorectal cancer and does not reflect a        general tendency for Hawaiians to die sooner        One possible explanation for this is that Hawaiians were        not utilizing medical care to treat colorectal cancer to        the same degree as other ethnic groups Our post hoc        analyses did demonstrate that ethnic disparities were no        longer statistically significant after controlling for        treatment differences Interestingly however Hawaiians        did not appear to be receiving less treatment and with        respect to chemotherapy and radiation appear to have been        receiving more than the other ethnic groups One possible        explanation for this is that treatment is causing adverse        effects and death Another is that doctors see prognostic        signs of severe disease that are not measured by our        covariates and therefore prescribe more treatment That        is Hawaiians may have more advanced disease than staging        alone indicates        The implications of these findings are important If        differential screening constitutes the primary reason for        ethnic survival disparities it should be possible to        achieve equally favorable outcomes in all ethnic groups        With the exception of the Hawaiians the evidence presented        here reflects a convergence in terms of screening medical        care and colorectal cancer survival among all ethnic        groups Further efforts are needed to examine why Hawaiians        do not follow the overall trend and how to make        improvements In this regard a Native Hawaiian cancer        network called the Imi Hale is attempting along with        support from the National Cancer Institute to increase        screening for colorectal cancer in Native Hawaiians                  One limitation of this study is that data are restricted        to the state of Hawaii However even though there are        clearly potential regional differences in ethnic patterns        of survival the results of this study could be important        beyond Hawaii For example in national studies it has        been shown that AfricanAmericans are less likely than        others to receive adjuvant chemotherapy           Differential treatment utilization may drive ethnic outcome        disparities The role of individual patient choice and the        role of complicating comorbid conditions in treatment        selection probably play some role and another limitation        of our study is not having access to this information In        future studies however we hope to elucidate the impact of        such factors        To this end an important area for future research is        detailed analysis of specific treatments received by cancer        patients For example beginning in  the start of the        third cohort in the present study colorectal cancer        survival has been improved through the use of        fluorouracilleucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy           This factor as well as improving stage distribution        through screening has undoubtedly contributed to the        greatly improved colorectal cancer survival rates in the        third cohort Unfortunately the HTR does not provide        adequate detail with respect to specific chemotherapy        treatments so this hypothesis could not be examined here        However future studies incorporating expanded data sources        should examine whether Hawaiians have been receiving        adjuvant FUleucovorin to the same degree as others and        if not why not eg access informed choice with refusal        of recommended treatment or comorbid disease        Conversely if Hawaiians receive apparently similar        adjuvant therapy ie same agents dosage number of        courses etc do they benefit to the same degree as        others Also do they show a similar degree of treatment        compliance These issues may be of particular relevance        because results from this study suggest that Hawaiians are        equally likely if not more likely to receive        treatments        Hawaiians have been reported to have relatively high        rates of diabetes renal and vascular disease and tend to        be afflicted at a younger age Perhaps an interaction        between cancer treatment and comorbid conditions is having        a negative effect on Hawaiians We speculate that comorbid        illness might play a role in treatment selection for some        individuals with colorectal cancer Collection of ICD        diagnosis codes from nonHRT sources with appropriate        record linkage would allow us to study this        Other results from this study indicate that age at        diagnosis is another significant predictor of survival        with older individuals having a shorter life expectancy        after diagnosis However a comparison of hazard ratios by        cause of death showed that the values were much lower for        death due to colorectal cancer than for other causes This        suggests that while age is clearly related to overall        survival it is less relevant to colorectal cancer        survival That is colon cancer is not more deadly for        older individuals than for younger ones Similarly sex        appears to predict colorectal cancer survival A small        beneficial effect was observed for women when considering        death due to colorectal cancer but a strong effect when        considering death due to other causes The impact of        comorbid disease on survival might explain these age and        gender differentials        Stage at diagnosis represents the most important        prognostic variable In this study the SEER staging system        was used so that identical analyses could be performed        across all three cohorts However for the most recent        cohort cohort  TNM staging clearly improved survival        predictions over the less comprehensive SEER staging In        future studies we will use TNM staging whenever        possible                    Conclusions        This study provided longitudinal evidence in support of        nonbiologic explanations for ethnic disparities in        colorectal cancer survival Specifically the present        analysis suggests that observed ethnic differences result        from differential screening In Hawaii ethnic disparities        in colorectal cancer survival have narrowed considerably        over the past  years However Hawaiian patients did not        experience the same degree of improvement in survival as        the other
