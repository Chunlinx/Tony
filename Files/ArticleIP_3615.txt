                                 Orwell Listing            George Orwell of allpeople now stands accused of being an informant for the British secretservice In recent weeks the British press has been filled with articlesasking whether the inventor of Big Brother was a hypocrite for namingnames            Revelations about Orwells secret list have been trickling out for someyears In  Michael Shelden published an excellent biography that revealedOrwell kept a notebook listing the names of people he took to be Communists orCommunist sympathizers In  the British Foreign Office disclosed thatOrwell had shared some of the names in his notebook with a Cold Warera outfitcalled the Information Research Department With the British publication lastmonth of Orwells complete works in  volumes we have a more complete storyof what he did despite the fact that the Foreign Office has yet to release theactual list of names Orwell submitted            Surprisingly little of the story has been reported in theUnited States The only prominent mention was a confused quasidefense thatappeared on the New York Times oped page a few weeks ago The authorCold War historian Timothy Naftali asserts that Orwells list showed andcriticizes him for showing poor sense The apparent point of the piece was notto challenge his reputation but rather to argue that those who named namesbefore the House UnAmerican Activities Committee werent so bad since theydid only what Orwell had done in a time of difficult choices Orwell defendersin Britain have emphasized that in May  when he shared his list he was onhis deathbed Some have suggested he was coaxed into cooperating by a woman hewas in love with            None ofthese excuses is necessary What Orwell did was not the pardonable act of adying man It was the moral act of an ethical manright not only in thecontext of the times but also in retrospect The behavior he is now beingexcoriated for was not Orwellian in the sense of  s world ofinverted truthbut Orwelllike meaning that it was in keeping with a careerbased on political courage and intellectual integrity            To understand why Orwell did what he did itsnecessary to reconstruct a bit of history Orwells hatred of Soviet communismdates from  the year he volunteered to go fight in the Spanish Civil WarIn Barcelona he was a witness to and nearly a victim of the Stalinist purgeof independent elements on the left Members of the Republican militias notcontrolled by Moscowsuch as the POUM for which Orwell foughtwere beingjailed and murdered When Orwell tried to spill the beans about what washappening behind the lines he was prevented by people who though not CPmembers viewed criticism of the Soviet Union as intolerable These includedKingsley Martin the editor of the New Statesman  and Victor Gollanczwho had published Orwells early books Homage to Catalonia which may be Orwells finest work was finally published by the tiny firm ofSecker  Warburg and sold only  copies Orwell faced the same experiencewhen he finished Animal Farm during World War II Because of itscriticism of the Soviet Union no publisher but Warburg would touch it            WhenWorld War II ended Orwell became preoccupied with Stalins power grab inEastern Europe and the way those whom he saw as dishonest intellectuals in theWest were abetting it With his friend Richard Rees he played a game of tryingto figure out who was what in the fellowtraveling constellation In hisnotebook Orwell listed  nameswith remarks about who the people were whohe guessed might be some kind of agent who a fellow traveler or cryptoand who merely stupid dishonest or nave He missed the mark a fewtimesJohn Steinbeck and Orson Welles didnt fellowtravel very far ButOrwell was often not just correct but also uncanny Peter Smollett ajournalist who headed the Russian Department of the British Ministry ofInformation during the war and whom Orwell described as almost certainly anagent of some kind was later revealed to be in fact a Soviet agent PeterDavison the editor of the Complete Works  believes that Smollett wasthe person who talked Jonathan Cape a prominent British publisher intodropping Animal Farm  Orwell kept his private list uptodate WhenUpton Sinclair a fellow traveler in the s turned antiStalinist after thewar Orwell crossed him out            Orwell was not just a political commentator who spoke fromthe sidelines He was someone who believed in choosing sides and taking actioneven when the alternatives were imperfect In  he was busy arguing that itwas necessary to choose the United States over Russia in the emerging Cold WarHe criticized the editorial page of the Tribune  where he wrote aregular column for failing to take a proAmerican position even though thepaper was antiCommunist It was in the midst of the Berlin Crisis in  thatOrwell received a hospital visit from Celia Paget the sisterinlaw of hisfriend and fellow antiStalinist Arthur Koestler As Shelden recounts in hisbiography Koestler had fixed Paget up with Orwell after his wife suddenly diedin  Orwell was enough taken with her to propose marriage rather abruptlyThough Paget refused him they became good friends            After going to work for theIRD a department roughly analogous to the US Information Agency she askedOrwell for help in countering Communist propaganda around the world Orwelldeclined the offer of a commission to write a pamphlet in part because he wastoo illhe was suffering from tuberculosis and would be dead in eight monthsBut he was happy to recommend others suited to the task such as FranzBorkenau an exCommunist who wrote the best book other than Orwells about theSpanish Civil War Orwell also told Paget that there were people the IRD shouldavoid He asked his friend Rees to bring the notebook he kept at home to thesanitarium in the Cotswolds where he was dying From his list of  namesnotall of which have been revealed because some of the people are stillaliveOrwell chose only  people of whom he said he was fairly sure TheNew York                Times published excerpts from the larger list of even including people Orwell had crossed off leaving the impression that hehad submitted them all for blacklisting The names Orwell submitted are almostcertainly those marked with a red asterisk on his longer list and do notinclude such familiar ones as Stephen Spender or Michael Redgrave            Orwellasked that his list remain secret not because there was anything shameful aboutit but because he feared it was libelous Where he could say the same thingpublicly he did Many of those on his list are people Orwell wrote against inthe Tribune and in his London Letter for Partisan Review  Thereis no analogy to the behavior of those like Elia Kazan who named names beforeHouse UnAmerican Activities Committee Kazan betrayed friends in order toprotect himself People lost their jobs and had their lives ruined as a resultOrwell named enemies not friends And they werent his personal enemies theywere people he believed to be enemies of liberty Nor were their civilliberties infringed as a result The only consequence of appearing on Orwellslist is that you werent likely to be asked for help by the British ForeignOffice                           DidOrwells list demonstrate he was antiSemitic and antihomosexual If youmissed the link to the
