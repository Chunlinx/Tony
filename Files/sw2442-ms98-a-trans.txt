        all right     oh okay are you on an exercise program now or   yeah i exercise pretty regularly   uhhuh   i lift weights quite a bit   uhhuh   um i run occasionally lets see what else do i do play golf some and i work out on a a hanging bag im brown belt in karate so i keep up with that a little bit   uhhuh oh yeah   how about you   um the only exercise program im doing right now is walking   umhum   ive got a nine month old and im four months pregnant with my second and so at the time walking seems to be the best its something i can do with her plus um doesnt tax me too physically   umhum umhum   i have enjoyed aerobics in the past and i enjoy that because i like the group association you know like exercising with other people   yeah   and um and thats my favorite way to exercise   well thats neat   but   yeah i do walk some too my wifes about five months along so shes been walking quite a bit so that that is a good exercise for that   oh yeah its its its nice to do it together too i guess   umhum   because my husband and i used to walk together but our schedules dont coincide as well as they used to and so we very seldom get together to walk but when you when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule or do you go to groups or   i i i do it on my own schedule   umhum   we used to try and belong to clubs or the Y stuff like that but it so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive to drive the distance you have to go and   umhum   save the fees weve decided we just save the fees and and buy some of our own equipment so   and then you can do it whenever you want i guess   yeah yeah ive got a weight bench and we got my wife an exercise bike and i use that sometimes too   umhum   so its a little more convenient but youre i guess youre not as dedicated if you dont drive over do it           i guess it depends on the person depends on how motivated you are   umhum   because my husband used to work out three days a week with uh at the Texas Instruments gym   uhhuh   and then i would just go on Saturdays but  since the first of the year neither one of us have been going   yeah   so  you know like you said weve been paying these fees and not going so its kind of a a waste of money if you dont take advantage of it   yeah i i think you really have to be disciplined   yeah   i uh i i try to work out at at least a couple of times a week and i i think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that youre in   yeah oh with the walking i think they they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial   umhum   and we i have two friends that we walk they have babies that are about the same age as as mine and weve been walking every morning at going when it was cold wed go to the mall its because you cant take the babies out very easily   yeah   so uh so we when we go we have about do about fifteen miles a week but the last little while for one the reason or another we havent been real consistent so its a little harder when you depending on other people to do it with you   umhum   because you have to meet their schedules as well but   true   but i enjoy doing it more when ive got other people with me than and i usually do it because i want to because i know its good for me not because you know i dont i dont feel obligated to do it and i enjoy it   umhum   if i if i feel too obligated to do it i i start to rebel and i wont be as consistent with it   yeah i understand did you exercise between your first child and your second   i uh i exercised pretty well up until i found or until i was pregnant and i started having pains so ive calmed down everything except i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the um walking   umhum   yeah   and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful but the the TI rec center has an aerobics program for for um prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing   hm   and i was going to wait until um about my sixth month and then start doing that i did that with the second baby and um i went to my exercise class exercise class one day and then she was delivered the next day   gosh   so it it would seem to be real beneficial   umhum yeah maybe it maybe it speeded up the process and all that   well i think it made parts of it a lot easier i i is this your first that youre having   uhhuh   oh okay well then i dont know how much youve been through it but um i think parts of it made a lot easier and ive talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didnt with the other and they said that theyd exercise the one that had exercised was three or four times easier and   really   and weve i had having both of them natural the first one was natural and going natural the second and and it was its rough but its not as as bad as i thought it would be   umhum   and i think the exercise helped   well thats good   so do you work with TI   no i dont my my wife has been working with them   oh okay well then she could go if she was interested   umhum   i think thats what the class that meets on Saturday mornings so she could find out if she wanted to go its kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy and they would talk about exercise and just general things related to the birthing process and so for its so its educational as well as it exercise exercise beneficial so   yeah at least its something that you enjoy and i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say well i dont want to exercise its too much work but there a lot of different things you can do that that are enjoyable that you dont have to you kn ow strain yourself or sweat   thats right   be real sore afterwards   yeah       and sometimes thats if you get a little soreness you feel like well ive done a good job because i got worked myself to that point but i guess you dont want to overdue but well have we reached our limit im not sure how long weve been talking but   yeah i think i think weve talked about six minutes or so so   okay well its been good talking to you   its been good talking to you as well   okay i hope your baby goes well comes out well  byebye   thanks yours yours too byebye
