 Like his previous columnsTax theKnickers Off Your Grandchildren by Steven E Landsburg took a simplisticmathematical model with little connection to reality extended it to absurdlengths and stated that the conclusions are the only reasonable social policyHe truly embodies the worst stereotypes of both economists and radicalconservatives            If US per capita incomemanages to grow in real terms at a plausible  percent per year then in just years the average American family of four will enjoy a daily income of million he writes Using this logic in  the residents of my hometown ofPittsburgh should have let their economic policies be dictated by theirestimations of what would happen here now In addition what Landsburg didntsay is that no society in human history has ever sustained very rapid economicgrowth for  years            Landsburg goes on to berateand insult those who disagree using phrases like their pathological concernfor future generations and an epidemic of hysteria ending the piece withthe diagnosis of a mild air of intellectual schizophrenia for those of us whodont subscribe to his beliefs            In addition to hissimplistic model and the sheer arrogance of his prose Landsburg spewsanticonservationist nonsense that demonstrates a total ignorance of historyThere are at least a dozen examples of manmade ecological disasters that ledto famine and widespread devastation and at least a couple of majorcivilizations that collapsed under the weight of ecological mismanagement Idbet that each faminewracked region in history had at least one person likeLandsburg who had been predicting  percent economic growth for centuries andridiculing anyone who tried to consider the consequences of their actions            Onethirdof our government budget now goes to pay the interest on the debt thatLandsburgs friends ran up just  years ago Most of that money went intoshortlived schemes that no longer have measurable benefits if they ever didto most taxpayers yet the interest on that debt will dominate governmentspending for the foreseeable future What Landsburg would have us do is paythis interest by borrowing more each year and continue to do so indefinitelyor until the inevitable collapse which he presumes would take over  yearsto happen His silly little savingsaccount example does nothing to hide thestaggering stupidity of that policy                           Dr DanielSchwarcz                                       Tax theTrees                        Tax the Knickers OffYour Grandchildren by Steven E Landsburg seems less like awellreasoned editorial on economics than a weak rationalization forshortsightedness He begins by suggesting that if the United States couldachieve growth rates reported by South Korea in the past couple of decades ourgrandchildren would eventually be earning  million a day But it seemsmisleading verging on irresponsible to compare the economies of the mostpowerful nation on earth to a Third World country recently infused with thenewfound growth of capitalism Its akin to saying that if the Chicago Bullsshowed the same growth as the Raptors theyd eventually be winning more gamesthan theyre playing            Based on this faultyassumption Landsburg then goes on to make the assertion that since ourgrandchildren are going to be so rich they wont mind being reduced to seeingthings like trees only in photographs and they might prefer inheriting theproceeds of economic development to inheriting the redwoods anyway But thisseems to be bred from the same kind of intellectual schizophrenia heattributes to those who would disagree with him If economic growth isdependent on cutting down trees what happens when the trees are gone as hehimself concedes will eventually happen And if we can continue at this superbrate of growth after there are no more trees to cut couldnt we continue withthis rate of growth by stopping the cutting now            He sees this pathologicalconcern for future generations carrying over to the deficit as well and has asimilar defense of our spendhappy ways and insatiable need to consume Ourgrandchildren are going to be a bunch of spoiled rich little bratsundeserving of all the concern weve been giving them            What ifour economy doesnt grow at the rate of South Koreas or even  percent ayear but stagnates or God forbid goes down despite all the cutting of taxesand trees and racking up of deficits Then I suppose those of us who supportincome redistribution wouldnt look so hypocritical and our grandchildren wouldhave big debts higher taxes no treesand be poor                           Dylan OttoKrider                                       Steven ELandsburg Replies                        Schwarcz thinks that theresidents of Pittsburgh did the right thing in  when they chose not toworry too much about how their consumption would affect their descendants in Hes right it would be absurd for people living in  thcentury conditions to eat less well so that people living in  thcentury conditions could afford an even more extravagant lifestyle            Replace the  thand  th centuries with the  th and  th  andyoull see that hes making the same point I am            Schwarczs statement aboutrapid economic growth never lasting more than a century is incorrect The worldhas enjoyed rapid economic growth for the past  years worldwide per capitaincome is now  times what it was in  That growth is fueled bytechnological progress and technological progress is if anythingaccelerating            On a completely separateissue Schwarcz confuses the effects of government spending with the effects ofgovernment debt Government spending consumes resources It consumes an equalamount of resources regardless of whether it is paid for by debt or bytaxation            He has in fact made thestandard freshmaneconomics error of viewing the interest on the debt as acost without accounting for the offsetting benefit By keeping current taxeslower than they would otherwise be the debt allows people to have highersavings and therefore to earn additional interest That benefit offsetsthe cost This is not a matter of sophisticated economic theory it is a matterof simple arithmetic Not even the federal government has the power to overridethe laws of arithmetic            Krider is absolutely correctthat achieving and maintaining South Korean growth rates for the next  yearsis unlikely But thats an observation about an essentially parentheticalremark The thrust of my argumentand the numbers that I used in themathematical hyperlinkassumed a plausible growth rate of  percent            FinallyKrider worries that the economy might not grow at  percent in whichcase policies based on that forecast will have been mistaken Sure Its alsotrue that the earth might get destroyed by an asteroid in  years inwhich case all our sacrificing for future generations will look like a bigmistake It would be silly to say that we should consume everything weve gotjust because an asteroid might destroy us and equally silly to say thatwe should engage in an orgy of conservation just because economic growthmight slow to zero We make the best estimates we can and planaccordingly                           PublicDonations                        Franklin Foers The White House and the HatchAct adopted the conventional response toward this affair to find a way tosweep this unseemly activity under a rug            The current cycle of shockand horror about White House sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom in return forlarge contributions to the Democratic National Committee is amusing I rememberthis same response when the Republican Conference chairman Rep John Boehnerwas caught passing out checks from tobacco lobbyists on the House floor Howlsof iconoclasm and protests against tainting the official chamber with TammanyHall votebuying rang then and ring now            The corrective responseoffered by most media to both of these events is the exact opposite of what itshould be Rather than prohibit the solicitation of campaign contributions atfederal buildings the Hatch Act should be amended to designate these hallowedplaces as the only sites at which a candidate may solicit or accept a campaigncontribution It ought to require that the White House rotunda be the onlyplace at which the DNC or the president may accept large contributions andthat the floors of the House and Senate chambers be the only places anindividual or PAC may give a large contribution to a member of Congress            The law ought to alsostipulate the checks must be presented in a small white canvas sack with alarge  sign on it The burgeoning surveillance possibilities of microchiptechnology ought to be applied toward a public good The sergeantatarms orMarine guard at each site should attach a tag with a microchip to each sackthat emits information about the contributor the recipient and the amount ofthe contribution Then CSPAN could run a stock ticker ribbon at the bottom ofthe screen conveying information on the current trades            Attemptsat prohibition or limiting this activity have shown the proclivity of itsmembers to simply move it underground to Washington hotels and Florida resortsin order to skirt responsibility for its appearance By forcing candidates toconduct their fund raising at the places of the peoples business politicianswill have to accept responsibility for the appearance and fact of the tiebetween influence and money instead of maintaining the fiction of aseparation                           Kris Lipman                                       The CheckStops Here                        In reading the revealingarticle The WhiteHouse and the Hatch Act by Franklin Foer one major issue seems to jumpout at me We have heard Vice President Al Gore say that he has violated nolaw and that may be true within the narrow letter of these laws The issuethat bothers me is that as the supposed paragon of virtue of the DemocraticParty why does Gore apparently go to the very limit of the definition tocondone his actions            If it is unlawful for anygovernment employee save the president vice president and confirmedappointed officials to engage in fund raising from a government building whydo our leaders choose to walk the very thin edge of legality in their politicalactivities            Whathappened to the concept of a leader being a shining example to the peopleexpected to follow Are all now to presume that any activity we choose toengage in is fine as long as we can find a narrow definition that appears toexclude us from the responsibility of our actions                           Lawrence RWestin
