                                                            How WeLost That Story                        At                   Slate                wedo not go whoring after scoops While others chase semenstained cocktaildresses and sweat through the Beltway summer humidity in pursuit of leaks wesit back in our breezy Pacific Northwest aerie sipping a microbrew observinganalyzing synthesizing and generally thinking great thoughts Or at any ratethinking thoughts But we are not above indulging in a scoop if it falls intoour lap For a few hours this week we thought we had one            Over theweekend a journalist friend in London emailed us an article It was by aformer British intelligence officer MI MI MI Who can keep themstraight telling tales out of school about alleged attempts by Britishintelligence MI MI to kill Muammar Qaddafi the prominent Libyanstatesman and murderer A bomb intended for Qaddafi allegedly blew up the wrongcar killing innocent people At the British governments request the authorof this tale was arrested Saturday in France Our friends newspaper and allother British papers were forbidden to publish the article under Britainsnotorious Official Secrets Act But                   Slate                could publish it on theInternet he reasoned and in Drudgelike fashion avoid the constraints onprint journalism and draw attention to ourselves The story would get out andthe Official Secrets Act would be exposed as a farce in the age ofcyberspace            We did what any redblooded American would do in such asituation We consulted our lawyer He told us its not so simple Thelawyers mantra                   Slate                also might be subject to the OfficialSecrets Act If we published this article not only could our editors bestopped at Heathrow on their way to pay homage at the Diana museum but theassets of our parent company could be seized and so on Imagine millions ofWindows  CDROMs going moldy in some government warehouse The heart sickensCould we in good conscience risk denying the plucky British people thismarvelous operating system with its fully integrated Internet browser            Our lawyer said we mightescape Britains ridiculous censorship laws by arguing that we are an Americanpublication and any seepage into Britain was purely unintentional Or we mightnote that the storyits now Monday morning Pacific timewas alreadydribbling out The London Sunday Times had mentioned the alleged Qaddafiplot comically reasoning that the government claims the story is untrue andsomething that never happened cannot be an Official Secret Just to be safethough the reference was buried deep within an article on something lessinteresting On Monday other British papers reported that other British papershad reported the story            But intruth getting the story into Britain was not incidental It was the main ideaAnd to the extent the story was already out in Britain we had little interestin publishing it In short we realized our lawyers efforts were futileThere was a perfect inverse correlation between our desire to publish thearticle and our legal ability to do so Basically if it didnt violate theOfficial Secrets Act there was no point            This conclusion turned a potential scoop into apotential stand on principle which is even more exciting Should we askMicrosoft Corp to prove its bona fides as a media company by backing an act ofjournalistic civil disobedience That sounded like a lot of fun but first wehad to figure out which principle exactly was at stake            Was itthe right of the Internet to be free of all government restrictions No We arecomfortable with the idea that some national security informationthe names ofagents in hostile countries is the usual exampleshould not be published andthat such constraints should not have to depend on every journalist in theworld acting voluntarily The Internet makes enforcement of any restrictions onthe spread of information much more difficult But it does not as far as wecan see affect the principle that society ought to have the right to preventor punish publication of some information            Was the principle at stake here the right to be free ofstupid andor unnecessary government restrictions Governments will alwaysclaim too much secret territory A botched assassination attempt that killedinnocents is just the kind of thing the citizens ought to know about while thegovernment wont want them to know But it makes no sense for a journalist tosay I dont mind being censored but only about information I wouldntpublish anyway Theres no need for a law to prevent you from doing what youwouldnt do anyway If you concede the governments societys right to rulesome information out of bounds you must also concede the right to draw theline in a place you disagree with            Of coursecivil disobediencebreaking the law and taking the punishmentis a valideven noble way to dramatize iniquity and create pressure for change For                  Slate                a basically American publication to risk its future on acrusade to reform the excessive secrecy laws of the United Kingdom would havebeen a lovely gesture But somehow it did not seem morally mandatory Let theBrits care for the Brits            So maybe the principle is that Internetpublications shouldnt be subject to stupid andor unnecessary censorship byforeign governments Although with Internet access you can get                  Slate                as easily in Rwanda as in Redmond so perhaps the ruleshould be that every Web site must follow the laws of its home country andno other After all if an American publication like                   Slate                findsitself subject to Britains Official Secrets Act this turns the Internetspromise of freedom on its head Not only are we not liberated from our               particular national jurisdiction We are simultaneously subject toevery                other national jurisdiction                   Slate                is contentto obey the laws of the United States even laws we dont care for But thenotion of say Belgium popping up to enjoin us from criticizing moulesfrites seems unfair            Trouble is the Internetmakes a farce of any such oneWebsiteonecountry solution as the case inhand demonstrates Our British friend instantly and effortlessly emailed usthe rogue spys article and if we hadnt been worried about British law wewould have made it as instantly and effortlessly available in Britain as ifhed published it himself In this case that would have been a happy resultBut what happens when those agents names get emailed from the United Statesto oh Libya and immediately get posted on wwwmuammarcom As a practicalmatter this may be unavoidable And to be clear about it the massivecensorship necessary to avoid it is certainly not worth the cost in freedomBut theres no point in pretending that a Web site subject to only onecountrys laws is actually subject to any at all            So in the end we were deniedboth an exhilarating scoop and an invigorating stand on principle There is anobvious opportunity here for a bonanza of international conferences to studythe need for worldwide treaties to set up global commissions to come up withtransnational standards for  oh God we cant go on There must be an easierway Any suggestions                           Michael Kinsley
