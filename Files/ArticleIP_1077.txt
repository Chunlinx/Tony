                                 StockMarket Circuit Breakers            In the heat of last Mondaysstockmarket dive the New York Stock Exchange debuted circuit breakersReviews of the procedure which halts trading when the Dow Jones industrialaverage drops dramatically are mixed Most traders say that the pausesexacerbated the panic Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and others credit thepauses with calming jittery investors What are circuit breakers Why were theycreated What is the evidence that they work            Followingthe October  Black Monday stockmarket crash  a presidential taskforce was convened to investigate the crashs causes and suggest remedies thatwould prevent a repeat performance The task force blamed faulty marketmechanisms  The exchanges it argued lacked the infrastructure toaccommodate the trading volume that the drop occasioned Phone lines cloggedcomputers crashed and printers jammed Many orders simply werent receivedDeluged traders couldnt match the buy and sell orders they had The task forcerecommendedand in  the New York Stock Exchange implemented circuitbreakers  a pause in trading that would give buyers and sellers time toassimilate incoming information and arrange transactions Circuit breakersafford investors and traders the time to sell stock calmly rather than dump itin a panic            The main circuit breaker is an NYSE rule thatautomatically stops trading for  minutes whenever the Dow Jonesindustrial average tumbles  points from its previous days close Anothercircuit breaker halts trading for an hour if the market drops another points The NASDAQ exchange the American Stock Exchange and the ChicagoMercantile Exchange now stop trading whenever the NYSE stops Also after the exchanges agreed to curtail computer trading of futures when the Dow Jonesindustrial average either gains or loses  points This procedure is invokedregularly            Although circuit breakerswere first imposed this week the governing board of the NYSE does stop tradingwhen circumstances warrant it Following the  market crash for instancethe NYSE shortened its hours to curtail panic trading During the paperworkcrisis  of  the NYSE cut back hours for the first three months of theyear so that brokers could handle a massive backlog of unfilled orders Inaddition specialiststhe traders who handle the transactions of an individualstockare granted permission regularly by the NYSE to stop trading stock torestore temporary imbalances between supply and demand Bad weatherpresidential assassinations and power outages all have resulted in the closingof the market            Mostforeign governments require local                exchanges to halt the tradingof stocks that have dropped drastically Monday markets in Tokyo London andelsewhere prohibited the trading of specific stocks No other countryautomatically closes volatile markets for a breather            Critics of the new rules say that circuitbreakers flopped in their NYSE debut The first circuit breaker was thrownat  pm Monday Oct  After the minute pause trading resumed andthe market dropped another  points in  minutes triggering the secondcircuit breaker  The current Wall Street consensus is that the break madeinvestors and traders even more inclined to sell instead of cooling them offMany traders blame the cable networks  which dwelt on the first circuitbreaker and reported it as a sign of an impending crash During the first lulltraders who had orders to sell by the end of the day were already anticipatinga second circuit breaker Fearing that a second circuit breaker would close themarket for the day and prevent them from executing their orders on advantageousterms they sold their stocks as soon as possible instead of waiting to findthe best price                           Circuitbreaker critics also argue that the mechanism prevents themarket from working itself out of a crash Extreme volatility they say is anatural part of the markets quest for equilibrium between supply and demandInterrupting this process causes additional drops such as Monday afternoonsrather than upswings such as Tuesday mornings                           Technology has made moot much of theoriginal justification for circuit breakers Following the  crash bothNASDAQ and the NYSE invested billions in expanding and automating thetransaction infrastructure to accommodate the enormous swells in trading TheNYSEs computers now can handle the sale of  billion shares a day vs million in  Monday  million shares were tradednot much more than thedaily average volume of  million But Tuesday the NYSE handled a record billion shares with its central computer processing as many as transactions a second On both days traders had no difficulty matching buyersand sellers and speedily filling orders            The Securities and ExchangeCommission and the NYSE originally devised the circuit breakers to kick inafter a point drop At the time  points represented  percent of themarkets value Adjusting for the quadrupling of the market over the last sevenyears the SEC and the NYSE raised the circuitbreaker trigger last year to points Critics say that point trigger is far too low  allowing thecircuit breakers to flip at levels that dont warrant a stoppage of trade Theyappear to be right Monday when the first circuit breakers were imposed themarket had dropped only  percent SEC Commissioner Arthur Levitt Jr has saidthat the circuit breakers should be reformed so that they are triggered by adrop in percentages not points
