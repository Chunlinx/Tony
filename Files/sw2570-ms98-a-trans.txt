              why dont you go ahead and start   okay my hobby is uh sewing i ive just uh started learning how to sew and uh ive taken some classes and ive made a few few garments do you sew at all   i used to uh i i sewed you know in high school and when i went to college i think everything in my closet i had made but i havent sewed since then and thats been fifteen years   did you   so uh you know i didnt have access to a machine the whole time i was in college   oh   and uh my sister sewed and she needed the money so i would pay her and shed make my clothes   oh   and uh and then just in the last you know ten or twenty i just havent sewn anything i would love to i would like to get back to it   yeah uhhuh uh clothes are getting so expensive now in in the stores and the the quality is is sometimes so poor that uh it it really is worth while to sew   yeah it is you know an even back then i remember you could make something for you know half what it cost to buy and of course the quality was just exceptional   right an   uh now its a little more expensive to make it because you you know you start paying the price for the patterns and the material but its still such better quality that i think its worth it   yeah it certainly is and the patterns have gone up tremendously too the prices for them you used to could get you know a pattern for two or three dollars now theyre like you know five six seven eight   youre kidding me   oh no im not   see i can remember paying seventy five cents for a pattern   huhuh no the the cheapest ones now are like maybe four uh four or five five dollars     umhum   six seven and then you get into the vogues they get up to into twelve and fifteen and on like that   good night well do you have kids and a husband are you sewing for a whole family or   uh right now im just sewing for myself i i do have two daughters that you know out theyre theyre grown now though i wish that i had started sewing you know when they were younger   uhhuh   and uh it would have helped me out tremendously  but um       oh i guess i i just you know i always i have always tried to sew and uh i didnt like the way it looked so id never wear anything but now i i really have bought some uh new sewing equipment i bought the Serger machine   yeah uhhuh   and uh it really makes it look professional and ive taken some classes here in in uh Dallas   well and that always is helpful for starters you know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where youre going   yeah right i know a lot of people where i work make their clothes its just theres just so many people sewing now days   thats true well do you do anything else do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that   uhhuh huhuh no im not that talented   no see im not ive not ever been a real craft type person i have a sisterinlaw that i mean if it can be done with your hands she does it she makes things for the kids for Christmas and nephews and nieces and i look at them and i think God you know i i should be able to do things like this   right i have a sister that can can uh crochet real well or or knit i i guess i mean knit and she knits things like hats and uh sweaters an you know   yeah yeah well when my sister oh when my sister had her first uh child my niece and this is were talking fifteen years ago i was it was my last year of college   bed throws uhhuh uhhuh   and i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares so she did and i crocheted a blanket for my sisters baby   oh   and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time   uhhuh   and when we broke things off actually we were supposed to get married when i got out of college so when we broke things off i quit crocheting it and ive never picked up a needle since then in fact i think its still sitting in the top of the closet   oh my goodness   one of these days i keep thinking im going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread       but   yeah now now they have the uh knitting machines that will do it for you   fast   umhum   my problem i guess is time you know i i talk to my husband we kind of planning for the time eventually when you know maybe i can quit work while my kids because i my kids are young i have a three and a half and a two year old   uhhuh um   and he says but Bev i think youll be so bored because you know all youve ever done is work and i said but theres so many things i want to do id like to start sewing again id like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these you know knit these things and i think that would be fascinating he kind of laughs   yeah   are you familiar with what a Serger is uh the Serger sewing machine   i dont think so   well you know in when we used to sew wed sew the seam and then wed finish the edges and we we would uh trim the seams and finish the edges   sure uhhuh   well this machine does it all in one step its   youre kidding so like as youre sewing the seam its finishing off the inside edge   right and its cutting off the uh the there there are two knives and it cuts off the uh you know excess seam allowance   well that takes all the work out of it   right       and uh it it really makes it look professional   well how neat   especially on you know i mean from the inside you know how you look under under something that youve made and it doesnt really   uhhuh   but uh the Serger really makes it look professional   well thats neat   theyre pretty expensive i like i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine   for the machine yeah   uhhuh so since i bought it and paid that much for it i guess id better might as well get some use out of it  yes im going to have to do it   you have to learn how to do it thats right otherwise they hold it over your head forever right   right   now i bought you that machine  well that sounds really good     ah yeah   do you paint or anything like that   no no i i play the piano   never oh so do i   oh you do   except well i have one here its the one that i grew up with and my folks gave it to me and uh a couple years ago when they uh they sail and so they sold their home and they theyve been sailing and uh   uhhuh   so its here but i havent touched one like since college so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again and of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it and id love to teach them to play too   uhhuh yeah   so im not great but i remember it   uhhuh well im not that great either i used to be a lot better than i am now i i have played for uh the church choir and uh   yeah   i played for the choral club in high school and but i you know i dont practice a lot anymore and uh you know you get rusty   you do   you really   you do   i never thought i would get rusty but im rusty now   well i i figure it takes practice and i i dont i say i dont have the time thats not true by the time i put my kids in bed at night i dont want to do anything   uhhuh yeah   i you know ive worked all day and i come home and i do that i and you know even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that i i think gee i could do this or that i have an hour here i dont want to do them sometimes im too tired   right uhhuh yeah right   so i try to save that for the weekend i need to get better at it though   uhhuh well sewing does take up take an awful lot of time takes an awful lot of time   now the part about sewing that i never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out if if somebody would lay it out for me       then i didnt mind cutting it out and sewing it i could do that all day long and i i can remember once in high school i wanted some extra money   yeah   and my mom wanted some pants so she laid out the material and i cut it and sewed it and she paid me i think like two dollars a pair  to make her some pants   yeah   but i i hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and make sure its on the right lines and not on the bias and   yeah on the on the right on the straight grain and all that stuff uhhuh   yes on the grain of the fabric it drives me crazy   yeah that thats thats the part that i dont like too   yeah   yeah i i like sewing sewing up the garment itself i really like to do that but the the cutting and the all the even the cutting i dont like   well what are some of the other features on this machine it sounds wonderful   well thats about it really its it has four uh four threads instead of the the regular basic two threads   oh okay   and uh its   is that for designs or is that for the regular seam in the fabric or   no you you can either use three or four of the threads   oh okay   uh its kind of it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine like the theyre loopers under the bottom and then the theres a seam stitch and its the loopers that form the the edge you know that edge finish   uhhuh   and uh thats what really makes it look professional you can do a lot with the Serger though you can make uh piping and cording and uh you can use all kinds of different uh textures of thread   so it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do   and well yes but you you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine you cant throw your sewing machine away you you you need it to do things like button holes and uh   uhhuh   seams that need to be really strong need to be done on the sewing machine   so the Serger is not a sewing machine itself its something that goes with it   its uh   like an attachment or   no its its a its a its a machine its not exactly a sewing machine but it does it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff but there are other are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesnt do like you cant top stitch with it   oh okay   you know you cant do top stitching or um   theres theres a few few things that you just cant do with it it will also do a rolled edge um   uhhuh   gee its just so versatile like i remember     well im going to have to go check it out thats just something i hadnt heard of but it
