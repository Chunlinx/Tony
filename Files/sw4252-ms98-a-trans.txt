                what do you feel about it   uh          well lets see um generally i dont think there should be much gun control uh i like to i like to do a lot of hunting and i have my own gun at home and stuff but uh the older i get i think the more i believe there ought to be gun control       for instance uh just yesterday i go out my front door and somebody had shot a dog out of their front door their subdivision and the thing kind of wound up right where my kids get picked up at the bus stop   oh really thats kind of creepy   so uh yeah it is creepy you know and uh you know it makes me think hey you know theres a lot of a theres a lot of nutcases you know living even in you know in your subdivision and i mean   yeah well what do you think about like automatic weapons and stuff i mean those cant be used for hunting   yeah see yeah you look like look at automatic weapons and things like that and uh you know clearly they have no no useful hunting purpose and uh   yeah unless youre really bad   yeah even then if youre that bad it probably wouldnt help any anyway just uh itll help you kill like i mean up in Virginia a lot of hunters get killed anyway just with shotguns you know so i cant imagine what itd be like if theyre doing it with automatic weapons      oh really what kind of gun do you use when you hunt   uh when i hunt i use a twelve gauge shotgun its uh actually a lot of heavy broacher so its kind of a short range kind of thing   uhhuh oh really what kind of stuff do you hunt with it   uh well i the last time i hunted i hunted turkey actually and uh you know its   oh really   i wasnt too successful but  i wouldve shot one if id see one  so and   was that yeah when you use a shot gun do you have to like pick uh the pellets out of the  when youre i mean      oh yeah well youre supposed and yeah youre supposed to sure you have to try to get it out of there   shot    but yeah i guess i could you could probably hurt your tooth or something   uh well its actually uh i dont know if this is true anymore but its lead shot saying that you dont want to   oh really   you dont want eat a piece of lead but um yeah i think uh youre supposed to do that also you have to be real careful uh about what the animals been eating you know like uh if you ever hunt pheasant you know sometimes they get into corn thats been uh like you know has mercury on it or something and   yeah   ugh   and uh to keep the because the corn gets treated to keep uh insect dusts away so so if you go in and you dig into the pheasant yeah you can get mercury poison   uhhuh   but uh so theres i mean theres sort of some risks to that actually uh let me think  gun control uh i i generally generally actually since i live so close to DC and since its the murder capital of the world and you know the   anyway yeah Atlantas not far behind   yeah well they have guys i mean i guess they have this Atlanta too but i mean they got guys you know running around you know driving down the street with sub machine guns and stuff and   yeah   you know i dont even let my wife and uh kids go down there anymore unless you know im with them or something and then we just stick strictly to the mall area you know we never never venture outside of that area so   yeah well i mean i feel as if nobody you know if there werent already hand hand so many hand guns and everything prevalent you wouldnt need you know you wouldnt need one for selfdefense but it seems like theres so many of them uh that its really impossible you know itd be impossible to itd be impossible to do anyway i mean people would buy them regardless whether it was uh legal or illegal illegal i think   yeah doesnt that kind of strike you as  especially in big cities that uh you know the law enforcement agencies arent really capable of of providing the kind of protection that you they should be able to provide   no not at all our house as a matter of fact theres some guy that walked in and stole one of my roommates bikes while he was in the shower just the other day and thats kind of creepy to we live i live right down town and uh if theyd wanted to you know   yeah yeah uhhuh coming at  or something you know   yeah yeah if they wanted to shoot me or something there there wouldnt have been any problem i mean they just it was in broad it was during the day too so obviously they dont have a whole lot of fear of uh   yeah    yeah   being caught by the police in anyway anyway   yeah i you know i feel like like you know the when they when they interview these criminals you know the burglars and things they that the two things that they say keep them out of a house best are guns and dogs because they   uhhuh    yeah were getting a dog as a   yeah so they know theres a dog there they know theres a gun there you know theyre probably not going to rob you theyll probably go to the next house   uhhuh   and uh if they if they suddenly pass a really global law that says you cant have any guns you know there i mean theres guaranteed to be a higher percentage of people just breaking in assuming that these guys dont have any guns and   umhum its just crazy ive seen the statistics statistics on the number of deaths by hand guns in the United States compared with like Canada and and its just uh i mean they have like you know a handful a year   yeah yeah   uh and its just outrageous  how much how many we have here but   yeah   i dont i dont know if theres anything that can be if gun control would solve that problem   yeah contributing maybe contributing factors too nobody nobody knows about yeah im im usually pretty skeptical on that kind of stuff these studies   yeah and besides that i dont think i think the NRAs got such a big lobby that i dont think  theyd be able to   yeah clearly they have some other motive you know i mean their their argument used to be you know the communist were going to take over or something well they arent anymore you know so whats the argument now well   yeah
