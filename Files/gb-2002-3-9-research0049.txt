                    Background        Highresolution mapping and chromosome walking critical        steps in the positional cloning of a mutant gene may        become problematic and tedious without highdensity        molecular markers Although a number of molecularmarker        maps are available for various species further resolution        of the target region is often required as markers may be        irregularly spaced along the chromosome owing to uneven        rates of recombination In addition focusing the genetic        interval reduces the time and resources necessary for        chromosome walking Comparative mapping is based on regions        of microsynteny between two organisms and provides a        powerful technique for enriching molecular markers in the        region surrounding a gene of interest A number of        researchers have suggested that mapbased cloning in        economically important crop species can be expedited by        utilizing chromosomal microsynteny between the target and a        model species     The recently completed sequence        of the entire genome of         Arabidopsis thaliana   now        provides a catalog of ordered reference genes immediately        applicable to other higher plant species   Conservation        of synteny is well documented in closely related species        within the same family for example         Arabidopsis and         Brassica oleracea   rice and        barley   and tomato potato and capsicum           Recent comparative sequence analyses and mapping studies        have indicated that microsynteny and macrosynteny are also        well conserved between         Arabidopsis and evolutionarily        divergent species such as tomato    or soybean          Thus comparative mapping has the potential to rapidly        identify additional molecular markers in a region of        interest in those species        The singlegene         diageotropica dgt mutant of tomato                 Lycopersicon esculentum  displays a        pleiotropic phenotype that includes reduced auxin        sensitivity   A number of physiological and molecular        studies suggest that a         Dgt dependent auxin signal        transduction pathway regulates a subset of early        auxinresponse genes      however the nature        of the         Dgt gene is still unknown We have        been using a mapbased cloning strategy to isolate the         Dgt gene previously mapped to the        long arm of chromosome    On the basis of recent        comparative sequence analyses showing wellconserved        microsynteny between the tomato and         Arabidopsis genomes within relatively        small regions    we applied microsyntenybased        comparative mapping to facilitate the positional cloning of        the         Dgt gene and successfully reduced the        genetic interval with new molecular markers                    Results                  Identification of microsyntenic regions in          Arabidopsischromosomes          Using restrictionlengthfragment polymorphism RFLP          and RFLPderived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence          CAPS markers Figure  based on previously published          tomato genetic and RFLP maps   initial studies mapped          the           dgt locus to a region of around           cM near the bottom of the long arm of tomato chromosome           Of  backcross BC             individuals screened  plants          were determined to be recombinant between markers TG          and CT whereas no plants were found to be recombinant          between TG and           dgt Figure  To identify          additional genes within that region by finding          microsyntenic regions in           Arabidopsis  nucleotide sequences          of the three RFLP markers most closely linked to the           dgt locus TG TG and CT          were used to identify homeologous sequences in the           Arabidopsis genome database            BLASTN matches with an arbitrary threshold expect value                     E value of less than  were          investigated as significant matches          Three putative microsyntenic regions MSRs were          identified in the           Arabidopsis genome Figures            In MSR homeologs of all three tomato RFLP markers were          found in the same linear order on two adjacent           Arabidopsis bacterial artificial          chromosome BAC clones from chromosome             Arabidopsis accession numbers are          in parentheses FM AL and TA AL          The           Arabidopsis homeologs of TG          TG and CT in MSR had corresponding           E values of e  e  and e           respectively The           Arabidopsis homeologs of markers          TG ATg TG ATg and CT          ATg encode a small auxinupregulated protein          SAUR a hypothetical protein of unknown function HP          and a farnesylated protein FP respectively The second          microsyntenic region MSR spanned two           Arabidopsis BAC clones Fl          AL and ME AL and was also located on          chromosome  but only yielded homeologs for tomato          markers TG and CT            E values of e and e           respectively The third microsyntenic region MSR was          located on           Arabidopsis chromosome  and          spanned           Arabidopsis BACs FH AC          and FO AC This region only contained a          homeolog to TG ATg           E value of e  However          additional auxinregulated genes were identified in this          region ATg to ATg which made continued          analysis potentially beneficial In addition this region          had previously been reported to be syntenic to MSR            Therefore we also included MSR in the comparative          analysis of genes in MSRs between tomato and           Arabidopsis           Close inspection of the microsyntenic regions detected          by BLASTN analysis suggested that the genomic          microstructure was highly conserved in all three MSRs          Eighteen of  genes  identified in MSR also have          homologs in MSR andor MSR Figure  The order of the          microsyntenic genes was highly conserved in the three          regions with the colinear pattern of three genes           phospholipaselike protein pEARLI  cyclophilintype          peptidylprolyl           cistrans isomerase PPI and a          cluster of SAUR and auxininduced proteins COSAP           serving as a common footprint for these MSRs At the same          time variation in syntenic genes by gene duplication          andor translocation was also evident in all three MSRs          For example the sequences of PPI ATg          phosphatidylinositolspecific phospholipase C precursor          PPLC ATg and diseaseresistance response          protein DRRP ATg of MSR are duplicated only in          either MSR or MSR PPLCs ATgATg and          DRRPs ATgATg remain tandemly duplicated in          MSR and MSR respectively whereas PPI ATg          appears to have been translocated after gene duplication          in MSR                          Highresolution mapping of the dgtlocus by MEST          markers          Because           Arabidopsis MSR contained          homeologs in common with three RFLP markers in the           dgt region of tomato we used it as          our main target region to search for corresponding tomato          homeologs MSR contained  intervening genes between          the homeologs of TG and CT TBLASTN analysis of          each intervening           Arabidopsis gene against the Tomato          Gene Index   generated  TBLASTN hits that were          chosen for further investigation on the basis of the          original annotation of the           Arabidopsis gene and a low expect          value  e  From those  robust PCR products          were obtained and selected for development into new CAPS          markers The original  products provided  new CAPS          markers Table  that were used for PCRbased genotyping          against the informative mapping population Figure           The  previously identified informative recombinant          plants as well as an equal number of noninformative          plants were used to analyze the new microsyntenic EST          MEST markers Of the  CAPS markers tested six MEST          markers mapped in the           dgt region Two MESTs BG          putative protein PP and TC EFhand containing          proteinlike protein EFP identified a crossover          between TG and TG           dgt  and one MEST TC          glycinerich protein GRP revealed a crossover between          TG           dgt and CT These three new          markers which flank           dgt  narrowed the target region          from  cM to  cM in our small mapping population          Three MEST markers TC PPI TC PPLC and          AW DRRP cosegregated with TG and           dgt  Most of the MEST markers          derived from MSR have paralogs in other MSRs but          BG PP ATg and TC EFP ATg are          unique to MSR and MSR respectively Figure           We screened a BAC library with TG and obtained two          BAC clones M and  Each tomato BAC clone was          estimated to be approximately  kb in length by          pulsedfield gel electrophoresis data not shown but          neither contained marker TG or CT sequences data          not shown to allow confirmation that the           dgt locus was located on either BAC          clone When both BAC clones were probed with the newly          identified MEST molecular markers TC the          intervening marker between TG and CT was detected          only on BAC M whereas BG and TC the          intervening markers between TG and TG were          present only on BAC O Figure  The three MEST          markers that cosegregated with TG were detected on          both BAC clones These results permitted partial ordering          of the newly identified MEST markers and demonstrated          that the           dgt locus was present within the          two BAC clones          Subsequent BAC endsequencing and BLAST searches of          the Tomato Gene Index identified BAC  and M insert          DNA ends nearest the telomere as containing genomic          nucleotide sequence for two previously identified MESTs           TC and TC respectively This information          placed TC between TC and the MEST markers that          cosegregated with TG Figures   The BAC          endsequences nearest to the centromere for BACs  and          M were identified as BG PP and TC          chalcone synthaselike protein CHSP respectively          BG was confirmed as a MEST when the sequence was          later posted to the tomato EST database The BAC          endlocation placed BG between markers TG and          TC Taken together these results strongly suggest          that TC and TC are the closest flanking          molecular markers to           dgt present in the two overlapping          BAC clones containing TG BLAST searches of the BAC          endsequences against the           Arabidopsis Information Resource          TAIR database further confirmed microsynteny between          the           dgt region of tomato chromosome           and the three MSRs in           Arabidopsis Figure           As would be expected if microsynteny were maintained          two additional markers TC amidophosphoribosyi          transferase APRT and TC basic leucine zipper          transcription factor bZIP were determined to be          noninformative MEST markers with respect to our          positional cloning strategy because they fell outside          TG However their sequences maintained microsyntenic          alignment and cosegregated with tomato RFLP marker TG          data not shown which is proximal to TG on          chromosome  see Figure  Given no rearrangement of          tomato chromosome  and that microsynteny between tomato          and           Arabidopsis genomes remains firm          the predicted order of the new MEST and BAC endgenerated          markers in tomato would be as follows TC  TC           TG  BG  TC  TC  TC  TG           AW  TC  TC  CT centromere to          telomere Figure  The exact order of these markers and          the position of           dgt will be determined by complete          sequencing of tomato BACs O and M                            Discussion        With the sequencing of the entire         Arabidopsis genome comparative        mapping and homeologybased gene cloning is now available        in other species via microsyntenic alignment of molecular        markers and genes against the sequenced reference genome          Although exceptions to the blanket application of this        approach have been noted   our study successfully        applied microsynteny analysis between the tomato and         Arabidopsis genomes to facilitate        positional cloning of the         Dgt gene in tomato Using three        sequential tomato RFLP markers from our target region we        searched the         Arabidopsis genome database and found        three MSRs in the         Arabidopsis genome that enabled us to        construct a detailed molecular map of the target area        Comparison of the three MSRs from the         Arabidopsis genome shows that the        content and order of the genes are well conserved within        these regions MSR and MSR exhibit reverse polarity        compared to orientation of tomato RFLP markers whereas the        chromosomal segment MSR has the same polarity as tomato        Using information from the three         Arabidopsis MSRs we identified eight        new molecular markers on tomato chromosome  two of which        narrowed the genetic distance to the         dgt locus from  cM to less than         cM and provided the necessary data to confirm the        location of the         dgt locus on two overlapping BAC        clones thus avoiding the need for a chromosomal walk        Our strategy for microsyntenybased comparative mapping        was straightforward and simple First the BLASTN program        at TAIR was used to identify microsyntenic regions in         Arabidopsis containing homeologs of        tester markers tomato RFLPs in similar order within a        relatively small physical interval  cM Several        published reports supported our strategy of using simple        computerbased comparisons between tester and reference        nucleotide sequences Two recent comparative sequence        analyses clearly presented microsynteny of a  kb BAC DNA        insert   and a  kb cosmid DNA insert   from        tomato chromosomes  and  respectively to their        homeologous counterparts in the         Arabidopsis genome Paterson         et al   suggested that  to         of chromosomal segments of less than  cM remain        colinear in distantly related species Direct nucleotide        sequence comparisons BLASTN were used for each search as        this provides a more stringent test of homology between        tomato and         Arabidopsis sequences than do the        conceptual translations of DNA sequences TBLASTX that can        be used for less stringent comparisons between        evolutionarily divergent species   In our study        BLASTN searches using default parameters enabled us to find        a high level of microsynteny without encountering any major        differences between the highestscoring matches in either        TBLASTX or BLASTN searches data not shown However the         E value for each BLAST hit was quite        different between TBLASTX and BLASTN suggesting that an        arbitrary threshold         E value is critical to determine        acceptance of BLAST matches between evolutionarily distant        nucleotide sequences and to place the homeologs on         Arabidopsis chromosomes        The occurrence of multiple MSRs as a result of segmental        duplications on the         Arabidopsis genome has been        demonstrated by other comparative sequence analyses           Most MEST markers identified in this study were        conserved in at least two MSRs suggesting that the use of        genes conserved in multiple MSRs increases the probability        of obtaining microsyntenic markers that are conserved        between two species Using gene annotations in the         Arabidopsis genome database this        simple computerbased analysis not only avoided the time        and cost required for hybridizationbased experimental        methods     but also allowed us to make informed        decisions as to the location of unidentified genes of        interest as well as intervening genes between test markers        in the target area        The second aspect of the comparative microsynteny        approach was identification of tomato ESTs homeologous for        the coding sequence of each         Arabidopsis gene in the most closely        related MSR PCR primer sets were designed from sequences        of highscoring ESTs and robust PCR products were obtained        from  of the ESTs Thirty of the PCR products were then        converted to codominant CAPS markers and used to genotype        a small number of informative recombinant plants The use        of ESTs in comparative mapping has been successfully        applied to         Brassica species    and maize          However the success of ESTderived CAPS markers        depends on a wellestablished EST database The Tomato Gene        Index of The Institute for Genomic Research TIGR is the        third largest sequence database for plants and provided         EST sequences at the time of this study           The tentative consensus TC sequences of assembled ESTs        can be used for integration of complex mapping data and        identification of orthologous genes between divergent        species   Expressed gene sequences were used in this        study as they can be converted to molecular markers more        consistently than noncoding regions when comparing        distantly related species   Moreover two recent        comparative sequence analyses using monocots versus         Arabidopsis   and dicots versus         Arabidopsis   clearly showed that        exon sizes are well conserved in homeologs even between        monocots and dicots whereas intron length varied in rice        versus barley and tomato versus         Arabidopsis  In BLAST searches using        either the processed nucleotide sequence or the predicted        protein sequence of an         Arabidopsis gene the score of each        BLAST match was clearly higher and the         E value was significantly lower when        compared to the use of either nonprocessed nucleotide        sequence or intergenic nucleotide sequence Presumably use        of the predicted protein sequence of an         Arabidopsis gene increases the        probability of identifying the microsyntenic EST in        comparative mapping of distantly related species        considering the average substitution rate           nucleotide siteyear of nucleotides in plants   and        the separation  million years ago of tomato and         Arabidopsis          The MESTderived comparative map indicating that three        regions of the         Arabidopsis genome are related to        each other Figures   supports the hypothesis that at        least two rounds of duplication occurred in the         Arabidopsis genome followed by        selective deletion of genes andor minor rearrangements          Minor rearrangements of microsyntenic genes could        potentially impede highresolution mapping if placement of        the syntenic markers within a relatively large segment        indicated a missing sequence fragment as reported for the        comparative mapping of maize and sorghum   Given that        several genes exist between the homeologs of the two        closest flanking MESTs TC EFP and TC GRP        and neither a deletion nor local rearrangement of the         Dgt counterpart has occurred in the        MSRs the         Dgt counterpart could be one of the        annotated genes between the homeologs of the two closest        flanking MESTs It remains to be seen however whether        additional tomato genes are present in the region        Our results indicate that comparative microsyntenybased        mapping can facilitate positional cloning of a target gene        when information on genomic location is limited Ku         et al   recently utilized        microsyntenybased comparative mapping to add new molecular        markers in a  cM region defined by a previously        determined  kb BAC clone containing the         ovate locus in tomato Here        microsyntenybased comparative mapping was used to define        the position of the         Dgt gene within a much larger region         cM of the tomato genome by contributing six        intervening MEST markers initially derived from         Arabidopsis gene sequences between        TG and CT The approach proved to be less technically        complicated than other fingerprinting methods and points to        several cosegregating genes for further investigation as        potential         Dgt candidates We anticipate that        this general approach will contribute significantly to the        development of dense molecular marker maps for a variety of        higher plant species to expedite mapbased cloning                    Materials and methods                  Mapping population          A mapping population

performed to          identify markers closely linked to the           Dgt gene Figure  Two RFLP          markers TG and CT were converted to CAPS markers            and established as flanking markers to           Dgt  approximately  cM apart          Ten plants were identified as recombinant within this          interval and were designated as the informative          recombinant

Index at TIGR            The resulting tentative consensus TC sequences or          highscoring singleton EST sequences were analyzed and          used to design PCR primers Further sequence analysis was          carried out with the Genetics Computer Group  GCG          Madison WI program Alignments of conserved regions          within a multigene family were made using PILEUP and
