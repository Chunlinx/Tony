                                 Dirty Laundry            Now and then a documentaryfilm comes along that makes us reexamine the rules that unofficially governthe genre Can there be a middle ground between fiction and fact Can adocumentary use scripted scenes and yet remain ontologically authentic Howmuch can you stylize material before you alter the reality that yourestriving at least in theory to capture                           Unmade Beds  NicholasBarkers  real life feature film has proudly worn its mongrel status as adirected documentary of single life in the big city employing in the faceof criticism what amounts to a cacklingpunk defiance The movie tracks fouraging New Yorkerstwo men two womenthrough their lonely dating rituals inthe process depicting a universe of lusty coupledup haves and downcastexcluded havenots all viewed Rear Window style through rectangularopenings in the massive apartment houses in which they reside            This isnot cinema                vrit  and nothing has been left to chance Thedirector selected his four subjects from many hundreds of potential candidatesfollowed them around for months and then scripted their monologues anddialogues to reflect what he says he saw Calling his own film an exercise inmendacity Barker goes on Im quite happy to tell lies about my charactersand even collude with their selfdelusions if it enables me to communicatelarger dramatic truths            Spurned by US distributors Unmade Beds opened twoweeks ago in a small screening room in downtown Manhattan where it proceededto set box office records and generate lots of largely favorable press Inpart due to smart publicity which has bannered some of the bad reviews andcommentary I have to tell you that this film upset me so much that I reallydont want to have anything to do with ita New York publicist it threatensto become a cause                clbre and to be coming soon to a theaternear you Its always nice to see distributors proved wrong about the merits ofdifficult films but in this case I think they did the decent thingUnmade Beds isnt just badits obnoxiously noxiously bad a freakshow for the empathetically challenged The outrage it has prompted isnt thePuritan kind its more like legitimate revulsion at watching a blowhardpervert peoples lives in the name of larger dramatic truths            Thosetruths are large all right Take Michael the yearold  foot  inchlonely guy who has been looking for a wife for almost two decades If you wereto walk past him on the street you might think that a man of his small staturemight have some trouble getting dates and be rather bitter about it The largerdramatic truth is that Michael has lots of trouble getting dates and isvery bitter about it Just in case you feel too sorry for him howeverBarker is careful to include a homophobic monologue in which Michael complainsabout young women who waste their lives hanging out with effeminate males            Michael turns out to be the films mostsympathetic subjectby a wide margin At least hes not Mikey a paunchyyearold who writes but cant sell screenplays and who always flees blinddates because the women he gets fixed up with are mutts Sounding like oneof the lowlevel gangsters who posture like kingpins in Donnie Brasco Mikey talks a lot about mutts He also reminisces about that  hour period inthe s when he managed to sleep with three different beautiful women whosepictures he shows off These days all he meets are mutts He comes off as apathetic little losera mutt            Aimee onthe other hand is a pathetic big loser weighing in at  poundsDetermined to get married before she turns  she generally is filmed besidebags of groceries and assorted junk foods She cries about her situation to herthin friend Laurie who in one scene gently mentions Aimees weight Clearlythe scene is scripted but Aimee does a good job acting taken aback She hasalways been fatand shes OK with it and a man just has to accept it Thisis followed by more talk about how you attract men Will they respect you ifyou call them back If you express too much interest Or the viewer thinksif youre  pounds            The only natural performer here is Brenda a garrulousexhibitionist who blossoms with the camera on hershe could have a career as aPenny Marshallstyle character actress Divorced and aging Brenda needs moneyand is willing to charge for her sexual services It shouldnt be toodifficult because men are always showing her their dicks Im up to two dicksa day They meet her and a few minutes later they show her their dicksWeird huh What Barker leaves out its in a New York Observer articleis that Brenda a former lap dancer works in marketing at a strip jointPresumably men standing next to her in line at McDonalds dont show her theirdicks Nor presumably does she show them her breastsalthough she bares themfor Barkers camera jabbering about her body while she doffs her clothes andsteps into the shower and soaps up            Barkermight have crafted his subjects monologues from their own words but he hasrobbed them of their spontaneityand thus of their essence They arentthinking or trying to come to grips with their situations in front of youreyes because they already know what theyre going to say Theyve been fixedlike butterflies on the ends of pins and held up for voyeuristic inspectionThe scenes with friends and confidantes have a crude programmatic purpose Youcan imagine the director composing a shot the shots are tightly composed andelaborately lighted and reminding them In this scene she points out that youshould lose weight and you get shocked and defensive Ready  Action            Call me square but I find this antithetical tothe documentary spirit An Englishman who trained as an anthropologist beforegoing to work for BBC Television Barker clearly made up his mind about hismaterial before his cameras began to rollso its no surprise that it feelsprechewed and predigested When reality interfered Brenda apparently did notgo through with a marriage to an immigrant in search of a green card for as she does onscreen Barker brushed the truth aside as immaterialfollowing her up the steps of City Hall in her wedding dress because it wastrue to her character But what separates documentary from fiction is thatreal people are often more complicated and more conflicted than finishedcharactersas Brenda proved to be more or at least other than the sum ofher parts Thats the kind of truth that reveals itself to documentaryfilmmakers after the fact when they go over footage and discover unexpectedpatterns dissonances glimmers of a universe thats richer and messier thanthe one they set out to portray            So what are Barkers largerdramatic truths Single people in big cities can be desperate Single peoplefear theyre going to die aloneunloved and unloving People are judged andin turn judge others by how they look Big news One could argue charitablythat the movie is meant to be prescriptive that Barker intends for us toregard the ways in which his subjects delude themselves and thereby learn tosee through our own selfdelusions But Barker hasnt concocted a largerdramatic structure that would hold those larger dramatic truths togetherand help us comprehend where these people went wrong He dramatizes right up tothe point where a dramatist would be expected to provide some insightandthen hey hes a documentarian                           UnmadeBeds might make a good date movie Theres little to argue about in itssubjects personalitiesboth males and females will find them repulsiveandthe picture the film paints of single life in the big city is so bleak thatyoull probably want to jump into bed with whoever is sitting next to youAnything to keep from turning into one of those people            The Slums of Beverly Hills also walks a line between twogenres in this case comingofage sex comedy and autobiographical monologueTamara Jenkins the writer and firsttime director has an eye for absurdjuxtapositions that was obviously sharpened by the pain of her nomadicupbringing Her protagonist Natasha Lyonne spends her teenage years beingshuttled with her two brothers from one cheap dive to another in the  ZIPcode all because her egregiously unsuccessful father Alan Arkin wants themto be educated in the best schools Furnitures temporary education ispermanent Its a major omission then that we never see those schools orthe kids interaction with their stable welltodo Beverly Hills counterpartsWe cant tell if the father is on some weird level justified in his fervoror whether hes screwing up his childrensubjecting them to humiliation androbbing them of a sense of permanencefor no reason Jenkins hasnt quitefigured out how to shape her narrative which is full of episodes that arethere because they actually happened but that dont have a payoff I almostwish shed included more voiceover narration more commentary on the thingsthat as a filmmaker she hasnt learned to bring out                           TheSlums of Beverly Hills never gels but it has a likable spirit and itsexceedingly easy on the eye with lots of pretty girls and wry evocations ofs fashions and decor The father to obtain financial support from hiswealthy brother Carl Reiner volunteers to take in his vaguely schizzydipsomaniacal niece Marisa Tomei She and her cousin compare breasts playwith vibrators and talk in pig Latinish gibberish but Jenkins never lets theproceedings get too sentimental The whimsy is always cut with an

Deep Impact Armageddon  The Mask of Zorro  Small Soldiers  SnakeEyes  Halloween H  has been of a high grade and SavingPrivate Ryan and Return to Paradise were Vitalis slaps in the kisserfor people
