            okay so uh what do you do with your lawn   oh i just i just mow the lawn thats about all i ever do   uhhuh do you put any fertilizer or anything like that   um not really to speak of   uhhuh   um when i was little we used to use uh like uh chicken manure and cover the whole lawn with it and then uh plant uh Bermuda  mostly   umhum and how about uh like landscaping or the you know bushes or flowers or anything   um we had monkey grass   uhhuh   and a wax leaf ligustrums   uhhuh and do you like take care of those in anyway as far as uh feeding them or   well the freeze its really its bad here because the last couple of years the freeze has been real bad   uhhuh   i had to hack them off a little bit   uhhuh   and um and it left most of them dead in in a lot of places it they just killed them right off   oh did it right right well we have we just moved in and were uh kind of our yard has been left untended mostly for about six years so theres a lot of clover growing in it and everything   umhum   and uh so were trying to do is kill to to kill back all the weeds and the clover and let so the grass can grow and a number of the bushes uh theres a lot of boxwood bushes and all that were overgrown so we had to trim those all back you know to to nice and round because they were kind of sticking out all over the sidewalk and everything and there was some uh some juniper that was uh absolutely huge covering up half the driveway just about so we had to cut it all back so you can park the two cars in it   umhum   and uh mostly what were doing since we got a yard service to our lawn service to help fertilize uh seed aerate the lawns uh so that uh you know we can get it back up to speed and to and and to get get it all green again and i was gonna watch what i was gonna to do is watch them throughout the year and see what kind of fertilizer they use and uh then id just repeat it from then on myself   umhum   and uh were also kind of looking at uh a little bit of landscaping as far as putting some uh azaleas in with uh you know different white azaleas and red azaleas and purple azaleas you know to give a little color into the into the landscape there and uh you know put a couple of plants around our deck in the back and a couple in the front with the existing plants uh to give a little color and everything uh do you do anything like that or   um  not very much um just um   umhum   we had some hanging uh flowers in the on the porch and um   umhum   and a few plants on the inside   umhum   that was about it   you know some of the things that ive seen around here too is that a lot of people uh theres kind of two ways to to that ive seen to cheaply fertilize your yard and one was to uh i guess a big thing around is a called a composter   uhhuh   you know where you have you heard of that   yeah   oh yeah whether you you know you put your whatever different grass clippings and all that in and and you let it sit there for a while and it kind of cooks or something as as it decomposes and we sort of have one by guess by accident thats in our backyard and so were thinking about using some of that to spread around you know the the the bush beds and flower beds and stuff but another thing that uh one of my neighbors is doing and it it his yard looks really good is that hes not using any of the hes not collecting any of the um uh the the uh grass that he mows up at all he just lets it sit right back into the grass you know doesnt collect it in a bag or anything   umhum   and by doing that i guess it sort of acts like its own fertilizer   right   and uh it just makes the grass real thick and and green and everything and it doesnt cost anything   yeah they have a they have a mulching blade now it cuts the cuts the grass up real fine and you dont have to you dont  you cant even see it when it falls into the grass it it just penetrates right through to the ground   oh you mean so thats a separate blade   well i dont know exactly what it does but it cuts the grass a lot finer than than uh the old mowers used to do   uhhuh uhhuh do you think that thats like uh a blade that you can put on any mower or is it a special lawn mower the whole thing     uh its a special blade i mean they have mulching mowers but then they have a mulching uh mulching attachment too   oh really huh   that you can put on other mowers   oh ill have to look for that i didnt know it was a separate blade   i think i think its doubleedged   uhhuh   and it cuts it back and forth   oh okay oh ill have to look for that because that that would sure help us yeah i thought it was i thought it was just i dont know something special on the engine too as well or something   hm   huh have to look for that well is there anything else youd like to say   uh no thats about it   okay well it was very nice talking to you   nice talking to you   okay take care byebye   goodbye
