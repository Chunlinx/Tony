               okay   so what do you uh think is the uh the worst culprit for air pollution   well i think its its probably a combination of things um factories that that burn coal as uh an energy source with uh sulfur and nitrogen contaminants you know and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides   umhum   uh those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain and i think thats thats probably hurting us a little bit its hurting you know other countries its hurting Germany for example too and some other parts of Europe where they where they have high industry so were not the lone ranger here   yeah well its i uh its hard to put the finger on uh whats worse you know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion um with uh your hydrocarbons uh   yeah   causing the damage in which   hopefully were backing off from that a little bit but i know we havent cured it yet by a long shot   well well i notice on one of these uh home shopping networks they were selling these uh halogen uh fire extinguishers   yeah   and the halogen is uh an ozone depleter and it got hydrocarbons in there its a very clean uh fire extinguisher but its you know really bad on the environment   yeah huh yeah i guess i missed that one uh   yeah   automobiles of course are contributing too and you know how how we are with our love affair with the auto   oh yeah yeah   kind of hard to do anything about that i guess   i know uh in the Twin Cities area i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right but they had a new policy where in order to get your uh your license uh your car license uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards   yeah   and uh   we we have that here too but its part of the inspection sticker you know they put a probe in your exhaust pipe and and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out and   yeah   so thats you know thats the way theyre dealing with it here   yeah and yeah i guess that was just mainly in the cities there and i as far as where i live i dont have to do that but   yeah   i have an old car which i doubt would uh would uh pass the inspection a seventy six and uh you know theres no way i would put in a lot of money to to repair it to meet standards   yeah it probably be difficult anyway   yeah so although i do what i can to to cut down pollution but uh   i was just reading an article in uh Mother Earth News Mother Earth News Magazine   yeah   and uh theyve got a new um you know a lot of places are burning wood a lot of lot of people are burning wood those of us who have ive got a place in the country and uh   yeah umhum   and uh theyve had catalytic converters you know catalytic converters on those on uh i think theyre required in California and Oregon and and Washington but theyve had out those for quite a while and somebodys come up with a new one that uh sort of its a its a catalytic converter its a catalytic its a plate that fits in you know into the smoke pipe   yeah   and uh apparently it sort of feeds itself the more smoke is produced uh the you know after you get to like five hundred degrees the the higher it gets so the the more complete the combustion is and it sounds real neat i havent seen them priced anywhere yet but that that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know old old uh   yeah   older stoves that dont have any kind of EPA requirements on them that might help a little bit especially in some places were really lucky here we have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out   yeah   now sometimes we get a kind of a especially in in uh autumn it seems like we get a kind of a brown haze sitting on us but most of the time its blowing out pretty well probably blowing up there to you guys   yeah yeah well well around here our we get the well depends you know either in the in the winter time it it blows it your way and in the summer time  we probably get yours   yeah it comes back   yeah i really think that um you know were doing some some important things education uh raising consciousness awareness uh and i know school kids i work for school district here and uh you know this is one of the big things with kids kids are writing letters to the newspapers about you know uh telling adults to clean up their act and   yeah   its uh you know it  hope were not too late with it were were uh were having all kinds of recycling   yeah well it it thats thats a a big thing too i i know its has nothing do with air pollution but i kind of look at the way people treat our
