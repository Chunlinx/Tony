        i um think thats one of the greatest concerns that uh is in our nation today is the crime problem       what do you think   oh yeah well yeah theres a host a lot of things that center around that crime area uh you know from   umhum   from just uh people trying to make a living on the wrong side of the law to those who are just trying to uh keep their drug habit up and uh   umhum   so i think that it encompasses a whole lot of the concerns   i know in the large cities uh um we think that we have more crime but we have a place out in the country and uh weve had more  more people break into our place in the country than we have in town   oh really   and so i dont know that its confined just to the large cities   uhhuh   but uh we found that the crime rate in the country increased when they had let loose some uh early parolees and uh that concerned me because i was hoping letting the people out of prison early on for good behavior would work but i about decided it didnt   umhum   but um   yeah i i just dont know what kind of criteria they have used for most of those early parole leases releases so uh   i think sometimes it it depends on what space they need   thats right i think youre right   yeah   im sure it has a lot to do with it   do you think that that has as much to do with the rising crime rate as uh the uh beginning of the of the gangs and things   well i think um certainly that might have something to do with it but i also think that the standards of uh what we consider normal are is drastically changing each generation at least if not faster by because of the movies that are out there   oh yes   and what all the kids are exposed to and also the grownups out there that were just constantly watching and what we would of normally you know used to consider awful is almost a normal kind of thing on TV now and   i see what you mean   yeah and i so i think that its uh and also i think uh the way our lives our families are are uh being raised that with a lot more single families or a lot more fulltime working families that uh   umhum   there are a lot more strangers out there taking care of our kids and i i mean strangers in the sense of not the close family knit types that they used to have   umhum   and um i felt so i think theres a lot more people growing up confused and feeling not really considering uh you know necessarily as wanted or loved as they might have felt uh had the family been a little closerknit   umhum or maybe dont feel as responsible to anyone for their actions   thats thats right thats a good good way to say uh to say it   umhum well do you think that uh with the recession that everyone says is coming along and more women dont find work and have to stay home and the economy goes down do you think that would help um deter the crime raise and and increase raising of families   well i think it would be a long term change i dont think that we will see it too soon i think itll   umhum   not change i dont think it will slow down for quite some time just because theres you know its gonna take that pendulum a long time to swing back the other way   umhum well i see an awful lot of working parents who very very involved in their children   thats true   and um i dont know i know its hard especially to monitor television if youre not around   umhum   but uh   oh yeah i think there are definitely are ways that both parents can work and have recent you know responsible and and you know very loving children growing up and staying that way but i think it takes the effort and extra time and effort out of those parents and not too many not as many people are doing that as they should because were used to having an easy get it when you want it society and   umhum   uh you know uh the easy way out is considered more appropriate sometimes than than the working hard methods that  used to be   umhum i have a friend whos a principal in school and she said that a lot of the parents that she calls they just flat dont wanna be bothered   so right i think were all tired and having too many pressures and i just occurred when you mentioned principal it occurred to me when i was teaching how um it was becoming quite disturbing realizing how many crack babies were there were becoming you know out there in the educational area and   umhum umhum   and the things that well be dealing with just on the educational front that um are people that will children that will eventually grow to be older possible crime makers themselves because they started out in life with having so many you know uh   umhum
