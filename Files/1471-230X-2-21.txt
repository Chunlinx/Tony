                    Background        Primary Sjgrens syndrome SS is a systemic        autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes        keratoconjunctivitis sicca dry mouth xerostomia as        well as involvement of other exocrine glands While SS is        typically considered an autoimmune exocrinopathy the        immune destruction can often extend to affect nonexocrine        organs Around   of patients with SS can present with        involvement of other organs such as the thyroid central        nervous system lungs kidney and liver The association of        liver disease and SS was suggested more than  years ago            While liver involvement in SS has been considered        rare    only a few clinical studies specifically        address this complication and evaluate the association of        liver function tests abnormalities with the severity of        SS               Liver diseases associated with SS include primary        biliary cirrhosis PBCautoimmune cholangitis              autoimmune hepatitis      viral hepatitis B and C                      sclerosing cholangitis            and nodular regenerative hyperplasia     In        addition chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis has been found        in patients with different types of liver cirrhosis                           We report the results of a review of cases undertaken to        determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests        LFTs and liver disease in patients with SS referred to        a tertiary care center and the association of abnormal LFTs        with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of        SS                    Methods                  Statistical analysis          The statistical analysis included descriptive measures          means standard deviations and ranges Comparison of          results of patients with and without liver disease was          done using ttests of continuous variables and Fishers          exact test or x for categoric measures                            Results        Of the  charts reviewed  cases  women and         men median age  fulfilled EECC for SS and were        initially included for analysis Of the  patients a         of them  patients have had a salivary gland biopsy        performed In all these patients the biopsy confirmed the        diagnosis of Sjgrens syndrome All patients studied had        objective evidence of SS including keratoconjunctivitis        sicca positive labial salivary gland biopsy        autoantibodies andor salivary gland hypofunction We        excluded those patients without these objective criteria of        SS and also those who did not fulfill EECC criteria        The mean age at time of onset of disease was           years old and disease duration was  years   years        mean  range Liver function tests had been determined in         patients   and abnormal liver function tests were        found in  of the  patients   Further analysis        was then undertaken in those patients in whom LFTs had been        measured The clinical and laboratory characteristics of        these patients are shown in Tables and         For these SS patients studied abnormal LFTs were more        common than any other potential nonexocrine features of        SS Clinical evidence of liver disease defined in methods        section was found in  patients  all of whom had        abnormal liver function tests Two deaths occurred in the        population studied both attributed to liver failure An        additional patient required a liver transplant In all        cases the diagnosis of SS antedated the onset of liver        disease or its diagnosis Markers of viral hepatitis        sought in  patients were found only in  Two patients        carried the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus and one        had antibodies to hepatitis C virus In a liver biopsy of a        patient who lacked serological markers for hepatitis        viruses hepatitis B virus was detected by         in situ hybridization        Risk factors for liver disease were identified in  of        the patients with abnormal liver function tests and are        described in Table  No association with tobacco use was        found Only  patients had documented evidence of tobacco        consumption We found no significant differences in risk        factors for abnormal liver function tests among patients        with or without hepatic involvement Therefore in  of        the patients with sub clinical or clinical evidence of        liver disease no clear explanation for the abnormal LFTs        was found except for the association with SS        The pattern of biochemical liver abnormalities was        mainly hepatocellular defined as predominant increase of        AST andor ALT in comparison with AP andor bilirubins in         cases cholestatic defined as predominant increase in        AP andor bilirubins compared with AST andor ALT in  and        mixed evidence of both cholestatic and hepatocellular        damage in  cases Abnormalities were persistent present        on every occasion when measured more than once in         patients  of those with abnormal LFTs intermittent        presence of LFT abnormalities was not found in all        determinations in   and in one case  there was        only one determination of liver function tests The pattern        of liver enzyme abnormalities is shown in Figure  None of        the patients with abnormal liver function tests had        clinical evidence of muscle involvement that could explain        the high levels of aminotransferases Activity of CPK or        aldolase was not elevated when measured in  of the         patients with abnormal liver function tests        Antimitochondrial antibodies AMA and antismooth muscle        antibodies ASMA were sought in  patients with positive        ASMA in         The association of abnormal liver function tests with        other nonexocrine features of SS is shown in Figure         Patients with abnormal liver function tests were more        likely to have lung kidney or hematological        manifestations when compared to Sjgrens patients without        liver disease Presence of other nonexocrine features of        SS was not influenced by prevalence of liver        diseases        Regarding laboratory test results patients with liver        disease were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation        rate at some point during the course of their disease A        positive antiENA antiRo antiRoLa andor antiRNP        was also associated with an increased prevalence of        abnormal liver function tests Figure  The sample was        too small to determine whether a specific ENA was        associated with liver disease Other markers of systemic        inflammation or autoimmunity did not correlate with the        presence or absence of LFT abnormalities        Liver biopsies done in  patients disclosed postviral        chronic active hepatitis  cryptogenic cirrhosis         and one case each of postviral cirrhosis alcoholic        hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis                    Discussion        In this group of Sjgrens patients seen at a tertiary        care center abnormal liver function tests were found to be        a common nonexocrine feature of SS The prevalence of        this association was found to be higher in our study than        in other previous series          The true        prevalence could be even higher since liver enzyme profiles        were not done in all patients The prevalence suggested in        previous reports ranges from  to   but the definition        of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific eg        hepatomegaly to well proven cases of liver disease                   Denko in  reported that  of patients        with SS had hepatosplenomegaly     Other studies done        in the s also confirmed hepatomegaly in  of        patients with SS      In  Whaley reported liver        disease in  of patients with SS and mentioned an        association with antimitochondrial antibodies     In         Tsianos and coworkers described  SS patients with        gastrointestinal complications called from a large cohort        only two patients had liver disease each with chronic        active hepatitis     Other studies have reported        variable prevalence     and different        histopathological findings in liver biopsies ranging from        cholestatic liver damage stage I primary biliary        cirrhosis to chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis C        virus        In our study liver disease was associated with other        nonexocrine manifestations of SS specifically those        affecting lung kidney and blood cells Those patients with        serological evidence of systemic inflammation as shown by        an elevated sedimentation rate were more likely to have        liver test abnormalities Also the presence of a positive        antiENA correlated positively with hepatic disease An        association of ENA response with liver disease has been        described in children with autoimmune hepatitis where        antiENApositive patients demonstrated more severe liver        test abnormalities than those who were antiENAnegative            In another study a   of patients with various        chronic liver diseases were found to be antiRNP positive                   With etiopathogenesis of SS still an open question            a possible role of hepatitis C virus HCV has drawn        attention Recent studies have mentioned HCV incidence in        patients with SS ranging from                 Phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands        with immunohistochemistry in patients with hepatitis C        virus infection andor SS has given conflicting results            Some reports mention that the salivary gland        findings are strikingly similar in patients with liver        disease associated with HCV infection than in those with        SS     while others mention distinctive differences        between both groups regarding focus score expression of        surface markers in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary        glands and in epithelial cells as well as differences in        the degree of inflammation      Transgenic mice        models that carry the HCV envelope genes develop an        exocrinopathy affecting salivary and lachrymal glands            Expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ        between HCVinfection and SS Positive ENAs are rarely        seen in HCVpatients Also in most cases sicca symptoms        are not present in individuals with HCV as compared with        the SS population Although the prevalence of viral        hepatitis markers in our group of patients with liver        disease was very low and did not account for most of the        cases with abnormal liver function tests these markers        were not sought in a small percentage of these patients It        is important to note that HCV appears to account for a        subgroup of patients with exocrine complaints in which half        the cases might meet the definition for SS according to        European and Manthorpe criteria However this subgroup is        characterized by the absence of clinical manifestations        observed in SS and the absence of antiRo and antiLa                   An aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and        different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a        mechanism for the damage seen in different organs in  SS            Since it has been suggested that the target tissue        involved in the autoimmune histopathologic lesions of SS        might be the epithelium     it is interesting that the        findings in our study point to the association of liver        disease with pulmonary and renal abnormalities all which        are characterized by epithelial damage             Epithelial cells have been proposed to be active        participants rather than passive targets in the chronic        immune response in SS but further studies are needed to        establish the role of liver epithelial cells in the        pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease including        the analysis of HLA expression and cytokine secretion        pattern in these cells        The coexistence of liver disease and the presence of        circulating AMAs in Sjgrens patients sera has been        pointed as an indicator that liver pathology might be        autoimmune and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis               In previous studies a pericholangial        lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage I        of primary biliary cirrhosis has been reported in SS        with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for AMA             In our review of cases we found predominance in        hepatocellular liver damage rather than cholestatic        disease which would argue against a PBCtype of liver        damage Other authors had proposed that SS associated with        PBC should be considered a form of secondary SS that        resembles more the sicca complex with exocrine features        seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis             Limitations of the study come primarily from being a        retrospective analysis Since the patients were studied in        a tertiary care referral center the severity of the        disease and the prevalence of the manifestations might be        different from the general SS population Furthermore in        many cases Sjgrens syndrome diagnosis had been sought        because of otherwise unexplained nonexocrine features        While we could not find an association between use of        NSAIDS or other medications and prevalence of liver        function tests abnormalities the study design did not        allow us to exclude the possibility of overthecounter        OTC medication use that could have affected LFTs        measurement Drug toxicity is certainly an important factor        to be considered However given that most patients had        persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of LFTs        and that the use of hepatotoxic drugs was not elicited in        the majority of patients with liver abnormalities a toxic        effect of medications could not be established                    Conclusions        Based on the results of this study we consider that an        evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver        disease should be done in every patient with SS        particularly if there is evidence of other nonexocrine        complications or serological evidence of systemic        inflammation Although no other diagnosis explaining liver        disease may be found the disorders for which treatment        might be beneficial eg immunosuppressants for autoimmune        hepatitis interferonalpha for viral hepatitis        ursodeoxycolic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis warrant        a diligent search in all cases of SS with abnormal liver        function
