                                 Navel Gazing            People used to go to thebeach to see other people in an unusual state of near nakedness especiallygirls and stare at them in perfect freedom It was impossible to do thisanywhere else Magazines showed girls in sleek revealing swimsuits guystoo but that wasnt the same as real ones moving around some of them peopleyou actually knew It used to be the national pastime after baseball a summerthrill for everybody And then after admiring all the pretty girls on localbeaches you topped it off by watching the Miss America pageant and staring atthe prettiest girls in the whole country parading around in their bathingsuits on TV instead of the beach It was like dessert            Recentlythe pageant has got itself into trouble by implicitly acknowledging this truthabout itself It decided to allow twopiece bathing suits into the competitionAt the same time however the Miss America pageant stiffened up itsterminology so as to avoid calling the event a beauty contest or the girlsgorgeous The word is out to call the girls talented and confident and theevent a scholarship program It is I suspect this bit of doublespeak that hasreally set off the alarm alerting both the hypocrisysniffers and theexploitationofwomensbodies people at the same time            Excluding beauty is a ridiculous development for the MissAmerica contest Everybody knows that the pageant is about AmericasSweetheart the girl whose earnest desire to do good in the world and do wellin her work is most purely embodied in her lovely face and perfect figure Itspart of the wholesome old tradition equating Goodness and Truth with Beautyparticularly the beauty of women Its opposed to the wicked old traditionequating the beauty of women with Sin and Perdition Twopiece bathing suitsare so much a part of wholesome American life that the worlds wives anddaughters have been wearing them for decades and navels of all ages are acustomary sight            Socustomary have they become in fact that the pageants decision comes at thetime when bathing suits are no longer even considered particularly explosiveThe June issue of Vogue  for example showed several shots ofgirlsamong them Uma Thurmanon a sandy beach writhing in the surf wearinglong clinging evening dresses instead of bathing suits A current issue ofFrench Elle shows a sunny beach with three shots of wet girls in longprinted wrap skirts and longsleeved flowing shirts over their bathing suitsOnly one girl is wearing nothing but a bathing suit and it seemed to be madeof a very shaggy bathroom rug cut in two            Something has clearly happened to bathingsuits Of course something started happening to bathing suits as soon as theywere inventedthat is they got progressively more revealing Swimsuits wereinvented in the revolutionary s to permit mixed bathing on public beachesBefore that men and women bathed separately in the nude In due course wewound up with the modern swimsuit and the respectable nearly naked nuderatified for all time by the Miss America pageant and SportsIllustrated  In the beginning though a womans bathing suit was designedto repel the avid male gaze With their kneelength bloomers long stockingsand big thick belted tunic with elbowlength sleeves these outfits were allbusiness and no pleasure The advanced s permitted bathing suits to catchthe eye but only with nautical touches and a less engulfing shape under whichcorseting might be applied to sharpen the outline No skin could appear            The realchange in bathing suits began during World War I Even before that a radicalexposure in female clothing was underway skirts rose up and permanentlyunveiled the shoes necklines showing the collarbone began to be worn beforesundown Wartime excitement fostered the sense that the Brave Boys deserved athrill before they marched away and the truly patriotic bathing suit had todeliver some instant courage to the allied troops            The style of that era was set by the Mack Sennett BathingBeauties of the silver screen naked arms shoulders backs and armpits toppedoff skimpy costumes baring knees and an inch or two of thigh The tight corsethad vanished and dieting had yet to be invented so the jiggly female formshowed amply through the bathing suit And soon such daring beach wear couldshould and indeed had to be worn not just by actresses with doubtful moralsand a professional stake in their physical looks but by the girl next door Itwas all a matter of keeping the home fires burning and preserving the valuesthat mattered            Eversince it has been a part of every good girls duty heaven help her to adornpublic beaches and neighborhood swimming pools with eyestrikingheartstopping skinbaring bathing suits that provided less and less shelterwith every decade A girls respectability was forever sundered from theconcealment of her bodily factsquite the reverse it became attached to theirdisplay Consequently keeping the body fit for the task has been built intofemale basic training for four generations despite new shifts in the directionof female ambition and the foundation of new codes of female honor And thattraining still keeps the Miss America pageant in business despite theoccasional minor agitation that vainly urges it to stop the swimsuitcompetition            Lately however a shift in fashion hasattacked this ancient female habit of body and mind For one thing as the MissAmerica people have probably noticed vast tracts of oncehidden bare skin cannow be everywhere exposed in the public parks in the buses and subways inGrand Central Terminal Who needs the beach for the ritual summer thrillFurther degrees of exposure became impossible after the string and the thongcame in went out and returned And so whats happened to bathing suits isthat folks have lost interest in them except perhaps for the organizers ofMiss America            Even thetwopart fluffy carpet I saw in Elle seems just an awkward effort tostir things up A recent Paris Match tried to help by offering The MostExpensive Bathing Suits available this year all photographed by Helmut Newtonand worn by the unbelievable Eva Herzigova John Galliano won at  with ablack cottonsatin hourglass corset covered with jeweled sprays and stars andfaintly suggesting Jane Russell followed at a great distance by a Yoshibi Ishinuma bikini made entirely of swooping black coq feathersand a Robert Beaulieu bikini made entirely of pale mink available at a modest Thierry Muglers black satin onepiece took the sadomaso route withstark black bands clutching ribcage and upper thigh also for  Relief fromthis was offered by Dolce  Gabbanas twopiece in white lace and Lycraindistinguishable from the underwear of  and selling for only  Butsuch giddy stuff isnt really beach wear great though Helmut Eva andGalliano all are to contemplate at length            Extra daring nakedness has gone back to being the domain ofprofessionals the models who pose for nude photos or who wear runway couturethat bares the breasts buttocks and navel under transparent spangled veilingmeant for ballrooms not the beach Meanwhile the neat bikinis and onepiecesuits also shown in the June Vogue look like timeless fashion classicsphotographed on a perfect body in a manner suggesting the serene elegance ofantique sculpture We could easily follow along in that vein in our lessperfect versions and so can Miss America in her sweet one but whats trulygroundbreaking nowadays is to stroll on the sand or romp in the waves in afulllength dress
