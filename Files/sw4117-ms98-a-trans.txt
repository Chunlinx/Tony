        oh lets see um crimes and circumstances actually im im against capital punishment um probably not for the reasons that a lot of people are im against it because       i really dont think that uh there are any crimes that warrant executing a person and the reason i think that is because i really dont have the belief that uh any particular persons life is worth so much that you ought to take this other guys life for it i think you can either you know put him in jail for you know for some very long period of time or if theyre really you know mentally ill then i dont think they can really be held accountable for their actions anyway   umhum   so uh i just i im just basically against it       uh  i also i also dont have enough faith in our  our criminal justice system to to avoid getting the bloopers in there once in a while   well thats probably a pretty good objection um yeah actually im im in favor of it um well this ought to be an interesting discussion uh  um       i my basic reason is that uh if someone uh willfully takes a life of another individual um i think that they have in most cases forfeited um their convention by which they agree to abide to when when they enter into society um you know they have theres a a convention that you know you shall not kill other individuals um and if you can kill with impunity um then that kind of makes you king of the hill in a society that that cant control you uh and if youve shown that that you have such an utter disregard for other individuals that that you kill uh coldbloodedly or whatever then uh its probably uh a good thing to remove remove you from that society um and one probably one of the more effective ways of of doing that is through the death penalty uh because its a highly visible sort of action um and it also sends a message that you know this this sort of behavior is not tolerable within the society and you will forfeit all your rights uh if you engage in such activity   uhhuh well is isnt locking somebody up i mean equivalent to that   so well um yeah in a sense that you know that individual is removed from direct contact with society but that individual then becomes a burden to society a non productive burden   yeah do you i   uh because theyd sit there and i mean their quality of life is horrible uh because theyre rotting away in a jail uh and the taxpayers are paying you know for them to sit there and twiddle away and and make license plates or something   yeah yeah actually see im im sort of uh there are there are some other things im against im against also i think i think that jailing people for a really long period of time is is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual punishment which im also against   well yeah   so and so so im sort of in this quandary you know i mean either you have  either either you execute them       and uh youre done with it or you know you throw them you throw them in jail for some incredibly long period of time and then i think well i wouldnt you know you you dont want to be cruel to these guys and they say by throwing them in a jail where theyre you know theyre constantly abused or what other other brother or uh other other cell mates you know   umhum   so so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon you know where you       got to set up you know some incredibly safe rubber room but you know then when you set up the rubber room you know its so uh  its so antiseptic that its almost drives the person crazy if he isnt crazy already and so isnt that cruel and unusual punishment   right right exactly exactly   um on on the other hand i think there a lot of individuals who probably havent really signed up to the idea of you know our concept i mean most western peoples concept of civilization you know   umhum   and i i mean western in the sense of just you know western philosophy i guess um   okay   but  you know i i kind of dont buy into the idea that uh that to have a society you necessarily have to to you know terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because i think there are probably a lot of instances where um you get into a situation where somebody hasnt really signed up to being in that society and i mean they kind of consider it almost theyre protecting themselves or something and if society well for instance if society sort of forces themselves on somebody you know you hear it once in a while you hear about these incidences where uh   how so uh   some guy is you know off there in the wilderness or something you know  and and and he just doesnt wanna be part of society     umhum   and society kind of invades his turf you know makes him wanna or you know makes him makes him sort of abide by their rules when he really wasnt even known to society before and he winds up you know shooting somebody or you know killing a cop whos trying to get him to you know come in to pay his  theres a million theres a million things       you know that i can imagine million scenarios that i can imagine where the guy would be sort of like hey i dont wanna be in this society you know leave me alone you know and hed fight back and if he killed somebody you know hed get the death penalty you know
