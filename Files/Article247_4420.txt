                                 Something To Talk About                        Im sort of ashamed to admit I dont often read newspaper humorcolumnistsor newspaper columnists in general My memory from the time when Idid read columnists regularly is that even the very best of them tend to bataround  This is not I suspect their fault The economics of newspapersand the tastes of readers more or less dictate that a columnist has to appearat least twice and preferably three times each week Thats  words Veryfew people can turn out  words of penetrating insight every week As aresult columnists often tend to turn to fillermock outrage over the scandalof the day rants on solidly uncontroversial topics the New York Post sMaggie Gallagher I noticed devoted an entire column yesterday to advancingthe rather daring notion that adults should not have sex with children andin certain cases paeans to the comforts of their family Im pretty sure thatthere are few fates worse than being the child of a columnist struggling withwriters block and a deadline In the early s I could easily imagine AnnaQuindlen turning to one of her kids and saying Please for the love of Godsay something innocent yet wise And if it could have some bearing on acontemporary issue all the better            Again Im not really blaming the columnists here They have a deadline tomeet they have space to fill They do what they have to do But I do thinktheyre symptomatic of a larger problem Journalistic overcapacity Which is tosay we now have so many news outlets with so many writers that we are nowsaying far more than needs to be said covering far more than needs to becovered I might suggest that many of the miniscandals that pop up anddominate the news for a few cycles do so not because anyones legitimatelyupset or outraged over them but because people like you and especially meneed something to talk about Thus all the silly debates over say aflagburning amendment or the Sensation show Sure the discussions tend tobe reductive and overheated But at least theyre something to fill an hour ofHardball             This in turn ties into a favorite fantasy of mine I am invited to appearon Hardball With Chris Matthews to debate say flag burning I amintroduced as being for it I give my little speech They give such warmthand oh the rosy glow  And my opponentlets imagine CharltonHestonlights into me An outrage  should be ashamed to be an American an enduring symbol of our national freedom freedoms which you so clearly dontdeserve  And so on To which I reply You know Charltonmay I call youCharlton No OKI never thought about it that way Never thought about itthat way at all And now that you mention it youre quite right It is atravesty I agree with you completely We are now about five minutes into thebroadcast What we do with the remaining  minutes is a mystery to me
