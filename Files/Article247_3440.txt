                                 Hollywood Grabs Blair Witchs Coattails                        Judging from the fervent response to my piece on The Blair Witch Project  the role played by the Internet inthe success of this movie is not a myth One of the surprising things about theresponse though was how many people hated the film In part it didsound like a classic case of a movie that in two weeks went from being asleeper to being overhyped so that people who saw Blair Witch aftersay August  were led to believe they were about to see the greatest horrorfilm ever made But I was still surprised since I thought that the quality ofthe film was not something people would contest            In any case there are two other interesting points to make about BlairWitch as a marketingeconomic phenomenon The first is that the filmsmainstream successits now grossed more than  millionspeaks to thetremendous flexibility of even as hidebound an industry as Hollywood BlairWitch is owned after all by Artisan Entertainment a small independentdistribution company that specializes in true arthouse films like Wim WendersBuena Vista Social Club which you should by the way see at allcosts But Artisan was able to get Blair Witch into  theaters allover the country in the space of just a couple of weeks                           Blair Witch was obviously heavily hyped and the buzz on the film wasgood which undoubtedly made selling the film to theater owners easier than itwould otherwise have been But theres still something wonderful about thespeed with which theaters that normally would have had four screens showingDeep Blue Sea adopted Blair Witch instead Its an excellentexample of how quickly supply rises to meet demand with no planning involved atall            The second point is more mundane but also more curious and it has to dowith a weird new trend in movie advertising in which one film tries to takeadvantage of the buzz surrounding another film even though the two movies haveabsolutely nothing in common This strategy was used to great effect byAustin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me  which ran ads saying If you seeonly one movie this year see Star Wars  If you see two movies seeAustin Powers  That though was a clever acknowledgement ofreality What has followed seems more like a not very wellthoughtoutgimmick            First Austin Powers mimicked the ads for Big Daddy  with DrEvil and MiniMe urinating on a wall in place of Adam Sandler and that littlekid Then this week nascent bombinthemaking Detroit Rock City hasrun ads featuring the faces of its four main characters with the tagline InOctober of  four high school students disappeared outside DetroitMichigan Twenty years later their footage was found            This is of course a ripoff of Blair Witch whose ads featuredsimilar language But whats puzzling is the point of the ripoff Is it thatwere supposed to think the movie was made by the people who made BlairWitch  Or are we supposed to think that Detroit Rock City is somehowlike Blair Witch  Or alternatively are we just supposed to be amazedby the cleverness of the admakers and be inspired by that cleverness to seethe movie            The answer I think is none of the above Instead with the buzz onDetroit Rock City as bad as its been the marketing people essentiallythrew up their hands and decided that there was no point in selling the film aswhat it is Instead they wanted to see if they could catch a little haloeffect from Blair Witch Unfortunately even as I write this down itstill doesnt really make sense Who would ever go see one movie because its adcampaign consisted of an homage to another Detroit Rock City  Werenot a sequel to Blair Witch  but oh how we wish we were
