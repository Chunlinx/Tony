        okay we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it   okay well is your does your city have mandatory recycling uh recycling   no we dont have mandatory we actually were kind of slow up here and weve just started doing recycling probably last summer and its all voluntary so thats interesting cities have a mandatory recycling   um there theres some places that are strongly encouraging it then that the city will pick it up thats been one of the arguments here im just sitting here looking weve got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff but we have to carry it um some distance and some places um you can sell your uh recyclables and um for example um our church was was collecting newspapers   yeah when when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing we got like a penny a pound for them   well it turns out that so much the problem in Texas is that uh theyve got so much paper now from people recycling that theyve got no way to uh reprocess it   oh my   that it requires an extremely it requires uh essentially a paper mill to recycle it and so the value has gone down it turns out it wasnt worth it for the church to do   wow i didnt i didnt realize you would think now up here i i suppose they send it all back to the mill and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh actually there is one in northern Vermont so theres probably a paper mill thats sixty miles from here i didnt think that you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away its a lot of money to transport   well yeah well see thats in in Dallas there there no plan to build i think that theres some in East Texas theres some pulp mills but uh you have to go to Houston and uh its interesting and then theres places thatll buy metal and they still buy aluminum can in fact that   do you have to buy metal copper is a very good one to collect even aluminum yeah so   well do you do do you do recycling   uh we do do recycling and our city will pick up our recyclables they have these little blue bins um i dont recycle personally i im saying i want to do it   oh   but i dont get a lot of magazines i dont get a i dont buy the newspaper but i do have a lot of uh my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cardboard a lot of different papers and cardboards   well do you do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans   yes but we have a bottle return a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles weve had five cent deposits on our bottles for years   oh so its worth taking them back well see we dont have we have we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles   oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable its great for the kids because see a lot of the kids get the money from it and its great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes   oh thats interesting you know that you know that there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that uh my mother sells um       trees that they make paper out of and so every time i recycle newspapers uh in fact theres uh theres a uh Kimberly and Clark the the makers of kleenex and such   yeah   has a uh a big paper mill in fact i almost went to work for them i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me but its twenty or thirty miles from my house every time you recycle thats one less tree my mother can sell and uh so its a question should i be diligent and um um   and recycle   and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood   uh uh yeah i see that   but it it its an interesting point though that uh you know everybodys so anxious to recycle and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment but uh   but it takes away employment from the resource that its using   well but in general i think its a good idea because theres like the glass you cant argue that the glass it doesnt biodegrade and and uh the plastics obviously they dont   i do too uh they dont either   so we might as well recycle those   yeah like i say its not a very controversial thing everyone thinks we should do it its just that were so lazy i mean like personally i dont want to clean my i just have can cat food i dont want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin   yeah   you know id just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash   well thats what weve got ours we we started about New Years we decided wed get ambitious we took one load over there and now weve got these containers filling up with stuff and you know it it its not a very high priority thing to go haul these uh containers over there   well i think i i would be like when i bring my bottles back um if if if theyre pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over and bring them over now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if you said wash all the cans and things i wouldnt mind if it sat around too much but if if it stunk or something i wouldnt like doing it but um i produce quite a bit of trash my you know house and i see it but i dont see so much that i can recycle like i say its a lot of different type paper and cardboard im not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper   yeah   um pretty much and i and i dont know how they sort that but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would i would have a recycling center but now its just me and my husband so i dont know   but every little bit helps right   yeah i know what youre saying like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work and im the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin see some people the recycle bin is on their way out   what   instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash   well do you have separate trash cans at your desk   um no we dont but other other offices do they have a box for papers   well we have we have one thats recyclable and and then for uh lunch sacks and and waste food and and they gave us a list of things that arent recycle and it turns out its not so bad i i i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic or plastic like Saran Wrap or something anyway and then uh and cardboard theres a few interesting that were were recycling computer type paper   yeah   and and and uh one day theyll pick up uh the the cleaning people come through and theyll pick up recycled paper and then the next day theyll pick up the other so   oh   depending on how much uh you know and theres a lot of uh actually it works pretty well and then we have uh uh waste uh cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work and so   well thats thats a really good idea because um like our uh fruit fruit juices for some reason when theyre in a can dont come with a deposit it   oh   theyre theyre thinking about putting a deposit on them because pretty much you have to youre having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where theyre so much easier just to put a deposit on it because most   yeah   probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because theyre beer and soda but when they sell juice its some strange quirk in the law you dont have to have a deposit on it and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it but if its got soda in it it does so its a strange   thats an interesting distinction that   yeah they should they should clean clear that up it wouldnt take them much to put a stamp on uh on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda   yeah   so but redemption centers are a big thing up here they get a penny a can they handle they give you five cents and the when they return the can to the distributor i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can   well see well see those of us that dont have state income taxes yet thats the big debate here in Texas that they their the legislature wants to put one in and its interesting what people get upset about uh   yeah   it it really is the the   is bottle is bottle return down there a heated debate   well no the the big issue was is is uh when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck   oh yeah   and throw it out the at the and at uh so   well we well well well here you cant cant drink   were were now civilized now you can no longer you you cannot drink beer and drive but uh but it was it was actually legal   well yes well i know i was in Atlanta and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand but here let me put that in a paper cup for you  so that was strange but       i think if some people they have they say well were not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these um the the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to to recycle it and their problems already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits   yeah   see how they handle it and see if its a good way and then do it that way because as i like to say people are making money on it the cans do are worth something   well you know the other well the other thing is it also is is a is a a good habit uh to uh just to conserve resources you know whether you know because when you get in the habit of doing that you think in terms of of uh of of things like saving gas
