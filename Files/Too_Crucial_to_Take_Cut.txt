Legal Services Too Crucial to Take CutGerry L Alexander Chief justiceGerry L Alexander is chief justice of the Washington StateSupreme CourtOn Feb  Gov Gary Locke issued an order cutting nearly halfthe annual state funding for civil legal services   millionfrom the state budget Already strained to the breaking pointthis cut will devastate the civil equal justice delivery system inour stateFor the poor and vulnerable the justice system represents theplace of last resort  the place where essential rights areenforced and defended For thousands upon thousands who needprotection from domestic abuse wrongful eviction or the improperdenial or termination of essential governmental assistance ourstates civil legal services programs pro bono legal aid hold thekeyIf this budget cut is left unmitigated the governors actionthreatens irreparable harm to truly effective and important legalservices programs It is critical that the Legislature correct thissituation by replacing all or most of the amount cutI was a Superior Court judge in Thurston County in  Beforeme was a man with a toothless smile As I remember it the stateDepartment of Social and Health Services had agreed to pay to pullhis teeth out but due to a budget crisis the department decidedthat it would not pay for the dentures that he needed The man hadno money and could not afford to hire a lawyer However a legalservices lawyer from Spokane filed a lawsuit challenging thedepartments refusal to pay for the mans dentures I decided thatthe department had acted illegally The man got his teeth And inmy view justice was servedIn  there were three primary legal services programs in ourstate Together they had a force of  attorneys and theresponsibility to serve the civil legal needs of about  poorand vulnerable people throughout the state There were legalservices offices in  locations from Walla Walla to Port Angelesfrom Clarkston and Colville to Chehalis and Longview from Seattleto Spokane In those days the poor had a place to go and theyknew itThe picture is much different today The legal services programsthat existed in  are gone gutted by two decades of budgetcuts stagnant funding and increasing costs In their place we havetwo statewide providers of direct legal assistance to poor andvulnerable people They operate with a third fewer attorneys andmust try to meet the needs of a poverty population that has doubledto nearly  million While these attorneys are joined bythousands of volunteer attorneys who last year contributed morethan  hours of free legal assistance civil justice is stillunavailable for thousands who need it The  million cut willcause irreversible damageMost of us have no idea how many families and individuals arebarely surviving They are victims of domestic violence singlemoms trying to navigate the regulatory maze that strangles theirefforts to move from dependency to selfsufficiency fosterchildren who are maltreated migrant and seasonal farm workers whoare not paid or are forced to work in unsafe and unsanitaryconditions There are so many needing help each with a compellingand sometimes lifeanddeath story Until now the legal servicessystem has been able to support only an estimated  percent ofthose who need our help It is unfathomable to think about theimpact of further cutsIt is obvious that every social and human service budget willsuffer from very painful cuts as a result of the current budgetcrisis But legal services are not just social programs they arejustice programsLegal service programs are the only solution for thousands ofdisenfranchised Washingtonians who need to assert and enforce theirrights on matters of sheer survival And given the weak economyand the forthcoming budget cuts these people need more help rightnow not lessEvery day thousands of children in our state recite the Pledgeof Allegiance The pledge ends with an affirmation of the essentialpromise of our democracy  with liberty and justice for allTheUS Supreme Court building is carved with the words EqualJustice Under Law People in every corner of the world fight anddie for the American ideal of equal justiceBut does equal justice exist only for those with means topetition the courts Can equal justice exist where the laws cannotbe enforced because the poor cannot secure counsel Each time apoor person is denied access to the justice system  to assert ordefend important legal rights  a small piece of our democracydiesIn November  the Washington State Supreme Court created theTask Force on Civil Equal Justice Funding with  representativesof the Judiciary the Legislature and the governors office Thistask force is committed to solving the problem of adequatelyfunding access to civil justice in this state Formed three monthsbefore anyone knew the depth of the state budget cuts weadmittedly are alarmed How can we resuscitate an already sicksystem while enduring even deeper cutsThe Legislature needs to do the right thing for the people ofthis state It must act to replace all or most of the  millioncut from legal services It is our duty as a democratic society and as compassionate leaders in the state of Washington  to makesure that we really do ensure justice for all
