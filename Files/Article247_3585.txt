                                 Slander Patrol Did Bradley Flip Over Vouchers            Both the Republicans and Democratic supporters of Al Gore have been layinginto Bill Bradley for reversing his position on school choice New HampshireState Senator Lou Allesandro a Gore backer was quoted yesterday in theManchester UnionLeader saying that Bradley recently changed hisposition from provoucher to antivoucher for political expediency Thecurrent issue of Newsweek makes the same claim charging Bradley with aflipflop on the issue            The critics note that Bradley voted for experimental voucher programs in theSenate as recently as  but now says he doesnt think vouchers are theanswer to problems of education In an appearance last week in Clevelandwherea voucher program has been the subject of a heated court battleBradley alsoraised an objection to vouchers based on the separation of church andstate            Sounds like an openandshut case But Bradleys position isnt reallycontradictory Its perfectly consistentand reasonableto supportsmallscale experiments with vouchers while expressing skepticism about theirpotential efficacy and about whether they can pass constitutional muster Theargument is that since no one knows for certain what kind of education reformwill ultimately be most effective we should try a lot of different ideas on arelatively small scale This was in fact Bradleys stated position when hewas in the Senate Heres what he said about vouchers at a National Press Clublunch in                            I think the jury is out as to whether it actually would lead toan improvement of education I think that choice should be considered I havesome reservations about it but in the course of an education bill that movesthrough the Congress I think we can look at it thoroughly and it is apossibility As I say I have some reservations about it and I think that youhave to confront some of the basic questions about who will receive thevouchers And if you receive a voucher are you allowed to go to any school inthe state Are you allowed to go to only certain schools Are you allowed to goto public or private schools Are you allowedthere are  or  differentquestions that are raised by the issue of choice and education vouchers                        In  Bradley was one of three Democrats to vote for Bushsupportedlegislation that included funding for voucher experiments In endorsing thatbill which never passed Bradley made the same point again When it comes toeducation reform even imperfect notions are worth trying Choice may not bethe panacea for all our nations education ills he said in a speech on theSenate floor but we cannot afford not to take an honest look at whether moreoptions would help kids who today are trapped in the worst schools in ourpoorest areas            The only thing that would represent a reversal of Bradleys view would be acategorical statement that he no longer supports any experiments with vouchersThis is Gores position and the one demanded by the teachers unions Bradleywho is interested in vying for their endorsements may cave and contradict hisearlier statements on the subject But he hasnt done so yet
