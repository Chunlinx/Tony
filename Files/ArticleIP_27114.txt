                                  Firing Blanks            Inrecent days the National Rifle Association and its allies have argued thatadditional gun laws would not have helped avert the April  Coloradohighschool massacre because gun laws already on the books proved useless Whypropose more gun laws since the Colorado killers had broken  laws anywayasked House Republican Conference chairman JC Watts Jr ROkla Republicanpresidential candidate Gary Bauer  gun laws were violated and SenateMajority Leader Trent Lott RMiss  to  laws  We have lots of lawson the books echoed this construction The NRAs latest tally provided to                  Slate                Tuesday lists  laws allegedly violated in the massacreBut on closer inspection the list evaporates                           A Distractions The first four laws cited by the NRA concernbombs                            Possession of adestructive device ie bomb                                        Manufacturing adestructive device ie bomb                                        Use of an explosiveor incendiary device in the commission of a felony                                       Setting a device designed to cause an explosion upon being triggered                        Whatdo bomb laws have to do with gun laws According to the NRA nothingIncredibly weve been asked if we would support an instant check onexplosives purchases NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre noted with disgust ina speech at Saturdays NRA convention Well I dont have to tell you werenot the National Explosives Association So why does the NRA include bomblaws on its list To pad the total                           B                Tautologies Nine other laws on the listconcern the use of guns to commit the massacre                            Use of a firearm ordestructive device ie bomb to commit a murder that is prosecutable in afederal court                                        Possession of afirearm or destructive device ie bomb in furtherance of a crime ofviolence that is prosecutable in a federal court                                        Brandishing afirearm or destructive device ie bomb in furtherance of a crime ofviolence that may be prosecuted in a federal court                                        Discharging afirearm or destructive device ie bomb in furtherance of a crime ofviolence that may be prosecuted in a federal court                                        Conspiracy tocommit a crime of violence prosecutable in federal court                                        Possession of afirearm on school property                                        Discharge of afirearm on school property with a reckless disregard for anotherssafety                                        Intentionallyaiming a firearm at another person                                        Displaying a firearm in a public place in a manner calculated toalarm                        Thesalient feature of these nine laws is that the killers violated themduring the massacre not beforehand To say that these laws wereviolated is merely to say that the massacre happened ie that two kidswalked into a school and brandished aimed and discharged firearms in a mannercalculated to alarm people endanger the safety of others and further a crimeof violence It is meaningless to bring up these laws in a discussion ofprevention Like murder laws they are designed to prevent a killers secondcrime not his first                           C                Laws not violated or not known to have beenviolated                                        Possession of ahandgun by a person under age                                         Providing ahandgun to a person under age                                         Licensed dealersmay sell rifles and shotguns only to persons age  or over and handguns topersons age  or over  Persons under age  are prohibited from possessinghandguns from anyone dealer or not                                        Possessioninterstate transportation sale etc of a stolen firearm                                        Possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number                        It isnot known however whether the yearold perpetrator possessed the handgunused in the crime concedes the NRA The other perpetrator was  years oldAccording to the New York Times  the man who evidently bought the gunand passed it to the killers was  years old and investigators dont knowwhether he sold gave or lent the gun or which gunman  was the recipientAs for the other three guns the Times says the yearoldperpetrators yearold girlfriend has admitted buying two shotguns and arifle for him But she was not charged because it is legal in Colorado for aminor to own shotguns and rifles There is no evidence that any of the gunswas stolen Also the NRA concedes that it has only been suggested that atleast one of the firearms used in the crime had an obliterated serialnumber                           D                Duplicates Two statutes on the list banpossession of certain kinds of weapons essentially duplicating other statuteson the list that ban acquisition of those weapons                            Possession of ashortbarreled shotgun                                        Possession of a handgun by a person under age                                        E Formalities So the list of relevant laws known to havebeen violated boils down to one                            Manufacturing a sawedoff shotgun                        Thislaw prohibited the two perpetrators from making a sawedoff shotgun Howeverno law prohibited them from acquiring both a shotgun and a saw So this lawmeans nothing            Wouldthe additional laws proposed by President Clinton last week have made anydifference One of them would prohibit  to yearolds from possessinghandguns If that law had been passed and effectively enforced it would haveprevented the elder gunman from acquiring the handgun used in the massacreAnother of Clintons proposals would hold negligent parents liable for crimescommitted with guns by their kids This law might or might not have promptedthe parents of the Colorado killers to intervene before the massacre            It isalways possible that more gun laws would not have helped But the NRAs boguslist proves nothing
