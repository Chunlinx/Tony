                uh what is the last home repair that you did   oh gosh im trying to think well i guess ours have mostly been down at our lake house we built a house built a house down on Cedar Creek Lake   umhum   so i guess id have to say that because weve kind of let this house go   oh   so we had a shell built and then we did everything else   umhum   so it was quite a bit of work   yeah   what have you done   well uh repaired the back fence its uh well of course they get old you know after about ten years anyway but uh   oh yeah ours is nineteen years old   yeah the the street the alleys on a kind of a slant   uhhuh   and it makes all the fences tilt or or slowly you know   oh do you have to have like a retaining wall or   yeah somewhat right   yeah that makes them more difficult we weve just my husband has just um repaired repaired ours a lot it really needs to be replaced but we havent done it   umhum   but uh anyway well have you done anything else   um had to replace the the ridge row the shingles on the corners of the the roof from all the storms and everything   umhum umhum yeah   and uh   yeah i you know im wondering myself now why i checked this one because my husband is who does all the things like what youre talking about   right yeah   i havent done those things and of course you know inside stuff but um now down at the lake we had to like put in floors and put in wall and you know do the painting and the uh cut and make the like the uh window sills and things around the door and all that kind of stuff you know so we we did quite a bit   umhum   uh down there that i had never done or we havent done that much in our own house   weather proofing and   yeah yeah uh we do have still have a problem down there we built us a two story house and the bottom story uh oh its more like walk out basement   yeah uhhuh   and when it was built with these blocks you know these old gray blocks i think theyre called Hadite blocks   yeah   and uh we found now with some as much rain as weve had the past year it seeps through those blocks and comes into the downstairs and uh so now we have bought some uh   whats uh   uh water proofing paint   umhum   and thats our next project the next time we go down there weve got to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then hope that maybe that will do it but what they shouldve done i think is they should have put plastic or something like that against the house before they put the dirt back you know when it was built   right   and uh they didnt do that didnt think theyd need to   and then that its that its that white paint ive forgotten what its called Tight Bond or something like that and those bricks are very porous   yeah   and it soaks in to those bricks really well and it seals all the water out   oh have you ever used that anywhere   just a little bit   now people up north that have basements i think   yeah they use it all the time   you and do you know if it if theyve had good luck with it   yeah it seals the water out   we had a hard time even finding it down here in fact you know you go in a store and they say oh well that we dont have anything like that you know   right uhhuh   and then finally found some one somewhere that was familiar with it probably lived in the North   umhum   and well thats encouraging then because i havent known that many you know theres just not many basements down here are you from around here   yeah right yeah im from Dallas   oh okay well were from you know Texas too so   but uh uhhuh   uh but i we have a partner in this deal and hes from the North so he was the one that and it gave us a lot more space you know it gave us double the space   right   and toward the lake it looks like a two story house you know because it gradually the back it looks like a one story house you know   um umhum yeah and its set into the earth so   uhhuh built kind of into a hill a little hill you know   umhum   so it was a good idea to give us a lot more space for the money   right uhhuh   we just uh hadnt solved our  water problem yet   yeah   but we always
