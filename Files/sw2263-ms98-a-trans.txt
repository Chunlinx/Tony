              okay   okay they suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping   yeah what do you where do you like to camp how do you like to camp   oh i can camp just about most anyway  camping or uh motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up   i used to uh live in the Ozarks and uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods   oh really oh you really rough it then   yeah   uhhuh do you do that very often   i havent done it in quite awhile since i moved down here But i used to do it   uhhuh uhhuh   quite a bit   youd have a lot of hills in that down in that area   yeah yeah it was real hilly   yeah that would be really great   take a twenty two and go out   pardon   take a twenty two and find a creek   uhhuh that sounds like itd be fun did you go alone or with a group or   i used to go with my brother we just lived up there   uhhuh uhhuh oh thats great long as its not raining   yeah       it gets kind of i we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in   umhum   get out of the rain   really oh that would   but i dont know much about camping in Texas   uhhuh well im in Pennsylvania   youre in Pennsylvania   yes   i didnt know they did this   are you in Texas now   yeah   oh okay   yeah im down here at TI   most everybody ive been talking to is from Texas but uh were up here in western northwestern part of Pennsylvania   i used to be in Ohio its some pretty country up there   uhhuh well you kind of know what its like then   so   yeah but weve uh weve done uh many types of camping weve weve done tent camping and we had access to a motor home which is really super great  if you dont want to rough it too much   yeah you can get the   and uh   they have some nice camping grounds you know that have the water piped out   uhhuh uhhuh   just set it up and get out of get out of the city for awhile   right just get you away from the everyday things that are going on we when the children were smaller we used to go to uh Delaware along the ocean ocean most every year and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and uh we really enjoyed that   tell you what im losing you   huh   i said im losing you youre getting fade youre fading out   oh maybe my dropping my phone is that better   yeah thats     oh but   so what you try take a vacation every year and go out and camp   yeah well we used to we dont as much anymore but uh we used to we kind of slowed down a little bit but uh i think the worst the worst thing is when its raining if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping   yeah   then it can be kind of bad   i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks   uhhuh   thats kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping   i dont think i would like that what kind   uh Copperheads mostly   oh those arent too pleasant   no theyre   yeah we have some of them around here you probably have more there though i would imagine   yeah one year they were they were just everywhere i dont know what it was we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year there was   oh uhhuh   just Copperheads everywhere   uhhuh but you still backpacked and camped out   yeah well i lived down in down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time   uhhuh   if it rained we were stuck back in there had a four wheel drive so we could   uhhuh uhhuh   you just get used to it   yeah i guess you know enough to look where youre walking or sitting or whatever youre doing yeah   yeah   yeah i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too   yeah this cave that we used to go in was little it was small it was more   uhhuh   yeah it was just big enough for a couple of people to  sack out     uhhuh is your brother younger than you or   yeah hes about a year and a half younger   uhhuh uhhuh well thats great thatd be a lot of fun you have a lot good experiences from that yeah   yeah yeah it was saw a few bears   did you really   things like that   what black ones   yeah   yeah that would be exciting   yeah the first first couple of times its pretty scary but uh       after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too so   yeah yeah theyre usually more afraid of you than uh you are of them usually   but   theyre on the increase in this area   oh really   umhum   i dont know if they dont have them up there do they   the black bear oh yeah yeah the populations been really really up theyve uh   yeah oh do they   theyve had longer hunting seasons than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much   yeah they down here they they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them i dont know what its like now i havent been back up there in awhile   uhhuh yeah but uh we we really like camping i i must say that uh we have we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping and uh   well its good to get out and smell some fresh air too   yeah yeah   so   its just so its a lot of work too its uh getting you know getting ready and taking care of everything but its um   yeah   its really refreshing so   well i think were about to run out of our time   i think so well it was really good hearing from you and i hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it   yeah yeah im sure i will   okay thanks a lot and you have a good day okay byebye   you too bye
