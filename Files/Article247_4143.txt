                                 Al Gore Harasser            So far there have been three distinct phases to Al Gores campaign In thefirst phase which lasted until early autumn Gore highhandedly ignored thefellow running against him in the Democratic primaries In the second phasewhich lasted until midNovember Gore shook up his staff welcomed BillBradleys exciting challenge and began responding to it as a vigorouscompetitor Unfortunately Gores campaign has now entered a third much moreaggressive phase in which he nips too eagerly at Bradleys ankles and attemptsto bury his rival under a mountain of inconsistent and often spuriouscharges            In recent days Gore has passed up no opportunity to whack Bradley He hascriticized him over the cost of his healthcare plan its consequences for avariety of different minority groups for his past positions on SocialSecurity for his lack of a position on Medicare and even for not sayingwhether he would reappoint Alan Greenspana decision that will belong to thecurrent president not the next one As my colleague Will Saletan recentlyargued in a Frame Gamecolumn theres nothing wrong with negative campaigning per se But if some ofGores criticisms of Bradley are fair others are totally unfair and all arepart of a transparent effort to keep his opponent on the defensive Itsobnoxious political behavior So why is Gore baiting Bradley like a schoolyardbully            You can get a better sense of what Gore is doing by looking closely at oneof his latest onslaughts over the largely phony issue of whether Bradleyintends to raise taxes Last week Bradley sat down for an interview with the Washington Post  Asked what hewould do if his healthcare plan required a tax increase Bradley quitereasonably responded that he doesnt believe it will require a tax increasebut that if it does his options would include cutting other spending orraising taxes and that he would make a judgment at the time He was doing whatany wise politician does which is refusing to indulge a hypotheticalquestionthough even his nonanswer was more than he should have saidBradleys response looked like a juicy patch of exposed flesh for his crazedpit bull of a rival In todays Washington Post  Senator Bradley statedhe would be willing to raise taxes to pay for his trilliondollar healthcareplan said a press release sent out by the Gore campaign on Dec  Thatmight be his worst idea yet            Gores criticism of Bradleys comments was unfair Though various analyseshave suggested that Bradleys healthcare plan may require more funding thanBradley has yet acknowledged in order to be effective Bradley has offered aplausible plan to pay for his proposal out of projected budget surpluses Andin his interview with the Post  Bradley didnt put forward raising taxesas an idea He said that because he couldnt predict what would happen to theeconomy it wouldnt be prudent to rule out raising taxes in the futurecategorically            Bradleys campaign answered Gores taxraising charge by pointing out thatBradley and Gore have essentially the same position on future tax increasesNeither thinks raising taxes will be necessary to pay for their own variousinitiatives including healthcare reforms Nor has either of them made areadmylips pledge not to raise taxes under any circumstances and indeedGore campaigning in Washington DC specifically declined to make such apledge today In fact Bradleys campaign might have gone much further inpointing out the disingenuousness of Gores attack Having campaigned with BillClinton on a middleclass tax cut in  Gore reversed himself and supporteda necessary tax increase in  Moreover Gore has supported tax increaseson tobacco as recently as this year Also it just seems crazy for Democrats tostart demanding no new taxes pledges from other Democrats Then againRepublican candidates are now charging each other with endangering SocialSecurity which suggests that each party has to some extent been brainwashed bythe others propaganda            Bradleys mild rebuttal provided an opportunity for Gore to slam him evenharder Bill Bradleys zigs and zags over the past few weeks raise questionsabout his steadiness as a possible steward of the American economy Gorespokesman Chris Lehane said in his next release dated Dec  One day he sayshell consider new taxes to pay for his flawed trilliondollar healthcareplan The next day he says he didnt really mean it  These are confusingenough messages from Candidate Bradley Just think what those statements woulddo to the markets if they came from a President And in a subsequent pressrelease issued the same day entitled Can We Trust Bill Bradley To Keep theEconomy Strong Lehane added Within the past few weeks Bradleys statementsraise questions as to whether or not he has the vision and the experience tokeep the economy strong Gore repeated these charges in person at anappearance yesterday at New York University Law School where he received anendorsement from former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Gore accused Bradleyof proposing a tax increase and described Bradleys and Bushs approaches tothe economy as if it aint broke lets break it            The unfairness of Gores accusations escalates in response to Bradleysattempts to defend himself Whether Bradleys position on tax increases isreasonable or not he clearly hasnt zigzagged on the subject Hes beenentirely consistent But a nearuniversal assumption in politics says that acandidate has to respond to charges made by serious opponents lest thosecharges be generally accepted as true So Bradley once again answered Goresaccusation this time by getting two supporters with credibility on economicissuesformer Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Henry Kaufmanto issue astatement defending him This prompted the Gore campaign to put out yet anotherrelease accusing Bradley of stonewalling and somewhat bizarrely ofnamecalling            Gore seems to be assuming that if Bradley has to spend his time answeringsuch charges he wont be able to get his positive message out But Goresstratagem is even more diabolical than that As one Gore aide explained to methe pepperspray of criticism leaves Bradley with a Hobsons choice Either heignores it in which case the charges damage him or he responds in kind inwhich case he diminishes his carefully cultivated reputation forhighmindedness Once Bradley descends from his pedestal and begins tradinginsults with Gore he loses his aura of saintliness and becomes just anotherscrapping politician            I dont think Bradley has quite figured out how to deal with this dilemmaHis press secretary Eric Hauser told me that Gores assault is not changingour strategy It is not changing the dynamics of the race Bradley himselftold the Post that he is intent on running a positive campaign and thathe intends to shoot back only when Gore hits him with something outrageousWhat Bradley doesnt seem to have banked on is Gores accusing him of somethingoutrageous every few hours
