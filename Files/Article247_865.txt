                                 Kosovo KissOff            The LosAngeles Times leads with the renewed outbreak of fighting between Serbsand Albanians in Kosovo as the peace talks in France falter The New York Timesoffleads that development but leads with a story first tipped by the Wall Street Journal yesterday the Clinton administrationsdecision to reject the sale of a  million satellite to a Chinese businessconsortium because of concerns about hurting US security and boosting Chinesemilitary capabilities This story is also on the LAT front BothTimes run top front pictures of refugees fleeing from the fresh Kosovofighting documenting that their number includes horses and babies TheWashington Post also offleads Kosovo but its leadis yesterdays signal from the House Republican leadership that despiterecently endorsing a  percent acrosstheboard tax cut it will no longerpress very hard for it because says the paper of stiff opposition from GOPmembers of Congress who fear the plan is too costly and politically riskybecause it smacks of favoring the rich Into this breach explains thePost  will go an attempt to scale back the marriage penalty paid by manytwoearner couples and other targeted tax relief proposals USA Todaygoes with the upswing in federal health care fraud prosecutions resulting inunprecedented numbers of doctors and administrators going to prison Sixtypercent of these cases involve bogus Medicare billing The storysheadlineFeds Triple Health Fraud Casescommits the sin of a vacuouscomparison but the body explains that the baseline year for the comparisonwith current prosecutions is             The LAT lead describes the erosion of the Kosovo talks It spells outthe stumbling blocks the Albanians want an eventual referendum on independencewritten in and the Serbs are balking at the interposition of a NATOpeacekeeping force Meanwhile according to the LAT  the tacticalsituation is likewise deteriorating The Yugoslav army and police are nowmoving large numbers of troops and vehicles around Kosovo in violation of theOctober ceasefire And some of the  unarmed monitors of that agreementhave come under attack from Serbian mobs and some have been beaten byuniformed Serbian police            Its becoming clear from the coverage that the US negotiating strategytoget the Albanians on board and then threaten the Serbs with airstrikeshascome a cropper because US and NATO diplomats have been in the NYT swords flabbergasted by the Albanians especially by the Albanian guerrillasin the delegation The LAT says the Albanians frequently argue amongthemselves The paper notes that theyve never had to make collective decisionsbefore And as one US official tells the WP  We cant jam the Serbsuntil we get the Albanians on board            The NYT points out that the administration suppression of theChinasatellite deal reverses its yearslong policy of promoting such commercialsales making it likely that China will interpret the quashing of thistransaction as a fundamental retreat from US policy encouraging expandedeconomic relations The paper says the Commerce Dept approved of the sale butthat State and Defense opposed it on the grounds that the technology involvedcould result in making Chinas ICBMs more accurate The paper pushes down tothe th paragraph news that States concerns included questions about thebehavior of Hughes Electronics the satellite vendor in the consummation ofprior Chinese satellite deals in which questionable briefings to Chinesescientists and a questionable hiring of a son of a Chinese general took placeThis suppression of news is particularly odd here because these very relevantfacts were turned up in previous Times stories            The WP and NYT go inside with news that in an alternativeuniverse would be explosivea federal judges finding that two cabinetsecretaries Interiors Bruce Babbitt and Treasurys Robert Rubin are incivil contempt for failing to produce records of accountsheld in trust for Indians by the government The Times doesnt mentionthe names of the two men until the sixth paragraph Also the paper nevermentions that the judge in this case who suggested the failure to producesmacked of official deceit had previously harshly ruled against theadministration in the matter of whether or not closed meetings of theHillaryled health care task force were illegal levying a  fineagainst the government The Post goes right out of the box with mentionsof Babbitt and Rubin and cites the judges previous ruling            In reporting on the news that blue
