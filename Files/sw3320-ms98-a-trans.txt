        were supposed to talk about crime in the city     umhum   and uh  seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesnt it   well uh i uh thats sure um i think i think its statistics statistics obviously vary greatly i always thought of Dallas as being a fairly safe place   well it is but our crimes up here uh is i think it must be in most cities now but i was listening to the news the other day and they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because of the uh so many people are without work nowadays economys so bad   do you really believe that i mean it its been up every year for many years and the economy hasnt been this bad for so long has it   well thats a good point   thats just what they quoted over the news     yeah   uh i dont know if ill believe that or not but it it does seem up and uh   what kind of newspaper do you get down there   what kind   yeah   well we got a i think we got a pretty good newspaper uh we have two the Morning News and the uh Times Herald   umhum   Morning News seems to have the largest circulation i think its a pretty good its a locally owned paper the Herald is owned i think by the Times out of uh LA or somewhere   umhum yes do do they do they play up the local crime angles or do or do they   but well they dont no not really uh they dont play it up i dont think uh but there there is too much of it you know uh too many homes broken into we had our our fact about uh last year sometime our home was broken into   umhum yeah really so this is a topic of personal interest   we yeah we uh uh i didnt think ours ever would be burgled into burgled but so many in our neighborhood had been and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main   umhum   street but uh we were so uh   yeah so so you saw this happening in your neighborhood and you figured it wouldnt happen to you   sort of yeah and i never did get a security system but since that happened i certainly have   yeah what kind of system do you have   its uh  uh  i guess excuse me just a standard uh with the uh all the doors and uh uh infrared thing you know motion detector pretty pretty standard   umhum is is this is this one with some company that that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff   yes yes its monitored and all that uh   yeah well is is that a necessary feature to have somebody you know at the other end of the line or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise   and i think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would would suffice i really do   yeah   but uh this deal that was part of it for you know three years or so you pay the unit off or whatever   yes umhum   and uh but it uh the monitorings not that bad though because uh uh weve goofed it up you know several times youll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something and  and they call back pretty quickly so i i guess its you know i think its all right but i to answer your question i think uh uh i think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it   um hum yeah so so so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line   umhum well its got a back up system that doesnt work supposedly that uh if its cut supposedly it notifies them anyway       supposedly who knows you know   how does it do that   but thats the selling point and i think theyre probably i think it probably does these things are supposedly supposedly pretty good   umhum   boy they sure advertise them you know so many of them nowadays   oh sure   but uh well dont yall dont yall have a pretty high crime rate up there   well yeah um   im not saying its any higher than anybody elses down here we seem to or or not here but the statistics seem to say that i dont know   i i think its the murder capital of the country now   is that right   yes   i would gather probably from drugs   absolutely   and i think thats the reason its so high everywhere   yeah   but i dont think theres anyplace  used to years ago you thought well these little small cities and all  wouldnt have that problem but they do   yeah   weve had relatives that their children were just as involved in it uh as anyone you know   so so so whats the solution   thats a good question i dont know i dont know what the solution is i really dont   and all these politicians make make hay over you know being anticrime but   yeah yep   they havent seemed to have changed anything   the and nothing seems to change and uh im not sure that anything will because these  if something could happen to make these people not wanna buy it   umhum   uh but they wanna buy it so supplying and demand long as somebody wants to buy it somebodys gonna provide it for them   yeah   so i dont know i dont  you know i dont know what the solution is i really dont   yeah   i dont think anyone does in fact   and what
