                                 The Cubist Republican            Gertrude Stein was not myaunt although I sometimes fantasize that she was The notion that I am herrelative and a member of her charmed circle is  percent crazy but its not percent crazy Gertrude and I share the name Stein and we are both JewishAnd I have recently discovered another affinity We are both Republicans            The ideathat this revolutionary in literary style this patron of bohemians andradicals this most famous lesbian since Sappho was a Republican is staggeringand delicious Just imagine what Jesse Helms Pat Buchanan and Jerry Falwellwould think if they knew Other avantgarde writers were conservatives of atype Ezra Pound was a fascist conservative TS Eliot a highchurch elitistconservative William Faulkner an antique Southern gentleman conservative ButGertrude Stein whom I will call GS for brevity was a mainstreammiddleAmerica smallgovernment Republican She was not a RockefellerRepublican even though Rockefeller endowed the Museum of Modern Artcelebrating the artists she was among the first to recognize She was more likea Coolidge Republican even sharing her literary style with Cal He soundedlike GS when he said When people are out of work there is unemployment Thesuperficial simplemindedness of the statement makes one think there must besome deeper meaning beneath it            In January  GS said that Republicans are the onlynatural rulers in the United States What was special about the United Stateswas that its individuals were free and its government was small somethingTheodore and Franklin Roosevelt did not understand When I say Theodore andFranklin Roosevelt are not American I mean they do not feel America to be avery large country around which anybody can wander and so although a governmentis there it is not always anywhere near but they feel it to be a little countrywhich they can govern and so it is European and not American            TheodoreRoosevelt was of course a Republican but GS did not consider him anauthentic one It is not that Theodore Roosevelt destroyed the republicanparty that might have happened anyway She saved her real dislike for FranklinRoosevelt saying that Democrats were elected president only if they had asingular seductiveness Roosevelt Franklin was honestly elected but he isnot half as seductive as his predecessors so I dont think he will be electeda second time            Her dislike of FDR was based partly on economicpolicy Is Franklin Roosevelt trying to make money be so that it has noexistence that it ceases to be a thing that anybody could count so that nobodycan any longer believe in it or is it all electioneering she asked If hisgoal was ridding people of the belief in money so that they would no longerbelieve in it GS thought it might be a good thing But what FDR really wantedshe believed was a lot of money at his disposal so that he could controleverything            GS gavethe most extensive view of her thoughts on economics in a series of articlespublished in  in the Saturday Evening Post  the house organ of MainStreet Republicanism Her basic theme was that governments spend too muchAccording to GS the unemployed do not want to work and if there were fewerrich people there would be more poor people Although FDR is not mentioned byname in her pieces its evident that he is the main culprit            The first article Money starts with this simplebrasstacks statement                           Everybody just has tomake up their mind Is money money or isnt money money Everybody who earns itand spends it every day in order to live knows that money is money everybodywho votes it to be gathered in as taxes knows money is not money That is whatmakes everybody go crazy                        GSs point is that thegovernment officials who tax and spend do not realize what money is to thepeople who earn it But because money really is money those who tax andspend should treat it the way that the earners treat itbut they dont Thereis trickery or confusion in GSs argument Of course money is money but thereare different kinds of money and the different kinds need to be regarded andmanaged differently Each soldier in an army division is someones son but wedo not expect the commanding general to manage all of them the way theirmothers would            Governments may be wasteful in managing money but the only evidence GSprovides is in the story of Louis XV who when accused of spending too muchsaid After me the deluge The story was singularly inappropriate inthe deluge had come after Coolidge and Hoover and Roosevelts spendingwas an effort to stem the deluge or at least to keep some people from drowningin it            GSs Saturday Evening Post articleseerily suggest words we were to hear  or  years later The Louis XV storyreminds me of one of Ronald Reagans favoritesabout the Muslim philosopherwho said that the king came to the throne with high taxes and departed with lowrevenue Is money money similarly presages Bob Dole on the  campaignstump reminding people Its your money Its your money Its your moneyAnd when GS asks who is to stop congress from spending too much money Theywill not stop themselves that is certain I imagine her testifying beforeSen Orrin Hatch about the balancedbudget amendment            How did this unconventionalwoman arrive at these conventional ideas I never spoke to my aunt and I amnot a student of the large literature by and about her But if she could writeabout fiscal policy perhaps I can speculate a little about her            She waseither terribly ignorant about economic affairs or terribly foresighted Shelived abroad continuously from  until  when she returned for a USlecture tour and then departed never to return She missed the worst part ofthe Great Depression She did receive American newspapers in Paris which weknow because of the story of her giving the comic pages to Picasso but weorat least Idont know what news accounts she read Had she been more aware ofthe despair of the Depression she might have been more understanding ofFranklin Roosevelt            One might say that GS had such great understanding of humannature that she could see beyond the Depression beyond World War II beyondthe Cold War to the fiscal problems we would have in  One could say thatbut I dont believe it She was not a woman of great foresight about publicevents Living in France in the summer of  she rejected the opinion ofwellinformed people that war was imminent            Howeverignorant of economics she may have been there is one economic fact that allAmericans living abroad knowthe exchange rate Before FDR devalued thedollar GS could get  francs for each dollar of her American income Afterthe devaluation the rate was  francs to the dollar a drop of  percentI can easily imagine her being greatly annoyed at FDR for that            GS was not the stereotypical poor and alienatedintellectual who was an enemy of capitalism She always had a comfortableincome derived from her inheritance and supplemented after she turned  byher publishing royalties She also had great investmentsin PicassosMatisses and other paintings Far from being alienated she was theinternationally recognized grande dame of a group of rising geniuses And shewas not an intellectual having little interest in general ideas abouteconomics or politics The real ideas she said are not the relation ofhuman beings as groups but a human being to himself inside him and that is anidea that is more interesting than humanity in groups            It seems to me that her viewof society was cubist like the paintings she was early to appreciate and theliterature she wrote A cubist painter tried to decompose an object into theatoms that were its real essence He could paint a violin as a number ofsuperimposed geometrical shapes of varying shades of brown GS tried to revealthe essence of communication by stringing together heavy words without thepunctuation connectives adjectives adverbs and allusions we are accustomedto She understood society or was interested in society only as a collectionof individual human beings not bound together by any political or economicsystem            This attitude has itsmerits but it also has its drawbacks No one can play music with the cubistsidea of a violin Very few people could understand GSs writing Her atomisticview of society nourished her assignment of a high value to individual freedombut it limited her ability to understand much that was going on in theworld            As GS might ask what is thequestion to which this essay is the answer Perhaps there is none Every answerdoesnt have a question But one lesson of this essay is that the Stein familylike every other family contains some surprises
