Using Tech Tools to Serve The Underservedby Wendy R LeibowitzLexisONETechnology is slowly transforming pro bono efforts on and offthe Web But there is still a long way to goPro bono has come a long way in a short time Susan M Hoffmanthe pro bono coordinator at Washington DCs Crowell Moring regularly receives queries from nonprofit organizationsvia email She compiles the emails into different messages anddistributes them to lawyers in her firm who volunteer sometimesvia email to take the casesI have a political asylum email list a domestic violence lista hotline list and so on she says She carefully notes thereferring organization  Catholic Charities Legal Network or theFair Housing Council of Greater Washington  in each emailMs Hoffman also maintains her own database of attorneyinterests I can go in and search and pull up an attorneyinterested in child abuse and neglect so when I get a case I cantarget it she saysRecently she had lunch with some of the referring legalassistance organizations to try to improve their recruitment andmatching efforts even more She also sends around pro bono emailquestionnaires to find out which types of cases attorneys are mostinterested inTechnology is transforming pro bono but there is a great deal todo particularly as many legal assistance agencies still lack basictechnology such as Internet connections Those places needdonations of good equipment as much or more than they needdonations of lawyer hoursBut as lawyers try to meet demands with technology the basicneeds remain meeting the need for legal services among the poor orunderserved Some of the unmet needs are among people who can paybut who are deterred from seeking a lawyer because of theuncertainty about legal fees and their fear of the professionThe British writer Richard Susskind calls these potentialclients the latent market Small firms and solos are ideal forsuch clients but the clumsy sometimes impersonal referralnetworks and the prejudice against flatfee billing serve as hugebarriers between client and lawyer Slowly Web sites are emergingto serve them Divorcelawinfocom helps people educate themselvesabout divorce MyCounselcom is aimed at small businesses andthere are many others including Nolocom which helps people helpthemselves without a lawyer But there is little public awarenessof these sites at presentA recent front page story in the New York Times featured afifteenyear old boy who was answering legal questions on a Website called Askmecom with knowledge he gleaned solely from CourtTV and Judge Judys televised courtroomDespite public perceptions to the contrary there is anenormous gap between those in need of legal assistance and thelucky few who manage to find a lawyer to counsel them says EstherLardent president of the Pro Bono Institute Technology is oneimportant tool to help bridge this gapby making it easier forlawyers and clients to find each other making basic legalinformation more easily available and demystifying the law so thatpotential clients are more willing to seek legal helpThe need is great Even after it was revealed on AskMecom thatLawGuy was only fifteen years old people continued to askfor him by name For one thing LawGuys answers were clear andprompt while the actual lawyers answers could be turgid filledwith statutory language including formal citations sometimesposted long after the question appearedBut its clear that there are indeed lawyers out there manyfrom small firms who are ready and able to help The problem isthat boards like AskMecom dont do a good job of matching lawyerswho are licensed in a particular jurisdiction or in the case ofLawGuy licensed at all with clients in the same areaThe need to distinguish between ANY legal information whichLawGuys can provide and GOOD guidance which knowledgeable lawyerscan provide remains paramountOne area where lawyers are reaching out effectively to clientsover the Web is immigration law Sites such as wwwvisalawcom orwwwshustermancom provide a wealth of information in severallanguages free email newsletters and uptodate targetedguidanceGreg Siskind who launched Visalawcom says he is working onbuilding personal secure Web sites for each client who wants oneso people can check the status of their cases without having tocall the firmTight immigrant networks the personal kind help publicize themost effective attorneys And immigration is ideal for the Webits a federal formsbased practice that rarely requires meetingthe clientBut in practice areas other than immigration linking lawyerswith clients still revolves around either asking your relatives andneighbors if they know a lawyer or calling a bar association andgetting the next name on the list A plethora of listings areavailable at Lawyerscom but the amount of information is almostoverwhelming to the noviceRecently the American Bar Association launchedFindlegalhelporg Like like many ABA sites it takes a while todownload and it requires a few clicks to actually find a lawyerbut once you plow your way through a few screens you find that theABA has placed an asterisk next to associations that have earnedthe ABAs approvaliLawyercom Chicago Bar Association Los Angeles County BarLawyer Referral Service Assoc of the Bar of the City of New YorkLawyer Referral ServiceOf course if youre not in those areas youre back toAskMecom or FreeAdvicecom or RipOffCitycom Some wonderful legalservice agencies such as the National Association of PublicInterest Lawyers NAPIL at wwwnapilorg have Web sites thatare devoid of explanations about what public interest lawyersreally do and which appear to be so corporate in appearance thatthey could just as easily be an Annual Report Many of thematerials are posted only in PDF portable document format whichmust be downloaded to be readPrivate practioners must step up to the plate to reach out tothe clients online if only to save the image of the professionfrom LawGuy and NAPIL Remember that contacting legal agenciesfor pro bono clients can lead to paying workVolunteer Lawyers for the Arts Veterans Organizations theLegal Aid Societythese are networks bigger than most corporatenetworks involving contract disputes benefits work contacts withlarge government agencies that themselves could be the source ofwork Arts contacts bring in contract disputes copyright disputeseven international artistic disputes as when a young artistdisplayed his work in Brussels only to see his work destroyedWhen small firms and solos do use technology to help smallerclients the resulting publicity can generate much good will Solepractitioner Carolyn Elefant frustrated thatUS Supreme Court cases were posted all over the Web butresources needed to help people in benefits cases adoptionmatters and landlordtenant disputes were not built her own probono library on her Web site at wwwhiscomIsraelloceprobonopro bonohtml In addition to being a wonderful library ofresources it has become a source of referrals she saidIndeed new Web sites can now be a destination for those coldcalls or emails seeking legal help that used to be turned awayor sent to the state bar association As most laws varystatebystate queries from outofstate used to meet a dead endBut now criminal law queries can be referred to Families AgainstMandatory Minimums at wwwfammorg a national group that might beable to help a caller no matter where the person is in the UnitedStates More such sites are neededA major Web site dedicated to pro bono called ProBononet isseeking firm to mount and maintain pages within its site dedicatedto particular issues Crowell  Moring may take on anEmployment Law page says Ms Hoffman Basic grunt work such asputting form documents and templates on the Web is still neededDrafting a complaint in a custody case is pretty rudimentary butcan be intimidating if youve never done it before acknowledgesMs Hoffman ProBononet hooks up experienced lawyers with relativenewbies But what really really sells pro bono cases is that thework is interesting meaningful and rewarding They involve directservice And good lawyers can and should provide it using all thetools available in our timeWendy R Leibowitz is an attorney and legal columnist inWashington DC
