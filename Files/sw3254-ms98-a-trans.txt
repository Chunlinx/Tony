        okay where do you enjoy dining out     oh i generally go to the quickie places just because theyre cheap   yes do you have children   uh we have four but most of them are gone now so there there might be but we were taking you know uh four five and six people out   ah yes that makes a difference doesnt it uhhuh what area of the country do you live in   yes im in Texas   yes i am too   and we lived we lived in Ohio prior to this oh   so i did too  im from the Dayton area   uh we were up near Cleveland yeah   ah   but i look for service even at the quickie places type things uh i dont like to go to the drivethrus because sometimes they get your order wrong and then youre stuck and its a pain to have to   uhhuh thats right   stand there and see what it is before you leave so i really dont like the drivethrus that much i i like to go and eat there   yes   but i would say service uh atmosphere and whether the food is good on on going out i like steaks  so we try to hit those places when we can   when we travel we look for Wendys because we have kids and my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals and then that way they can get their burgers and fries and we can have a salad bar   umhum yeah   so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendys because its all either McDonalds or Dairy Queens  but     uh  yeah and in in in the countries unless its a large city i guess Dairy Queen and WalMart are their main  thats what you find right   right thats right i know   my husband likes um Dairy Queens he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs i guess so hes a fan of of Dairy Queen and and well go even in town here at times just as a a change although   uhhuh uhhuh   im not that excited about it it weve eaten we eat out so much its gotten so i dont like to really eat any place but yet i hate to cook food at home   oh   so that might be why i look for inexpensive places just because were eating out probably five   uhhuh   nights a week maybe or we eat junk food at home   um yeah   uh now that my husband   so what are some of your your favorite inexpensive places   oh well go to them all we sort of take turns and and we uh im sort of favor the ones if i have a coupon we can go there and if not we cant because its cheaper so mine is monetarily i guess strongly monetarily   uhhuh   based uh well go get pizza and uh at Little Caesars although the kids prefer Dominos   oh we are Little Caesar fans here thats where we always go   right but its just a lot cheaper than than Dominos so thats we go to Grandys quite a bit i would say   yes we like Grandys too   McDonalds uh weve sort of been off of that for a while and no particular reason and i i maybe we avoided Wendys the last few years because our daughter worked there and she never wanted us show up there   oh   so i dont uh we dont go there that much   where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out or a big meal   a nice meal oh   where you go for steaks   its usually when were out of town and ill order steak or steak and lobster combined   ah uhhuh   so that its really not in town   ah you ever been to Houstons on Beltline   no   thats where we go to get steaks they have a teriyaki steak there and when we have something to celebrate we head to Houstons they dont take reservations and you wind up waiting about an hour   umhum umhum   but the food is good and theyve got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at five oclock then you can go right through   right   but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks so thats our nice place to go we dont usually take the kids when we go there   dont well we dont go out that much i guess well i guess we do go out without kids were usually picking things up quickly though and just we just dont   yes   dwell on food too much and uh with my husband traveling he can get all he needs  for that during the week going to those places so it it doesnt really matter to him hed probably just like to stay home   right thats right yeah thats the way with my husband hes gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends and ive been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere   right   so we have a conflict of interests on the weekends   well i think our i i never have liked to cook food but i think it all began eating out when we had uh the boys in in different uh baseball on baseball team it was mainly baseball teams and my husband would coach   right yes   so we were never home at the same time and im not one thats going to fix you know the meal at two oclock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever theyre there if theyre not there in between five and six well then i guess we dont eat today or you go you know you fend for yourself you go somewhere else   uhhuh right yep   so that you know that really snowballed when we got down here when i started to sub make money i went oh well ill just sub to
