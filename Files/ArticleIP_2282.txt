                                 Adultery and Boredom            We now know what Gary Hartdid wrong He got caught cheating on his wife a decade too early In  whenHart embarked on the Monkey Business with Donna Rice public exposure ofinfidelity was a careerwrecker Today the episode would play out differentlyHarts adultery would get reported but the nation would yawn The story wouldvanish quickly from the news and all the pundits would say that Hartswandering eye was less important than his expertise on weapons procurement            That atleast is the revised scenario suggested by the two sex scandals that brokelast week Reputable publications reported that the president of the UnitedStates and the mayor of New York City were actively unfaithful spousesand noone cared According to a New York Daily News poll  percent of thosesurveyed said that charges in a Vanity Fair article that Rudy Giulianiwas having an affair with his communications director would have no impact onhow they voted Only  percent said the information would make them less likelyto vote for Giuliani There has been no comparable poll about Newsweek sreport that Clinton fondled a woman named Kathleen Willey during a  jobinterview in his office But there is no sign of harm to the presidentsapproval rating which continues to hover in the low s Ten years ago boththese stories would have launched fulldress feeding frenzies which as likelyas not would have chewed up successful politicians and spat them out onto therefuse heap            Now such stories dont even rate as scandals They mainlyprovoke orgies of media selfexamination which usually take the form ofreporters who got scooped beating up those who broke the story As ever beforeit was amusing to watch the prestigious media organs resist temptation as bestthey could only to yield hypocritically a few days later When VanityFair broke the Giuliani story the New York Times characteristicallyturned up its nose printing only a brief mention of Giulianis denial on PageB A few days later Metro columnist Clyde Haberman slipped more detail inunder the guise of discussing whether the mayor was spending too much time atthe office When you think about it the most interesting part of thisflapdoodle over the state of the union at Gracie Mansion is what it tells usabout Mayor Rudolph W Giulianis frenetic work habits Haberman wroteimplausibly The Washington Post gave similar backdoor treatment to theWilley affair mentioning it only in the context of Willey being subpoenaed byPaula Jones lawyers The Post subsequently covered it in much greaterdetail as a press story about how Matt Drudge who publishes an Internet tipsheet scooped Newsweek by reporting what the magazine was about toreport            The Drudgeangle is significant By reporting gossip about gossip Drudge hassinglehandedly lowered the bar for what constitutes news A few days ago hereported a rumor that Sidney Blumenthal a former journalist who is now aClinton official was once accused in court filings of spousal abuse Thiswas utterly false and Drudge retracted it under threat of a lawsuit But allthis was reported in the Post and elsewhere putting the falsehood intowider circulation As the supermarket tabloids have shown the ethical standardof the bottomfeeding publication is the one that ultimately prevails Oncesomething is published by anyone it becomes fair game for analysis andrepetition Irresponsible inaccurate postings on the Internet are now a backdoor for stories that dont even meet the standards of the tabloids            But as the standards of journalistic legitimacyhave declined the formerly godlike power of the establishment media to decidewhether politicians will live or die has also diminished In the Gary Hartdays the Times and Post were inclined to withhold informationabout the personal lives of politicians on the assumption that readers couldnthandle it While sophisticated journalists might understand that anextramarital affair wasnt such a big deal the public at large was too bigotedand judgmental to put such information in proper perspective A frequent lamentby columnists from that era was that the United States wasnt like France orBritain where politicians sex lives were considered their own business            Thatattitude was condescending and undemocratic If voters considered all TenCommandments pertinent to their decision about whom to vote for the NewYork Times had no business suppressing information about one that itthought was OK But on the evidence of the most recent cases the folks inflyover country have grown more worldly than bigcity journalists give themcredit for While people may be extremely interested in details about anyfamous persons sex life they dont deem that information particularly usefulor relevant when casting their votes In one  Harris poll  percent saidit was none of their business whether Bill Clinton had been unfaithful to hiswife In  and  the election results suggested that they were tellingthe truth about how they felt            Admittedly New York City is not South Carolina andinformation that might not harm a Democratic president could still destroy aRepublican governor In Clintons case everyone has fully assimilated thenotion of the president as an adulterer or worse An added datum weighs farless than does a novel accusation against someone previously considered a goodfamily man But something clearly has changed Even conservative Republicanslike Trent Lott now hesitate to make blanket condemnations of adulteryIronically while the press in Britain and France has moved toward an Americanstandard of privatelife investigation over the last decade the Americanpublic seems to have evolved a more European attitude Were more concernedabout politicians performance in office than about the condition of theirmarriage vows            This newmaturity argues not for an advance but for a retreat on the part of the pressIf voters dont deem personal lives politically relevant theres nojustification for reporters invading peoples privacy to find out about themThis openended assault by the press is one of the main factors driving many ofthe people we want in public life away from public life And if the publicdoesnt think adultery matters the press is exploiting politicians merely forits own aggrandizement One Newsweek columnist suggested this week thatthe Vanity Fair story was defective among other reasons because itsevidence fell short of the photographic But getting better evidence means evenmore disagreeable snooping  la Gary Hart What journalists need is a stricterstandard of relevance not a higher burden of proof            One might make a case that the latest sexstories are relevant just the same According to Vanity Fair  severalmembers of Giulianis inner circle have broken with him over a spokeswoman themayor values for more than her spin It was getting absurd for reporters toanalyze developments at City Hall without referring to a romantic attachmentthey believed to be a key force in events In the Willey case appointment to afederal board and a trip to a conference in Indonesia raise the question ofwhether the president misused government resources But reporters can alwaysfind pretexts of one kind or another that the person is a hypocrite is lyingabout it is doing it on government time orthe old standbythat the issueraises questions of character Its time to quit fishing When it comes tosimple adultery journalists should listen to the voters If they dont caretheres no reason why we should either
