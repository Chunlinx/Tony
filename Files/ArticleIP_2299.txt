                                 Happy Birthday Heritage Foundation            Nextmonth marks the  th anniversary of the Heritage Foundation thebiggest and best known of the conservative think tanks The festivities began afew weeks ago with a blacktie gala for  at which Margaret Thatcher spokeon the topic of Courage Ronald Reagan and I refused to accept the declineof the West as our ineluctable destiny Thatcher declared displaying herusual modesty and sense of fun The revelries are to continue for two fullyears with a traveling lecture series featuring such speakers as WilliamBennett who will orate in Oklahoma City about Truth and Clarence Thomaswho will address the people of Palm Beach on the subject of CharacterAnother vast dinner in Washington will cap the series and Heritagesmillion fundraising drive To commemorate the occasion the foundationalso has sponsored a gushing account of its first quartercentury The Powerof Ideas  by Lee Edwards The books title is incongruous since the wholepoint of the Heritage Foundation is that ideas alone have little power withouta big push            By all measures Heritage has much to celebrate Fromacross the political spectrum opinion appears to be unanimous that theorganization has been singularly effective in accomplishing its mission ofdragging American politics to the right Since the  release of itsMandate for Leadership  a detailed program for the incoming Reaganadministration that the Reagan administration actually took seriously Heritagehas played a central role in setting not only the broad conservative agenda butalso the details of legislation Edwards book delights in quoting enviousencomia from the enemy camp Michael Shuman of the leftwing Institute forPolicy Studies credits Heritage with a bigger influence on American politicsand policy than any other conservative institution Will Marshall president ofthe New Democratic Progressive Policy Institute says Heritage wrote the bookon how to market and popularize political ideas The Nation  amongothers keeps up a steady drumbeat on this theme Why doesnt the left have anadvocacy organization as influential as Heritage Well why not            The mostobvious explanation is money A rightwing advocacy tank like Heritage isable to raise much more than its liberal counterparts for the same reason thatRepublican candidates outraise Democratic ones Those who have a lot togivecorporations and rich individualsgive primarily in their ownselfinterest And unlike political candidates organizations like Heritagecan accept donations directly from corporate treasuries Selfinterested moneygoes to organizations that promote lower taxes and less regulation two topicson which Heritage is absolutely unflinching To be sure there is disinterestedconservative money and selfinterested liberal money such as the union fundsthat go to the Economic Policy Institute a think tank that opposes freetradeagreements But such exceptions dont change the rule The BrookingsInstitution often cast as Heritages liberal counterpart could never dream ofraising  million in two years            In fact Brookings isnt really Heritages liberalcounterpart Though it has historically exhibited a modest liberalslantdiminished in recent yearsBrookings thinks of itself as a scholarlyinstitution devoted to objective research into public policy It would neverspend its money in an explicit effort to harm its political foes because itdoes not conceive of itself as taking a side and does not view politics asideological warfare This is even more true of the big liberal foundationssuch as Ford Rockefeller and MacArthur New Right conservatives on the otherhand as exemplified by Heritage are quite explicit about viewing politics ascombat In the words of Heritages president Ed Feulner We conduct warfarein the battle of ideas Washington exerts a strong moderating influence andFeulner has been attacked in recent years for going establishmentwanting tobe prestigious and respected like Brookings instead of being powerful andfeared This is the same fault Heritage attacked the American EnterpriseInstitute for in the s But even if it has settled down a bit Heritagestill retains an insurgent mindset It views itself as the center of a radicalmovement even if it has become part of an entrenched Washingtonestablishment            Because of its combat mentality Heritage has never been aplace with very high standards Like other conservative outfits it loves thelingo of academic life Its hallways are cluttered with endowed chairsvisiting fellows and distinguished scholars The conceit here is that as a PCDark Age has overcome the universities conservative think tanks have becomethe refuge of thought and learning At Heritage in particular this is a laughAEI and the Manhattan Institute frequently produce stimulating books andstudies and occasionally arrive at unexpected positions Even the more dogmaticCato Institute has cultivated a reputation for rigorous research and analysisfrom a libertarian point of view Heritage however is essentially apropaganda mill There are exceptions Stuart Butler a Brit who runs thedomesticpolicy shop has done solid work on enterprise zones and took painsto develop a conscientious conservative alternative to the Clinton healthcareplan But on the whole Heritage is focused on selling and promoting its viewsrather than on developing thoughtful or nuanced ones It spends nearly half its million annual budget on marketing It prides itself on producing reportswith concision and speed According to Edwards one recent innovation is thecolored index card summarizing a conservative position in short punchysentences According to Heritages Vicepresident for information marketingthese cards have been wildly successful with Republicans in Congress            Itsethical standards are as lax as its intellectual ones Heritage is a taxexemptc organization which means it is not supposed to lobby CongressEdwards notes that a disclaimer appears at the foot of all its publicationsNothing written here is to be construed as an attempt to aid or hinder thepassage of any bill before Congress This is an evident absurdity Heritageexists to aid and hinder legislation before Congress and often boastsabout doing so Edwards quotes the Heritage disclaimer immediately after hefinishes explaining that Feulner and Paul Weyrich founded Heritage because inthe early s AEI was taking its taxexempt status too seriously Havingbeen investigated by the Internal Revenue Service AEI didnt focus on gettingits reports into the hands of members of Congress before the relevant votesFor whatever reason liberal groups tend to be more punctilious about thisMany are split between two organizations a c to which contributionsare tax deductible and a c which is simply not taxable itself andwhich has more latitude in lobbying This reduces the amount liberal groups canraise enhancing their natural disadvantage            At bottom the big liberal think tanks remaintemperamentally different from the likes of Heritage They have their vices tobe sure They can be ponderous conventional and gimmickyand miraculouslysometimes all three at once But you cant see the TwentiethCentury Fundfeeding policy popcorn to Democrats in Congress Theyd be insulted by theidea Its hard to imagine the Progressive Policy Institute naming aVicepresident for information marketing You cant conceive of Brookingsputting out a volume of selfserving bluster like the Edwards book In factBrookings did commission a history for its  th anniversary in It was serious critical and selfquestioning in a way that is totally aliento the Heritage Foundation Though Democrats have become better in recent yearsat suppressing their differences in favor of their common interests they stillshy away instinctually from a united front of the kind that Heritage is            Liberals say they want tolearn from the most successful organization on the right But in realitytheyre more comfortable and probably better off wishing the HeritageFoundation a happy birthday and admiring it from afar
