                                 The Sex God            On Mount Olympus they mustbe laughing at Bill Clintons pleas for privacy and at our attempts to explainhis impulses For about  years since the Greek gods first appeared inmythology theyve been dropping their tunics because thats what godsdo  In fact the parallels among the inhabitants of Olympus and theparticipants in the drama playing out at the White House are striking                           BillZeus The king of the gods Zeus is the most powerful in the pantheon Hewields the thunderbolt which is useful both as a weapon and as a way ofextracting himself from the sticky situations he often finds himself in Forall his power and brilliance he has a few overwhelming character flaws Attimes his pride and petulance became intolerable writes classicist RobertGraves in The Greek Myths  In Mythology  Edith Hamilton writesHe is represented as falling in love with one woman after another anddescending to all manner of tricks to hide his infidelity from his wifeGraves even reports that the gods mother foreseeing what trouble his lustwould cause forbade him to marry But what young god ever listens to hismother                           Hillary Hera When Hera first appearedin mythology as Zeus wife she was also his cosovereign writes Graves butas the millenniums marched on she became subservient to him Think of startingout heading health care reform and ending up supervising the MillenniumProject As Ovid wrote in Metamorphoses in the first century Hera saysof herself Great indeed are my achievements and mighty my strength So shewas incensed at finding herself humiliated repeatedly by Zeus philandering andreduced to being his sexual parole officer Hera isLord have mercythegoddess of marriage As for her own writes Graves she and Zeus bickeredconstantly mostly over his infidelities Though he would confide his secretsto her and sometimes accept her advice he never fully trusted Hera Thefeeling was mutual                           MonicaIo According to Ovid when Zeus first saw this nymph he said Maidenyou are fit for Zeus himself to love and will make someone divinely happywhen you share his couch Ovid does not say if the couch was in Zeus privatestudy Zeus spread a cloud over the Earth to conceal the dalliance which hadthe unintended consequence of alerting Hera According to Ovid When she couldnot find him in the sky Unless I am mistaken she said he is doing me somewrong  She was right When she confronts him in Graves telling he simplylies I have never touched Io Its clear now that a better translation fromthe Greek would have read I have never touched that nymph  Miss IoNever one to confess voluntarily Zeus then silences Io by turning her into acow                           Kathleen Willey Semele One clearlesson from the Greeks is that mortals pay a heavy price for being desired by agod After the mortal Semele had an affair with Zeus Hera consumed byjealousy encouraged her to ask Zeus to display to her all the power hepossessed He didand Semele was burned to ashes by the flame from histhunderbolt                           PaulaJones Nemesis This goddesss name means according to HamiltonRighteous Anger Graves writes that she became the embodiment of divinevengeance on proud kings In his telling Zeus pursued the goddess who fledfrom him To keep him at bay she constantly changed her shape apparentlythe Hellenic equivalent of a makeover and nose job                           Linda Tripp Eris Tripp is not justlike you but she is just like Eris a minor goddess who helped spark a hugeconflagration Eris as Graves writes is always stirring up occasions for warby the spread of rumour and the inculcation of jealousy Hamilton describesher as the evil goddess of Discord She was hugely unpopular and always beingleft out of things Resenting this deeply she determined to make troubleandshe succeeded very well indeed writes Hamilton When she was not included atan important wedding banquet she threw into the hall a golden apple markedFor the Fairest The scramble for possession of the apple was the event thatignited the Trojan War                           MikeMcCurry Hermes This god got the job of Zeus messenger after Zeus heardof his clever escapades As Graves writes of the job interview Zeus said Youseem to be a very ingenious eloquent and persuasive godling Then make meyour herald Father the young Hermes answered adding that he would nevertell lies though I cannot promise always to tell the whole truth That wouldnot be expected of you said Zeus with a smile                           Ken Starr Typhon Typhon is accordingto Graves the largest monster ever born  His brutish asshead touched thestars his vast wings darkened the sun fire flashed from his eyes and flamingrocks hurtled from his mouth When he appeared the gods fled Mount Olympus tohide Finally though Zeus overcame his cowardice and grappled with themonster It did not go well Typhon cut the sinews in Zeus hands and feet AsGraves writes Now he could not move a finger But Zeus like the presidencyif not individual presidents has immortality Eventually his power wasrestored and he threw Mount Aetna on top of the independent counsel ahmonster            Finally the only deitiespossibly more powerful than the Olympiansthe three goddesses who literallymeasure out the course and length of a persons lifeare the Fates Zeus notsurprisingly fancies himself their leader Thats always a dangerous fancy AsAeschylus wrote of Zeus in Prometheus Bound  He cannot fly fromFate
