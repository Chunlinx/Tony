                                 The Fisherman and the Dryad            Hedrank from a bottle and waded in the riverHe waded near the bank and watched the lightDrain through the trees and set on the waterThat told his fortune with floating sticks and leavesHe saw his place arranged there before himA dinner service set on a table of glassThat he the thrown rock of himself might breakHis own reflection the gray shadow of a fishIts murky back twisting through stumps and weeds            Thenhe heard her step through the forest the soundOf the steps preceding her through the leavesLike the calling card of a doe approaching the waterTrying her footing across newly covered groundBackpacker he thought and put away his bottleNot wanting it a strangers first sight of himCheered it might be someone who liked a line of chatterHe not having spoken to anything but a wormAll day in the forest instead of at work            He had been changing aflat a roofing nailPried from the tread with the edge of a dimeRolling the spare when he first heard the riverOn the other side of the road when his breathing slowedHaving heard it he wanted to see it at onceTo wade in his boots and drag a cast lineIn the flat current moving toward himWhen she stepped into the clearing above the riverYellow leaves on her arms and birds in her hair
