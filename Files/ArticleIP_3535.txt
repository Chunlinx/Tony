               In the past whenescorting a young woman to my automobile after say coming out of arestaurant I would unlock the passengerside door for her first before walkingaround to the drivers side On modern cars with power locks howeverunlocking the driversside door automatically unlocks all other doors Thisinnovation makes first unlocking her door a superfluous and illogicalgesture                                       Wheredo you come down on this question of chivalry vs logic Is it insulting tounlock her door first when we both know its unnecessary                                       SincerelyLovelocked                                       DearLovelocked                        There is no conflict herebetween chivalry and logic Chivalry requires not only that you unlock the doorbut also that you open the door for her hold her arm to help her enter seethat the edge of her skirt has been removed from the door frame and then closethe door Helping her enter can also be the occasion for sweetly kissing her onthe cheek Modern gadgets will not do all that and real men dont want themto Something has to be left for the men to do            Anywaythe idea of a conflict between chivalry and logic is mistaken Chivalrousgestures even though not utilitarian at one level have a utilitarian logic atanother level Chivalrous gestures are a means of communication and that isuseful When you hold the door for the girl even though she is quite capableof doing it for herself you are communicating the fact that you care about herand want to be her helper Unless you are a great poet it may be the best wayyou have of communicating those sentiments to her Which gestures communicatewhat changes over time as does other language In my time at least holdingthe door communicated respect or affection or some other favorableemotiondepending on the personalities involved What holding the door foryour girlfriend communicates is different from what holding it for yourmotherinlaw does            Prudence                                             DearPrudence                                                      Eversince Seymour Hershs book came out detailing the raw side of Jack Kennedy andthe dark side of Camelot Ive been wondering what JFK did in todays contextthat warrants an eternal flame at Arlington National Cemetery While there arefew precedents anywhere in the world for eternal flames to honor individualsthere are even fewer precedents for turning them off once ignited I dontsuppose many would argue that JFK has greater stature than Washington orLincoln so isnt it a little silly to honor JFK in so unique a fashion Whatif anything can be done that doesnt come across as overtly partisan orantiKennedy                                       Troubled inArlington                                       DearTroubled in Arlington                        To snuff out the JFK flame atArlington National Cemetery would be more trouble than it is worth What isimportant is the flame of admiration and affection for JFK that burns in thehearts of many Americans When that flame burns out as I think it soon willthe flame in the cemetery will not matter No one will go to it except to roastmarshmallows            People flock to the LincolnMemorial because they revere Lincoln as a man who rose from humble origins tobecome president of the United States save the Union free the slaves andwrite some of the most profound and moving words in the English language Ifthe same marble structure in the same place were dedicated to William McKinleyno one would go there            In a primelocation opposite the White House is a statue of Andrew Jackson on a horseThousands of people pass it every day but no one stops to look at it It willbe the same with the JFK flame in time            Prudence                                             DearPrudence                                                      Christmas was  days away when a fair number of my neighbors had alreadyplaced lights around their homes and fully decorated their trees I like tothink of myself as somewhat festive but why has Christmas turned into afullmonth affair What can we do to keep this holiday from becoming thenational bore                                       Scrooge                                       DearScrooge
