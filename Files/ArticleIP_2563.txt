                                 On Being a Jew            I venture to air thesemusings about my life because so much is being written these days about who isa Jew or about who is a good Jew I dont know how typical my experience isbut I am sure it is not unique            Irecently read a little book The Penguin Book of Jewish Short Stories which my daughter had given me Reading these stories about Jewish life ineastern Europe a hundred or so years ago was eyeopening I had never beforefelt so close to my roots I could have been one of the pale skinny young menwho sat in the synagogue all day studying the Talmud I could have been theJewish actor in Warsaw fantasizing about his love affair with the beautifulactress I felt that there was nothing in my own personality or character thatwould have prevented me from being just like them if I had been born in theirtime and place            The discontinuity between Jewish life in the Russianshtetl in  and Jewish life in the Watergate Apartments in Washingtonin  must be the greatest onecentury gap in Jewish life since the ExodusIf I could imagine myself back at the beginning of that discontinuity in I could by easy stages imagine myself back three millennia            My familyand I made that leap in the direction from  to  with no intermediatestops We did not have resting places in prolonged settlement in a transplantedWarsaw on the East Side of Manhattan or a transplanted shtetl inBrownsville My father came to America from the shtetl just about ahundred years ago and almost immediately left the Jewish life behind Havingno supportive family at an early age he joined the United States Cavalryusing a borrowed birth certificate That was about as unJewish an occupationas you can imagine He went with his troop to the Philippines to chase therebels against the American raj            When I was born he was living in Detroit thena quite unJewish town working for the Ford Motor Co a notoriously unJewishemployer as a bluecollar machinist a very unJewish occupation Until I was although I and everyone else knew I was Jewish I led a life with hardlyany Jewish content After Detroit I lived in Schenectady another gentilecommunity I never had a bar mitzvah Although I spent five years studyingLatin I never spent a day studying Hebrew At the age of  I spent onesemester at Sunday school in a Reform synagogue That was the extent of myJewish education I spent much more time studying Shakespeare than studying theBible I went to an isolated college in the Berkshire Mountains where  percentof the class that entered with me was Jewish We had compulsory attendance atEpiscopal chapel services eight times a week Until I went to graduate schoolI never had a Jewish teacher except for my clarinet teacher in Detroit            Theraising of my consciousness as a Jew began at  when I married a Jewish girlwhose family and community background were much more Jewish than mine althoughshe was still not an observant Jew Other steps came with maturation Being ahusband then a father and homeowner gave me a more realistic sense of my ownidentity and responsibilities than I had had when I lived in the fantasy worldof academia As a result of the pattern of residential segregation thatremained in Washington at least through the s each of the three housesthat we bought in succession was on a block with many Jewish neighbors Ibecame one of the first members of a newly formed synagogue in the suburbanMaryland county where we lived But I attended services rarely and feltuncomfortable when I did because I knew so little of what was going on            Learning of the Holocaust was a powerful reminder that Ihad an identity that except for the accident of geography would have broughtme to the same fate as  million others The establishment triumphs and risksof Israel were a source of pride and obligation to me            Oddly twoof the most satisfying experiences of my life as a Jew came about on theinitiative of gentiles In  President Richard Nixon sent me with my wifeto Israel as his representative at the celebration of the anniversary of thefounding of the state This was a great pleasure and honor for me personallybut I also felt that I was doing something for my people by serving as a tokenof Americas support for Israel            Having used the magic words Nixon and Jewin the same paragraph I want to answer a question often asked of meApparently Mr Nixon said some things that I wish he had not said But I knowof nothing in his behavior to me to my family to Israel or to Jews ingeneral that entitles him to anything less than my total loyalty            The othergentile who enters my story and in a more important way is George Shultz Assecretary of state in  he named me to be a consultant on the economicproblems of Israel I worked with several other people Israelis and Americansto develop a policy that would rescue Israel from devastating inflation and setthe country on a course of durable economic progress The policy succeeded andI was fortunate to have had the opportunity to make that contribution to mypeople            So what kind of Jew am I after  years ofconsciousnessraising For one thing I am proud to be a Jew I do not referonly to the clich of pride in belonging to the community of Moses FreudEinstein and Jonas Salk or to pride in the fact that God Bless America waswritten by Irving Berlin I refer also to pride in Jews as a whole I recentlysaw statistics saying that there are about  billion people in the world about billion of them Christians and about  million of them Jews And I thoughtwow we precious few have achieved a lot and survived a lot My Jewishnesscertainly includes support for Israel although not always support for thepolicies of the government of Israel and I have recommended a reduction inUS government financial aid for Israel            I am puzzled about what tosay on the subject of my religion I pray to God but I do not feel that I ampraying to an exclusively Jewish God If as we say there is one God surelyhe is God of the whole universe including the gentiles I observe nine of the commandments excepting only the one about the Sabbath but I dont thinkthe commandments are for Jews alone I recognize deficiencies in my JewishnessI wish I had studied Hebrew rather than Latin I regret that I did not havemore Jewish education I do not have the energy to remedy these deficienciesnow I am pleased that my children have had more Jewish education than I didand that my grandchildren have even more            All in all I believe that ifI ever meet one of my forebears one of those pale skinny yeshiva studentsfrom the eastern European shtetl of  I will be able to say to himI too am a Jewnot a saint but a Jew like you
