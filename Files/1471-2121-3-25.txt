                    Background        Rab proteins comprise a large family of Rasrelated        GTPases that function in the anterograde and retrograde        trafficking of proteins in mammalian cells              Different Rab proteins reside in specific subcellular        membranes or organelles where they mediate vesicular        transport between discrete donor and acceptor compartments        in the endocytic or exocytic pathways      Detailed        studies of a few Rab proteins          eg  Rab Rab and Rab have led        to a general model wherein Rab proteins are presumed to        cycle on and off donor and acceptor membranes in connection        with changes in their guanine nucleotide state              In the active GTPbound state Rab proteins associate with        budding transport vesicles      and appear to        participate in the assembly of membrane docking complexes              Following vesicle fusion with the acceptor        compartment and GTP hydrolysis the inactive GDPbound Rab        is extracted from the membrane by a carrier protein termed        guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor GDI              The GTPase can then reenter the transport cycle        through nucleotide exchange promoted by a specific exchange        factor at the donor vesicle membrane       In        addition to changes in guanine nucleotide state the        posttranslational prenylation of Rab proteins plays an        important role in the cycling mechanism Nonmodified Rabs        have a low affinity for GDI     and do not associate        effectively with membranes             Rab originally identified by Olkkonen         et al      remains one of        several members of the Rab family without a confirmed        biological function We have described several unusual        features of Rab that distinguish it from all other        members of the Rab family studied to date     Rab        has a markedly reduced GTPase activity due primarily to        the presence of a serine residue instead of the usual        glutamine at the position equivalent to Q in HRas        Furthermore Rab is not efficiently geranylgeranylated        and does not form a detectable complex with GDI These        unique properties of Rab suggest that it may not function        according to the accepted cyclical model        In the present study we set out to learn about the        biological function of Rab by using a wellestablished        paradigm in which a dominantnegative Rab construct is        expressed in cultured cells anticipating that it will        suppress the trafficking steps mediated by its endogenous        counterpart Amino acid substitutions at the position        cognate to N in HRas typically yield soluble Rab        proteins that have a reduced affinity for guanine        nucleotides Such constructs have been used successfully to        define the functions of RabA and RabB       Rab            Rab     and Rab     Unexpectedly we        found that expression of the mutant forms of Rab in        cultured cells resulted in their accumulation in a striking        array of insoluble intranuclear inclusions which disrupt        the integrity of the nuclear envelope                    Results                  Mutant forms of Rab accumulate in nuclear          inclusions          In all of the known Rasrelated GTPases the guanine          nucleotide binding site is surrounded by a set of highly          conserved sequence elements      One of these          elements termed the G motif consists of NKxD with the          asparagine located at position  in HRas In Rab          and in some members of the Rho family threonine occurs          instead of the asparagine Amino acid substitutions in          the NTKxD motif cause a drastic reduction in the          affinity of Rasrelated GTPases for guanine nucleotides               When overexpressed in cultured cells these          mutant GTPases function as dominantsuppressors of their          endogenous counterparts       presumably because          they can compete for interaction with effectors exchange          factors or docking proteins but cannot cycle on and off          membranes in a nucleotidedependent manner We set out to          assess the function of Rab by making substitutions in          its TKxD motif starting with DI To facilitate          localization of the proteins the wildtype and mutant          constructs were made with a mycepitope tag at the amino          terminus The addition of such tag sequences to          Rasrelated proteins including several members of the          Rab family does not appear to alter their function or          subcellular localization                When mycRabwt was transiently expressed in           cells immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a diffuse          reticular distribution throughout the cytoplasm with a          concentration in the perinuclear region Fig A In          contrast when the same studies were performed with cells          expressing mycRabDI we observed a striking          accumulation of the mutant protein in punctate structures          localized in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments          In most cells the inclusions appeared to be concentrated          predominantly within the nucleus Fig A Identical          structures were seen when immunofluorescence microscopy          was performed with antibodies against the Nterminal myc          epitope or the Cterminal hypervariable domain of Rab          indicating that the immunofluorescence pattern reflected          the localization of fulllength mycRabDI Finally          the localization pattern of RabDI remained the          same when the protein was expressed without the myc tag          Fig B          Western blot analyses of cytosol and particulate          fractions obtained from the transfected  cells          indicated that mycRabwt was present in both          fractions consistent with previous results with Rab          and other wildtype Rab GTPases      In contrast          mycRabDI was found exclusively in the particulate          fraction Fig C When transfected cells were disrupted          in a buffer containing  NP  deoxycholate and           SDS most of the RabDI was recovered in the          detergentinsoluble fraction Fig D This suggested          that the mutant protein was concentrated in inclusion          bodies rather than membrane components          The nuclear inclusions containing RabDI were          not celltype specific Fig Ashows that similar          punctate structures were formed when the DI mutant was          expressed in NIH T fibroblasts We also verified that          the unique behavior of the Rab mutant was not related          specifically to the substitution at the aspartate          position in the NTKxD motif Thus similar inclusions          were observed when Rab was expressed with substitutions          at the NT position           ie  TA Fig A or TI          not shown To test the possibility that protein          aggregates might be formed when           any Rab GTPase is overexpressed          with a mutation that impairs nucleotide binding we          examined the localization of four additional members of          the Rab family containing amino acid substitutions in the          NTKxD motif In all cases these proteins exhibited a          general cytoplasmic localization with no evidence of          nuclear inclusions Fig A          Rab is known to be expressed endogenously in many          cell types including the cell lines used in these          studies      and we have estimated that both          mycRabwt and DI are transiently expressed  fold          over the level of endogenous Rab data not shown          Therefore a question raised by these studies is whether          the genesis of nuclear inclusions occurs indirectly          through dominant suppression of endogenous Rab function          by the DI and TA mutants or directly through          association of cellular proteins with the accumulating          mutant protein We attempted to distinguish between these          possibilities by using an alternative strategy to make a          dominantnegative form of Rab Several laboratories          have shown that in addition to mutations in the NTKxD          motif which reduce overall nucleotide binding          dominantnegative Rab constructs can be generated by          introducing amino acid substitutions            eg  asparagine at the position          cognate to Ras S            ie  S in Rab                 Such proteins are thought to be locked in an inactive          GDPbound state because the mutation markedly reduces          their affinity for GTP compared to GDP     As shown          in Fig B when mycRabSN was expressed in T          cells there was no evidence of nuclear inclusions          However when the bound Plabeled nucleotides          associated with the expressed protein were analyzed by          thinlayer chromatography Fig C we were surprised to          find that the SN mutant was predominantly in the          GTPbound state The inability of the SN substitution          to substantially reduce the affinity of Rab for GTP          adds to the growing list of fundamental differences          between Rab and other members of the Rab family In a          previous study we observed that replacing S with Q          which occupies this position all other Rab proteins          increases the GTPase activity of Rab     resulting          in a modest increase in the ratio of protein in the GDP          versus GTP state see Fig C When this mutant was          expressed in T cells we again failed to observe          inclusion bodies Fig B Since neither RabSN nor          RabSQ showed evidence of being locked in a          GDPbound state it is unlikely that either would          function as a dominantnegative Thus the question of          whether the nuclear inclusions containing the DI and          TA mutants are caused by dominantnegative suppression          of endogenous Rab function remains to be resolved                          Morphological characteristics of the nuclear          inclusions          Several followup studies supported the notion that          the punctate structures containing the Rab mutants were          inclusion bodies rather than membranebound organelles          For example immunofluorescence microscopy revealed          little or no overlap between these structures and markers          for Golgi Rab           Lens culinaris lectin endosome          EEA or lysosome LAMP membranes data not shown          Although Rab has been proposed as a possible regulator          of autophagic processes      the accumulation of          punctate bodies in cells expressing RabDI was not          prevented by methyadenine a known inhibitor of          autophagosome formation     Most importantly          electron microscopy with immunogold labeling of          mycRabDI in ultrathin sections confirmed the          initial impression that the inclusions are in fact          localized within the nucleus The expressed protein was          concentrated in clusters of dense granules of fairly          uniform diameter  nm with no evidence of a          surrounding membrane Fig AB The cytoplasmic          inclusions containing mycRabDI were similar to          those observed inside the nucleus except that they were          larger with a diameter  times that of the nuclear          particles Fig D Such structures were never observed          in cells expressing mycRabwt or any other          overexpressed Rab GTPase                          Disruption of nuclear architecture by inclusions          containing RabDI          The accumulation of nuclear inclusions in cells          expressing RabDI led to progressive degeneration          of nuclear structure Figure shows a series of          representative photographs of transfected T cells that          were costained with antibody against the Rab myc          epitope combined with DAPI to visualize the chromatin          Fig A or an antibody against lamins A and B to          visualize the nuclear envelope Fig B At  h after          transfection we observed many cells with          mycRabpositive inclusions that showed fairly uniform          staining of the nuclear envelope with no loss of          chromatin or deformation of nuclear shape However in          some cells with larger and more numerous inclusions we          observed discontinuities in the antilamin staining of          the nuclear envelope and some colocalization of lamin          with mycRabDI in the intranuclear aggregates The          gaps in the nuclear membrane were clearly visible in          electron micrographs of cells with large numbers of          intranuclear aggregates Fig C In the most extreme          cases the nuclear envelope was significantly distorted          and fragmented and there was leakage of chromatin into          the cytoplasm Fig A B lower panels The number          of cells with obvious nuclear disruption increased with          time so that by h this was seen in the majority of          the transfected cells not shown          The morphological changes occurring in cells with          accumulated RabDI inclusions did not match the          hallmark features of apoptosis            eg  membrane blebbing          condensation of chromatin at the nuclear periphery This          was confirmed by TUNEL assays where cells at various          stages of nuclear inclusion body accumulation showed no          evidence of DNA fragmentation either before or after          disruption of the nuclear envelope Fig A In          contrast TUNELpositive cells were readily detected in          parallel cultures where apoptosis was induced by          treatment with staurosporine Fig B                          RabDI disrupts nuclear import of          glucocorticoid receptor          Rab contains a unique argininerich insert          EEDRRRRR     in the domain cognate to loop in          HRas     The latter sequence is reminiscent of          unusual argininerich nuclear localization signals that          allow proteins like HIV           tet and           rev to undergo nuclear          translocation by association with importin in the          absence of importin      Since the loop insert          in Rab lies adjacent to the conserved NTKxD          nucleotide binding cassette we hypothesized that          conformational changes caused by the DI substitution          might render the Rab mutant capable of disrupting the          nuclear import machinery     To test this          possibility we coexpressed mycRabwt or          mycRabDI with GRGFP a fusion between the          glucocorticoid receptor and green fluorescent protein          This protein contains a prototypical nuclear localization          signal but remains in the cytoplasm when expressed in          cultured cells in the absence of steroids Upon addition          of  M dexamethasone Dex the receptor is translocated          into the nucleus within  min     When GRGFP was          coexpressed with the wildtype Rab in NIHT cells we          observed normal liganddependent translocation of GRGFP          into the nucleus when Dex was applied Fig A However          when GRGFP was coexpressed with mycRabDI there          was a striking perturbation of receptor localization          Instead of remaining in the cytoplasm in the absence of          steroid nearly all of the GRGFP was found in the          cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusion bodies containing the          Rab mutant Fig A The latter point is clearly          illustrated by the overlap of GRGFP green fluorescence          with rhodamineIgG staining for mycRabDI red in          Fig B The possibility that the inclusions induced by          mycRabDI contain aggregated nuclear import          complexes was further supported by immunostaining with          an antibody against importin karyopherin which          revealed focal concentrations of importin in these          structures Fig A However other proteins such as Ran          binding protein Fig B and Ran GAP not shown which          are recruited to the nuclear import complex through          interactions with the Ran GTPase did not appear to be          present in the inclusion bodies                          The Cterminal hypervariable domain of Rab is          required for the formation of inclusions          To learn more about the structural features of          RabDI that are responsible for triggering the          formation of nuclear inclusions we focused on regions of          the protein that distinguish Rab from other members of          the Rab family We began by deleting a portion of the          loop insert described in the preceding section Four          amino acids EDRR were removed from both Rabwt and          RabDI Immunofluorescent localization studies          showed that this modification had no effect on          distribution of the wildtype protein in the cytoplasm          Fig A and contrary to expectations did not          interfere with the accumulation of the DI mutant in          nuclear inclusions Fig B          The second region where the sequence of Rab differs          substantially from other Rab GTPases is the last  amino          acids of the Cterminal tail This region commonly          referred to as the hypervariable domain plays a major          role in the subcellular targeting and functional          specificity of each Rab protein     In accord with          this view replacement of the hypervariable domain of          Rabwt with the corresponding domain from RabB          caused the resulting chimera to exhibit a discrete          juxtanuclear Golgilike fluorescence pattern typical of          RabB in  cells      Fig C When the DI          substitution was introduced into the Rab portion of the          RabRabB chimera the protein was no longer targeted          to inclusion bodies Fig D but instead exhibited a          diffuse distribution similar to RabBNI and other          Rabs with mutations in the NTKxD motif see Fig  To          confirm the importance of the Rab hypervariable domain          for targeting to inclusion bodies we performed the          reciprocal experiment replacing the Cterminal domain of          RabBwt or RabBNI with the hypervariable domain          from Rab Instead of the usual RabB juxtanuclear Golgi          localization the RabBwtRab chimera showed a          broader cytoplasmic distribution similar to that of          Rabwt Fig E Most notably replacement of          hypervariable domain of RabBNI with the          corresponding Cterminal region from Rab caused a major          change in the localization of the chimera from a          predominant cytoplasmic distribution typical of          RabBNI Fig  to a pattern of large intranuclear          and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies Fig F          To determine whether the hypervariable domain of Rab          was sufficient to promote the formation of inclusion          bodies when fused to a heterologous protein we prepared          fusion constructs with enhanced green fluorescent protein          EGFP containing either fulllength RabDI or just          the Rab Cterminal domain As shown in Fig A          EGFPRabDI accumulated in inclusion bodies similar          to those described earlier for mycRabDI In          contrast the EGFP fusion protein containing only the          hypervariable domain of Rab exhibited a diffuse          cytoplasmic and nuclear localization that was essentially          identical to the pattern observed with EGFP alone Fig          B C Therefore it appears that although the          Cterminal domain of Rab is required to promote its          incorporation into inclusion bodies it does so only when          expressed in the context of a Rab GTPase with a mutation          in the NTKxD nucleotide binding motif                          Nuclear inclusions generated by RabDI          contain ubiquitin and Hsp          Although the formation of intranuclear inclusions has          not been observed in previous studies of Rasrelated          GTPases it is a common feature of several          neurodegenerative disorders where abnormal proteins          containing polyGln tracts are synthesized as a result of          CAG codon expansions     Examples include          Huntingtons disease huntingtin               spinocerebellar ataxia SCA types  and  ataxin and          ataxin     and dentatorubralpallidoluysian          atrophy atrophin     These polyGln protein          aggregates typically contain ubiquitin    and members          of the Hsp chaperone family     consistent with a          proposed pathway for cellular clearance of toxic          misfolded proteins We noted that the inclusions caused          by expression of RabDI were similar          morphologically to those described in some of the          polyGln disorders and hypothesized that they might arise          via a similar pathway An immunofluorescence study was          performed to determine whether or not the intranuclear          RabDI aggregates might sequester ubiquitin and          Hsp Both ubiquitin Fig A and Hsp Fig B          showed substantial overlap with nuclear and cytoplasmic          aggregates containing mycRabDI In contrast the          aggregates did not contain Hsp Fig C suggesting          that the sequestration of Hsp was specific          To determine whether ubiquitin was conjugated directly          to RabDI it was necessary to solubilize the          protein aggregates in a highdetergent buffer that was          incompatible with standard immunoprecipitation methods          Therefore we generated a mammalian expression vector          encoding a His            tagged version of RabDI and          used Ni affinity resin to isolate the expressed protein          from detergent extracts When expressed in  cells the          His            RabDI accumulated in          inclusion bodies that were morphologically identical to          those formed by the myctagged and untagged proteins not          shown When the His            tagged protein was extracted from          the inclusions and subjected to SDSPAGE we saw no          evidence of higher molecular mass forms that would          correspond to polyubiquitinated species using either          antiHis            Fig A or antiRab not shown          antibodies Moreover immunoblot analysis of the His            RabDI isolated from cells          treated with lactacystin to block degradation of          polyubiquitinated proteins by the S proteasome showed          no detectable ubiquitin associated with the protein          although the same antibody detected multiple          ubiquitinated polypeptides in the wholecell lysate Fig          B Again these findings agree with recent studies of          polyGln protein aggregates which indicate that although          ubiquitinated proteins are present in the inclusions          they are not conjugated directly to the initiating          polyGln polypeptide                                Discussion        Here we have shown that single amino acid substitutions                 eg  DI and TA in one of the        conserved guanine nucleotide binding domains of Rab can        cause the protein to accumulate in a massive array of        nuclear inclusions in mammalian cells Although members of        the Ras GTPase superfamily have been studied for many years        using sitedirected mutagenesis approaches there have been        no previous reports demonstrating cytopathic effects of        this kind In particular as we have shown in Fig  a        variety of Rab proteins bearing similar mutations are        localized in the cytoplasmic compartment        It remains unclear whether the nuclear inclusions        induced by RabDI are generated         de novo inside the nucleus or instead        penetrate the nuclear membrane after being assembled in the        cytoplasmic compartment Rab does not have a classic        nuclear localization signal sequence but monomeric        mycRabDI is theoretically small enough  kDa to        diffuse across the nuclear pores     However it is        less likely that this could occur in the case of the larger        EGFPRabDI fusion construct  kDa which also        formed abundant intranuclear inclusions Fig  Our        preliminary observations indicate that some of the        intranuclear inclusions containing RabDI are        immunoreactive for lamins while those outside the nucleus        are not Fig B Moreover the electron micrographs show        that nuclei containing clusters of inclusions often have        regions where the nuclear membrane appears to be        discontinuous Fig C Based on these findings we        believe that aggregates formed in the cytoplasm may        transiently associate with and disrupt the nuclear        envelope then enter the nucleus through the resulting        gaps Ultimately the accumulation of nuclear inclusions in        cells expressing RabDI causes a catastrophic        disruption of the nuclear architecture although this does        not appear to be accompanied by classic signs of apoptotic        cell death such as DNA fragmentation or caspase        activation        The molecular mechanism underlying the formation of        nuclear inclusions in cells expressing the mutant forms of        Rab remains to be defined An extensive body of published        work supports the notion that Rab proteins bearing        mutations in the NTKxD nucleotide binding motif function        as dominantsuppressors of their endogenous cellular        counterparts Our domainexchange experiments with Rab        and RabB Fig  indicate that incorporation of the        mutant proteins into nuclear inclusions requires the        specific Cterminal hypervariable targeting domain of        Rab Therefore one possibility is that the inclusions        arise as a consequence of disruption of the normal        physiological function of Rab To explore this issue        further we attempted to generate another potential        dominantnegative form of Rab predicted to be locked in        the GDP state However when we made the amino acid        substitution customarily used to generate such Rab mutants                 ie  SN Rab unexpectedly        remained in the GTP state Therefore pending further        investigation we cannot rule out the alternative        hypothesis that mutations in the NTKxD motif of Rab        combined with features in the Cterminal domain cause        Rab to misfold in a unique manner attracting        nonphysiological protein partners that can promote        aggregation and nuclear localization        As a framework for future studies we can envision at        least three models that could explain the accumulation of        inclusion bodies in cells expressing RabDI Our        immunofluorescence studies Fig  suggest that the        inclusions are complex protein assemblies containing Hsp        and ubiquitin Therefore the first possibility is that the        presence of Hsp and ubiquitin reflects a failed attempt        by the cell to eliminate misfolded protein aggregates via        the proteasome pathway Indeed a similar explanation has        been invoked to explain the presence of Hsp and ubiquitin        in nuclear aggregates observed in cells expressing abnormal        gene products with polyGln tracts such as huntingtin           and ataxin     Based on reports that        overexpression of chaperones     or a        dominantnegative form of the ubiquitinconjugating enzyme           can suppress the formation of polyGln protein        aggregates Kaytor and Warren    proposed a threestage        model wherein i molecular chaperones initially associate        with the misfolded protein ii failure to diminish the        pool of misfolded protein leads to aggregation and        ubiquitination and iii inefficient degradation of the        aggregate by the proteasome is manifested by the        accumulation of inclusion bodies Although this model        implies that the misfolded polyGln protein might be the        primary substrate for ubiquitination a recent study by        Suhr         et al     suggests that this may        not always be the case Specifically they found that when        aggregates from  cells expressing polyGln proteins were        dissociated the ubiquitin polymers were not conjugated        directly to the polyGln protein or the sequestered        Hsp        An alternative mechanism for the formation of inclusion        bodies in protein conformation disorders is suggested by a        recent study showing that clearance of polyGln and        polyAla inclusions is accelerated by compounds like        rapamycin which stimulate protein degradation by autophagy            Along similar lines the work of Kegel         et al     hints that polyGln        huntingtin may be degraded mainly in autophagic vacuoles        containing lysosomal proteases Interestingly Rab has        been implicated as a possible mediator of autophagy in a        recent study where wildtype GFPRab was observed to        accumulate on large autophagic vacuoles in cells subjected        to amino acid starvation     Thus if RabDI        functions as a true dominant suppressor of endogenous        Rab the inclusions observed in the present study may        consist of misfolded endogenous proteins that cannot be        degraded because basal activity of the        autophagosomelysosome pathway is blocked        Although the two preceding models may explain the        presence of Hsp and ubiquitin in the RabDIinduced        aggregates the incorporation of glucocorticoid receptor        Fig  and importin Fig  may point to a third        distinct scenario Aside from its wellcharacterized role        in protein folding     Hsp is known to associate        with the GR in the cytoplasm where it promotes formation        of a heterocomplex between the inactive GR and Hsp            In addition Hsp becomes concentrated in the nucleus        when cells are exposed to environmental stress     Of        particular note the nuclear accumulation of the Hsp        Ssap in response to nutrient deprivation in yeast appears        to occur by a novel mechanism that involves its direct        interaction with Mmdp a member of the importin family            A role for Rab in nuclear trafficking would be        unanticipated since the only GTPase known to function in        nuclear importexport Ran is structurally distinct from        the Rab subgroup of the Ras superfamily             Nevertheless we can speculate that if Rab participates        in a stressinduced pathway for nuclear import of Hsp in        mammalian cells the constitutive overexpression of        RabDI might stimulate aberrant accumulation of        Hspimportin aggregates at the nuclear pore complex        This might ultimately result in disruption of the nuclear        envelope and penetration of the aggregates into the        nucleus If the Hsp in these aggregates retains the        capacity to bind GR this could account for the        sequestration of nascent GR in these structures        It is well established that mutations affecting the        guanine nucleotide state of Ras are associated with        neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells              However the potential role of Rab mutations in disease is        just beginning to be explored Menasche         et al     found mutations in the        RabA gene in  patients with Griscellis syndrome an        autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in        skin pigmentation and Tlymphocyte and macrophage        activation While several of the mutations were deletions        a few were missense mutations that changed single amino        acids in conserved regions of the Rab structure Mutations        in the RabA gene have also been detected in mice with the        coat color mutation         ashen  which is regarded as a model        for Griscellis syndrome      Rab can be detected        in many tissues and cell lines      but expression        appears to be highest in neuronal cells     At present        there are no available data specifically linking Rab        mutations to human disease However there are many case        reports describing patients with progressive        neurodegenerative disorders of unknown etiology        collectively referred to as neuronal intranuclear inclusion        disease     While these may consist mainly of        unidentified polyGln or polyAla disorders the present        study raises the possibility that some forms of this        disease may arise through unexpected mechanisms perhaps        involving mutations in Rab or other poorly characterized        members of the Rab GTPase family that mediate trafficking        of misfolded proteins within autophagosomes and        lysosomes                    Conclusions        Previous studies have shown that Rab exhibits several        unusual characteristics that distinguish it from other        members of the Rab GTPase family     The studies        described in this report demonstrate that putative        dominantnegative mutant forms of Rab bearing single        amino acid substitutions in the conserved NTKxD        nucleotide binding motif          eg  DI and TA are targeted        to numerous inclusion bodies that disrupt the nuclear        envelope and enter the nuclear compartment The inclusions        bear a superficial resemblance to those described in some        of the polyglutamine disorders and appear to sequester        Hsp ubiquitin importin and glucocorticoid receptor        Studies of RabRabB chimeras indicate that the unusual        cytopathic effects induced by the DI mutant require        sequence elements within the Rab Cterminal hypervariable        targeting domain Similar mutations in the NTKxD motif of        other Rab proteins typically yield soluble cytoplasmic        proteins Confirmatory studies with other potential        dominantnegative mutants such as those bearing        substitutions at the position cognate to Ras S were not        possible with Rab because such mutants remained in the        GTP state The present results further highlight the unique        nature of Rab and raise the possibility that it may        function in autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins        or perhaps play an unanticipated role in nuclear protein        trafficking or maintenanceassembly of the nuclear        envelope
