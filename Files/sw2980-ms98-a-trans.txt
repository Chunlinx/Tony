                are you a computer professional   uh well i would like to call myself that yes but im sure theres always something new to learn because we have a growing  growing uh computer world out out there   but are you working at the Texas Instruments or are you at home   no im at uh Texas Instruments umhum   okay uh whats whats your application for PCs   oh golly numerous uh application presentations uh memos uh uh spreadsheets um just all kinds of things   oh okay   i dont do any plotting though i dont do any you know i dont do any uh device creations or anything like that   umhum   like in AutoCAD i dont do those but we have that capability here   oh okay well i got involved in uh computers because i have an interest in speech recognition   uhhuh   which is probably why i got involved in the TI switchboard project   umhum thats been ongoing for quite a while now is the speech recognition its uh i dont know how old it is but i know theyve been pursuing it for a long time   and will probably be pursuing it for a long time to come   thats right yes a lot of uh glitches to get out of it to work out of it uhhuh   yeah well i bought a uh PC oh well i bought a series of personal computers of one kind or another but the latest one i bought for the children to use uh for their educational games and and for entertainment games and i soon discovered that it was running faster than the IBM PCAT that i had purchased to do my uh uh postgraduate studies   oh thats interesting isnt it   so ive uh ive taken over the childrens computer   oh my word   and uh enhanced with uh uh uh Texas Instruments DSP board   umhum   and im using it for uh speech recognition research at this point   well thats wonderful how are you advancing on your uh endeavors   well ive gotten to the point where the program will phonetically label a sentence that i speak into the microphone   well great that sounds good   and uh its its just now up and running in that mode and ive got to make a lot of improvements and uh improve my models and   umhum   adjust coefficients and try to improve the performance a little bit but the first results look promising   yeah well thats wonderful thats wonderful now if we can get everybody together that has got all these uh uh new inputs that theyre doing for speech and if if they could get them together and compare notes they probably would do well to jump a couple hundred feet in that area   i think were getting to the point now where uh theres a lot of people whove done research in a lot of individual areas and were sort of entering the phase now where i think were starting to pull some of these results together and getting them to work together   umhum well thats good do you have do you have a group that uh you can interface with each other like uh whos interested in speech   well not really uh but   that wouldnt be a bad idea though do you think that   well my company has has expressed an interest and theyve asked me to do a lot of research so   uhhuh   ive been traveling around the company country talking to uh different groups i spent uh three or four days in Boston earlier this year talking to MIT and uh Bobrank and   umhum   and a place named Sonotek uh just to find out what their state of the art is and i see whats out there that can all be brought to bear on the problem and i think the focus of my dissertation is to uh to look at four different uh technologies that have already been researched and see if i cant make them work together in synergy to to get a step ahead   right um umhum umhum   and uh so i think thats probably the way things will go in the future theyll theyll theyll start pulling together the different aspects of speech recognition i would say that there will be well therell certainly be a lot of commercial products on the market in the next five years   umhum umhum   and therell probably some be some very good systems available by the turn of the century   so its that that soon   yeah uh therell probably be some you know reasonable breakthroughs in terms of uh bringing products to market   umhum its going to be interesting to uh uh look at im not involved in it myself you know but uh just hearing what is going on at TI is very uh fascinating   umhum   and i dont know that much about it i know that um in the group that i was working in there was an area that was really focused on speech recognition however im not in that uh organization any more within TI im in uh a different area of TI now working on something totally different   umhum   so uh my interest was spurred and then it was uh taken away because i i um was moved out of that area   yeah yeah i think its an interesting field and   oh its definitely very fascinating   my primary interest is in speech understanding   uhhuh   uh so once we get the the basic word recognition or something resembling word recognition   umhum   uh my interest is in extracting the understanding and in developing uh man machine dialogue type operations like intelligent tutoring systems that uh the tutoring system can sort of gain some insight into what the student knows or doesnt know and modify its tutoring program accordingly   oh thats wonderful   and uh getting the interactive speech is a key part of that   thats like almost giving them a um evaluation   but right   and going into the direction where theyre gifted in   umhum   thats wonderful   well its its all of parallels techniques that teachers ordinarily use during the day they theyre teaching a grade stool grade school student to add and subtract they they pose problems for them and they see where they make their mistakes in in carrying or uh in borrowing or something like that and they then pose problems which will   um umhum umhum   you know point out the proper procedure and then test them again to see that theyve learned that fact and so thats thats where the artificial intelligence comes in is is in developing that kind of an art in a machine   well youre you sound like youre very current with all that information uh i know it because you have children too and youre also interested in the uh uh voice recognition its been so long since my  my children my grandchildren are in school now but i dont have to worry about them any more just worry about your children   huh   and uh let let the let the parents worry about the about their babies   right   but you just know that their doing well so but i dont have any idea whats going on in the schools today   hm   im not active in any school other than paying my school taxes
