        this recycling its uh i dont know what you all are doing but we are not doing a whole lot here in Arlington about it uh they have a trial section that uh     so   part of the city has been given these uh plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out   right   i dont happen to be in the part of the city that does that though   right here in Philadelphia the city for residential customers has certain they had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with special containers   uhhuh   and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every year a different piece of the city gets added to the list but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now   uhhuh   you on the first and third Saturdays of every month you take your bottles and your newspapers and lets see bottles newspapers to certain corners in the neighborhood   uhhuh   and there is a farmers market that collects the plastic they uh   yes   it use to be a firehouse   uhhuh   but they are trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the University of Pennsylvania where im a grad student     uhhuh   and its not the safest neighborhood there is       so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmers market does is collect plastic   uhhuh   and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and that kind of thing   oh thats interesting the grocery stores here usually have some bins for the plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things   right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah lets see and the   uhhuh   um   we dont have very uh i do not know of a very good place for glass here but i dont i would not know where to take glass   uhhuh how about aluminum cans do they recycle that   oh yes theyll recycle those we have places for those and uh for a while they were the newspapers there were places but i think they had so many newspapers now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any place   right well the only part the thing is that its probably isnt profitable to just from a standpoint of making new paper to recycle   umhum   but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer   yes i know and we have that problem  but uh   down home i know my folks um live in South Carolina and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they the county built a new landfill and a site that wasnt geologically proper   uhhuh   so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they just wont have to build landfills as often   i see   another things that they are doing now at home but in the offices here is recycling of paper and and that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality   uhhuh   from the miscellaneous paper   hum   and well they also recycle aluminum cans   yes   they have every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper   oh thats a good idea   and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall   oh but do you all have any place around there for uh used oil car oil   oh you know thats one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my my oil changed when i go down to South Carolina there has been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years   uhhuh uhhuh   and they have pretty economical rates but now in South Carolina there is this mandatory waste recycling fee and my daddy would like to to get the used oil to pour over fence posts   huh   so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the the uh Goodyear store wont even   right uhhuh uhhuh   they say they cant give you the oil they say its against the federal law now and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee   my goodness   so the only way you can get in South Carolina anyway and they say its because of federal law you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself   huh well we do ours ourself and we take it to a uh
