                                 You Count            How many readers does Slatehave Like other Web sites we get asked this question all the time Our usualreply is Thank you for asking Thats a complicated question But here isour best effort to answer it along with an explanation of why counting readerson the Web is so complicated and why you should take any claims about Websitetrafficexcept ours of coursewith a grain of salt            Traditional print magazines know exactly how many copies they sell though theyhave no idea how many people actually read a particular article or see aparticular ad TV networks rely on sampling by companies like Nielsen to estimate how manyviewers were watching which channel at any hour of the day See Slates recentDispatch from someone selected to be a Nielsen family Nielsenand other firms such as PCMeter now known as Media Metrix are scrambling to adapt this concept tothe Web Meanwhile though there are hits             The contents of a Web site are stored on highperformancecomputers called servers  When you type a Web address into your browseror click on a link or a favorites or bookmark button you are telling yourcomputer to fetch a specific set of datatext images sound etcfrom someWeb sites server Your browser then assembles these data and displays them asa page Each of these requests for information is a hit            Hits perday per week per month  are the most common measure of Web traffic Butthey are deceptive A single Web page can be one hit or many depending on howit is constructed The more separate elements it contains images sound the more hits it will require Thats why Slate and some other sites preferto talk about pages served  This is a measure of how many complete pagesyour server has sent out in response to requests from browsers In recentmonths Slate has been serving an average of about  pages a day            But the number of pages served is also amisleading measure in some ways A page is not a standard unit on the Web theway it is in print Depending on a Web sites design the same amount ofcontent can take up a very different number of pages Slate is designed so thatevery article or feature takes up a single page Other sites break up articlesinto many pages Were not suggesting that people are padding their pagecounts Its a judgment call about whether readers will find having to scrollmore annoying than having to click and wait            Alsosometimes a site will feed you two pages when youve only asked for one Slatedoes this for example with our cover and contents pages HoweverBoy andGirl Scouts that we arewe subtract this double counting in the figures wereport We cannot guarantee that every site is so scrupulous            Further complicating page counts is the issue ofcaching  Computers at corporations and other large organizations oftenaccess the Web through a middleman computer known as a proxy server Your computer requests a page from the proxy server which then requests itfrom the Web site But proxy servers are often programmed to save or cachefrequently requested pages rather than retrieving them from the Web each timethey are requested America Online also caches pages for its customers Andyour own computer is probably set up to cache some pages youve visitedrecently Thats why when reading Slate its quicker to go back to thecontents page than it was to call it up at the start All this caching meanspages are served more quickly but it does become harder for a Web site to knowhow often its pages have actually appeared on someones screen            Anyway pages served could be  people reading this column or one obsessiveparticipant in The Fray What we really want to know is how manyindividual readers Slate has And we can find out sort of Each requestto Slate from your browser carries with it an assortment of useful informationYour computer tells us what operating system and browser software you areusing so that our server can return a page appropriate to your setup We alsoare told about the referring page that is the page you were readingwhen you requested this one Marketers love that information More importanteach page request is accompanied by a return address How else would the serverknow where to send the data Every computer connected to the Internet has anaddress known as an IP address  consisting of four numbers Forexample  is currently the IP address of one of Slates serversDepending on how you access the Internet your computer has either a permanentor a temporary IP address            But for a variety of reasons includingcaching IP addresses arent a great way of counting individual visitorsTherefore there are cookies  Cookies are like the club bouncer whostamps your hand when you leave the premises temporarily so as to identify youwhen you return The first time you visit Slate our computer sends yours apiece of data which your computer sends back every time you return so we knowits you Cookies arent perfect They dont account for multiple peopleaccessing the site from one computer or one person using different computersor browser software Also some older browsers dont understand cookies andnewer ones allow privacy freaks to turn them off But using cookies we canget a pretty good idea of how many unique browsers are visiting oursite            Even that though is aproblematic concept Do you measure browsers per day Per week Per month Thelonger the time period you choose the more individual visitors you can claimwhich is nice On the other hand because of repeat visitors the number ofunique browsers in a given month is less than the total of unique browsers perweek for those four weeks which is less than the total of unique browsers perday over those  days Choose your poison Slate attracts about  uniquebrowsers a day and  a month            Morecomplications Every Friday  people get a printout version of Slatedelivered to them by email Click here to sign up Several hundred others download the printout version directly from our site every day Afew hundred determined traditionalists pay  to get this version of Slateprinted out and mailed to them each week via the US PostalService Hotmail aWebbased email service delivers Slates table of contents to  of itscustomers every week            As this discussion shows measuring Web traffic isgenerally less exact than measuring traditional magazine circulation In oneway though it is more exact We know that every Slate page servedand bythe way the ad on that pagehas hit the eyeballs of one reader and in allprobability not more than one Print publications have no clear idea of howmany people read each copy of their publication and conversely how manyindividual pages of any given copy go unread In practice they tend to makewild claims about the former and ignore the latter            Even this distinctionthough is changing with the development of offline readers software thatautomatically goes to the Web to retrieve material and stores it on your owncomputer Slate is already part of PointCast which puts information you select on your screensaverOffline readers put Web sitesand Web advertisersin the same position astheir counterparts in the print world although the offline reader built intoMicrosofts upcoming Internet Explorer  will actually send the server a log of theusers reading habits            So how many readers doesSlate have Taking all these complications into effect and being as honest aswe can we estimate about  million give or take  or soRemarkable isnt it
