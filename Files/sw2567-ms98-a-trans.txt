          so what do you whats your opinion on the our policy down there   i dont think we have one yeah i was going to say its kind of hard to have have an opinion we seem to uh whoever screams the loudest   i didnt know we had one either yeah   or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support without regard whether there is a democracy or a anarchy or anything else   i yeah the only thing that i pretty much know about is the Central American policy where you know theyre just trying to you know military action in Panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now and then   well oh yeah and then of course there was there was the uh in Columbia with the drug lords but we just   right   talked a lot we didnt actually do anything   right well thats thats what i was about to say we didnt do anything   im actually surprised at anything in Central America along with Panama im just kind of surprised we did that   yeah that is that is pretty risky   especially after our friend Jimmy Carter gave it away anyway   i mean uhhuh   but i guess they had to finally do something actually Bush has been better at that than i thought   umhum   he has a little more  a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would i always considered him kind of a wimp   he takes more risks   yeah Reagan is kind of mush mush mouth   yeah he was     but but i guess most of the policy that were using now is uh a combination of Reagan and Carter neither  much as you know policy makers   yeah it seems that the the policies of pretty much anywhere not just in Central America that US has now is is you know more action than just words than just rhetoric but you know i  we we back up what we say what we say with actions   uh yeah we have so far but we we really really havent of course we really havent taken on the drug lords yet   i dont know how long its going to last yeah   id be interested to see if we do that   well i dont think its possible because even though you know were against them i dont think we can go into another country and do something about the other countrys problem   well we did in Panama we did in Saudi Arabia   yeah but no but see the thing when Panama was uh the that uh Noriega was uh        was was uh was wanted for either the FBI by the FBI and therefore they had a reason but to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different   it could be an interesting   because   interesting problem i   right   i dont know if they could do it or not did you read Tom Clancys A Clear and Present Danger   uh no i didnt     i think you need to pick that up and read it its quite uh its its quite interesting it addresses the problem   oh the drug problem umhum   umhum actually he he wrote that prior to the uh Medellin Medellin Cartel being exposed it was on the stands prior to that time it its quite timely and either he knows somebody or he has a real good a real good imagination because its it hits pretty close to home   yeah   but i dont think were going to have much of a choice in either either Central or South America   i dont think uh i dont think the the uh problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon i mean you know it it i think it pretty much got sidetracked with uh with the Panama and and with the Central Central you know Middle East problems things that that are important take precedent precedence over the drugs i think i think i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front and before you know it itll take a little bit of time before theyll realize that this is failing so theyre going to have to go to the source   um yeah i think we realize its failed we just dont we just  dont nobody wants to make the nobody wants to make the uh unpopular decision of going in and invading   dont admit it yet right   we still theres still theres theres still too many Kennedys and  and Udalls all up there   yep yeah thats true   theres too many liberals in control they cant agree on anything and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes as long as somebodys getting killed as long as nobody knows about it its okay but but the minute it hit hits the paper then of course the Kennedys and the  and the Udalls the Dawes from Georgia all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is   yeah     of course these are the same people that also drown  the  and stuff like that you know       but i guess it automatic i guess its automatic respective   depends on how much power you have and who you know   year you know the people have a right to know except about what it about what concerns them   yeah     and these are the people that make the foreign policy and it its probably basically uh i would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those dont have a lot of uh financial holdings in in Central and South America   probably   considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway       every time you drink Scotch youre paying Kennedys   i dont drink Scotch   good dont ever drink Scotch its terrible i quit drinking Scotch when i found out about that but anyway but uh as far as as far as you know Central and South America we our policy pretty much uh it depends on who were what government were buying down there at the particular time   yeah i think were trying to stay uh stay friendly with uh the uh the Brazilian and and Argentinean governments because theyre producing so much uh agricultural exports   yeah   we dont want to piss them off and have them over produce and then because then our economy would be pretty bad   yeah        although we do need to do something about you know of course in Nicaragua and around there with the Sandinistas and the Contras thats been going on for years but then hell its probably still be going on long after were dead itll still be the same thing   yeah     those people down there dont really   i think its going to have to get worse before it gets better you know the same old cliche   well i think basically they cant figure out what they want down there   right   if you give everybody what they wanted there  is a complete democracy those people wouldnt know how to react because they have no education   right and theyll just pick crooked people again and then people the the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again and itll all be for nothing   its all tradition its all traditional they have to you have the ruling class and you have everybody else   yeah well i guess thats about five minutes appreciate talking to you   alrighty   what was that book that you were saying to read again   well talk to you later Tom Clancy its called A Clear and Present Danger   A Clear and Present Danger   umhum   all right   he wrote hes the one who wrote uh Red October A Hunt for Red October   okay all right   and i think if if you read that i think youll get a real kick out of it   all right thanks a lot all right bye   all right byebye
