WhERE TO GOT he greygreen Danube cuts straight through the heart of the cityneatly separating the ancient cobblestone streets of Buda from the latethcentury boulevards of Pest If you love history youll probably head for the Buda side of the river but if youre a keen shopper and enjoy lively nightlife then Pest will certainly oblige Orientation is rarely a problem as the majority of sights are crammed into the central areas and getting around the city is very easy Castle Hill is made for walking and the rest of town is efciently served by buses trams trolleybuses and underground trainsThis section follows the natural layout of the city starting on the western bank with Buda Obuda and the hills and then moves across the Danube stopping at Margaret Island and over to Pest on the opposite side of the river It is perhaps best to sample Budapest piecemeal taking a little from one side then crossing over the river to the other and heading back again However most would agree that the best place to start is the Castle HillCastle Hill VarhegyThis fascinating area is the most picturesque and peaceful spot in Budapest giving the only clue as to how the medieval city once looked Entire streets of beautiful old buildings are concentrated here and almost every other house bears a muemlk monument plaque which tells of its history As serene as it seems today however the district has suffered destruction upon destruction in the past and many places have been rebuilt at least onceThe area overlooks the city from a long narrow plateau divided into two the southern part occupied by the enormous Royal Palace where the original castle once stood and the northern district of historic streets where th and thcentury aristocrats and artisans once rubbed shouldersFrom Pest there are various ways of getting up to Castle Hill The most popular method of ascent is aboard the thcentury sikl funicular which starts by the end of the Chain Bridge and rises to the Royal Palace Alternatively take the metro to Moszkva tr climb up the steps to the road and catch the mini Vrbusz service which shuttles to and from Dsz tr stopping at numerous points en route You could simply walk up the hill using any one of several streets and staircases but one method you cannot use is your own transport cars are forbidden on the hill unless you are a resident or a guest at the Hilton Hotel thus preserving the areas historic ambienceHistoric StreetsTurning right at the funicular terminus a short walk brings you to Dsz tr Parade Square which marks the start of the northern district The Mtys templom Matthias Church spire towering gracefully over this historic area is the best reference point for our tour The church takes its name from Hungarys favourite medieval king who married here twice in the th century The Emperor Franz Joseph I was crowned king of Hungary here in  to the tune of the Coronation Mass composed by Liszt for the occasionThe original church was built in the midth century converted into a mosque during the Turkish occupation and seriously damaged during Budas recapture in  It was rebuilt in Baroque style after the return of the Christian forces and between  and  it was completely reconstructed along its present NeoGothic linesThe unusual multicoloured diamondpattern roof and geometric designs covering the inside walls date back to the thcentury refurbishing the motifs are therefore Hungarian and not TurkishTour guides are quick to point out the Loreto Chapel immediately to the left of the entrance where a red marble statue of the Virgin takes pride of place At the east end of the church is the entrance to the crypt and the museum which holds a ne collection of medieval stone carvings sacred relics historic vestments and religious paintings The museum rambles up and down old staircases around the church offering at one spot an excellent view down onto the naveOutside the front of the church in the centre of Szenthromsg tr Trinity Square is a votive column crowded with statues of saints and angels which recalls a bubonic plague epidemic of the early th century The survivors built the monument in gratitude for being spared Behind the column there is a ne NeoGothic building that puts on temporary exhibitions and also offers accommodation Looking across the square towards Dsz tr the Baroque twostorey white building with a jutting corner balcony served as the former Buda town hall from  to  Behind the church is the most photographed monument in Budapest the intriguinglynamed Halszbstya Fishermens Bastion Built onto the castle walls at rst glance this picturebook array of turrets terraces and arches could easily pass for authentic medieval fortications but they are in fact too good to be true constructed around the turn of this century as pure ornamentation The name refers to the shermen who defended the ramparts here in the th century Today it is a busy place with coachloads of tourists peering through the arches for one of the citys finest viewsacross the Danube and over to the Houses of Parliament At the handsome equestrian statue of the canonized King Istvnn old ladies trade Transylvanian tablecloths zithers sing sweetly and barrelorgans grind while classical buskers ll the air with Bartk and LisztThe view west from Fishermens Bastion focuses on the startling sixstorey reective faade of the Budapest Hilton Hotel The bold approach of shamelessly merging ancient and modern has integrated the  Hilton Hotel with the remains of a thcentury Jesuit college and the tower of the districts oldest church dating from the th centuryAcross on Hess Andrs tr the basrelief of a red hedgehog at number  recalls the th century when the building was an inn of that name Today on the hill theres no better place for light refreshment than Ruszwurms a mere scones throw away at  Szenthromsg utca This cosy patisserie has been resident here since  its cakes compete favourably with the best the city has to offerStart your tour of the old streets along Tncsics Mihly utca House number  where Beethoven stayed in  is now the charming Museum of the History of Music Here youll learn to tell your clavichord from your hurdygurdy and that bagpipes are also an Hungarian instrument Next door at number  are plaques to political heroes Mihly Tncsics and Lajos Kossuth both imprisoned here in the s and s for their nationalist beliefs Number  served as a synagogue from the end of the th century a small museum relates to this period The street ends at the Bcsi kapu Vienna Gate a reminder that the district was once fully enclosed The grand building next to the gate with the diamondpatterned roofechoing that of St Mtysis the National Archive open to the publicFortuna utca is a charming muchphotographed street full of pastelpainted houses and takes its name from a tavern which stood at number  from  to  Today this houses the Museum of Commerce and Catering Kereskedelmi s Vendgltipari Mzeumnowhere near as grand nor as boring as its name suggestsdealing with confectionery in one section and Hungarian trade in the late th and early th century in another The museum curators take a genuine delight in demonstrating various exhibits its well worth a visitAt Szenthromsg tr turn back into Orszghz utca Orszghz which means Houses of Parliament takes its name from the parliamentary sessions which took place in the building at number  between  and  The architectural highlights of this street however are the grand thcentury mansion now used by the Alabrdos halbardier restaurant as well as numbers  which are considered three of the nest examples of th and thcentury domestic architecture on the hill Several other buildings on this street incorporate picturesque medieval features at times hidden just inside the archway Here youll see both ancient stone sedilia builtin seats for three people and vignettes of contemporary life with an equally timeless quality such as necklaces of paprika strung across windows and balconies to dry people do still live hereAt the end of this street rises a large glassless church window It belongs to the Church of Mary Magdalene reduced to kneehigh remains by the Allies in the last days of World War II Amazingly its huge rocketlike thcentury tower survived and now houses a private art gallery The stone window was rebuilt but the remainder of the church was left levelled as a poignant reminder of events An altogether more lighthearted curiosity can be seen on the corner of Orszghz utca and Petermann br utca A ying nun in stone a reference to a convent that occupied number  before Parliament has apparently passed straight through the corner of the building Mikls Melocco executed this amusing sculpture in Uri utca meaning gentlemens street is even older than Orszghz utca and the details on many of its houses are equally fascinating Yet another specialist museum crops up at number  the Telephone Museum features  years of telephone exchanges and technology Budapest had the first telephone exchangeAt number  you can descend deep into the hill via a series of tunnels that were dug in medieval times as an escape route in times of siege They were used again as airraid shelters and an emergency hospital in  Here visitors can join a guided tour of the caves and tunnels which also contain a waxwork exhibition depicting episodes of Hungarian historyUri utca terminates at Dsz tr where its best to turn and walk back along Trnok utca Among the shops and restaurants here are a number of ne buildings The orangeandred geometric frescoes painted on the overhanging rst oor of the Aranyhord Golden Barrel restaurant are the most noteworthy Next door number  was built as a merchants house in the rst half of the th century Used as the Arany Sas Golden Eagle pharmacy from  until  it is now the most attractive of this areas small museums Beautiful old majolica vessels are the stars of an atmospheric recreation of the pharmacy and there are also informative displays on potions practices and alchemy in the Budapest of this eraThe nal street of this district to be explored is the leafy Tth Arpd stny This promenade situated along the western ramparts offers views of the Buda Hills and the huge Southern Railway Station Dli plyaudavar rather than a glorious Danube panorama Nonetheless this is a delightful stroll particularly in early evening when the locals come out to enjoy the fresh air At the northern end various cannon signal the entrance to the Museum of Military History Hadtrtneti Mzeum Its an extensive exhibition and popular with schoolchildren but the section dedicated to the  uprising is the most memorable for older visitorsThe Royal PalaceNow returned to its former outward splendour the Royal Palace dominates Castle Hills southern skyline Construction began in the th century and reached its zenith in the th century under King Mtys when the palace was said to be equal in grandeur to that of any in Europe Under the Ottoman empire however it was neglected and during the siege of  was destroyed In the following two centuries the palace was rebuilt in the NeoBaroque style Nemesis was on hand again when the German occupation forces made this their headquarters during a nal stand in  Since then the palace has been rebuilt purely to house three museums and a library Its a huge place and cant be covered in one day Break up your time here with sightseeing on the northern part of the hillIf you are not already on Castle Hill then the best approach to the Royal Palace is from the steps at the southern tip of the hill by the Semmelweis Medical Museum The path winds up through lovely gardens to the rear entrance of the castle and the only surviving turreted tower the Buzogny mace Tower Steps lead up through tiny castle gardens to the entrance of the Museum of Budapest History Budapesti Trtneti Mzeum in wing E of the Royal PalaceMore than  years of excavations at the palace site have produced a picture of the medieval Royal Palace of King Mtys it is possible to visit the ten or so rooms that have survived from the original now reconstructed in their former state Make sure you see the exhibition of Gothic statues from the Royal Palace During construction work at the start of the th century the statues were thrown out in the yard which was later filled in and they remained there until excavated in The southern palace courtyard includes wing F which houses the National Library and its two million books The library is open to the public and temporary exhibitions are held in the buildingThrough the courtyard arch is the main Palace area The Museum of Recent History in Wing A stages some interesting everyday life exhibitions visitors can also enjoy views of Buda and Pest Wings B C and D house the Hungarian National Gallery Magyar Nemzeti Galriaa huge undertaking spanning seven centuries of Hungarian art Dont try to see it all in one visitthere are some ne works here but it is too much for one day The gallerys most popular sections are Hungarian Impressionism and th century works in Wings C and D Contemporary art lovers are advised to head straight for the Ludwig Collection in wing A which includes important figures in the contemporary art world featuring several controversial worksObudaHistorically Obuda is the oldest quarter of Buda centred on the site of Aquincum the capital of the Roman province of Lower Pannonia Nowadays its a nightmare of Soviet townplanning with heavy trafc constantly rumbling past on the main northern highway out of Budapest Amid this unlikely setting however there are some major Roman remains to be discoveredTo begin the Roman route take any number of city buses north to the socalled Military Amphitheatre Katonai Amtetrum thus distinguishing it from a smaller one a short distance farther north Gladiators performed here in the second century to amuse legionnaires Completely forgotten for centuries the ruins were only partially restored in the s Now its effectively a grassy piece of parkland where locals play and walk their dogs but enough remains of the amphitheatre walls and outline to give a good idea of what it was once likeFarther north beneath the Flrin tr yover on the Buda side of the Arpd Bridge stand the ruins of baths built for the Roman legions Take the walkway on the opposite side of the yover from the baths and you will catch the incongruous sight of a dozen isolated Corinthian columns with a s housing estate backdropThe third and most important site is that of Aquincum a civil town for the artisans merchants priests and other nonmilitary staff attached to the legion You can get here by bus tram or HEV train Keep your eyes on the highway central reservation shortly before the Aquincum stop and you will see the remains of a Roman aqueductThe site proper which covers several acres comprises the foundations of villas including some oor mosaics workshops and public areas and there is another amphitheatre ruin on the other side of the road You will need more than a little imagination to reenact the scene of  years ago from the kneehigh rubble but you will nd help in the small museum attached to the site Here the best of the nds are displayed here and at the entrance kiosk there are guidebooks in various languages If you want to explore the Roman connection farther enquire at Aquincum about access to the Hercules Villa museum at Meggyfa utca But there is more to Obuda than its Roman heritage Between Flrin tr and the river is Fotr a small picturesque cobbled square untouched by modern development In this oasis you will nd a fine old theatre several pleasant cafs four rstclass restaurants and just off the square two excellent small museumgalleriesEven before you reach the Imre Varga Museum at Laktanya utca  youll half know what to expect because of the charming gures with umbrellas standing by the square Varga is renowned as Hungarys greatest living sculptor whether his materials and subject matter are conventional as is the case with Umbrellas or offbeat as many of his works are he manages to be accessible and very likeableThe Vasarely Museum on Szentllek tr features rstclass Op Art a style that exploits optical effects characterized by cubes and spheres in bright eyepopping checkerboard colours by artist Victor Vasarely a pioneer of the movementBuda Riverside and HillsThe stretch of riverside which is of most interest to visitors runs north from Szabadsg hd Liberty Bridge While Castle Hill provides arguably the nest views over the Danube there is another lookout point that also should not be missed Gellrthegy Gellrt Hill which rises some  metres  feet almost directly above the Danube on the Buda side provides a marvellous panorama Its not well served by public transport so give your legs some exercise starting from the southern approach by the Gellrt HotelAlmost immediately to your right you will see an extraordinary monument in the hillside a cave converted into a chapel It belongs to the Order of St Paul the only monastic body of Hungarian origin Continue up the slope through the pleasant landscaped gardens of the Jubileumi Park turn right onto the main road and you will soon reach the summitThe Citadel crowning the hill was built by the Habsburgs after the Revolution of  as a lookout point from which to control neighbouring Castle Hill It saw no action however until the end of World War II when the German army held out here Since then the Citadel has been renovated and now holds a restaurant caf and budget hotelA Liberation Monument Szabadsag szobor visible from all parts of the city stands below the citadel It was erected by the Russians in honour of their troops who fell while liberating Budapest from the Germans The monument is loathed by most locals as a symbol of Soviet domination but it has become too much of a city landmark to removeDown at the base of the hill the Gellrt Hotel is the perfect place to recover from your walk Behind this classic  white Art Nouveau structure is a swimming pool complex and the nest thermal bath in Buda While the older family members may wish to enjoy the restorative thermal waters and float at leisure in the beautiful indoor pool youngsters will most likely delight in the equally splendid landscaped outdoor poolThere are some more baths frdo with a wonderful atmosphere in which to relax just along the Buda embankment rakpart by the entrance to the Erzsbet hd Elizabeth Bridge The thermal pools are restricted to men only The entrance to the Rudas frdo is rather shabby and a knowledge of the language is denitely an advantage here but after  years of serving the locals change comes slowly The building has been much altered over the centuries but the atmosphere in the steamy main pool where a stone Turkish dome rises over an octagonal pool and sunbeams stream in through the starshaped glass openings in the cupola is magically ancient The medicinal theme continues a little farther north at the Semmelweis Museum of the History of Medicine Semmelweis Orvostrtneti Mzeum Professor Semmelweis who was born here in  discovered the cause of puerperal fever and thus became known as the Saviour of Mothers The museum is a lively sometimes gruesome trawl through old instruments and techniques some of which appear far worse than the condition they were intended to relieve There is also a beautifully preserved old pharmacy shop dating back to North of the museum the embankment is relieved by arcades terraces NeoClassical statues ceremonial staircases and gateways not open to the public which lead up to the Royal Palace At this point its best to catch a bus or tram along the main road Fo utca which becomes a canyon of trafc noise pollution and exhaust fumes Get off at the stop before Batthyny tr to admire the colourful exterior of the  NeoGothic Calvinist Church which features in so many panoramas of the cityBatthyny tr is a major square where metro bus tram and suburban railway all meet It is a bright lively area and offers a wonderful view of the Houses of Parliament directly across the river The similarity to Londons own Parliament Big Ben aside is quite striking with the Danube simply substituted for the ThamesThe Vienna stagecoach terminal used to be just around the corner and the once famous White Cross Inn on the opposite side of the square to the river was the fashionable venue for balls and festivities Its still a grand old building even if its role has now diminished to that of a nightclub renamed Casanova after the famous rake who reputedly stayed here On the south side of the square is Szent Anna templom St Annes Church a ne midthcentury structure with Italianate inuencesFarther north along Fo utca is another excellent example of a Turkish bath The Kirly frdo Kirly Baths were established in the th century and the authentic Turkish section has survived complete with an octagonal pool under the largest dome Apart from the steam bath visitors can use the bath tubs sauna and several other facilitiesTurn left off Frakel Le t the continuation of Fo utca at Margit hd Margaret Bridge and follow the signpost up the steps to another Turkish memento the Gl Baba trbje the tomb of Gl Baba This meticulously preserved mausoleum was built in the midth century for Gl Baba a famous dervish killed during the siege of Buda in  whose funeral was attended by the Sultan The interior in keeping with the Muslim tradition is quite simple with the tomb surrounded by carpets and a few artworks from the Turkish government The hill on which the tomb stands called the Rzsadomb Hill of the Roses is one of the most exclusive addresses in BudapestBuda HillsThe Buda Hills area is a greenbelt that lies due west of Rzsadomb though it stretches as far north as Obuda and as far south as the start of the M highway Choose a clear day then catch any one of several trams or buses which go past the cograilway terminus just west of Moszkva tr opposite the Hotel Budapest There is room on the train for mountain bikes if you are feeling particularly active The train passes smart residential houses on its way to the terminus and park of Svbhegy A short walk across the park just follow the crowds is the stop for the Childrens Railway Szchenyihegyi Gyermekvast thus named because it is operated almost entirely by schoolchildren only the engine drivers are adultsThis is an old narrowgauge line which traverses seemingly unspoiled forestsbut for the numerous walking trailsand climbs slowly everupwards At the rst stop Normafa youll find a skirun but unless its snowing stay on the train until Jnoshegy It is a  minute walk from here to the Jnoshegy lookout tower at  metres  feet the highest point in the city If the horizon is not blurred by mist theres a splendid degree view for mile upon mile you can also eat hereOn the way to the lookout tower you will have passed a chairlift that goes down to a camping site The views from the chairlift are also spectacular and the peace and quiet as you soar up and down the mountainside is quite extraordinary Remember to note that the chairlift is closed on some Mondayscheck with Tourinform or go on another day If you would prefer a speedy return to town catch the  bus to Moszkva tr from near the bottom of the chairliftBetween the BanksJust as Tower Bridge is the toast of London the Golden Gate is the pride of San Francisco and the Brooklyn Bridge is a symbol of New York Budapest too has its landmark river crossingsThe most venerable of these is the Szchenyi Lnchd or Chain Bridge opened in  the rst span to unite Buda and Pest Count Istvn Szchenyi a great innovator of his age imported the technology and expertise of the British Industrial Revolution to help Hungarys own reform programme The bridge was designed by an English engineer William Tierney Clark and its construction was supervised by a Scotsman Adam Clark no relation who has a square named after him at the Buda end of the bridge Dont miss the oodlit view of the bridgeits one of the citys nest sightsSouth of the Chain Bridge is the rather more functionallooking Erzsbet hd Elizabeth Bridge named after the consort of Franz Joseph tragically assassinated in  The bridge opened in  is of modern design and works on the suspension principleSouthwards from Elizabeth Bridge is the Szabadsg hd Liberty Bridge opened in  and originally called the Franz Joseph Bridge Its a handsome green iron structure with turul birds see page  perched on a golden ball balancing on each pillarTo the north of the Chain Bridge is Margit hd Margaret Bridge a modern replacement of the thcentury version destroyed in World War II Note the fine stone carvings of nymphs resembling ships gureheads on the bridge piersMargaret Island MargitszigetThe elite of the Roman empire escaped everyday cares on this leafy oasis between the two banks and in later eras princes and plutocrats did likewise Today wealthy tourists enjoy the thermal facilities and treatments offered at the two internationalclass hotels on the island The leisure establishment of most interest to visitors is the huge outdoor Palatinus Baths Palatinus strand which includes thermal pools and boasts a capacity of  swimmers and sunbathers The island is not just for tourists however Budapestis of all ages come here to walk run swim play tennis or team games or simply sunbathe Its also a famous spot for courting couplesThe island is  km  miles long and only a few hundred yards at the widest part Many of its estimated population of  trees are now more than a century old and large areas of the island are lawned and landscaped Best of all cars with a few exceptions are prohibited thus preserving the islands peace and quietAlongside a landmark water tower is a good openair theatre which presents concerts opera and ballet performances in the summer Nearby are the ruins of a thcentury Dominican Convent that was founded by King Bla IV Here he enrolled his yearold daughter Margit in fullment of a vow he had made should he live to survive the Mongol invasion Princess and later saint Margit stayed on the island for the rest of her life it was subsequently named after her Her burial place is marked by a marble plaqueThe other ruins close by include a Franciscan Church and monastery built in the th century The charming little Premonstratensian Chapela thcentury reconstruction of the original thcentury churchis still in use today It houses a thcentury bell the oldest in HungaryPestThe bulk of modern Budapest lies to the east of the Danube in what was until  the autonomous city of Pest Here is the true pulse of Budapest large hotels museums government buildings shopping streets nightlife and thunderously busy boulevardsFrom the Romans point of view defending Buda and therefore western civilization was a real headache All they could do was stare across the great expanse of at badlands to the east of the river and wait for the barbarians to arrive So in ad  they decided to build a defence on the east side to make it harder for any invaders to establish a foothold here They called the place ContraAquincum it is still at the core of the inner city of PestThe Inner City BelvrosA medieval town grew around the Roman defencepost evolving into a long narrow strip with the Danube to the west and defensive walls on the other sides The socalled Kiskrt Little Boulevard follows the line of the old walls and encloses the district of Belvros Note that you wont nd Kiskrt on any mapits the aggregate of Vmhz krt Mzeum krt Kroly krt the southern end of BajcsyZsilinszky t and Jzsef Attila utcaThe oldest building in Pest is the Belvrosi templom Inner City Parish Church The exterior is rather unprepossessinga sooty Baroque church hemmed into an undignied position by the Elizabeth Bridgebut look inside and you can discern much earlier elements in the handsome interior It was founded in the th century and some Romanesque construction is still visible So too is the influence of the Turks who turned the church into a mosque and carved a mihrab prayer niche on the Mecca side of the chancel wall Next to the church is all that remains of ContraAquincuman excavated square with benches and a small display of tablets and reliefs found on the siteThe centrepiece of Pests pedestrian zone is Vci utca pronounced Vahtsee utsa the first place to visit for shopping in the city Here you will nd the best fashion art cosmetics books and jewellery the biggest and the best branch of Folkart see page  the Pest Sznhz theatre where Franz Liszt made his city debut as a yearold pianist various airline offices and several international organizationsVci utca runs into the everbusy yet somehow relaxed Vrsmarty tr This is one of Pests favourite gathering places often lined with craft stalls and resounding to a brass band After a browse through Luxus department store its probably time for coffee and cakes at Gerbeaud doyen of Budapests coffeehouse scene since  If the sumptuous highceilinged interior is a little too formal for your liking then take a terrace seat and watch the world go byStroll a few yards towards the river and you will come to yet another pleasant and lively square Vigad tr which has the advantage of a riverside location with Castle Hill views Here too you will find craft stalls and any number of buskers A vibrant cafrestaurant comprises one side of the square but the dominant building is the splendid Vigad theatre The interior hall is an acoustically perfect auditorium renovated in  its predecessors having twice perished in war and revolution but the faade has been gloriously restored in midthcentury HungarianEastern style The list of performers and conductors who have graced the Vigad theatre is an impressive Whos Who of the past  years of European classical music Liszt Brahms Wagner Mahler Bartk Prokoev Casals Bjrling and von KarajanThis is also the centre of what may be called the Hotel Zone with four luxury hotels within a very short distance of each other Their architecture has done nothing for the aesthetics of the embankment viewed from the Buda side of the river but ironically looking in the opposite direction they provide some of the nest views of the cityFrom Vrsmarty tr take Dek Ferenc utca into busy Dek tr Just to the east of the pedestrianized zone across Peto Sndor utca are a number of intriguing buildings and two small museums Next to the ordinary Lutheran Church is the National Lutheran Museum which houses a valuable collection including documents bibles and chalices It chronicles the story of some of the distinguished Protestants influential in the history of this predominantly Catholic country As Dek tr is the only meeting point for all three metro lines its an apt place for the tiny Metro Museum FAV Mzeum located down in the pedestrian subway Here you can see the original train that travelled on Europes first continental underground railway in its hardly different to those on the current Millennium lineAlmost opposite the Lutheran Museum next to MacDonalds is the helpful Tourinform tourist information ofce The mustard building dominating the far side of the square is the Anker Palace formerly an insurance company headquarters and one of the very few structures to escape World War II unscathedWalk down Barczy utca which runs along the back of the Lutheran Church and on your right the Budapest City Hall

along Krolyi Mihly utca past the yellow University Library building on your left On the opposite corner is the University Church Egyetemi templom Built between  and  by the monks of the Order of St Paul it features splendidly rich Baroque carving Turn into Szerb utca where there are more university buildings The Serbian Church on this quiet street dates from  and has a beautiful interiorThe Little BoulevardDespite its diminutive name the Little Boulevard is very big on trafc it is definitely not the place for a leisurely stroll There are however three major points of interest that fall just outside the inner city side of this notional dividing lineThe most popular of these among locals is the Budapest Market Halls Vsrcsarnok at the beginning of Vmhz krt by the Szabadsg hd Liberty Bridge This vast oldfashioned covered market is brimming with local colour and exotic smells There is also a lively daily market at Lehel tr north of the inner city in the Liptvros district take metro line  to the station at Lehel trFor visitors the most popular Little Boulevard attraction is the Hungarian National Museum Magyar Nemzeti Mzeum This impressive structure built in NeoClassical style with Corinthian columns and a sculptured tympanum stands back off the road in its own big garden Inside amid monumental architectural and ornamental details the whole story of Hungary unfolds On display are prehistoric remains and ancient jewels and tools but theres no doubt as to which is the main point of interest just follow the crowd to the hushed room where the royal regalia residesThe crown is romantically associated with St Stephen the great thcentury king but is actually of a slightly later date the lower half is th century the upper th century The beautiful goldthreaded mantle made in  is said to belong to St Stephen The sceptre also dates from around the th century Its believed that both the thcentury gilded orb and the thcentury sword are replacements of the original regalia that was lostThe exhibition downstairs which deals with the history of the Carpathian Basin from prehistoric times right up to the Conquest of  has some good moments particularly when covering the Roman period its worthwhile buying a copy of the EnglishGerman guide book which costs only a few forintsThe exhibit upstairs covering the period from  to  is of more general interest than the previous millennium A thcentury Turkish tent decked out with carpets is one highlight while other exhibits run the gamut of war and peace from suits of armour to room reconstructions The museum also boasts a natural history section but compared to the riches of the rest of the collection this is entirely optional viewingBack on the Little Boulevard at the start of Dohny utca is a striking synagogue of enormous proportions built in a amboyant ByzantineMoorish style This is the Central or Great Synagogue dating from the midth century which is claimed by some sources to be the biggest in Europe capable of holding up to  people Visitors are allowed in except during services between  am and  pm to appreciate its quiet grandeurAn interesting and informative Jewish Museum within the complex includes a moving exhibition about the Hungarian Holocaust Next door to the museum in a courtyard of the synagogue is a metal weepingwillow fashioned by the artist Imre Varga see page  Each leaf bears the name of a Budapest family that perished in the Holocaust The site is deliberately chosen being above the mass graves of Jews executed by the fascist Arrow Cross government installed by the Nazis between  and LiptvrosBounded by Jozsf Attila utca to the south and by BajcsyZsilinszky t to the east Liptvros Leopold Town lies directly north of the inner city Directions to find the Basilica of St Stephen Szent Istvn Bazilika arent needed as its metre foot dome dominates the skyline The biggest church in Budapest built between  and  it is frequently full to its capacity of  people Its exterior is in a poor state though slowly being restored Before seeing the interior ascend the tower Its a long walk to the top but you are rewarded with Pests highest viewpointThe interior of the basilica is dimly lit There is an interesting main attraction in a reliquary in a rear chapel the Szent Jobb Holy Right is the much revered holy relic of the right hand of St Stephen youll need a forint piece to illuminate itSzabadsg tr Freedom Square a short walk to the north is probably Pests nest architectural ensemble At its centre is an obelisk dedicated to the Soviet troops who fell in the city but the enormous ostentatious buildings surrounding the square are what really steal the show The superb lemoncoloured Art Nouveau building close to the obelisk is home to the American Embassy Next door is the former Stock Exchange now the countrys TV headquarters a showy eclectic building with some good reliefs The Hungarian National Bank on the opposite side of the square is the work of the same architectThe great dome of Parliament equal in height to that of the basilica is clearly visible from the square The Houses of Parliament Orszghz were built between  and  as a symbol of the grandeur of the AustroHungarian empire Its vital statistics are impressive  metres  feet long  rooms and an estimated  km  miles of staircase inside The architect may not have had Londons Houses of Parliament in mind but whatever his intentions the NeoGothic arches and turrets rarely escape comparison with those of WestminsterTourists are only admitted on group excursions and only to certain parts of the building when parliament is not in session the visiting arrangements do vary from year to year check with Tourinform as to the current situation If you are admitted on a guided tour you will probably be taken up the grandiose central stairway to a splendid sided domed hall then into the lobby and nally into the principal debating chamber of the House Look out for the brass rack where deputies leave their cigars before they enter the chamberAcross from parliament is the mighty Ethnographic Museum Nprajzi Mzeum built in the same era occupying the former location of the Supreme Court of Justice It is worth a visit for the palatial interiors alone but the exhibits here are also some of the most fascinating in the city Permanent displays show the fastdisappearing world of Hungarian rural life and folklore these are underpinned by trenchant temporary exhibitions dealing with current issues such as the lives of Budapests gypsiesAndrssy tThe most attractive avenue in the city modelled after the ChampsElyses in Paris was a bold stroke of the s Travelling straight as an arrow almost  km  miles from the inner city to the City Park it is the site of some of the nest architecture in Budapest The buildings that line it blend well yet almost every one has a unique featurea fountain a statue a mosaic or a frieze columns or arches Theres a roomy patrician feeling here which belies the avenues past namesfrom the unpronounceable Npkztrsasg tja Peoples Republic Avenue to the prosaic Sugr t Radial Road to the hated Stalin tYou can visit one of the typically large ndesicle aristocratic homes right at the start of the avenue at number  now home to the Postal Museum There are some colourful and interesting exhibits here particularly the correspondence between Thomas Edison and the Hungarian telecommunications pioneer Tivadar Pusks but the real attraction is the building itself particularly the stairway and balcony decorated with outstanding frescoes by Kroly LotzThe State Opera House Andrssy t  completed in  by Mikls Ybl is the most admired building on the avenue Its Italianate style and restrained proportions t in exquisitely with its surroundings

away from the noise and trafc of Andrssy t the City Park is a lovely green space where Budapestis can relax stroll have a meal hire a rowing boat go to the zoo or visit museums The park which covers some  hectares  acres began to evolve in the early th century though many of the present amenities were added during preparations for the Millennium festivities of Cross the bridge over the boating lake which doubles as an iceskating rink in winter The Castle of Vajdahunyad behind the lake was built as a prop for the Millenary Exhibition but proved so popular that it was rebuilt in permanent form It reproduces in convincing detail part of the exterior of the fairytale Hunyadi castle in Transylvania Inside the castle is the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture housing a comprehensive collection that illustrates the history of hunting fishing and farming If you want to see the castle at its best return by night when it is beautifully illuminated Within the grounds theres a Catholic church with a splendid Romanesque portal another reconstruction and one of the citys favourite statues which depicts the medieval chronicler who gave Hungary its rst written records Unfortunately he didnt leave us his name so his face is hidden deep inside the cowl of his monksstyle robe he is referred to simply as Anonymous There are two more museums in the park both towards its top righthand corner The Museum of Aviation and Space Travel occupies part of the Peto Csarnok Peto Hall the city youthcentre where rock concerts often take place while you will find the Transport Museum Kzlekedsi Mzeum on the perimeter path of the park Both of these deal almost exclusively with Hungarian developments and are most likely to appeal to specialists or childrenThe jewel in the park is the Szchenyi Baths complex to the left of the road that bisects the park This is one of the largest medicinal bath complexes in Europe it also provides yearround openair swimming at a constant C F in beautiful surroundings The buildings constructed between  and  in a Baroque Art Nouveau style are topped by a series of huge green domes Inside the pool area the walls are ivyclad and there is some sumptuous statuary but even more interesting than the architecture of the baths is the bizarre sight of groups of men playing chess while immersed in warm water their boards are supported on small jetties protruding into the poolJust behind the baths are the zoo and two amusement parks The zoo welcomes visitors with an Art Nouveau entrance decorated with polar bears and elephants It keeps a wide range of animals including most childrens and adults favourite species The animals are mostly held in traditional cages though renovations on several pavilions are in progress Grownups may like to note that

metro which runs the whole length of Andrssy t look for the antique yellow Fldalatti signs The quaint oldfashioned trains are a tourist attraction in their own right Note that the trains run in the same direction as trafc and you must descend to the platform from the appropriate side of the road it is not possible to cross the lines once you are undergroundThe Great BoulevardThe Great Boulevard Nagykrt forms a long sweeping arc from the Margaret Bridge to the Peto Bridge It has over the centuries changed in name from Ferenc to Jzsef to Erzsbet to Terz and nally to Szent Istvn yet its character remains consistentbig and bustling City planners approved the project and pushed it through during the landmark year of  when the volume of trafc was considerably less than it is today The buildings that line the boulevard are routinely six or more storeys high many with ornate architectural touchesThe architectural pride of the Great Boulevard has to be the Museum of Applied Arts Iparmuvszeti Mzeum just off Ferenc krt at  lloi t The exterior is a splendid example of Art Nouveau incorporating Hungarian folk art styles and using Hungarian majolica tiles Great green cupolas small spiky towers a majolica lantern and a bright green and gold roof top the ensemble The architect of the museum dn Lechner is regarded as the greatest exponent of this native form of Art Nouveau style The interior is if anything even more remarkable The style itself may best be described as fantasy Hungarian with strong Moorish inuences Shimmering white Arabian Nightstype arches balconies and swirling staircases sweep up to a ne Art Nouveau skylight The main hall is covered by a great expanse of glass supported by an iron frame and ferns and potted plants around the hall create an exotic ambienceA fascinating permanent exhibition showing the progress of native arts and crafts techniques from the th century onwards is augmented by a variety of temporary exhibitions which are usually of a very high quality on more specialized subjectsA museum of an altogether more restrained nature lies just beyond Erzsbet krt at Hrsfa utca  The Philatelic Museum Blyeg Mzeum contains every stamp issued by the country from  onwards and so provides its own miniature pictorial history of the countryTerz krt and Erzsbet krt have traditionally been centres of Budapests cultural as well as its commercial life At the Great Boulevards intersection with Dohny utca is the New York Caf formerly known as the Hungaria The cafs NeoBaroque Art Nouveau interior shining with polished wood brass and cut glass has been restored to its original gaudy gloryit looks the same as it did at the beginning of the th century It is once again a meeting point for actors writers and journalists ExcursionsThe Danube BendOnly a few miles north of Budapest the Danube dramatically alters its easterly course for a southern tack The prosaic name of this beautiful region is Dunakanyar meaning Danube Bend Here the river is at its most alluring the countryside is lush and mostly unspoiled and there are three delightful historic towns to exploreSzentendreJust  km  miles from central Budapest Szentendre is the most captivating of the Danube Bend settlements The easiest way to reach it is by the HEV suburban railway from Batthyny tr During summer boats make a fivehour journey all the way from Budapest to Esztergom stopping en route at Szentendre and Visegrd On your approach to Szentendre dont be put off by the modern suburbsthe heart of the town remains virtually locked in the th century Right at the centre is Fo tr a picturepostcard cobblestone square The iron rococo cross in the centre was erected in  by the Serbian community in gratitude for being spared by the plague and the majestic Serbian church on the hill is the towns most prominent landmarkSerbian refugees twice settled here in the wake of Turkish invasions first in the late th century and then again in  On the latter occasion around  Serbs brought their religion art architecture trades and crafts and commercial acumen to Szentendre The church in the square the Blagovestenska Eastern Orthodox is known as the Greek Church Greek refugees also ed here even though it too is Serbian Built in the midth century its interior is a little gem with a collection of Serbpainted icons well worth seeingOn one side of the church in what used to be an thcentury schoolhouse you will find the Ferenczy Museum displaying works by the Hungarian Impressionist Kroly Ferenczy and his two children Another museum on the opposite side of the church conrms Szentendres status as an important artists colony The Margit Kovcs Museum is the former home and workshop of ceramicist Margit Kovcs  unknown outside Hungary but worthy of an international audience Inside there are attenuated sculptures of wideeyed damsels poignant religious icons and ordinary people stooped and tragic bearing the whole weight of Hungarys thcentury misfortunesThe rustred midthcentury Serbian church on the hill is only open for services but in its grounds is the excellent Collection of Serbian Ecclesiastical Art displaying precious carvings icons and manuscripts The oldest church in the town lies just above here on top of the hill affording a perfect vantage point from which to peer down into the tiny gardens and courtyards and across the towns venerable rooftopsThe Catholic parish church dates mostly from the th century though parts of it go back to the th century During summer and early autumn craft and souvenir stalls congregate around here Opposite the church is another good local artists collection that of the Impressionist Bla Czbel You will nd much more art on display in town but dont miss the modern art in the Barcsay Collection on the road out to the bus and railway stationIf you want a change from museums and galleries a km mile trip out of town brings you to a great place for historic films the Hungarian Open Air Village Museum Szabadtri Nprajzi Mzeum which is an offshoot of the Ethnographical Museum Catch the number  bus departing from the terminal next to the HEV station and ask for the Skanzen There are also regular buses from the Tourinform ofce on the road from the bus station to the centreThe hectare acre museum site will eventually contain ten villages of real houses churches mills farm buildings workshops and smithys dating mostly from the late th to the early th century and culled from all over Hungary At present there are only three settlements to view but even these will occupy you for at least half a day and possibly longer It is a fascinating and picturesque simulation of old rural Hungary brought to life by active craftspeople gingerbread makers and other rural folk Try to come on the rst or third Sunday of the month when there are several different craft demonstrations An excellent guide book giving the general history of the villages and buildings and details about individual interiors is available for purchase Dont miss climbing up the hill to visit the Greek Catholic Church from Mndok in northeast Hungary originally built in  and boasting a painted iconostasis The village is closed from November to AprilVisegrdFarther up the river where the Danube bends lies Visegrd You can get here by boat or the bus from Szentendre This is one of the most picturesque sections of the river where verdant hillsides roll down almost to the waters edge The nest place to enjoy the viewsreminiscent of the best of the Rhineare at the Citadel high on a hill above the ruins of the old palace of Visegrd which means high castle in SlavicThe strategic value of a site commanding the river bend has been recognized since the fourth century when the Romans built a fort here In the th century the Angevin kings of Hungary built a palace on the site each monarch adding new rooms and more opulence until the establishment covered an area now estimated at some  hectares  acres By the end of the th century when King Mtys see page  was resident the palace like his grand Buda residence was famous all over Europe One rather unwilling and notorious resident was the monstrous Vlad the Impaler on whom the Dracula legend was partly based held prisoner here from  to Like King Mtyss Royal Palace in Buda the palace of Visegrd fell into ruins in the Turkish occupation and was completely forgotten Excavations began in  part of the main building has been unearthed and certain parts have been rebuilt using obviously new materials to differentiate these sections from the original ones Among the best of the discoveries are the superb Hercules Fountain a rare vestige of Hungarian Renaissance architecture the vaulted galleries of the Court of Honour and the restored Lions Fountain On the hillside the hexagonal tower known as the Tower of Solomon is now a museum of the palace Topping it all is the Citadel which was once considered so impregnable that the Hungarian crown jewels were kept hereEsztergomThe third of the Danube Bend towns Esztergom situated a farther  km  miles upriver is linked by hydrofoil to Budapest and by boat or bus to Szentendre and Visegrd Take the boat if you have two hours to spare as the rivers most scenic stretch lies between Visegrd and Esztergom King Stephen was born in Esztergom during his time the medieval capital of Hungary It is still the religious centre of the country boasting the largest church in the land The towering basilica stands on the site of an thcentury church where Stephen was crowned as the rst king of Hungary in the year  This church was destroyed in the struggle with the Turks and for all its massive dimensions or perhaps because of its size the only part of the current structure that generates an ancient atmosphere is the rather spooky cryptThe most valuable part of the basilica is the redmarble side chapel called the Bakczkpolnaa pure example of Italian Renaissance style Built in the th century the chapel taken from the ruins around it and reassembled in the th century is all that survives of the original basilica Note the white marble altar which was sculpted by a Florentine masterDont miss climbing the stairs of the Basilica for two more highlights The treasury contains what purports to be Hungarys richest store of religious objects including a crystal cross from the ninth century and the thcentury Calvary of King Mtys From priceless treasures ascend the tower for a priceless view As well as looking down over the town you can also see across into Slovakia The Danube forms a natural boundary the bridge that up until World War I linked the two countries was symbolically left in ruins Its a melancholy sight that recalls Hungarys claim on that part of the land north of the river lost in the punitive  Treaty of Trianon Those interested can cross over by ferry at this point Note that the treasury as well as the tower are closed from November to AprilAlongside the basilica the remains of a medieval royal palace have been excavated and restored and today house the Castle Museum Among the highlights in the museum are St Stephens Hall the frescoed Hall of Virtues listed as Prudence Temperance Fortitude and Justice and the thcentury Royal ChapelThe most popular collection in Esztergom lies at the foot of the Basilica Hill at the riverside The Christian Museum Keresztny Mzeum with the most important provincial collection in Hungary is the best religious art museum in the country Covering mostly the Gothic and Renaissance periods from the th to the th centuries it has some very good th and thcentury Italian paintings Look out as well for the thcentury Cofn of Garamszentbenedek an intricately carved and painted devotional vehicle previously paraded in the streets at

freezes over completely while in summer the shallow water is subject to winddriven waves and when a storm blows up even the ferries call it a dayHowever for most of the summer the hot sun warms the tranquil lake almost up to air temperature luring swimmers in the thousands into the water Whats more the mildly alkaline water is said to be positively healthy for bathinga claim that few seaside resorts can make in these days of polluted shores The Balaton authorities also ensure that the lake is kept clean and calm by banning motor boats with exceptions that require special permitsIf the sh

lake enhancing the area with fruit trees rippling expanses of wheat and in the area of Badacsony some of the best vineyards in HungaryThe north and south shores of the lake have their own distinct personalities The north shore shelves quicker and in many places is less suited to bathing than the southern shore The north is backed by hills greenery and quaint villages the south is atter and has extensive tourist facilities perfect for the more hedonistic holidaymakerThe North ShoreDriving from Budapest and navigating the lake in an counterclockwise direction along the perimeter Highway  the

November to February It is not all cures coffee and culture here Balatonfred is also one of the lakes liveliest resorts bustling by day and nightOne of the most attractive spots on Lake Balaton is the village of Tihany The place gives its name to a peninsula which almost cuts the lake in two and ends at the ferry point of Tihanyirv where there is a Club Medstyle camp and hotel offering a gamut of entertainment The peninsula is unspoiled and protected by its National Park status It even has its own small lake popular with birdwatchers and nature lovers To the south are the domes of former

Tihany Historical Museum closed November to February This museum features regional folk items and art three small rooms where Hungarys last king Kroly IV lived for ve days in  and in the basement an atmospheric lapidarium containing Roman remains In front of the church King Andrs is commemorated in a typically offbeat Imre Varga statue wrapped in an aluminium cloakSome of the quaint thatched white houses that run along Pisky stny have been converted into an Ethnography Museum similar to the one at Szentendre see page  but on a much smaller scale In the Fishermens House for example you can see canoes and shing equipment used on the lake until the s museum closed November to AprilA promenade overlooking the lake passes restaurants as well as craft and souvenir shops before it ends at Echo Hill where the views are ne even if the reverberations you hear arent what they used to be A marked path continues to the vrnot an old castle as the name suggests but a volcanic outcrop dotted with cells made by monksThe name of the region of Badacsony is as inextricably linked with Hungarys wine industry as that of Burgundy or Beaujolais in France Apart from the opportunity to sample the local tipple its the scenery that appeals to visitors here the regions volcanic past is evident at rst sight of the conical green hills The central basalt peak Mount Badacsony the biggest of all the extinct volcanoes at  metres  feet is invariably described as cofnshaped The basalt organpipes of Szentgyrgyhegy are an especially ne sight If you are feeling fit and energetic you can hike up these hills but the easy way is by car or by a jeep that shuttles passengers to and from the bottom of the hill to the wine museum and three small museum houses as well as scenic points of interest A little way farther west set off the main road is the small settlement of Szigliget The moody remains of a thcentury castle offer ne views of the village and lakeThe last town on the north shore Keszthely pronounced kesthey was once owned entirely by the wealthy Festetics family and their palace is one of Hungarys most important Baroque monuments open all year round Here among a selection of its  rooms you can see something of the aristocratic life the family enjoyed during the th and th centuries The highlight is the Helikon library claimed to be the greatest in the country and it alone is worth

historical collection The Balaton Museum portrays the story of the settlement of the lake and the development of its people including their agriculture and shing and its fauna and flora in a lively exhibitionThe South ShoreJust off the southwest corner of the lake lies KisBalaton Little Balaton a marshy National Reserve noted for its rare birdlife Observation towers are provided for watchers
