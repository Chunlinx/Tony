was in the kings tentwherefore the king most worthily hath caused everysoldier to cut his prisoners throat O tis agallant king            This then prompts an extended comparison on thepart of Fluellen of Henry V and Alexander the Great Thus Fluellenscondemnation was for the French slaughter of the boys in the Englishbaggage traina slaughter conducted apparently by French soldiers who fledthe battle This is what Fluellen and Gower think provoked King Henrys commandto kill Englands French prisoners and both soldiers fully approve of thatcommand            John Keegans excellent book The Face ofBattle also looks at the issue and concludes that his command was wellwithin the norms of warfare for the period Henry V is in fact Shakespearesarchetype of the perfect HeroKing precisely because of his Machiavellianqualities which certainly are presentHenry understands as he explainsduring his tour of the army before Agincourt that the moral demands upon aKing are very different from those upon ordinary men                           To reply clickhere                                        Subject ReCultureboxs Rusty Shakespeare                           From JudithShulevitz

largerargument            First things first I stand corrected Fluellen isin fact referring to the French slaughter of the English servants But I submitthat theres a good reason for my having misread the text on the flyFluellens remark follows immediately Henrys order to his men to kill theirprisoners which would have scared anybody in Shakespeare audience who knowsanything about war The side whose captured soldiers have been murderedinvariably retaliates by killing the men it has captured and the men orderedto slit their prisoners throats understood that I think Shakespearemeans for us to confuse the two for a moment until Gower replies andwe know where we are            Fluellen does not then go on to compare Henry toAlexander the Great exactly Fluellen in the great tradition of theShakespearean Fool uses the comparison to make Henry out to be an assFluellen first compares Henry to Alexander the Pig  is corrected byGower defends his malapropism then goes on to say that the reason Alexanderand Henry are alike is they both kill their friends Henry of course killedFalstaff metaphorically by cutting him to the quick Obviously we are meantto laugh at Fluellens nonsense but still When a Shakespearean fool mocks aking intentionally or not we have to sit up and take notice            As for Keegan and The Face of Battle Guatam Makunda inadvertently makes my point for me Keegan would not have hadto weigh in if there wasnt a raging debate about the rightness or wrongness ofHenrys actions            Is Henry the archetype of the Hero Machiavellianor otherwise I would argue that Shakespeare did not create archetypes Hecreated characters Indeed he may have created Character itself What makes aShakespearean character is his roundedness his moral complexity his goodsides and his evil sides all mixed in As Harold Bloom puts it Shakespearemore or less invented our modern notions of psychology Is Henry all good Hellno Is he all bad No not really but hes out there and Shakespeare knew itMy point was simply that hes not an exemplary role model and its ridiculousfor business executives to think that Shakespeare had handed them a road map tothe unproblematic

          Chatterbox like David Shaw in his interminablepiece in the Los Angeles                Times  never makes it clear why therevenuesharing arrangement between Staples and the newspaper was such anegregious violation of journalistic ethics Dumb maybe as Chatterbox pointsout but where is the attack on integrity The ad side of all newspapers isconstantly trying to get the ed side to say nice things about thoseadvertising In this case though the advertisers in the special issue ofthe LAT magazine were companies other than Staples And theTimes writers were never pressured to do puff pieces            Yes the Times  almost unwittingly was aninstrument for Staples to engage in a kickback schemeie Staples leaned oncontractors and vendors to pony up for ads for which they got some return Butthis breach is more an offense by Staples The LAT was on the hook forsupport already But again the writers were free to write what they wanted sowhy is the staff there so exercised which they became only after theWSJ and NYT started knocking their conduct            One more point Chatterbox says the LATparticipated in a bad business deal Perhaps But he should take into accountthat the LAT also has a corporate commitment to downtown LA and thatthrough its continuing expansion the paper as well as the town would benefitEnlightened selfinterest and all that                           To

          Your discussion of the copyright status of Itsa Wonderful Life is correct enough but I think youre wrong to regard thecurrent Republic Pictures copyright rooted in its underlying copyright of themusical score as a settled legal concept Its true no one has challengeditbut would you want to be the station manager at the UPN station in Provowho took on NBCs exclusive rights in court In fact the seemingly farfetchedact you suggest would liberate the movie Removing the music track is not sofarfetched at all the  movie Love Affair has been released onvideo with its score replaced for exactly that reason Surely Its aWonderful Life would be even more worth the trouble if any videodistributor thought they could do it without immediately facing a battalion ofhighpriced lawyers            This same legal gambit has been used for years inthe world of classic film distribution When the balance of power among publicand private parties was fairly even the private copyright never stood up forvery long A famously shady and litigious film distributor once tried to gaincontrol of among other things DW Griffiths Birth of a Nationlong since public domain by buying up the rights to the
