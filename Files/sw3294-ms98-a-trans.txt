            well lets see as far as im   so so what gets you   well the thing i think that annoys me the most is i have i have young children a baby in the house and and inevitably as soon as theyre asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something and i think that that is probably the most   umhum   aggravating um it you know it invades my time im the one that pays for the phone um   umhum   if i wanna buy something ill take the initiative and and go find it you know and it that just really does aggravate me um what do you think   well i mean i  thats exactly the kind of thing i would have said although in my case its my wife and i both work we come home and just as were preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings and its one solicitation call after another and       you know   your time is is valuable and   yeah its its  like you say very annoying and um why why do we let this happen   oh i thats thats interesting i uh uh the market seems to just be growing too i i guess enough people are not speaking out im not speaking out thats for sure i just get aggravated about it and   would would you  mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate   i really dont know im im not into  um heavy government legislating legislating of a lot of different areas but i i dont know i just i do particularly find it annoying um i really not sure i havent given that a lot of thought if if it should should go you know to be   yeah it it seems it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we dont wanna receive calls like that   well that yeah that might   and the people making these calls would be obliged to compare compare   identify themselves yeah   the their lists that theyre gonna call against this list of people who dont wanna be called   right that would be a an an interesting ways yeah   um and that that way those who want it can have it and those who dont want it dont have to have it   right   sort of like an unlisted number where you havent gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself except even unlisted numbers arent safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers   right just oh is that right oh well thats interesting   um automatically and   and they just get everybody huh oh boy   bright   well i i do wish that it would stop on my end because it it seems to happen at the worst possible moments   yeah   and i i guess the the next one is is doortodoor solicitors i dont mind the children when theyre selling things for school i have kids and you know thats just kind of  part of it but when   umhum yeah   its adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten oclock in the morning  um that really it just makes you not feel particularly safe and its annoying as well   umhum yes and these and these people may in fact be just looking to steal find an unoccupied house to rob   right you just you really dont know so i i find myself being a little a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than  than i might normally be but i i do feel like its a an invasion of my space and uh   umhum yeah what about these telephone callers sometimes  theyre doortodoor but usually theyre telephone callers who who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire   ive never quite understood the purpose of that yeah i uh     well i think these people are hired by from from different sources   just to keep   um  with you know and so therefore theres no one answer but but yeah sometimes its a market survey basically its a market survey but they never say who who theyre really working for or what  you know what what what questions are you know   just a survey yeah thereve been a couple of times when the it the uh whatever the subject was i guess caught my interest and i went along with it and then there have been several times when i just said well i just really dont have the time   yeah   you know to deal with it at that moment   yeah   but um i dont get too many of those ive had just a few   yeah   um generally someones trying to sell me something or   yeah right well  and sometimes thats this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too   right right   other times its you know wasting your time to collect the data they want for their     right with   marketing purpose for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider but but a dollar isnt it you know its  uh   yeah thats right oh well   and i also sort of worry that you know that sometimes people give away personal information um when when the call comes and and they uh uh you know  sort of seductive to you know somebodys asking me my opinion on all of these things and so i start answering and then you you know you go down a path um     right   and you dont know where its gonna end uh   yeah   in fact you dont even know what youve eventually you know the totality of what youve revealed and you know   well we thats true   this isnt you know probably most likely not to going to be used against you but it could and   yeah you just never know i guess   and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed   that yeah i i   because its subject to abuse and it   asking for information is is i cant really see that i think they ought to if if if if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp and you know  when it arrives at your house oh i
