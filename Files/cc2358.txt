                    Introduction        Infections with resistant organisms represent a serious        menace in critically ill patients As options for effective        chemotherapy diminish intensive care unit ICU mortality        will increase Mortality rates as high as  have been        reported for serious infections ventilatorassociated        pneumonia VAP bloodstream infections with inappropriate        initial treatment          In a recent study            inadequate antimicrobial treatment of infection was an        important and independent determinant of mortality in        critically ill patients In that series patients receiving        inadequate treatment had an inhospital mortality rate of         as compared with  in those patients who were        adequately treated        The increasing prevalence of multiresistant        Gramnegative strains in ICUs has recently rekindled        interest in colistin         a bactericidal        antibiotic that was used in the s for treatment of        infections caused by Gramnegative bacilli A high        incidence of adverse effects nephrotoxicity        neurotoxicity along with the development of newer        effective drugs with better safety profiles resulted in        the practical abandonment of systemic use of colistin        although it still remains active         in vitro against practically all        strains of         Pseudomonas aeruginosa and         Acinetobacter spp The presence of        multiresistant         P aeruginosa and         Acinetobacter baumannii strains in        our ICU prompted us to try treatment with colistin as a        last resort in patients with serious infections with such        strains Here we report  years of experience with        intravenous colistin in the treatment of Gramnegative        sepsis                    Patients and method        We studied critically ill patients with sepsis caused by        Gramnegative bacilli resistant to all antibiotics with the        exception of colistin The patients were treated in a        sixbed ICU in a trauma hospital        Diagnosis of infection was based on clinical data and        the isolation of bacteria either from a normally sterile        site or from quantitative cultures of tracheal aspirate or        bronchoalveolar lavage More specifically the clinical        prerequisites for the diagnosis of VAP were as follows        presence of at least two of fever C        leukocytosis or leukopenia and purulent bronchial        secretions and a new and persistent infiltrate on chest        radiography On isolation of strains of         P aeruginosa and         A baumannii that were resistant to        all antibiotics apart from colistin intravenous colistin        sulfomethate sodium Colistin Norma Athens Greece was        initiated at the discretion of the attending physician The        dosage of colistin administered intravenously was  MU        three times daily adjusted for creatinine clearance                   Susceptibility testing was done using an automated broth        microdilution test Vitek bioMrieux Durham NC USA        The breakpoints for susceptibility were those recommended        by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory        Standards Susceptibility to colistin was tested using the        disk diffusion method with a  g colistin disk Oxoid        Ltd Basingstoke Hants UK Isolated bacilli were        considered susceptible if the inhibition zone was  mm or        greater                    Results        In all  patients were treated with colistin In         cases colistin was part of the initial empiric regimen        based on previous surveillance cultures with subsequent        cultures confirming the sensitivity pattern For the        remaining patients colistin was introduced when culture        results became available in those who had not responded to        the initial empiric regimen Four of the  patients died        within  hours of the initiation of colistin these        patients were not included in the analysis because they        were not considered true therapeutic failures Data on the        remaining  patients are presented in Table  The mean        age of the patients was  years and the mean Acute        Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II score        was  In five patients multiple organ failure was        present at the initiation of colistin A total of         courses of colistin were given for the following        infections VAP  cases empyema thoracis one case        posttraumatic meningitis one case sinusitis one case        urinary tract infection one case catheterrelated sepsis        three cases and sepsis of unknown primary origin four        cases The offending pathogen was         P aeruginosa in  cases and         A baumannii in six In six cases a        copathogen was isolated Median duration of treatment with        colistin was  days range  days In all cases a        second antibiotic ceftazidime in         piperacillintazobactam in six and a carbapenem in four        cases was added to the therapeutic regimen despite        documented resistance        Clinical response judged as abatement of fever for at        least  hours with parallel improvement in vital signs        was observed for  of the  treatments In two patients        with septic shock one hypothermic and the other with        lowgrade fever it was possible to stop vasopressors in        the following  hours and this was also considered proof        of response Thus clinical response was seen for  out of         treatments with colistin  Survival at  days was                In the subgroup of patients with bacteremia         patients an initial clinical response to colistin was        observed in seven patients and the ICU mortality was         Additional blood culture data after initiation of colistin        were available in two of the clinical responders and        bacterial eradication was confirmed in both In the        subgroup of patients with VAP  out of  patients         had an initial clinical response to colistin        bacterial eradication was observed in eight  and        ICU mortality was         Three patients had already developed acute renal failure        at the initiation of treatment with colistin and were being        treated with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration        CVVHD None of them survived The other patients had a        serum creatinine below  mgdl with one exception a        patient with serum creatinine  mgdl and all had        adequate diuresis Only patients   and   had        an increase in serum creatinine of greater than  mgdl        during treatment with no serious consequences in patients         and  Only patient  developed anuria and serious        impairment in renal function requiring CVVHD Table         No patient developed clinically apparent neuromuscular        transmission blockade                    Discussion        Colistin is a cationic polypeptide antibiotic of the        polymyxin family that is rapidly bactericidal to        Gramnegative bacteria The action of colistin is by a        detergentlike mechanism interfering with the structure        and function of the outer cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria        and resulting in bacterial death      It is        administered as colistin sulfomethate sodium and its        hydrolysis releases the active drug It is removed by        glomerular filtration            Colistin remains active         in vitro against almost all strains        of         P aeruginosa          Klebsiella pneumoniae          Acinetobacter spp and         Enterobacter spp On the other hand         Proteus spp         Providencia spp         Serratia spp         Burkholderia cepacia  and some        strains of         Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are        usually resistant to colistin                      Crossresistance with other antibiotics has not been        reported      and acquired resistance is rare             Although lower susceptibility rates for         P aeruginosa have been reported in        patients with cystic fibrosis undergoing chronic        prophylactic treatment with inhaled colistin             of strains of         P aeruginosa from such patients are        still susceptible to colistin            With regard to clinical efficacy data are limited In        the s the drug administered mostly via the        intramuscular route was found to be of use in the        treatment of infections with Gramnegative bacteria        resistant to other antibiotics Response was better in        patients with bloodstream infections resulting from urinary        tract infection Colistin was less effective in patients        with osteomyelitis biliary tract disease endocarditis        and suppurative infections of the lung probably because of        suboptimal concentrations locally and it was ineffective        in the treatment of Gramnegative infections in neutropenic        patients              In recent years intravenous colistin has occasionally        been used in acute exacerbations of multiresistant         P aeruginosa in patients with cystic        fibrosis       With regard to adult patients        without cystic fibrosis treated with colistin an        observational study    reported a clinical response rate        of  In that study the drug was used in  patients with        serious infections with         A baumannii  and         P aeruginosa  resistant to all        other antibiotics Of the patients studied  were        critically ill and the mean APACHE II score was         Response was suboptimal  in patients with pneumonia        Recently GarnachoMontero and coworkers    reported        the only controlled study of colistin in patients without        cystic fibrosis Patients with VAP caused by         A baumannii were treated with        imipenem  patients or in the case of resistance to all        other antibiotics with colistin  patients APACHE II        scores at presentation and Sequential Organ Failure        Assessment scores at the time of diagnosis of VAP were        similar between the groups Achieving clinical cure in         of cases intravenous colistin was as effective as        imipenem No significant difference was observed between        the two groups in terms of crude mortality VAP attributed        mortality microbiologic cure or duration of ICU stay        Limitations of that study are the small number of patients        included open design and lack of randomization        Clinical response in the present study was somewhat        better than in the study conducted by Levin and coworkers            despite a higher mean APACHE II score The observed        day mortality rate of  in the present study is        certainly high but not unexpectedly so for the severity of        illness Because mortality rates in the region of         have been reported in critically ill patients receiving        inappropriate treatment           the use of        colistin may indeed have been of clinical benefit in our        patients        Both the study by Levin and coworkers    and a study        of an experimental pneumonia model with         Acinetobacter sp in immunocompetent        mice    suggest that despite good         in vitro activity the clinical        efficacy of colistin may be suboptimal in Gramnegative        pneumonia On the other hand GarnachoMontero and        coworkers    reported that colistin was not inferior to        the standard treatment for VAP caused by         A baumannii  with a clinical cure        rate of  Results were rather better in our patients        with VAP in whom a clinical response was seen in  and        bacterial eradication in  Perhaps the high doses of        colistin used in our study were in part responsible for        this        The dosage of colistin used in our study was more than        double that usually recommended       although much        higher doses  with a parallel increase in nephrotoxicity         have been reported in the past     We opted for the        higher dose because of the severity of the infections being        treated A recent study that reported that colistin        methanosulfate is less rapidly bactericidal than is        colistin in         P aeruginosa    offers        retrospective justification for the higher dosage used in        our ICU It appears that peak concentrations of colistin        methanosulfate  times the minimum inhibitory        concentration or greater are required for complete         in vitro killing of         P aeruginosa within  hours                   In the present study all patients received a lactam in        addition to colistin despite documented resistance In        some cases the second drug was added to act against        isolated copathogens but in most patients this addition        indicated the attending physicians lack of confidence in        monotherapy with colistin Although combinations of        colistin with lactams are reported to be of unproven        benefit      a recent study conducted in an         in vitro pharmacodynamic model           reported synergy with ceftazidime for         P aeruginosa sensitive to colistin        but resistant to other antibiotics including ceftazidime        Synergy with colistin has been reported for        trimethoprimsulfamathoxazole cotrimoxazole    and        rifampicin     but no patient in our study received        these antibiotics        A possible drawback of the present study is the use of        the disk diffusion method for testing         in vitro susceptibility to colistin        According to a recent study     this approach        sometimes yields falsely susceptible results However        because errors are observed mainly for         S maltophilia and much less often        for         Acinetobacter spp it appears        unlikely that the use of a different method of        susceptibility testing would materially influence our        findings        Toxicity particularly nephrotoxicity is an important        concern with colistin In the study conducted by KochWeser        and coworkers     impairment in renal function         usually reversible with termination of treatment  was        observed in  of  patients Levin and coworkers           also reported a high incidence of nephrotoxicity         especially in patients who already had compromised renal        function     Because most of the patients in both        studies were seriously ill it is highly probable that at        least part of the reported toxicity was the result not of        the drug but of the disease On the other hand experience        with the drug in patients with cystic fibrosis has shown        only minimal nephrotoxicity               GarnachoMontero and coworkers     in patients with        VAP observed that there was no significant difference in        development of renal failure between colistin and imipenem        In our study despite a dosage of colistin that was much        higher than that usually reported nephrotoxicity was        moderate  and it is unlikely that this had a        clinically significant impact in most cases although the        drug might have contributed to the poor outcome of patients        under CVVHD        Neurotoxicity and neuromuscular blockade were also        reported with colistin in the s      but more        recent studies did not report clinically evident            or neurophysiologic    abnormalities No clinical        neurotoxicity was observed in the present study                    Conclusion        Although our findings with colistin can be considered        encouraging in comparison with previous experience the        small number of patients the concomitant use of lactams        and the absence of a control group in the study do not        allow for a clear verdict on the clinical effectiveness of        colistin On the other hand the moderate incidence of        complications suggests that colistin may be a relatively        safe choice in patients with normal renal function at        least when administered in an ICU with proper monitoring of        variables that affect renal function Pending a randomized        controlled trial the use of intravenous colistin should be        considered in severe infections with Gramnegative bacilli        when it remains the only antibiotic to which the causative        pathogen is sensitive         in vitro                     Competing interests        None declared                    Key messages         Intravenous colistin is not associated with        prohibitive complications in critically ill patients even        when it is administered at doses higher than are usually        reported         Pending a definitive randomized controlled trial the        use of intravenous colistin should be considered in severe        infections with Gramnegative bacilli when it remains the        only antibiotic to which the causative pathogen is        sensitive         in vitro                     Abbreviations
