                    Background        Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is        diagnosed in over  Americans each year resulting in        over  annual deaths     Carcinomas of the head        and neck are often associated with multiple areas of        dysplasia or carcinoma         in situ CIS in noncontiguous        mucosa as well as with the development of second primary        cancers of the aerodigestive tract The concept of field        cancerization hypothesizes that regions of the mucosal        epithelium although normal in appearance are        preconditioned by chronic exposure to carcinogenic        agents thus priming them for the subsequent development of        invasive lesions            The use of modern molecular biological techniques has        supported and greatly expanded our understanding of the        cancer field effect Analysis of Xchromosome        inactivation in female patients with multiple head and neck        cancers shows that distinct tumors arise from regional        clonal growths of phenotypically normal mutated        preneoplastic cells       a phenomenon similar to        that also observed in liver cancer patients with cirrhosis            Longterm smoking and alcohol abuse are strongly        associated with these clonal growths in the upper        aerodigestive tract reviewed in            Frequent allelic loss at chromosomal locations q p        q p q p q p q q q and q is observed        in head and neck cancer         Molecular studies        of hyperplastic dysplastic CIS and invasive head and        neck lesions indicate that loss of heterozygosity at        chromosomal locations p p and p are early events in        head and neck carcinogenesis      Specific tumor        suppressor genes such as         FHIT p         p p         p p and         RB q have also been shown to        be mutated in head and neck cancer      Nevertheless        the large number of additional chromosomal regions with        high frequencies of allelic loss in head and neck cancer        strongly suggests that many suppressor genes still remain        to be identified        The         mannose phosphateinsulinlike growth        factor  receptor MPIGFR maps to chromosome        location q     a chromosomal region predicted to        contain a head and neck tumor suppressor gene             It encodes for a receptor that functions in intracellular        lysosomal enzyme trafficking transforming growth factor        beta activation and IGF degradation reviewed in             Granzyme B internalization by the MPIGFR is also        required for cytotoxic T cells to induce apoptosis in cells        targeted for death resulting in this receptor being        referred to as a death receptor     Elevated IGF        levels during murine development arising from MPIGFR        deficiency result in cardiac abnormalities cleft palate        fetal overgrowth and perinatal lethality             Furthermore large offspring syndrome frequently observed        in cloned animals is associated with epigenetic changes in        gene regulation and decreased         MPIGFR expression     Thus        the         MPIGFR plays a crucial role in        regulating mammalian fetal growth and development        The         MPIGFR is also mechanistically        involved in the genesis of human cancer                         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity        coupled with intragenic lossoffunction mutations in the        remaining allele is a common event in human cancers               Inheritance of a tandem repeat polymorphism in        the  UTR of         MPIGFR furthermore predicts for        enhanced susceptibility to oral cancer     Moreover        tumor cell growth is inhibited when         MPIGFR expression is restored to        normal while it is increased when gene expression is        reduced        The results of these mutational        and functional studies clearly demonstrate that the         MPIGFR possesses the        characteristics necessary to be classified as a tumor        suppressor gene            We tested in this investigation the hypothesis that         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity in        locally advanced nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinomas        of the head and neck is associated with poorer patient        prognosis The patients used in this study were enrolled in        a randomized trial of twice daily radiotherapy with or        without concurrent chemotherapy     We report herein        that         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity        occurs frequently in head and neck cancer and that it        predicts for poor therapeutic outcome                    Methods                  Patient Population and Treatment          Patients with locally advanced but nonmetastatic          squamous carcinoma of the head and neck who participated          in or who met eligibility criteria but declined          enrollment in a phase  trial of hyperfractionated          irradiation with or without concurrent chemotherapy          constituted the study population Details of their          treatment and outcome have been published previously              Briefly patients receiving radiation therapy alone          were given a continuous course of  cGy twice daily to          a total dose of  Gy Patients assigned to combined          modality treatment received  Gy via a splitcourse of           cGy twice daily They also received two cycles of          cisplatin and fluorouracil during the first and sixth          weeks of irradiation All protocols were approved by the          Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review          Board                          Tissue Microdissection and MPIGFRLoss of          Heterozygosity Analysis          Microdissection of malignant and surrounding normal          nonmucosal tissue was performed as previously described                tumor histology was confirmed by a          pathologist RT Volmer Paraffinembedded sections           m in thickness were microdissected following          deparaffinization and the tissue was then digested by          proteinase K in trisEDTA buffer at C for  hr Six          different genespecific polymorphisms were used to assess          head and neck tumors for           MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity                        A tetranucleotide ACAA insertiondeletion          polymorphism in the UTR of the           MPIGFR    was detected with           rounds of nested polymerase chain reaction PCR The          forward and reverse first round PCR primers were          KKACAAF GGAGAGTTTGCCTGTTCTATGCC and KKACAAR          CAAATCAATCTTTGGGC AGG respectively The forward          and reverse second round PCR primers were KKACAAF          AGTCAGGAATGGCTGCACCand KKACAAR CAAATCAATC          TTTGGGCAGG respectively the KKACAAF primer was          endradiolabeled with PdATP prior to PCR Each round          of PCR consisted of  cycles at C for  seconds          C for  seconds and C for  seconds Platinum          Taq DNA polymerase GibcoBRL Baltimore MD was used          for DNA amplification The PCR product  l containing          the UTR ACAA insertiondeletion polymorphism was          mixed with  l of formamidebased stop buffer heated to          C for  min placed on ice electrophoresed on a           acrylamide gel and then exposed to film          Five identified single nucleotide polymorphisms c          CG exon  c AG exon  c AG          exon  c AG exon  and c AG          exon  were also analyzed following  rounds of          nested PCR the exon specific forward and reverse primers          have been previously described      The exons          containing these polymorphisms were PCR amplified from          genomic DNA using PCR conditions identical to those          described above The single nucleotide polymorphisms used          to determine           MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity          were assessed by direct sequencing of PCR products          according to the manufacturers protocol Thermo          Sequenase USB Corporation Cleveland OH Figure            MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity          frequency is independent of the polymorphism used for its          estimation p                      Taq DNA polymerase can introduce          sequence errors during PCR amplification and unequal          amplification of the two alleles can result in false          positive detection of loss of heterozygosity Thus both          the normal and tumor DNA templates were amplified in          three independent PCR reactions and assessed for tumor           MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity          Due to the potential of contaminating the tumor tissue          sample with normal stroma allele loss in informative          patients was defined as a  decrease in the ratio          of the polymorphic band intensities in the tumor tissue          versus that in the surrounding normal stromal tissue          this was quantified using a densitometer                          Statistical Analysis          Relapsefree survival represented the primary clinical          endpoint Locoregional control was evaluated as a          secondary endpoint since the vast majority of head and          neck cancers recur either locally at the primary site or          regionally in the neck cause specific survival was also          assessed All curves were computed using the KaplanMeier          method starting from the time of study entry Curves for          different subgroups were compared by the CoxMantel test          A chisquared test was used to compare the clinical          characteristics between           MPIGFR informative and excluded          patients and informative patients with and without           MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity A          pvalue   was considered to be statistically          significant                            Results                  MPIGFRLoss of Heterozygosity Analysis          The study population consisted of  patients          enrolled in a phase III randomized clinical trial          comparing radiation alone versus radiation plus          concurrent chemotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer             plus an additional  patients who met all the          entrance criteria but declined enrollment A total of           tumors could not used in this investigation because          either the tissue slides were unavailable or the DNA          could not be PCR amplified Of the remaining  patients            were informative ie polymorphic and the          tumors in   of these patients had           MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity          Figure  The           MPIGFR informative patients and          those not used in this study were insignificantly          different from each other for the clinical          characteristics of gender age race smoking history

       concurrent chemotherapy     outcome was also          analyzed according to whether or not patients received          chemotherapy Figures    Patients in the          radiotherapy RT loss of

results in          poor patient outcome when RT alone is employed since all          other measured clinical characteristics of the head and          neck cancer patients were comparable to those in patients          with a nonmutated           MPIGFR tumor suppressor gene          Table           Patients in the RT LOH group also fared worse than          those in the combined modality CM LOH

any significant benefit over radiation alone for patients          with a nonmutated tumor           MPIGFR p   Thus          patients with a nonmutated           MPIGFR who received RT alone had          the same longterm outcome as the overall population of          patients who received RT and concurrent chemotherapy              This implies that           MPIGFR allelic loss may help to          identify a group of head and neck cancer patients who can          be adequately treated with RT alone without exposure to          the added morbidity of combined modality therapy          The development of second primaries was independent of          the           MPIGFR mutation status in the          primary tumor p   Three of the   patients          with           MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity          and two of the   patients without loss of          heterozygosity at this locus developed second          primaries                            Discussion                MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity        occurs frequently in human breast liver and lung cancer               and the remaining allele of  to  of        these tumors contains an intragenic lossoffunction point        mutation in the ligand binding domains     The         MPIGFR is also commonly mutated in        gastrointestinal and endometrial malignancies because its        coding sequence contains a polyG region that is a        mutational target in tumors with mismatch repair        deficiencies and microsatellite instability             Functional studies show that the introduction of an        exogenous wildtype         MPIGFR into human colorectal        cancer cells with a single inactivated allele significantly        decreases growth rate and enhances apoptosis            Conversely loss of         MPIGFR expression promotes cancer        cell growth by increasing intracellular signaling from both        the insulinlike growth factor I receptor and the insulin        receptors            We demonstrate herein that loss of heterozygosity at the                MPIGFR locus in head and neck        cancer is also associated with poor patient prognosis Loss        of heterozygosity in cancer can occur either because of        chromosomal deletion or somatic recombination resulting in        uniparental disomy     Comparative genomic        hybridization studies in head and neck cancer            demonstrate that q deletion frequency   is        similar to that which we observed at the         MPIGFR locus This provides        evidence that         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity in        head and neck cancer is due primarily to either gene        deletion or chromosomal loss rather than somatic        recombination        Since chromosomal deletion can affect more than one        gene         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity        alone does not rule out the possibility that other adjacent        genes also have a tumor suppressor function in head and        neck cancer However our previous finding that both        alleles of the         MPIGFR are mutated in greater than         of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung            supports our postulate that the         MPIGFR is a key head and neck        cancer tumor suppressor gene at chromosome location q        The clinical trial from which the tumor specimens used        in this study were derived showed improvements in        relapsefree survival locoregional control and overall        survival for those patients randomized to combined modality        therapy     This investigation established that        patients whose tumors had         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity and        were treated with radiotherapy alone had a significantly        worse prognosis than their counterparts with a nonmutated        allele Conversely patients with an intact         MPIGFR had a similar prognosis        whether they received radiotherapy alone or combined        modality treatment Thus our findings suggest that head        and neck cancer patients with tumor         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity        would benefit most from combined modality treatment        The mechanism by which         MPIGFR allelic loss in head and        neck tumors increases the effectiveness of adjuvant        chemotherapy is presently unknown but it is clearly of        clinical importance A primary function of this receptor in        placental mammals involves the degradation of extracellular        IGF         MPIGFR allelic loss would        therefore result in enhanced cellular bioavailability of        this potent growth factor thereby potentially increasing        both cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis            The MPIGFR also facilitates the activation of TGF a        potent cell growth inhibitor that is secreted in an        inactive form reviewed in              MPIGFR mutation is therefore one        mechanism by which cancer cells can become refractory to        TGFs mitoinhibitory effect        We have previously shown that         MPIGFR mutation in squamous cell        carcinoma of the lung is highly correlated with increased        TGF concentrations in both the tumor and patient plasma            Elevated TGF in the latter stages of tumor        progression directly contributes to enhanced tumor        angiogenesis metastasis formation and a decreased host        immune response reviewed in     Together these        findings predict that tumors with a mutated         MPIGFR would be more resistant to        therapy than those with an intact receptor Moreover if        some chemotherapeutic agents are not only directly        cytotoxic to cancer cells but also reduce tumor production        of growth factors such as IGF and TGF adjuvant        chemotherapy would be more useful in treating tumors with a        mutated         MPIGFR  as observed in this        study                MPIGFR is normally imprinted in        mice with only the maternal copy of the gene being        expressed     In contrast both copies of the         MPIGFR are expressed in humans        because genomic imprinting at this locus was lost in the        primate lineage approximately  million years ago            Importantly restoration of biallelic         MPIGFR expression in mice results        in a marked reduction in offspring weight late in embryonic        development that persists into adulthood     This        demonstrates that         MPIGFR allelic loss or haploid        insufficiency markedly enhances cell proliferation andor        survival during fetal development Therefore mutation of        even a single allele of the         MPIGFR in human somatic cells is        predicted to also promote cell growth        Haploid insufficiency for tumor suppressor genes such        as         Nf          p         Kip          p          Ptch          Pten and         TGF  is known to promote tumor        formation reviewed in      Yamada         et al    demonstrated that in        patients chronically infected with hepatitis B andor        hepatitis C viruses the         MPIGFR is mutated not only in        hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs but also in the        phenotypically normal hepatocytes adjacent to these tumors        Interestingly only one         MPIGFR allele is inactivated in        the adjacent cirrhotic tissue even when both alleles are        mutated in the HCC These findings are consistent with        normal appearing preneoplastic hepatocytes forming clonal        masses in the liver because         MPIGFR haploid insufficiency        affords them with a selective growth andor survival        advantage relative to normal hepatocytes            The liver is not the only organ in which regions of        normal appearing tissue have a clonal origin Entire        lobules and large ducts of normal breast tissue can be        derived from a single progenitor cell     and LOH at        various chromosomal locations is frequently detectable in        morphologically normal lobules adjacent to breast tumors            Lung tumors and head and neck tumors that develop in        a localized region also often have a common clonal origin              The high frequency of         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity        observed in the head and neck tumors in this study suggests        that the phenomenon of field cancerization first        described by Slaughter and his colleagues    in         may in part result from the clonal proliferation of mucosal        epithelial cells with         MPIGFR allelic loss                    Conclusions        The observations in this study raise the intriguing        possibility that selection of head and neck cancer patients        for concurrent chemotherapy can be based upon the        intratumoral mutational status of         MPIGFR  Furthermore since         MPIGFR loss of heterozygosity in        squamous cell carcinomas is highly correlated with an        elevated plasma TGF level     patient prognosis may        potentially be assessed by a simple blood test This would        be desirable since the morbidity of combined modality        therapy is greater than that of radiotherapy alone                                Competing interests        None declared                    Authors
