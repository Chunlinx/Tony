                                 What Boys and Girls Are Made Of            Going to work for Mike Leighis not just a job its a histrionic quest You can picture his actors clearingtheir calendars for the next six months ritually cleansing themselves andkissing their spouses and children goodbye Renowned for his means as much ashis ends the director sends his performers out into the world to unearth dataabout their characters then leads them through weeks of improvisation andscenebuilding Actors God love them adore this Theyre not the mostsystematic or penetrating thinkers but they come back with nuggets of goldThey also tend to truck in loads of dung in the form of earnest psychobabble Isuppose when you compel actors to draw on their own resources you have to takethe banal with the startling And there is something to startle you in Leighscrooked bittersweet little comedy Career Girls  Its called KatrinCartlidge and every director should have oneand build an altar to it            Youpossibly saw Cartlidge in supporting roles in Naked and Breaking theWaves  You havent seen her in full gale force As Hannah who grows fromspiky prole to uneasy denizen of the middle class shes the sort of womanwhos underrepresented in movies smart and aggressive and desperately unhappyabout the random injustices of her upbringing Tall and sharpfeatured shes afount of caustic oneliners and her stabbing wit makes her look more angularyet Hannah drives people away with her querulous expressions her verbalparries her cockofthewalk mannerisms The miracle of the performance isthat the quips seem doubleedged at once a glorious shield and a grim barrierto contact with other human beings She cant tamp her anger or her need to beever in control shes too superbly defended            Leigh mindful of symmetry has paired her with AnnieLynda Steadman a woman with no apparent defenses at all A quivering pile offlesh attired in smart career girl fashions Annie travels to London by trainto visit Hannah her former college roommate whom she has not seen in years Ireport all this matteroffactly but in the film it takes a while to determinejust what their relationship is or was The two are guarded with each otherinexpert in their banter halting in their rhythms Then Leigh launches thefirst of many flashbacks to their college dayson bluish film stock with ashaky cameraand the glimpse of the past fills in the empty spaces in thepresent It also adds another layer of confusion The performances are soextreme and the milieu so scuzzy you might think theyre not in college but arehab clinic for junkies It takes a while to get oriented in Leighs movieswhich for all their socialrealist trappings frequently explode intocaricature and hightheatrical artifice Thats not a bad thing by the wayCareer Girls  unlike the increasingly dreary Secrets  Lies ups the fun quotient and leaves the moral sortingout to the audience            Steadmanit must be said overdoes the jiggleheaded twitch in college she looks likea Star Trek android whose circuits keep misfiring But she is awfullycute As Leigh skips back and forth between past and present he spotlights thecontrast between the wellcoiffed woman and strungout teenager graduallythe two incarnations merge Annie and Hannah come to seem like little girlsdressed up their old emotions there but determinedly buried And as the womenbecome more comfortable with each other opening themselves up to theirmemories and feelings the meter of the film shifts from jerky toexpansive            Leigh must provide a narrative so a third ofthe way into the picture Hannah announces that she has made a series ofappointments with realestate agents to see deluxe apartments the girls canpretend to be swells and see how the haute bourgeoisie live In a yuppiehighrise a swinger Andy Serkis puts the moves on them and is sohilariously shameless that he transcends the clich Simultaneously in thepast we meet the girls roommate Ricky Mark Benton who is very very fatand is also a mass of tics and twitches Uh em uhm eh he begins in aneffort to tell Annie that he loves her ahI ffffffffancy you Uh emuhm eh ahI llllloov you Neither attempt at seduction is especiallyappealing and neither man takes rejection well A third suitor Adrian JoeTucker does better with both girls In flashback he has his way with oneWhen I fook someone they stay fooked and sends the other into a decadelongswoon in the present he appears as a slick enigmatic realestate agent whorefuses to acknowledge his previous persona Adrian is smarmily insulated fromhis past Ricky whom Annie and Hannah stumble on in the films climacticscene has let his past eat him alive            Because of how organicallyLeigh works his films can seem both shapeless and too pat In some ways theydont gel in others they harden into cement The heroines of CareerGirls crack jokes about the people turning up from their past as if on cueWhat are the chances of that The chances of that are good indeed if youre acharacter in a movie so dont play postmodern games Over Chinese food thewomen lay out their points of view too neatly psychoanalyzing the life out ofthe scene And the pictures final encounter with a grotesquely addled Rickyfeels exploitative Ricky might represent how Hannah and Annie could haveturned out if theyd let go if they hadnt overcome their bitterness orhelplessness to scale the socioeconomic ladder But he seems emblematic oflittle besides spasticity and mental retardation            Thatsaid Career Girls is hard not to treasure I wasnt crying at the endthe way some in the audience were but I wasnt eager for the credits to rollLeigh gives his actors the space they need to establish a characters rhythmsand the results are like a richer kind of oxygen I suspect he works the way hedoesand his films are such a mishmashbecause his world view is happilycompromised A Marxist he cant suppress his sympathy for those who look formeaning in the material world in backyard barbecues and cars and fax machinesClass might be central but it isnt destiny And yuppies are too ripe forsatire to be branded as evil The only thing thats certain is that when actorsare given their heads they have a whale of a time and the audience does tooThe rest is openended            Which is the opposite in every way of In the Company ofMen  a dazzling repellent exercise in which the case against men is closedbefore its opened A handsome junior executive Chad Aaron Eckhart proposesto a nerdy superior Howard Matt Malloy that as a means of exacting revengeon all the females whove ever hurt them they both pursue and then dump thesame womanfor the fun of it So theres no chance youll think that the filmis genuinely misogynist the writerdirector Neil LaBute makes the object oftheir scheme not a trashy bitch but a shy good hauntingly lovely womanChristine played by Stacy Edwards who also happens to be deaf The boysmight as well be torturing a puppy            The filmwhich has been widely acclaimed is immaculately of a piece even if that pieceis Carnal Knowledge by way of David Mamet Chad speaks in rattattatclichs and has no trouble smoothtalking the girl into bed Meanwhile hedoes what he can to stir up paranoia in his buddy As in Career Girls scenes are reduced to a single shot a single tableau but LaButescompositions are rigid and airless they call attention to their own wit andto the fact that the characters destinies are fixed As it turns out Inthe Company of Men is only tangentially about womanhating its actuallyabout male corporate culture in which the players find it endlessly excitingto screw one another But that wont stop some women from fearing that this atbottom is what all guys are like            Look ladies One of these men is a sociopathand the other a spineless dweeb Most men dont have the sophistication tohurt women for sport They do it because theyre selfish creeps And the angelat the center of the movie is hardly representative either KatrinCartlidges Hannah could make quick work of both these losers Of coursethere is a certain kind of male who might enjoy In the Company of Men Someone who likes to watch people victimized while feeling morally superior tothe victimizers Friends of mine especially women found sitting through thefilm akin to being smeared with excrement It worries me that before I thoughttoo hard about it I was having a pretty good time                           The perfect woman seconds                                        Hannahs cardinaltrait
