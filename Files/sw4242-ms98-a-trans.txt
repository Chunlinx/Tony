        okay Michelle well since i started off i uh since i called in i guess ill state my opinion first     okay   and uh i i guess id fall in the same category that i dont think there should be any restrictions i think that if unless a weapon is selfpropelled or has to be towed Americans should be able to own it     okay um i really dont know exactly where i stand just to be honest i have mixed feelings about it and ive thought about both positions i would like to have the freedom to own a firearm um i am currently married and that makes me feel more secure but if i were single i would definitely want to have a firearm   uhhuh umhum   uh of course i think it should be locked up you know so that children can not   absolutely   get their hands on it   i agree i think parents should be held responsible if their child gets a hold of one or either injures injures another person or or themselves   umhum definitely definitely   i also am in favor of a check i i think the criminal record system in the country should be brought up to snuff so that they can run a computer check as easy as they do when you run a credit card through so they can see if a person insane or is a felon   yeah right now ive heard a lot of people say that that wouldnt do any good but i really think that it makes a lot of sense   i dont it wouldnt do any good right now because the criminal record systems are a mess you know i mean there really isnt any any system as such but if there were and if the government were to invest in that then there wouldnt be any problem theyd   uhhuh   theyd be able to identify those that shouldnt have   what do you mean the criminal records are a mess   well there isnt any computerized system that can tell you you know   by the push of a button   yeah i mean in Virginia has done it by the way reason i im a life member of the Gun Owners and i am sure no longer member of the NRA so i im kind of into this but Virginia Virginia does have an instance check uh system   uhhuh uhhuh   they do have their records within a state computerized and it seems to be working well       and if it could be done on a federal basis   hm are they the only state   the only state that im aware of   gosh   thats done that   so what has to take place them to to make this happen to other states   well uh   that makes a lot of sense   yeah it really you know its it should be done on a national basis because on the statewide basis you just get those that have violated state laws but   youre right right   yeah and some there are federal you know violators too   uhhuh uhhuh   so it would require an investment on the part of the government to to bring their records up to shape but i think its uh probably a good investment anyway uh   umhum so youre from New Hampshire   yes umhum   im not even i hate to admit uh that familiar with what the laws are here in Texas regarding purchasing a firearm um   uhhuh uhhuh   i guess you heard about the the massacre in  thats only about an hour in fact thats where all my cousins live i used to go down there every summer   oh yes umhum   so that was a real shocker   you know uh in that case uh in particular that fellow that did that had owned those guns a long time   yeah thats true   so i mean its not like he went in and picked them up and uh then went off on a shooting spree   umhum umhum umhum yeah so it um it couldnt have been avoided by you know any type of law being   and   uh set   thats right   but   unfortunately whenever something like happens that happens uh people tend to blame the gun and not the person it is its it is the person   yeah this is true   yeah oh i tend to agree with you in in that i believe that that that like youre saying the majority i believe would be responsible with with the weapon and Lord knows with the crime rate the way it is   umhum   we need to have something to protect ourselves   yeah i feel that you should be you know you uh if you were single should be allowed to have a weapon to  yourself     uhhuh uhhuh   but if it   yeah i know how to use it   umhum but if there were a total ban you know whod have the guns   oh yeah oh sure   it wouldnt be it wouldnt be the people whod go to buy them honestly   uhhuh       yeah it would be the people that you know could get in touch with the underground or something and i mean they have ways   right thats right and gun control laws dont stem them because uh they dont they dont most of the criminals dont go buy their guns uh from a gun store anyway   yeah   they get them through the through the black market   yeah yeah youre right thats what i was thinking well   well its uh its certainly a a lengthy subject and theres a lot of   it is its very complex   theres a lot of uh discussion about it and what and now and then it becomes a heated argument in both sides but   umhum umhum umhum   but i ive i just feel that the founders of our country the constitution people that wrote the constitution didnt intend for us to not have a means to protect ourselves either either from without the country or from within the country   yeah yeah do you do a lot of hunting   no i dont i used to i i used to now im just a target shooter yeah i used to go uh   with your guns are you so do you
