                                 Slanted            The New York Timesruns a lot of headlines about scandals but rarely does it run a headline thatis a scandal On Saturday Dec  it came pretty close The headlineover its lead Page One story read DEMOCRATS HOPED TO RAISE  MILLION FROMASIANS IN US On the inside page where the story continued the headline wasDEMOCRATS GOAL MILLIONS FROM ASIANS Both headlines were wrong The storywas actually about a  Democratic National Committee document outlining aplan to raise as the lead paragraph put it  million fromAsianAmericans            Memo tothe New York Times  AsianAmericans are American citizens of Asianancestry Asians in contrast are Asianscitizens of some Asian nation AndAsians in US are citizens of some Asian nation who are visiting or residingin the United States This is not  It gets at the heart of the subtleprobably subconscious racial prejudice that has turned a legitimatelymediumsized scandal into a journalistic blockbuster            Would a Times headline call PolishAmericans EastEuropeans in US Or in the jump headline just East Europeans And theheadline was only half the problem with Saturdays story The story itself waswrongheaded implying that theres something inherently scandalous aboutAsianAmericans giving money to a political campaign In fact the inaccurateheadline was necessary to prevent the story from seeming absurd Can youimagine the Times runningover its lead storythe headlineDEMOCRATS HOPED TO RAISE MILLIONS FROM US JEWS            Political parties targetethnic groups for fundraising all the time as Jacob Weisberg recently showedin these pages They target Hispanics they target Jews they pass the hat atPolishAmerican dinners To be sure the AsianAmerican fundraising plan wasin retrospect no ordinary plan It went quite awry Some of the projected millionat least  million according to the Times wound up comingin the form of improper or illegal donations which of course we already knewabout Foreign citizens or companies funneled money through domestic front menor front companies And sometimes foreigners thus got to rub elbows withPresident Clinton For all we know they influenced policy            But thetruly scandalous stuff was old news by Dec  What that days story added wasnews of the existence of this document outlining a plan to raise money fromAmericans of Asian descent And that alone was considered worthy of thehighscandal treatment            Leave aside this particular story and considerthe campaigngate scandal as a whole What if the same thing had happenedwith Europeans and Americans of European descent It would be just as improperandor illegal But would we really be so worked up about it Would WilliamSafire write a column about it every  minutes and use the loaded wordaliens to describe European noncitizens If Indonesian magnate James Riadylooked like John Major would Newsweek have put a huge ominous grainyblackandwhite photo of him on its cover Clintons European connectionwouldnt pack quite the same punch as Clintons Asian connectionthe phrasethat Newsweek put on its cover and Safire has used  times in weeks Would the Times be billing minor investigative twists as leadstories            Indeedwould its reporters even write stories like that Saturdays The leadparagraph which is supposed to crystallize the storys news value is this AWhite House official and a leading fundraiser for the Democratic NationalCommittee helped devise a strategy to raise an unprecedented  million fromAsianAmericans partly by offering rewards to the largest donors includingspecial access to the White House the committees records show You meanDemocrats actually offered White House visits to Americans who cough up bigcampaign dough Im shocked Wait until the Republicans discover this tacticThe Friday after Christmas is a slow news day but its not that slowAnd as for the unprecedented scale of the fundraising goal Virtually everydimension of Clintons  fundraising was on an unprecedented scale asweve long known            There are some interesting nuggets in the Timesstory But among them isnt the fact repeated in the third paragraph thatfundraisers told AsianAmerican donors that political contributions were thepath to power And among them isnt the fact repeated again in the fourthparagraph that the quid pro quo promised to AsianAmerican donors was inmany cases a facetoface meeting with the President And anyway none ofthese nuggets is interesting enough to make this the days main story The onlyway to do that is to first file AsianAmericans in the alien section of yourbrain Thats why the storys headline is so telling            The funnything about this scandal is that its root cause and its mitigating circumstanceare one and the same Its root cause is economic globalizationthe fact thatmore and more foreign companies have an interest in US policy Butglobalization is also the reason that the scandals premisethe illegality ofcontributions from foreign interestsis increasingly meaningless Both theTimes and the Washington Post in its blockbusterlitefrontpage story the next day cited alreadyreported evidence that a donation since returned may have originated ultimately with the CP GroupThe CP Group is a huge Thai conglomerate with interests in China andelsewhere in Asia the Times  and is among the largest foreigninvestors in China the Post  But of course Nike Boeing GeneralMotors Microsoft IBM and so on are also huge companies with interests inChina and elsewhere in Asia They no less than Asian companies at times havean interest in low US tariffs treating oppressive Asian dictators with kidgloves and so on Yet it is perfectly legal for them to lubricate suchlobbying with big campaign donations            Why no journalistic outrage about that Well for starters try looking at a grainy newsweeklysized photo of LouGerstner and see if it makes you remember Pearl Harbor By the way neitherthe Times nor the Post noted that the ominous CP Group isinvolved in joint ventures with Ford and Nynex            You might think that in anage of globalization and with the United States fate increasingly tied to thefate of other nations the United States best newspaper would be careful notto run articles that needlessly feed xenophobia Guess again Six weeks ago aTimes oped piece by political scientist Lucian Pye explored theformidable mindset that governs China today Current Chinese leaders havedistinctive characteristics that give them significant advantages over theUnited States in foreign policy They see politics as exclusively combativecontests involving haggling maneuvering bargaining and manipulating Thewinner is the master of the cleverest ploys and strategems  sic Moreover Chinese leaders are quick to find fault in others and try alwaysto appear bold and fearless Finally in a holdover from classical Chinesepolitical theory Chinas leaders insist on claiming the moral high groundbecause top leaders are supposed to be morally superior men In short Chinasdistinctive edge lies in combative Machiavellian mudslinging blusteryselfrighteous politicians Gosh why didnt we think of that            These peculiar traits Pyenoted aggravate another disturbing feature of modern China It seems that theChinese people vacillate between craving foreign goods and giving vent toantiforeign passions In other respects too they evince a pricklyxenophobic nationalism Imagine that
