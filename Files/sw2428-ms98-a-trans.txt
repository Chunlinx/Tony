          so do you have a computer at home   i sure do i have an Amiga its an O one thousand model but its still compatible to the uh late model Amiga personal computers the three thousand and the two thousand even the five hundreds out now and i love it   do you i got my i got my first one ive been at TI forever and i found an engineer selling his really old TI PC   how about you you got one   oh a forty four   uh i think so no not ninety nine its one of the full TI PCs   ninety nine i mean or something i got you right   and hes an engineer so he even came over and set it up for me and had it running for like two hundred dollars so i thought that   my goodness gracious well you sure made a savings there i have never heard anything to beat that thats just terrific does does is it IBM compatible type   well now it does no no no no its just the old PC and it has two floppies it doesnt have a Winchester it doesnt have anything but for what i need just keeping records it does just fine   oh i see uhhuh well if you ever decide to get a newer later model think about an Amiga because its the slickest machine youve ever seen   oh really   its got four thousand ninety six color graphics its got realtime animation capability theres a world of games for it if youre into that but it can do word processing you can import pictures into your documents and uh it just does everything a PC can do but it does it better   ill be darn when i uh im in uh Plano right now but when i was up at uh McKinney i had uh IBM PS two i loved that thing i loved it   uhhuh uhhuh you did well i i venture to say your you and your kids if you have any would enjoy the Amiga better   well i have kids fortunately that have left grown gone thank heaven   oh really  well youre not supposed to admit that   to them i admit it  it was fun leave   okay well my wife and i are gonna be glad to get ours out of the house too i know exactly how you feel   the emptiness syndrome is a myth theres no such thing i mean   oh really ill tell her  were sure not staying with the PC subject subject too well are we  well how how how much memory you got have you got on your machine   its nice it really is yeah were talking though uh on my you know i dont really know i knew when i bought it but i dont know right now ive got a little program uh genealogy program called Family Ties   oh yeah uhhuh   and i can research and go to the library and and discover who married who what year and all this sort of thing and come back and load it all into my computer and then when i want to   uhhuh   say this is going to be a present for my grandchildren tell them all okay here you are and then i can sort it all that they can trace it back to their parents and the grandparents and on you know do an explosion   uhhuh uhhuh   and it all prints out up to five generations per child and you know you can select the child and get the whole thing i think its just as neat as it can   uhhuh well thats neat yeah id like to have a piece of software like that for my machine now on my machine ive got a microphone hooked up to it and i can digitize me and the wife and kids all talking and all that but i can hook a VCR up to it and take our picture   oh how fantastic how fantastic   and then then then if my parents had the same kind of computer which they dont they dont have a computer but if they did then they i could send them all that on a floppy disk and it would play out for them right there on the computer and they could click it to see each next scene   oh   but thats all possible to do on the Amiga and frankly my VCR camera cost more than my computer did   get out of here for heavens sake ive never heard of one   but you can do all those sorts of things on the Amiga   i didnt know anything about this thats fantastic   yeah theres a lot of people dont know about it its put out by Commodore they made the sixty four but this is a machine that they bought from a company that got started up in California   im familiar with Commodore   yeah well they make the Amiga and uh not only that but the Amiga is Unix compatible so if anybody around there is using Unix and they want a cheap Unixs work station that cost under about four to five hundred dollars then the Amiga runs Unix and uh besides uh being able to do all the other things i was telling you about   well ill be darn   its a fantastic machine if youve got to have IBM compatibility theyve got a card you can plug in and you can run IBM software but the machine is so powerful i dont need it   what what do you have at work   uh i use a Sun work station at work but im im in the process of purchasing Amiga to use it as my desktop computer but research work though i use a Sun Sparc station   so youre into computers oh we have some Suns in this building uh im a buyer and and i help them with their maintenance contracts and repair and things like that just its its not much of my job but it you know i do come in contact with them   are you uhhuh   those are expensive machines   i know well see uh the the Sparc stations run about twelve thousand dollars in color and an Amiga runs only forty seven hundred in color   good grief   so it makes a real nice cheap Unix compatible desktop work station and see ive got one at home and everything i run at work i can run at home by you know same sort of stuff and uh uh it really makes it quite nice it definitely does i have four and a half megabytes on my machine here at the house and uh sixty five megabyte Seagate hard disk and it rips   why do you think TI has not used the Omega because uhhuh   the Amiga well because its made by Commodore and uh most people all they know about is IBM compatible because most people in this country that know anything about computers dont know much but they do know about IBM   um   so when the PC came on the market and then it being first one on the market earlier than the Amiga was but when it came market people just naturally assumed that well if IBM makes it should be the computer of my choice and they intend to look around very much so as a result Macintoshes and uh Amigas didnt get a fair break   oh i see   where but honestly an Amiga is far and away a much better PC than the PC will ever be it has a full multitasking operating system during the Christmas holidays while my kids played games with my machines i backed up my hard disk because i used my Commodore sixty four as a terminal to it like a main frame   uhhuh   so i was copying files off my hard disk to floppies and they were playing a game using the uh joy sticks and they never even knew i was there except i was sitting there and i was pushing another floppy into this little slot uh while they were doing their thing to keep copying files out   yeah   you cant do it on any machine a Mac or anything made   well thats wonderful id never even heard of it   yeah its kind of neat not to mention the fact that its got four thousand ninety six colors and you cant get more than two fifty six out of a PC or a Mac either one   so your kids were having a good time and you were working   yeah thats right i can do that exactly  you sure can you can network them together and everything its a fantastic machine needless to say so im very uh high on it but you said you have computers Suns at work right what other machines do you all have at work   thats marvelous just marvelous well i work in I A Smith so were forever looking at something else uh i you know i work   uhhuh i see well tell them to look at the Amiga a lot of people think its a toy and a game machine but it is a most powerful work station all the way around multitasking and i mean a realtime multitasking operating system and computer made   well you know youd be surprised how many of the various ones are coming in and giving us demos at all times and i sit in on all this stuff   uhhuh not only that but this machine can be hooked up to a regular TV set and you can do video presentations with it it has all kinds of software you can use that Commodore makes called Amiga Vision so that you can take pictures in and then you can make up your own video presentation Hewlett Packard uses it Hewlett Packards makes PCs and they use the Amiga to do video presentations and um uh campaigns educational type uh presentations for the engineers incidentally incidentally Bausch and Lomb uses it too   let me ask you something uh if you were if you needed to go to another   sure   town somewhere you know fly to a to see a supplier and do a review there could you put your presentation on a television and just kind of send him the disk instead of going yourself   uhhuh well what you would do in the case of the Amiga is youd use NTSC output that you can get on the machine put it right out to a uh video video tape and just cut you a video tape by uh by running it   uhhuh   to the video tape because all the sound and graphics that it produces can be put right out of the back of the machine to a common VCR and recorded on a VHS tape   so you could just say okay fellows weve got a problem get everyone in the room and let them see this tape rather than buying an airline ticket   yeah if you wanted to you could uh but you could do the whole presentation and slick it up and edit it and make all kinds of changes and modification till you had it down pat on the Amiga once you had done that i mean including hooking up a camera to take pictures of things like maybe you want to do a a a a presentation on how to run some piece of gear well you want to take pictures of it you might want to take pictures of it running   uhhuh   because you can put more than one frame into the machine and then you can describe whats going on you can record microphoning machine then theres a way to link all that together and once you got it satisfied satisfactory done you can then take it and play it back out of the machine right out the NTSC port in the back to a VCR and record it after that you can put it all on floppy disk it might take several and between on how big a space youre talking about and uh carry it to another facility if they happen to own an Amiga well you slap it on there put it on their hard disk and away you go   how much will how much would this cost   for what to do it well the parts or the machines depending on what well you can get a two thousand which is uh a bare essential machine to do this with for about twenty three hundred dollars   yeah for that whole operation   and uh then you would uh with some add on options and things youd have to have probably the outside price at the max would be about thirty five thirty six hundred dollars if unless you want to use a video tape to to do all kind of weird things like wipes and and fades and things like that which the uh TV people use   we dont need that type we dont need that type of graphics thats just not necessary   okay well if you dont need that which is really fancy and that has twenty four bit or sixteen million colors if you dont need that thats another fifteen hundred dollars and thats made by a commercial company just for the Amiga IBM and Mac both tried to get them to make it for their machines but they cant because the Amigas the only PC on the market that has special graphics and sound and peripheral handling chips inside and thats why it can be a multitask operating system and not and handle numerous multiple jobs at once because it has three coprocessor chips in there that help out the main CPU and off load from doing the graphics see the CPU in my machine is a little old sixty eight thousand and it loafs because theres three coprocessors chips in my machine to handle the graphics the the color graphics one coprocessor chips handles all the sounds and it can make it has four channels of sound two of them come right out the back as stereo ports i have mine hooked up to my stereo down stairs has excellent stereo dynamic range and it has a third chip in it that has all your peripherals so that if i were to copy a file from my hard disk to the floppy then the CPU just goes out and tells Paula thats the chip that does peripheral handling copy this file from the hard disk to the floppy and the CPU goes off and does something else because
