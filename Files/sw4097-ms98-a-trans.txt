            uh no this elderly care of the elderly i am looking at this right now with my father and it is a tough decision to make   umhum   that uh   does he he live at home now and   yes hes and hes living at home  more or less alone my sister spends an awful low of time with with him which is a burden on her   umhum yeah   and his health is so bad that we dont feel right about you know just letting him do what he wants to do and of course he feels like he is capable of taking care of himself and we know better   no i know my uh my mother uh my grandmother is still alive and uh feisty old old lady shes uh shes really pretty good but she really just cant get around any more and she does have significant significant health problems   uhhuh   uhhuh   and my mom is looking after after her and it its a big drain on my mom i can tell when i get calls from her she she sounds worn out   yeah   uh and uh its tough on on my grandmother because shes use to just going to the store and getting what she wants and baking up things for her friends but now shes no longer where she grew up her friends have all passed on or in another city she cant just run right out and get things so a lot of these thing   uhhuh   fall on my mom go to the store get me this i want to go do that uh ive changed my mind phone calls in the middle of the night because shes lonesome yeah     oh yeah Yeah   yeah and uh you know i i can see from a distance im not right there on top of it maybe i am a little more objective but i would think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of all she could be happy   well thats that will be a problem because i have looked  and they all really amount to the same thing uh   yeah yeah   i have looked for all both ends of the scale really from your kind of State run things to the very private elite type and really it boil down to i think to one thing youre putting somebody in there and more or less waiting for them to die   um   and its uh its sad but thats the way weve been brought up to look at it and i hate it but there comes a time when when this is what what happens especially with the way medicine is today Its keeping us alive longer and   yeah   and were living longer so therefore you know   you almost like to have some place thats almost hospice care but a little bit more independent than that almost almost like a community that has partly something like condominiums   right yeah its kind of our   where those people that are mobile can still retain their their independence but maybe have somebody come by and check on them once or twice a day bring them the groceries or come by and chat or whatever and then a hospice for those who no longer quite so mobile   right uhhuh   the problem with everything else in health care is is the cost   the cost is just unreal   uh i mean thats thats almost why some of the you know the the experimental cooperatives you hear about where people sort of throw in all their money together and and do that sort of thing but its its you you start getting commercialization of it and the cost just skyrockets   right well thats   so they want to really make a a method of it i wish that we could find some place for for my grandmother she would be happier   uhhuh   uh and my mother wouldnt have to drop everything and and really shes lost a great deal of control of her life to the point where her own health is deteriorating   right right   and and that the stress is just enormous i i feel for you youre youre one step closer than i am to it and it must be it must be really draining on you   well it is especially since he lives in Mississippi i live in Texas and then my sister lives in Louisiana  This this you know it makes in fact i just got back from having to go stay with him because she needed to get away   oh umhum yeah   and its uh but uh i dont know what other solution there is eventually were going to have to put him in a home some place   oh it it right now though hes independent enough to to take care of day to day or or have   well more or less but he is almost to the point that hes legally blind so that is really what bothers us uh he could start a fire uh just about anything  could happen   oh oh yeah oh yeah yeah i can i can appreciate that and theres  there use to be programs in some of the more progressive communities of of house mates     uhhuh   somebody that comes and lives there and for room and board takes care of people but   right   you need you need a contact service in the community id id even be happy just uh trying to find a a day program that my grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the day meeting some right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the only people she   right
