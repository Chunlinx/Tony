                    Background        The regulation of gene expression is a fundamental        process within every cell that often allows exquisite        control over a genes activity for review see          Altering transcription rates is an effective strategy for        regulating gene activity It is well established that        transcription of a given gene is dependent upon a promoter        sequence located within a few hundred base pairs of the        transcriptional start site Promoter activity is modulated        by sequencespecific transcription factors that physically        interact either with the protein complexes that make up the        core transcriptional machinery or with the promoter        sequence itself        In eukaryotes the activity of a promoter can be        modified by transcription factors binding to DNA sequences        frequently termed         cis regulatory modules or enhancers        that are located from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of        base pairs away from the promoter These regulatory modules        can either increase or decrease the rate of transcription        for a target gene depending on the cellular state and the        activities of the bound transcription factors There are        several mechanisms by which transcription factors bound to        regulatory modules exert their effects First many        transcription factors interact directly with the core        transcriptional machinery by recruiting the latters        protein complexes to the promoter Second transcription        factors may bend or twist the DNA altering the way in        which other transcription factors interact with the DNA        Finally transcription factors can alter local chromatin        structure by modifying histones typically through        methylation acetylation and substitution of histone        subunits to permit or restrict access to the DNA        Modifications of chromosome structure also occur at much        larger scales Most eukaryotes exhibit distinct chromosomal        regions that are usually either transcriptionally active        euchromatin or inactive heterochromatin In animals        heterochromatin is typically found near centromeres and        other regions of low sequence complexity        Less clear are the mechanisms by which the regulation        provided by a         cis regulatory module is restricted        to specific target genes Several examples of insulators         sequences that prevent neighboring modules from affecting        transcription  have been identified reviewed in          Insulators seem to function not by deactivating         cis regulatory modules but by        preventing their influence from being propagated along the        chromosome It is not known how common insulators are in        the         Drosophila or any other genome        Some insulatorbinding proteins localize to a few hundred        chromosomal positions and these positions coincide with        genomic sequences that are not heavily compacted by        chromatin structure the interbands of polytene        chromosomes   There is substantial evidence that        although gene expression can be tightly controlled        neighboring genes or chromatin regions are important for        the expression of individual genes For example otherwise        identical transgenes inserted into different chromosomal        sites show varying levels of expression          Two recent observations lend credence to the idea that        genomes may be divided into domains important for        controlling the expression of groups of adjacent genes        First there is evidence from budding yeast that some genes        are found in pairs or triplets of adjacent genes that        display similar expression patterns   Second about         much larger regions of the human genome show a strong        clustering of highly expressed genes   which is caused        by clustering of genes that are expressed in nearly all        tissues   We have examined the fraction of genes in the                Drosophila genome that are subject to        regulation that reflects large domains using data from        highdensity oligonucleotide microarrays that reflect over         experimental conditions and have found more than  of        the genes clustered into coregulated groups of         genes                    Results                  Many neighboring genes show similar expression          patterns          We collected relative geneexpression profiles          covering  distinct experimental conditions from           Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome Arrays see          Materials and methods section When the genes in this          dataset were organized according to their positions along          the chromosome we observed numerous groups of physically          adjacent genes that shared strikingly similar expression          profiles We sought to measure the magnitude of this          effect by identifying all groups of physically adjacent          genes that showed pairwise correlations between their          expression profiles that were higher than expected by          chance          Visual inspection of the entire dataset using TreeView          software   revealed that groups of adjacent genes with          similar expression patterns appeared frequently in our          real dataset but rarely in a randomized dataset The size          of these groups varied but appeared to average about           genes In order to systematically identify groups of          adjacent similarly expressed genes we calculated the          average pairwise Pearson correlation of gene expression          for genes in a sliding tengene window across the genome          The Pearson correlation is a commonly used metric for          determining the similarity between two gene expression          profiles   and the average pairwise correlation is          the average of the Pearson correlations of all           possible pairs of genes within the tengene set We          estimated the probability of the average correlation          scores by randomly sampling one million times from the          dataset and calculating the average pairwise correlation          for windows of ten genes We also created a random          dataset of the same size by randomly shuffling the          associations from genes to expression profiles and used          this to illustrate the significance of our results Our          analyses show that groups of physically adjacent genes          with similar expression are common nearly  such          groups are significant at a           p value of  Table  In more          conservative analyses requiring an uncorrected           p value of   where we expect          to observe only one group by chance in fact we observed           groups Table           To ensure that tengene windows were appropriate we          repeated the analysis using windows of various sizes As          the window size increases from two to eight genes the          net number of genes in groups that is the genes in          groups in the ordered dataset minus genes in groups from          the random dataset increases linearly At a window size          of about ten genes the net number of genes begins to          plateau Figure  This suggests that most groups          include about ten genes so we used a window size of ten          for the remainder of our analysis There are no          qualitative differences in the nature of groups          identified by larger window sizes          Many of the tengene groups that have high average          pairwise correlations of gene expression represent          physically overlapping stretches of genes that is genes                    n through           n   make up one group and genes           n   through           n   form another For all          further analyses therefore we collapsed all groups that          bordered one another into a single group This          substantially reduced the number of groups showing that          the effect on expression extends well beyond ten genes          Table  Nearly  tengene groups are significant          at           p    but these collapse          into only  groups with an average group size of          greater than  genes As the           p values decrease the average group          size also decreases but even at           p   there are on average           genes in each group  genes in  groups see Table                    The  groups  genes in total that map to the          left arm of chromosome two and have a           p value of less than  are          shown using a ratiogram   aligned to the chromosome          arm in Figure  The distribution of groups along the          chromosomes appears random and there is little bias for          genes in a group to be on the same strand The length of          genomic sequence occupied by similarly expressed gene          groups is highly variable The average group size is          nearly  kilobase pairs kbp in length with a          standard deviation of about  kbp while the smallest          group is  kbp and the largest is over  kbp As might          be expected there is a relationship between the number          of genes in a group and the length of genomic DNA covered          by each group Pearson correlation                           Gene groups are not explained by gene function or          homology          Many genes that are related by function share similar          expression patterns and it is plausible that the same is          true for homologous genes particularly those that arose          from recent duplications In           Drosophila there are  genes          for which there is a homolog within the genome and the          two homologs are separated by less than  genes To          determine whether homologs account for our observations          we repeated our analysis on a dataset from which homologs          that are physically near one another were removed This          dataset is just under  genes and although there is          a significant decrease in the numbers of genes found to          be in groups in this dataset Table   groups          remain containing about  genes          We considered an extreme model to account for our          observations  that evolutionary selection has organized          gene groups according to the biological processes the          genes are involved in so that their expression can be          coordinately regulated We sought to test this model          using the Gene Ontology GO database    as a          source of annotations of biological processes We first          used the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the          probability of observing each GO term as enriched in each          group on the basis of the number of genes in the group          the number of genes in that group that are annotated with          that GO term and the number of genes in the genome that          are annotated with that GO term We then selected all GO          process terms associated with a group at           p   where at least two          genes had the selected GO term Of the  groups          identified in our full dataset and the  groups from          the homologsremoved dataset  and  GO terms          respectively have associations to groups that meet the          above criteria These numbers are modestly higher than          would be expected by placing a random selection of genes          into groups where we would expect    from the full          dataset and    from the homologsremoved dataset The          observed enrichment is clearly dependent on homologs          however given the nearly fourfold decrease in observed          associations when homologs are excluded from the          analysis Thus with the present level of functional          annotation the vast majority of gene groups we observe          are not composed of genes with similar biological          processes and the extreme model is not supported                          Similarly expressed gene groups can be identified          from smaller datasets          Our dataset is derived from RNA samples taken from          embryos or adults primarily males The groups in our          dataset show a pattern of gene expression that mirrors          this bifurcation most genes are expressed at higher          levels in either adults or embryos We wished to          determine whether our observations of groups reflect this          division so we divided our dataset in two creating one          dataset of embryo experiments and one of adult          experiments It should be noted that four of the adult          experiments contained RNA from males and from females          which contain a substantial number of oocytes whereas          the rest of the dataset was only from males We          calculated the average pairwise correlations for all          groups of genes in each of the two new datasets Table          summarizes the number of genes in groups for the embryo          and adult datasets both randomized and ordered The          gene numbers are remarkably similar to those found for          the entire dataset as are the numbers of groups see the          Additional data files          We wished to know if there was a correlation between          the gene groups identified in the adult embryo and          combined datasets To do this we tabulated all genes          identified in each dataset at each of three           p values    and            and calculated the Pearson correlation between each pair          of datasets at each           p value Table  The average          correlation between either the embryo or the adult          dataset and the combined dataset is about  while the          average correlation between the adult and embryo datasets          is lower about  The number of genes involved makes          little difference because the correlations are similar          at each           p value despite the vastly          different numbers of genes identified at different           p values In all  genes are          present in a group defined by one of the three datasets          at           p    After correcting for          genes expected to be found in groups by chance about           genes are identified in one of the three datasets          at a           p value of  and about           genes are identified at                            Correlations with known chromosome          structures          We attempted to determine whether the locations of          similarly expressed gene groups correlate with known          chromosome structures Polytene chromosomes show a          distinct reproducible pattern of extended and compacted          regions The compacted regions contain the vast majority          of the DNA although the amount of DNA in each band can          vary by more than one order of magnitude The mean DNA          content of each band is approximately  kbp    as          compared with approximately  kbp for each group of          coexpressed genes We calculated the number of bands          that overlap or are contained in each group and          compared this with the number of bands that overlap or          are contained in a randomly placed group matched for          size There was very little difference in the average          number of bands overlapping each coexpressed group or          each randomly placed group  versus           It has been proposed that           Drosophila chromosomes are attached          to a nuclear scaffold at precise locations   but          there is very limited mapping data on the position of          these attachments Mirkovitch           et al   mapped four attachment          sites in a  kbp region near the           rosy gene on chromosome R          dividing the region into a number of discrete domains of          average size  kbp each containing many genes We          wished to determine whether the groups we identified          might correspond to distinct regions between attachment          sites as several of our groups fall in the region          studied by Mirkovitch           et al   We attempted to align          these regions but there are no clear overlaps the sizes          and positions of the domains identified between          attachment sites did not correspond to the groups we          found                            Discussion        We have found that over  of the genes in the         Drosophila genome appear to fall into        groups of  genes such that the genes within each group        are expressed similarly across a wide range of experimental        conditions Our data do not reveal the mechanisms        responsible for the observed similarities in expression of        adjacent genes but we believe the findings are most        consistent with regulation at the level of chromatin        structure for the following reasons First the regions        showing similarities in expression are quite large        containing on average  genes with each gene presumably        having its own core promoter Second it is frequently the        case that one or two genes in a group display a high level        of differential expression see Figure c If the        chromatin in a region of the chromosome that contained many        genes was opened so that a single target gene could be        expressed it might increase the accessibility of the        promoters and enhancers of other genes to the        transcriptional machinery leading to modest parallel        increases in their expression Such an effect could account        for the observations we have made        Discussions of transcriptional regulation often        emphasize the belief that the process is tightly controlled        and essentially errorfree We believe that the degree of        precision at least at a quantitative level may be less        than is generally assumed For example only a few genes        show an obvious phenotype when heterozygous and        heterozygosity generally results in a twofold reduction in        expression level   Moreover there are numerous        examples in the literature of genes that when misexpressed        either temporally or spatially do not generate a        phenotype Although it is difficult to prove that        individuals carrying such traits are as fit as their normal        relatives it is likely that the precise regulation of many        genes is allowed to vary considerably If we presume that        the groups we have observed arise because of selection on        the regulation of a small subset of genes in each group        then the vast majority of genes are in effect being        carried along for a ride The regulation of transcription        may be precise when it is needed and sloppy when it is not        important        If coordinated gene expression is unimportant there        should be no selection that drives the groups of        coregulated genes we observed to be evolutionarily        conserved It will be possible to test this when the         D pseudoobscura sequence is        completed If the groups of genes we identify here are        found to be more syntenic in the         D melanogaster and         D pseudoobscura genomes than        expected that would support the idea that the observed        coordinated expression is advantageous        Although we have assayed a relatively large number of        biological samples we cannot infer the profiles of unique        cellular states As further experiments are carried out it        may be that our observation of similarly regulated groups        will grow to include all genes  that is the entire        euchromatic genome may be structured in such domains                    Materials and methods                  Data collection          We collected a dataset composed of  experimental          conditions hybridized to

data including          software used in this study and the underlying expression          dataset is available at our website   and from the          ArrayExpress database   with the accession id          ERUBN                          Data processing          Genes are represented on the GeneChip Drosophila          Genome Array by one or more transcripts which in turn          are represented by a probe set Each probe set has           pairs of perfect match PM and mismatch MM          oligonucleotides Data were collected at the level of the          transcript but for ease in the text the data are          referred to by gene Intensity data for each feature on          the array were calculated from the images generated by          the GeneChip scanner using the GeneChip Microarray          Suite These intensity data were loaded into a MySQL          database where information on each of the features was          also stored The difference between the PM and MM          oligonucleotides probe pair was calculated and the          mean PMMM intensity for each array was set to a constant          value by linearly scaling array values The mean          intensity of individual probe pairs was calculated across          all arrays and the log            ratio of each value to this mean was          stored Next all log ratios for each probe pair set          transcript were averaged creating one measurement for          each transcript on each array The final dataset was          generated by averaging data for each transcript on          replicate arrays and subtracting the average log ratio of          each gene in the dataset                          Definition of homologs          BLAST scores based on predicted protein sequence were          obtained from Gadfly Release    We used these          scores to define a homolog pair as those gene pairs for          which BLAST           E values are less than                            Identification of adjacent similarly regulated          genes          We calculated the average pairwise correlation of          geneexpression profiles for all genes that were within           n genes an           n gene window of one another          using the Pearson correlation Significance            p values was estimated by sampling          random sets of           n genes  million times to          determine the likelihood distribution for the dataset We          also calculated the average pairwise correlation for a          random dataset in which the associations between genes          and expression profiles were shuffled We have calculated          the number of genes in groups at each of the three           p values namely     and            for window sizes ranging from  to  genes          Next we set out to show that homologs did not account          for the increase in the number of gene groups with higher          than expected average correlations We searched for cases          in which homologs as defined above were near each other          in the genome by scanning the set of genes for each          chromosome from one end to another If a gene showed          homology to another gene that appeared less than  genes          ahead it was removed from the dataset although no break          in gene order was created For example in a set of           genes where the third and fourth were homologs gene           would be removed and a tengene group would consist of          genes   and  through  In total  genes were          removed from the dataset This homologs removed dataset          was subjected to the average pairwise algorithm as was          a randomized version of it          We also constructed two nonoverlapping subsets of the          total data matrix All hybridizations were divided into          either the embryo or adult dataset on the basis of          the source of the RNA used in that hybridization In          total  experiments remained in the embryo dataset and           experiments remained in the adult dataset The random          pairwise correlation algorithm was applied independently          to each of these datasets as well as to randomized          versions of each dataset                          Significantly enriched GO terms among gene          groups          GO terms for all genes were obtained from the GO          database   Using the hypergeometric distribution          the probability of observing each GO term with each group          was calculated Briefly the probability           p that a GO term is significantly          enriched among a specified set of genes can be calculated          with the following formula                    where           k is the number of genes in the          group           G is the total number of genes           n is the number of genes in the          group with a given annotation and           A is the total number of genes with          a given annotation Because many sets of GO terms            were tested on many groups of genes            there is a problem of multiple testing All GO terms          significantly associated with a group of similarly          expressed genes at a           p value of less than    were          recorded                          Correlation of groups with known chromosomal          structures          We determined the number of polytene bands present in          each group of similarly expressed genes The coordinates          of each group were determined by using the transcription          start sites from GadFly Release    of the genes at          each end of a group We then determined how many bands          overlapped each group based on the positions reported             We also calculated the number of bands that          overlap randomly placed groups with the same sizes as          the real groups                            Additional data files        The following are provided as supplemental materials a        tabdelimited text fileof the underlying expression data        the perl scriptsused to process the data and a text        fileused to generate Figure  All expression data are        reported as log base  and are mean centered the mean        expression value for each gene in all experiments is zero        The first column of each expression data file is the CT        identifier of each transcript The second column is a        description field which includes the CT identifier CG        identifier gene name and brief Gene Ontology annotations        The remainder of the columns contain expression data        classified by the column header either adult or embryo        The data used to generate Figure can be loaded into the        TreeView software   to visualize individual groups null        data rows indicate boundaries between groups The software        and underlying expression dataset are also available at our        website   and from the ArrayExpress database   with        the accession ID ERUBN        Additional data file         A tabdelimited text file of the underlying expression        data        A tabdelimited text
