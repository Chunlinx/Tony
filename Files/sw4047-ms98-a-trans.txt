        okay i guess were on uh capital punishment uh my my feeling by the way is that i think there is a need for capital punishment i dont think it ought to be applied to every crime obviously but there is a need how do you feel about it   oh i believe there is you know there is a need for it like you said it shouldnt be applied to every every crime you know   uhhuh   uh   uh   i feel like you know they need to instead of giving the people on on uh you know like death row and stuff just leaving them there and sit there and make taxpayer pay for it i think they ought to do something about it   yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh they keep people there ten twelve years uh uh that seems to be the norm   yeah   um i i dont know how effective a deterrent it is when when that happens uh but more and more people are being executed for crimes i think down in Texas uh just today or yesterday didnt you have one an execution down there   yeah we had uh one just yeah couple days ago   yeah well they havent executed anybody in uh in our state of New Hampshire since i think nineteen forty four or somewhere around that time frame its its been a long time   yeah   we do have the death penalty but uh they dont use it very much instead they sentence them to life and uh we end up as you say uh fitting the footing the bill the next forty or fifty years     yeah thats what i think that they need to do something to change that because i dont think the taxpayers should have to pay for that guy to stay in the stay in there for life you know   i think one interesting question would be uh uh you know as far as circumstances uh i think we agree if somebody you know is involved with a premeditated murder or you know a cold blooded first degree murder they deserve the death penalty thats in my opinion i dont know how do you feel about that if they take another human life you know and theyve theyve planned to do this or theyre doing it for pay dont you think that deserves the the death penalty   it sure does   now how about drug dealers where they dont directly take a life you know its not like theyre pulling the the the trigger on a gun or or something like that what do you think about uh major drug dealers getting the death penalty   well that not theyre partly you know theyre a lot responsible for it because theyre the ones selling the drugs to the to the uh dealers out on the street you know and i think they they need to get capital the capital punishment   i think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more effective than for uh the just the common street criminal that kills somebody   yeah   that person probably isnt thinking too much about it but these major drug dealers uh you know they got some brains they wouldnt be in the business if they didnt have and if theyre threatened with the death penalty i think it might make a difference on them   oh yeah i think it would too you know sometimes i think they ought to just  take them out and shoot them and just you know but uh thats my opinion on some of the cases   uhhuh   because i think drugs is a bad deal and stuff   thats right it certainly ruins a lot of lives uh whereas a you know somebody that uh is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly small circle of people i mean the relatives and friends of the person that was killed   yeah   but but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives   oh yeah   and in effect causing some of them to die   umhum and you know its especially i just saw something on TV tonight on the news about LSD in a school over in Dallas so   oh is that right   yep so its effecting its way down there in the high schools and stuff and   uhhuh   i think drug dealers need to be sent to prison for life imprisonment and stuff you know or given the death penalty   yeah and and uhhuh that LSD even gets into the grade schools when they sell these uh stickers they look like uh i guess theyre dots on a piece of paper or something   yeah   and uh you know thats really thats really a crime to give it to the young kids like that       well i guess weve talked about all we can on this topic what do you think   uh yeah   okay well its been nice talking with you hope you have a nice day good evening talk to you later byebye   okay you too all right bye
