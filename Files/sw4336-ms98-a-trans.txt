        uh well im not sure how it is in Georgia but in in Pittsburgh the rate the crime rate really is not very high at the moment is that is that true for for Atlanta     Atlanta is kind of high uh its its lower than it has been in the past uh i guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher   yeah i thats thats probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere   yeah uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into any pacifits   well uh from least what from whats on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences whats more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store or a car theft you know it things of that nature very few uh you you assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh cases of you know like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners   um   but mostly petty things and nothing nothing nothing nothing really too big   right well i guess here we run into that sometime but i guess a lot of crimes are done with uh apartment type breakins you know   right   that type not much home breakins there are some but not not very high uh as far as tellers and things like that its not extremely high either there there were one case where uh this one guy uh was taking women from the teller and and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them also so its kind of like a double assault there   umhum yeah uh a strange case that uh that happened lets about about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine     really   it was a freestanding machine and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it   umhum oh wow   now theres a crime for you   there is a crime   yeah but uh i guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous although uh from what i hear in the news and and i i saw saw an episode of the TV show Cops   uhhuh   uh one time that was in Pittsburgh and uh it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that but i i dont really think those things happen happen too often because like like i said from whats reported in the news at least its its not all that common   oh okay hm i dont know crime situations here they like i say a lot of a lot of cases is usually just apartments and and breakins and things like that and a lot of it is due to drugs   yeah   or drug related you know in in most cases its not like uh if someone do steal a a television or VCR or something like that it is for drugs you know because you really cant on the street make any money off of it per se you know you gonna only get ten or fifteen bucks for it   yeah   so you really not making a sizeable profit so its not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist   you know i i just to diverge a little bit uh i live in an apartment right now im finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh and uh the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in but even so it i mean its its still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out  you know and things like that   right yeah umhum   uh it it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here when theyre not just come in   umhum   you know theres a TV and a VCR and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while theyre upstairs playing music it it could still happen then   umhum yeah thats true but you be surprised also how  much people watch you that even uh uh participating in any type crime i guess there was one case i was surprised uh so happen this person worked at the same place i work for Georgia Tech and they work at the same place i did but i didnt know that they had been watching me because i was getting ready to go in my car one morning and the first thing they said is uh you must dont have to be to work at eight you know like shock
