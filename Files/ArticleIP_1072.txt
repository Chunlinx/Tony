                                 Bounty Hunters            Last month five armedbounty hunters forced their way into a Phoenix home shooting and killing twooccupants In another recent case Kansas City Mo bounty hunters broke intothe wrong home and put three bullets in an innocent man These stories portraybounty hunters as thugs who are beyond the law What is a bounty hunter Whatlegal powers do bounty hunters have Whence do they derive those powers                           Bountyhunters work for bailbondsmen  They are dispatched to capture defendantsin criminal cases who have skipped bail posted by bailbondsmen About percent of all criminal defendants are released on bail  a cash depositthat is forfeited to the court if the defendant fails to appear before thejudge as promised Defendants who cant afford bail often hire the services ofa private bailbond agency to front the cash The bondsmans fee is usually percent of the bail with defendants putting up collateral for theremainder            Last year more than  defendants posted bailand then skipped their court date  Most bailjumpers face charges ondrugrelated crimes violent offenses or theft The most popular bailjumperdestinations are warmweather spots Southern California and south Florida andbig cities Chicago and New York City Most skips stay within the UnitedStatesavoiding passportcontrol agents who are trained to spot them            In moststates a bondsman must return the skip within a year of the missedcourt date to recover his deposit Few bailbondsmen keep bounty hunters on thepayroll for liability reasons choosing instead to pay the bounty hunters thestandard fee of  percent of the bond Bounty hunters who prefer to callthemselves recovery agents are paid only after the skip is returned tocustody and the bailbondsman gets his deposit back from the court In moststates bounty hunters are unregulated  Bailbondsmen on the otherhand are licensed and regulated by all states and in many jurisdictions mustcarry liability and general operating insurance            The powers of bounty hunters areimmense  When arresting a skip bounty hunters need not read them theirMiranda rights  They do not need a warrant to search the residence of askip even a hotel room Nor are they required to announce themselves beforeentering private property as police officers must Evidence obtained illegallyby bounty hunters can be submitted in court Like police officers bountyhunters are authorized to use all reasonable force  to apprehend skipsThis means they can shoot to kill if shot at Also they can transport skipsacross state lines without enduring extradition proceedings Bounty hunterclich Extradition proceedings take place in the trunk of a car                           Bountyhunters derive their powers from the  Supreme Court case                   Taylorvs Taintor                In the eyes of the law a defendant voluntarily placeshimself in the custody of the bailbondsman and by extension the bountyhunter when he signs the bail contract The court decided that bondsmen andbounty hunters are proxies for the state and therefore deserve police powerswhen taking custody of the accused However the usual constitutionalprotections enjoyed by suspects dont apply to skips pursued by bounty huntersbecause the court decided the bounty hunters work for the bondsmen not thegovernment Private debt collectorsrepo menface more legalfetters than bounty hunters They cant use violence or search private propertywithout the owners consent And unlike bounty hunters they can be arrestedfor trespassing on private property            Bounty hunters privileges are a vestige of Britishcommon law  Since the Middle Ages courts have appointed custodians fordefendants awaiting trial Usually the custodian was the defendants friendIn the  th century courts commonly required custodians to servedefendants punishments in their stead when their wards skipped even if thismeant standing in for a hanging                           Bountyhunters are more efficient at returning criminals than police are TheNational Association of Bail Enforcement Agents says that  percent of allbail jumpers are returned to authorities by bounty hunters Law enforcementofficers return  percent of skips but catch most of them at routine trafficstops and at border crossings Only  percent of skips remain at largeCriminal justice experts credit bounty hunters success rates to two thingsThey face less red tape than do police and unlike police bounty hunters havean economic incentive to get their men            Last year US News World Report proclaimed bounty hunting one of the hottest job tracks in itsBest Jobs for the Future issue No persuasive evidence substantiates thisclaim According to the NABEA there are only  to  fulltime bountyhunters in the United States and they earn an average income of about More than  people bounty hunt part time Most of them are formeror offduty cops or private investigators            Few bounty hunter trainingprograms existthe most frequently attended programs are hourcourses that cover only basic legal constraints Several states have billspending that would require bounty hunters to register with police take moreextensive training courses and obey procedural constraints that apply topolice such as announcing themselves before entering a private home            Instances of bountyhunters abusing their power abound In the Phoenix case the bounty huntersclaimed that they were pursuing a skip but accidentally raided the wrongaddress The authorities believe that the bounty hunters used their professionas a cover for armed robbery Increasingly civil courts hold bounty huntersliable for their mistakes  Last year one court awarded  million to aNew York woman who was mistakenly kidnapped and transported to Alabama bybounty hunters
