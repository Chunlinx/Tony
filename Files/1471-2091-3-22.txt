                    Background        The ubiquitinproteasomedependent proteolysis system        has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular        regulatory mechanisms including transcription signal        transduction and cell cycle control reviewed in            The system employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions that        lead to the covalent attachment of a chain of multiple        ubiquitins to substrate proteins     In many cases        modification by ubiquityl moieties targets proteins to the        proteasome ultimately resulting in their degradation The        ubiquitylation reaction involves a minimum of three        enzymes An E which mediates the ATPdependent activation        of ubiquitin and an E or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme        UBC which together with an E ubiquitin ligase        transfers ubiquitin to the target protein E enzymes are        of particular interest as they mediate the substrate        specificity of ubiquitylation reactions        Studies in budding yeast identified SCF Cdcp an E        ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitylation        of the CDK inhibitor Sicp      SCF Cdcpconsists of        at least four proteins the cullin Cdcp the RING domain        protein HrtpRbxpRocp the adapter protein Skpp and        Cdcp reviewed in     Cdcp contains two sequence        motifs which are conserved in a wide variety of socalled        Fbox proteins Cterminal WDrepeats that are involved in        binding the substrate Sicp in a phosphorylationdependent        manner and a central Fbox    that interacts with Skpp             Cdcp in turn binds to Skpp and        HrtpRbxpRocp which bridges Cdcp with the        ubiquitinconjugating enzyme CdcpUbcp                         In vitro reconstitution demonstrated        that SCF Cdcp Cdcp E ubiquitin and ATP are        sufficient to mediate Sicp polyubiquitylation                    Components of the SCF system are widely conserved in        eukaryotes      In human cells for example SCF        Skpmediates destruction of the CDK inhibitor p             while SCF TRCPtargets IB       All of these        SCF complexes share homologues of the core components        CDCCUL SKP and HRTRBXROC which associate with        different Fbox proteins        Several lines of evidence suggest that the SCF pathway        is also conserved in the fission yeast         Schizosaccharomyces pombe  Pcup a        CdcpCULrelated protein was shown to associate with        two different FboxWD repeat proteins Popp and Popp        when overexpressed     In addition genetic studies        demonstrated that both of these Fbox proteins are        simultaneously required for efficient destruction of Rump        and the replication initiator Cdcp       Rump        is a Sicpanalogous CDK inhibitor which accumulates in        G but is degraded as cells enter S phase             Failure to degrade Rump is the major phenotypic defect of         pop and         pop deletion strains which leads to        disturbance of normal cell cycle progression resulting in        polyploidy        Based on the genetic data and        the biochemical observation that Popp and Popp interact        when overexpressed a putative SCF PoppPoppcomplex was        proposed which would contain the heterooligomerizing Fbox        proteins Popp and Popp bound to SCF core components                    Whether this unusual heterooligomeric SCF        PoppPoppcomplex exists         in vivo and whether it mediates Rump        ubiquitylation remained unproven as not all fission yeast        SCF core subunits were identified In addition based on        overexpression distinct SCF Poppand SCF Poppcomplexes        were proposed to target unknown substrates but no        biochemical evidence of their activity was provided            To address these questions we cloned two additional        subunits of SCF Popand performed a detailed        characterization of its activity         in vitro and         in vivo  Our results indicate that        heterooligomeric SCF PoppPoppmediates Rump        ubiquitylation whereas distinct SCF Poppand SCF        Poppcomplexes target unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic        substrates thereby generating combinatorial diversity of        SCF function in fission yeast                    Results                  Composition of SCF PoppPopp          Based on the composition of known SCF complexes we          identified in the           S pombe genome database           psh pombe skp homologue and           pip pop interacting protein           two genes encoding proteins with strong similarity to          human SKP and HRTRBXROC respectively data not          shown Consistent with these proteins being components          of the putative SCF PoppPoppcomplex they all          copurified with Popp Popp and Pcup when          overexpressed pairwise data not shown          Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using affinity          purified rabbit antisera confirmed these interactions at          the level of the endogenous proteins While each of the          five antisera coprecipitated at least one of the other          subunits Pipp Popp and Popp antisera          coprecipitated all five proteins from wildtype cell          lysate Fig A Size fractionation of total cell          lysates prior to immunoprecipitation revealed coelution          of Pipp with Popp Popp Pcup and Pshp in a high          molecular weight complex of approximately  kDa which          we refer to as SCF PoppPoppFig B The composition          of the core complex PippPcupPshp did not undergo          major variations during the cell cycle Fig C We have          carefully reexamined potential cell cycle variations of          Pcup neddylation apparent in the IPimmunoblotting          experiment in Fig C These variations were not seen          when samples were denatured in SDS immediately following          extract preparation data not shown suggesting that          they arise from varying degrees of deneddylation          presumably occuring during the immunoprecipitation step          In addition in a separate experiment PoppPopp          heterooligomerization was largely constant during the          cell cycle Fig C These findings indicated that cell          cycledependent substrate degradation is unlikely to be          controlled at the level of SCF PoppPoppcomplex          formation                          SCF PoppPoppmediates polyubiquitylation of Rump          in vitro          Genetic experiments suggested that degradation of          Rump depends on the Popp and Popp Fbox proteins               but also requires phosphorylation of Rump on          serine  and threonine  by cyclindependent kinase          CDK     Thus phosphorylated Rump may be a          substrate for SCF PoppPoppmediated          polyubiquitylation To test this we first confirmed that          Rump is an           in vitro substrate for the Cdcp          kinase in association with the cyclin Cigp    as          judged by a mobility shift on SDS gels Fig A          Bacterially expressed Rump purified to apparent          homogeneity was also efficiently phosphorylated by          CdcpCigp complexes Fig A          To determine whether phosphorylated Rump interacts          with Popp and Popp protein lysate was prepared from          cells cooverexpressing epitopetagged combinations of          Popp and Popp Upon affinity purification on NiNTA          resin HAPoppHisMycPopp complexes were incubated          with bacterially expressed phosphorylated Rump In this          reaction PoppPopp complexes specifically bound          phosphorylated Rump Fig B lane  Consistent with          the genetic data     HisMycPopp and HisMycPopp          individually purified upon overexpression in           pop pop double mutants exhibited          no Rump binding above background Fig B lanes  and                    Given our ability to prepare immunopurified SCF          PoppPoppthat bound phosphorylated Rump we sought to          reconstitute Rump polyubiquitylation           in vitro In addition we required          an ubiquitin activating enzyme E and an ubiquitin          conjugating enzyme UBC While human E is highly          similar to its fission yeast counterpart data not          shown inspection of the           S pombe genome revealed fourteen          potential UBCs none of which is an obvious homologue of          human UBC or budding yeast Cdcp since all lack the          characteristic Cterminal extension data not shown We          therefore purified recombinant human E and UBC CDC          upon expression in bacteria Fig C          In the presence of human E UBC ubiquitin and ATP          SCF PoppPoppcomplexes immunopurified with Pipp          antibodies converted a small portion of phosphorylated          Rump into high molecular weight species Fig D This          conversion was dependent on the addition of E ATP data          not shown and wildtype UBC Fig D lanes           The activity of SCF PoppPoppwas augmented when Pipp          complexes where purified from           csn mutants Fig D lane           This mutant accumulates Pcup exclusively in a form          carrying the stimulatory Neddp modification due to a          defect in COPsignalosomemediated cullin deneddylation               Replacing wildtype ubiquitin by a mutant          lacking all lysine residues prevented the formation of          high molecular weight products Fig D lane           indicating that they represent polyubiquitylated Rump          species generated in the reaction Similar          polyubiquitylated reaction products were detected upon          incubation of phosphorylated Rump with Pcup          immunocomplexes further suggesting that the activity is          mediated by SCF PoppPoppdata not shown Moreover          Rump ubiquitylation was not obtained with Pipp          complexes prepared from cell lysate of           pop deletion strains proving the          Fbox protein dependency of this reaction Fig D lane           In addition the reaction was specific for human          UBC as no ubiquitylation was obtained with fission          yeast Ubcp Ubcp Ubcp or Ubcp Fig  lanes           Taken together these results strongly suggest          that SCF PoppPoppmediates the polyubiquitylation of          CDK phosphorylated Rump           in vitro                           Differential subcellular localization of SCF          PoppPoppsubunits          The copurification of the five identified SCF          PoppPoppsubunits and their           in vitro activity toward Rump          suggested that they coexist in a common subcellular          compartment The nuclear localization of the only known          substrates Cdcp    and Rump DAW          unpublished indicated that a substantial portion of SCF          PoppPoppis enriched in the nucleus To test this          assumption all five SCF PoppPoppsubunits were          expressed as fusion proteins with green fluorescent          protein GFP at low levels from an inducible pRep          plasmid While Pipp Pshp Pcup and Popp were          present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus          surprisingly GFPPopp was largely restricted to the          nucleus Fig A These localization patterns were          consistently observed in each single cell of an          asynchronous population excluding major variations          during the cell cycle          To rule out the possibility that overexpression or          Nterminal fusion to GFP affects their localization          Popp and Popp were modified with  Cterminal Myc          epitopetags at the endogenous genomic locus          Immunoblotting proved the expression of correctly sized          proteins and in addition showed that endogenous Popp          is approximately twofold more abundant in           S pombe cells than Popp Fig          B Indirect immunofluorescence staining with Myc          antibodies confirmed that Popp is predominantly          localized to cell nuclei whereas Popp is expressed in          both the cytoplasm and the nucleus Fig C          To confirm these localization patterns cells derived          from the epitopetagged strains were biochemically          fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear components The          efficiency of enrichment of nuclear and cytoplasmic          components was estimated by analyzing fractions with          antibodies recognizing the nuclear marker PCNA and          cytoplasmic tubulin Fig D Although both fractions          showed some contamination Popp was detected mostly in          nuclear fractions while Popp was apparent in both          nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions Fig D Thus all          five SCF PoppPoppsubunits appear to coexist in the          nucleus although all but Popp are also present in the          cytoplasm          Since Popp and Popp interact with each other              we asked whether their localization patterns depended          on the presence of the respective interaction partner          For this we created a           pop deletion strain carrying Popp          modified with  Myc epitope tags at the endogenous          genomic locus            popmyc pop strain  In          addition we created the reciprocal           popmyc pop strain containing          epitopetagged endogenous Popp in a           pop deletion background The          distinct localization patterns of PoppMyc and          PoppMyc were fully maintained in these strains Fig          E This observation was confirmed by overexpressing          GFPtagged Popp or Popp in           pop pop double deletion mutants          data not shown These data indicate that Popp and          Popp assume their subcellular localization pattern          independent of each other indicating the possibility of          distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic homooligomeric SCF          Poppand SCF Poppcomplexes                          Differential Fbox requirements of Popp and          Popp          As shown above and in previous genetic work               SCF PoppPoppdependent Rump degradation requires          two different proteins with highly conserved Fboxes          Fig A To better understand the apparent dual Fbox          requirement for SCF PoppPoppfunction we generated          mutants of Popp and Popp lacking Fboxes PoppF          PoppF Fig B In addition we prepared a set of          mutants in which the Fboxes of Popp and Popp were          swapped PoppF PoppF Fig B The mutants were          tested for their ability to suppress polyploidy and Rump          accumulation in the respective           pop mutant strains          As described previously     wildtype Popp          mildly overexpressed from a pRep plasmid fully          complemented the polyploidization phenotype of           pop mutants as determined by flow          cytometric measurement of the cellular DNA content Fig          C In addition Rump accumulation in           pop mutants was efficiently          reversed by wildtype Popp Fig D In contrast Popp          lacking its Fbox PoppF or Popp in which the Fbox          was replaced by the Fbox of Popp PoppF were          largely inactive in both assays Fig CD Thus as          with many other Fbox proteins the Fbox of Popp is          essential for its           in vivo functions          In contrast wildtype Popp the corresponding Fbox          mutant and Popp containing the Popp Fbox were equally          effective in preventing Rump accumulation Fig D The          same wildtype and mutant proteins also reversed the mild          polyploidy phenotype of           pop disruptants Fig C Thus          in contrast to Popp Popp does not seem to require its          Fbox to mediate Rump degradation           in vivo           To further substantiate this conclusion we examined          Rump protein stability in wildtype and           pop mutant strains expressing          Fboxdeleted Pop proteins from the weak pRep promoter          Since the sensitivity of our Rump sera was insufficient          to detect the low levels present in wildtype cells see          Fig D lane  these experiments were conducted in a          background where endogenous Rump was modified with           Cterminal cMyc epitope tags Rump halflife was          increased from  minutes in wildtype to greater than           minutes in           pop or           pop mutants Fig  While Fbox          deleted Popp expressed from plasmids reduced Rump          halflife to  minutes in           pop mutants Fboxdeleted Popp          was completely defective in rescuing the Rump          proteolysis defect of           pop mutants Fig  Instead          expression of PoppF in           pop mutants led to even greater          stabilization of Rump potentially due to dominant          negative interference with the residual activity of Popp          andor other Fbox proteins                          Fbox independent interaction of Popp and          Popp          The failure of the Popp Fbox to replace the Fbox of          Popp as well as the finding that it is not essential for          Rump degradation could be explained if it was not          critically involved in SCF PoppPoppprotein          interactions We therefore tested the possibility that          Popp can be tethered to the SCF core complex          independently of its Fbox via an interaction with Popp          Consistent with this hypothesis coimmunoprecipitation          experiments of overexpressed proteins revealed that the          PoppPopp interaction occurs independently of the          Fboxes of both Popp and Popp Fig A          We had previously mapped the domain of Popp that          interacts with Popp to an Nterminal fragment consisting          of the first  amino acids and lacking the Fbox               Fig B lane  In coimmunoprecipitation          experiments with overexpressed proteins this fragment          also bound to an Nterminal piece containing the first           residues of Popp Fig B lane  Thus the          PoppPopp interaction is mediated by their Nterminal          domains A further truncation mutant mapped the Popp          binding domain to a region between residues  and           of Popp Fig B lanes                           Individual SCF Poppand SCF Poppcomplexes bearing          ubiquitin ligase activity          The apparent dispensibility of the Fbox of Popp for          Rump degradation and binding to Popp raised the          question of why Popp does contain an Fbox Based on the          subcellular localization data we considered the          possibility that the Fbox of Popp may mediate the          assembly of a cytoplasmically localized SCF Poppcomplex          independent of Popp To demonstrate this we again used          the strain in which endogenous Popp was modified by           Myc epitope tags in a           pop deletion background The same          experiments were carried out with the reverse stain          which contained PoppMyc in a           pop background As a reference for          SCF Popcomplex formation we used strains carrying Myc          epitopetagged Popp or Popp integrated into the genome          of wildtype cells          Pipp immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of          these four strains and appropriate controls and          copurification of SCF components was determined by          immunoblotting These experiments showed that both Fbox          proteins in the absence of their respective          heterooligomerization partner could individually bind to          Pipp in complexes that also contained Pshp and Pcup          Fig A These findings indicate the existence of          distinct SCF Poppand SCF Poppcomplexes           in vivo           To further substantiate this conclusion we used gel          filtration to compare the elution profiles of Popp and          Popp in the presence or absence of their respective          dimerization partners If recruitment of Popp into a          high molecular weight SCF complex required          heterooligomerization with Popp its elution profile          would be expected to shift to a smaller size in the          absence of Popp Consistent with the results presented          in Fig C Popp together with SCF core subunits          eluted in fractions corresponding to    kDa          irrespective of whether Popp was present or not Fig          B In the reverse experiment the elution profile of          Popp was found to be independent of the presence of          Popp Fig B          While these data support the existence of distinct SCF          Poppand SCF Poppcomplexes individual binding of Popp          and Popp to SCF core components in the absence of their          heterodimerizing Fbox protein partners does not rule out          the possibility that these complexes represent inactive          intermediates formed during the normal assembly of          functional SCF PoppPoppcomplexes To exclude this          possibility we asked whether distinct SCF Poppand SCF          Poppcomplexes bear ubiquitin ligase activity           in vitro  To this end we          performed           in vitro ubiquitylation assays          Since the substrates of putative SCF Poppand SCF          Poppubiquitin ligases are unknown we adopted a          substrateindependent assay originally described by          Lyapina           et al      For this          experiment we again used the strains harboring          genomically integrated Myc epitopetagged Popp or Popp          in a background deficient in the respective          heterooligomerization partner            pop popmyc            pop popmyc strains Popp          and Popp complexes were immunopurified with Myc          antibodies and employed in           in vitro ubiquitylation assays upon          addition of E UBC ubiquitin and ATP High molecular          weight products generated in the reaction were detected          by immunoblotting with ubiquitin antibodies As          references we used strains expressing Myctagged Popp          or Popp in a wildtype background The experiment          demonstrated that Popp and Popp each associate with          polyubiquitylation activity even in the absence of their          respective heterooligomerizing Fbox proteins Fig C          Thus Popp and Popp appear to assemble into distinct SCF          complexes bearing ubiquitin ligase activity           in vitro                             Discussion                  Molecular architecture of SCF Popcomplexes          The phenomenon of Fbox protein oligomerization is not          unique to SCF Pop Although the crystal structure of the          SKPSKP complex derived from bacterially expressed          proteins revealed a single SKP monomer bound to SKP              biochemical studies showed that budding yeast          Cdcp a close homologue of PoppPopp forms          homooligomers when expressed in insect cells Correll and          Deshaies personal communication Similarly TRCP and           which target IB for degradation as homooligomers          form heterooligomers that each bind SCF core subunits          although no biochemical activity for this          heterooligomeric complex was demonstrated              Finally Popp and Popp homooligomerize at least when          overexpressed     indicating that both Fbox          proteins may also be present as homooligomers in          individual SCF Poppand SCF Popp respectively          A surprising finding of this study was that the Fbox          of Popp is dispensable for Rump degradation and ploidy          control while the Fbox of Popp is essential for both          functions Fig Dand  The Popp Fbox is unlikely to          be a degenerate nonfunctional and hence dispensable          motif as it carries all signature residues of the Fbox          Fig A In addition Popp in the absence of Popp          assembles into a complex containing all SCF core subunits          identified here Fig A At present we cannot exclude          that residues outside the Fbox mediate binding of Fbox          deleted Popp to Pshp and other core subunits          Consistent with this idea biochemical studies based on          the crystal structure of the human SKPSKP complex          revealed cooperation of the SKP Fbox with an adjacent          region in binding of SKP     Consistent with this          finding certain truncation mutants of the budding yeast          Fbox proteins Grrp and Cdcp interact poorly with          Skpp despite the retainment of their Fboxes               On the other hand the Fbox of Popp is essential for          Rump degradation Fig  arguing that residues outside          the Fbox are insufficient to mediate recruitment of Pop          proteins into SCF complexes          Based on the nonessential function of the Popp          Fbox we propose a molecular architecture of SCF          PoppPopp in which Popp is tethered to the core          subunits through interaction with Popp Although we have          no direct biochemical evidence to confirm this          proposition which would require Popp point mutants          deficient in Popp binding our data show that severely          truncated Nterminal fragments of Popp and Popp lacking          both Fboxes and WD repeat domains are sufficient to          mediate their interaction Fig B Similarly          dimerization of TRCP proteins is mediated by Nterminal          Ddomains lacking binding of SKP and other SCF core          subunits     According to our model the Fbox of          Popp would be essential only for the Poppindependent          activities of Popp for which we provide tentative          evidence by demonstrating the           in vivo assembly of SCF          Poppcomplexes Fig A These complexes bear ubiquitin          ligase activity in a substrateindependent           in vitro assay Fig C To what          extent this assay reflects the           in vivo activity of SCF Poppwill          become testable once the putative substrates of SCF          Poppare identified                          Subcellular compartmentalization of SCF Popas a          potential mechanism for substrate selection          Another surprising observation of this study was that          Popp is primarily localized to the nucleus whereas          Popp is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus          Fig  While nuclear localization was expected since          both known substrates of SCF PoppPopp Cdcp and          Rump are primarily nuclear proteins the cytoplasmic          localization of Popp suggests an activity of SCF          Poppdirected toward unknown cytoplasmic substrates In          support of this notion as with human SCF subunits              fission yeast SCF core subunits are also present in the          cytoplasm as shown here for overexpressed GFPfusions          Fig A and for endogenous Pcup by immunostaining in          a previous report              By analogy additional nuclear substrates of SCF          Poppmay exist For example Popp is involved in the          control of the RNA levels of the cyclin Cigp              While it is unclear whether this effect is mediated at          the level of transcription or mRNA stability the budding          yeast Fbox protein Metp was recently shown to regulate          the ubiquitylation and activity but not degradation of          the transcription factor Metp     In addition           pop mutants display an increased          rate of chromosome loss a phenotype that is not easily          explained by accumulation of Rump and Cdcp              Finally           pop mutants are sensitive to UV          irradiation whereas           pop mutants are not D Griffiths          and DAW unpublished observation It is therefore          likely that other substrates of Popp and Popp in          addition to their common substrates Cdcp and Rump do          exist          The idea developed above that Fbox protein          compartmentalization contributes to substrate selection          was recently confirmed directly for Cdcpmediated          degradation of Farp in budding yeast     Both          Cdcp and Farp are nuclear proteins in vegetative cells          owing to the presence of nuclear localization signals          NLS Fusion of Cdcp with a nuclear export signal          NESCdcp prevented its nuclear localization and its          ability to direct the degradation of nuclear Farp When          Farp also was targeted to the cytoplasm by disrupting          its NLS NESCdcp degraded NLSFarp in the cytoplasm                       A putative NLS is also present in the Nterminus of          Popp located between the Fbox and the WDrepeat domain           PEKIKRC An Nterminal Popp fragment containing          this motif when fused to the WDrepeat region of Popp          is targeted exclusively to the nucleus RL           DAW unpublished observation Like wildtype Popp          the reverse PoppNPoppC chimera localizes to both the          nucleus and the cytoplasm again indicating that Popp          but not Popp has a functional NLS in its Nterminus          RL  DAW unpublished observation It is          unclear at present what regulates Popp distribution          One possibility is that Popp is coimported in a complex          with other SCF subunits that is preformed in the          cytoplasm Since Popp distribution is independent of          Popp Fig E SCF core subunits are the most likely          candidates for such a function In line with this          suggestion it was previously demonstrated that          HRTROCRBX promotes nuclear accumulation of CUL                                         Conclusion        Our data suggest homo and heterooligomerization of the        Fbox proteins Popp and Popp as a mechanism for        generating combinatorial diversity of SCF function in        fission yeast A heterooligomeric SCF PoppPoppcomplex        mediates polyubiquitylation of phosphorylated Rump In        addition compartmentalization of homooligomeric SCF        Poppand SCF Poppcomplexes may direct the ubiquitylation        of unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates                    Methods                  Plasmids and yeast strains                    S pombe genes for           psh and
