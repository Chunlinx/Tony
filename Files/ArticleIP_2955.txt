                                 Famous Last Words            Anyone who lived in New Yorkin the last  years and whose life touched even briefly on that intownindustry of the printed word had to have heard of Harold Brodkey Writer andreputation were inseparable from the beginning no doubt because hisselfaggrandizement dovetailed so nicely with the spirit of literary kingmakersaround town It began as an explosion in  with the publication of hisstillastonishing collection of stories First Love and Other Sorrows The Big Novel was promised and promised but it seemed as if it would nevercome There were rumors that Brodkey was getting a kind of perpetuallyrenewable advance from his publisher Farrar Straus  Giroux Fragments offiction appeared in The New Yorker throughout the s and s butthey eventually amounted not to a novel but to a second collection Storiesin an Almost Classical Mode  Brodkey began to write an acerbiccolumn about life and letters for the New York Observer  and it was saidthat this new diversion proved he would never finish the novel            Somehowwhen The Runaway Soul  a novel of some  pages finally appeared in it was an anticlimax Though reviewed positively it was even itspartisans admitted perhaps too long too repetitive too fragmentary Literaryfashion is elusive what in the s might have seemed like an apotheosis ofmodernism had by the decidedly postmodern s come to seem old hat            Then in  while he was putting the finishing toucheson his second novel Profane Friendship  Brodkey learned that he was illwith AIDS He promptly published a declaration of his illness in The NewYorker  and suddenly he was as fascinating as a train wreck once againThis Wild Darkness The Story of My Death is his final book a series ofdiary essays chronicling the two years leading up to his death on Jan  An agonizing production of willful beauty it gives the lie to theimplicitly posed question about Brodkey megalomaniac or genius Because he wasboth            Brodkeysaccount takes us from his discovery that he was ill with AIDS through hisprolonged hospital stay with pneumonia his decision to return home and theslow monthsmany in a quiet equilibrium that was not health but not deatheitherthat followed During this time he was able to revisit his belovedVenice and spend a final summer in his country house in upstate New York Eventhough we know the end the story is filled with suspense and we turn thepages intently He was too great a writer not to milk the drama of his owndemise Running parallel to the story of the authors dying is that of hisrelationship with his wife Ellen Schwamm Brodkey and the mixture of deathbedwit tenderness and sensuality the couple share The portrait of Ellen is anunderstated valentine that colors the entire book with almost inadvertentcharm            The great relief here for reader as well aswriter is that the fictional mask has been cast aside Brodkeys work wasalways obviously insistently autobiographicalbut one could get muddledtrying to decide if for instance this storys narrator from a StLouis suburb was the same as that storys narrator from a St Louissuburb Although the various narrators might sound exactly the same they wouldhave different names and one a sister And then there were the confusionsamong the many Venetian lovers male and female and the mystery of the alterego who directs films These are no doubt parochial concerns but Brodkeyalways seemed to be deliberately provoking the puzzlement coyly playinghideandseek with us            Bycontrast it seems calming to Brodkeys voice to find itself in a true firstperson and a lucid present tense                           Medical attention andthe horrors of death great death amused me in a quiet way Amused Well whatdo you feel when youre expected to fight an oftenfatal pneumonia and youvebeen sentenced to death already  The connection to the ordinary world isbroken yet not entirely And there is a cartoon aspect the curses peoplehurled at you have come true What do you suggest I do Be unamused                        Thereisunsurprisingly given Brodkeys reputationno shortage here of paranoiaand scoresettling Brodkey often darkly refers to his enemies the enemies ofhis work of his marriagethe enemies of genius He manages to get one smartcrack in writing I do think about suicide a lot because it is so boring tobe ill rather like being trapped in an Updike novel            There are also embarrassingor if you preferhonestreferences to his being recognized and accepted as an importantwriter to the conviction that his work will live after he is gone He chewsover his past counts up his debtors enumerates his aches and pains andworries the issue of subjectivity to the bone A friend says that I am amonstre sacr but I am not so famous I am aware of the monstrosity ofmy own will and of individual will in anyone he writes Or again I believethat the world is dying not just me Is all this his special megalomania orjust gardenvariety egotism Either way Brodkey embraces a selfabsorption soextreme that it succeeds paradoxically in turning him into an Everyman                           My body is to me like acrippled rabbit that I dont want to pet that I forget to feed on time that Ihavent time to play with and get to know a useless rabbit kept in a cage thatit would be cruel to turn loose                        Brodkeyunderplays the untying of an old psychological knot when he reveals details ofhis childhood His mother died when he was young and he was adopted by theBrodkeys His new parents became physically ill which exacerbated theirpsychological torture of their son so much one could have gathered alreadyfrom Brodkeys fiction The new details in This Wild Darkness makeexplicit the sexual abuses of his adoptive father Brodkey tells us that afterseveral years of unwanted fondling I said he could not touch me anymore noteven a handshake unless he behaved   He turned his face to the walltelling me I was a cold fishbecause I would not sex around with him He waslecherous and strange            Brodkey expresses enormous ambivalence abouthis own laterlife adventures in homosexuality referring at one unsavorymoment to his illness as the wages of sin While it is easy to see howinfuriating such a pose must be to others offensiveness in the service ofsubjective truth has its place here If not here then where Brodkey is notobliged to be a poster boy for AIDS Besides in another mood he writes Itseemed to me that I was surrounded by braveries without number that I had beeninducted into a phalanx of the wildlyaliveevenifdying and I felt honoredthat I would so to speak die in the company of such people            On thepage Brodkey has always been a brilliant egotistical talker As a listenerone is both stimulated and frustrated longing to get a word in edgewisePerhaps thats why he has always seemed to want to preclude critical judgmentwith preemptive strikes within his prose anticipating our responses andsilencing us He does that here too but with a somewhat milder air I thinkwhat I think and the hell with the rest of it the rest of you you dontactually exist for me anywayyoure all myths in my head Perhaps theabsoluteness of the act of writing in effect his own elegyand theabsoluteness of his inability to answer his critics afterwardcuriouslymellowed him            It turns out to be surprisingly easy to get past thewhining and the nonsense about fame And Brodkeys strenuous feats ofobservation and language in the teeth of death more than repay theeffort                           At one time I wasinterested in birdwatching and I noticed that when I saw a bird for the firsttime I couldnt really see it because I had no formal arrangement no sense ofpattern for it  But once I identified the bird the drawings in bird booksand my own sense of order arranged the image and made it clearer to me and Inever forgot it From then on I could see the bird in two waysas the freshunpatterned vision and the patterned one Well seeing death nearby is verylike the first way of seeing                        What can one do withBrodkeys gift of his own death given in a manner at once casual and shockingReceive it with gratitude
