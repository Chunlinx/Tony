                 hello   Phil here in Rochester New York   my goodness well im in Texas so i sound i found sound very Texan           well this should be an easy one i so much so like we could we have lots to talk about   well what what do you subscribe to or are you ready for me to press one and and lets continue our conversation   yeah that would be all right   okay hold on     okay   what what magazines do you prescribe to or do you have   uh actually it would be easier to tell you what i dont get     okay   because i uh i receive Time Newsweek and the US News and World Report every week i get you know all the news magazines   uhhuh   and pretty much everything associated with my hobby which includes gardening magazines and uh uh uh radio and things like that so i im just loaded over here   uhhuh well im not see i i i take Time and uh uh uh off and on during my life ive taken uh Good Housekeeping so theres i work so much and then when im not working then im active in i do i do not do the the enough reading like i should   yeah i i since im in radio up here i have to try and stay informed with uh   certainly   what goes on around there i i like Newsweek better than i like Time i you know magazines for me i get behind but i like them because uh the especially with the news magazines you get much more analysis than the newspaper can give and uh im interested also in reading some of the stories that just arent big enough to make into the local papers here   right right   and uh of course you know for gardening i i get Better Homes and Gardens up here mainly i get gardening information maybe some recipes and sometimes these things have coupons in them too   right right   and that more or less pays for your subscription   uhhuh well im im very conservative so i dont jump uh im a single parent so i dont blow a lot of money in anywhere   sure       sure oh yeah it thats the thing you know they they have to be careful about which ones you get because they can be really expensive if youre   right   not careful not to mention finding the time to read them its even hard for me id i have mail buckets full of magazines i havent had a chance to look at yet   right       well see that uh i was really i was i do good to even get through  excuse me i do good to get through Time sometimes     yeah that i i i like Time a little bit uh i its probably my second favorite of the news magazines   well you think Newsweek might be a better   uh i like Newsweek better uh because they have uh a couple of things i like they have the cartoons and the quotes in there which i think are funny and some of the stories you know they have the analysis like all the rest of them do but they also get some more offbeat stories   huh uhhuh   which uh im interested in finding out more about and it seems just to me to be a better read than Time Time is my second favorite   uhhuh   uh Time excels at the coverage of indepth issues you know if you want to really find out something indepth and learn about it Time is a good magazine   right well what about what in your im asking all uh i uh uh really different question in a way but since you are in the in the public what is what does your area feel about abortion do you do is there any   and U S   general consensus or   well i i kind of fall down in to the choice category just because really as a man i really you know i dont particularly believe that i have a particular say over what someone else some woman has   or   you know she has her choice to do   right well we wont fight over this because you know i me myself i dont know that im forty six i dont know that i ever could have or ever would have an abortion   uhhuh   but now at forty six let me tell you one thing id have an abortion if i were to become pregnant but dont intend to you know but uh you know just just leave my body alone i have my choices   yeah uhhuh yeah that   and uh and i feel i really you know i dont believe in in getting pregnant when if theres any way to prevent it but it happens all the time you know i have a a sisterinlaw that had her tubes tied nine years ago   uhhuh   before she had her little bouncing baby boy   sure   you know so theres things like that happen of course now they they didnt she wouldnt consider an abortion but they didnt intend for that third child you know intend to have that third child   uhhuh   but uh you know just uh ive seen Jane Fonda ive i watch very little T V also but ive seen Jane Fonda on T V at my mothers house and she said tells you shes telling the government to stay out of her womb and i feel that way you know youve got enough business youve got enough problems youve got enough fraud youve got enough uh you know
