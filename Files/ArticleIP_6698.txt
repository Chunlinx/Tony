thing for apundit is to be sure of his or her opinions There is no penalty for being sureof one thing now and sure of something else later Until  pm ET when thefirst returns came in the analysts were certain that there would be nomessage tonight This would be a status quo election no big issues weregalvanizing voters nothing enormous would be decided            But by  pm the effortto impeach President Clinton was dead as a dodo and MSNBC pundits werewondering how long it would be till enraged Republicans deposed Newt Gingrichas speaker of the House By  pm when Chuck Schumers New York Senatevictory was announced the evening had officially become a Democratic Rout            The bestline of the night came from Sen Fred Thompson RTenn when some cable newsanchor asked him to assess the election results so far When these thingsarent going your way you say Its still early So I guess its stillearly            In terms of seats changing hands the Democraticvictorythough remarkableis very small Tonights real landslide victorybelongs to two other parties First the Party of Virtue It was a clean sweepfor the good guys In tight race after tight race voters have rejected thevenal and the wicked North Carolina dumped embarrassing Sen Lauch Fairclothin favor of John Edwards who cant possibly be worse Alabama dropped itsillbehaved governor Fob James New Yorkers had the wisdom to retire theirchief sleaze Sen Al DAmato in favor of Schumer who has all DAmatos goodqualities and only half of his bad ones Maryland reelected a harmlessmediocrity Gov Parris Glendening over a holy terror Ellen Sauerbrey Andto prove that the Party of Virtue is bipartisan Illinois may drop ethicallychallenged Sen Carol MoseleyBraun Any one of those results constitutes aminor improvement in American politics All of them together constitute a nearmiracle            Tonights actual miracleReform Party candidate Jesse The Body Ventura leads in the Minnesotagovernors race America has had plenty of athlete politicians and plenty ofactor politicians Now at last we can have both in one package a prowrestler            The otherbig winner Tuesday night oddly enough was the Party of Vice There is muchcrowing about the resurgence of the Democratic Party in the South given FritzHollings Senate victory gubernatorial upsets in South Carolina and Alabamaand a probable gubernatorial win in Georgia Why has this happened Because theDemocratic Party has become the Lottery Party In Georgia retiring DemocraticGov Zell Miller instituted a hugely popular state lottery that has raised tensof millions of dollars for public education Democrat Roy Barnes who promisedto continue Millers policies is winning the election to succeed him InAlabama and South Carolina the incumbent governors Christian conservativeRepublicans Fob James and David Beasley resisted efforts to startGeorgiastyle lotteries They are both getting thrown out of office defeatedby Democrats running on prolottery platforms Who says the lottery is asuckers gamble            As they do during the finalweek of every campaign the Turnout Bores have hijacked the  election Theyhave persuaded most of the media that this campaign is a pudding without atheme that there are no galvanizing issues and that everything hingeson which party does a better job getting its core voters to the polls Thequestion Can my blacks and seniors beat your Christian conservatives            Never mind that everyelection hinges on turnout Accept that the Turnout Bores are onto somethingIn fact why not take their theory a step further The election depends onturnout And what more than anything does turnout depend on The weather ofcourse            To thatend                   Slate                offers a real Election Day
