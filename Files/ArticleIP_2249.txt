                                 Dole vs the ITimesI            For several weeks nowpundits have debated how Bob Dole would exit the stage Would he depart on anegative note about his opponent or a positive one about himself Would heleave with anger or with humor In the past several days the issue has beensettled Dole it appears will end his political career raging against theNew York Times             Doles spat with the graylady went public on Thursday Oct  In New Orleans Dole charged the paperwith ignoring a story about a Miami drug dealer who got invited to the WhiteHouse This is a disgrace Dole insisted I doubt if you even read it in theNew York Times  They probably put it in the want ads They dont put anyantiClinton stories in the New York Times  Only antiDole stories inthe New York Times  Dole repeated his attack for the next five daysWe are not going to let the media steal this election he told a crowd inDallas on Friday This country belongs to the people not the New YorkTimes  On Saturday in Visalia Calif he added I know that with acrowd this size the New York Times will write not many people showedup but the other papers will get it right            On Sundaythe day the Times endorsed Clinton Dole called the paper theapologist for President Clinton for the last four years and an arm of theDemocratic National Committee In a CNN interview broadcast Monday Dole saidthe Times might as well be part of the Democratic Party  Theyhammer us on a daily basis We make a major speech they bury it back onsection D They put a frontpage story that well Bob Dole and Jack Kempdidnt get along together  years ago On Tuesday Dole was still at itreferring to the  words of the th Amendment and quipping Thats aboutwhat I got in the New York Times today            The Times has reacted to this assault byhighhandedly quoting everything and explaining none of it leaving its readersbaffled as to why the Republican nominee is so upset at the paper In factDoles fury at the Times is hardly news to those who work at the paperAccording to Katharine Seelye who has covered Dole since the beginning of hiscampaign the complaints date from December  when Dole staff members firstprotested that she had misunderstood the candidates position on abortion Thereal bitterness however began in May when the paper played what Dole aidesbilled as a major address about welfare on Page  of the business sectionSince then campaign honchos have peppered the papers reporters and editorswith constant phone calls and letters complaining about unfair treatment            Reporters traveling with Dolecaught a glimpse of the enmity Oct  when Nelson Warfield Doles presssecretary staged a public confrontation with Seelye The candidate Warfieldtold reporters waiting to board the campaign plane had just come from anappearance on G Gordon Liddys radio show Why Seelye asked werentreporters told about the appearance in advance According to reporters presentWarfield snapped that it wouldnt make any difference because the Timeswould get the story wrong anyway Then on the plane Warfield walked back tothe press section and grandly served Seelye with a copy of a letter fromCommunications Director John Buckley to her boss Times WashingtonEditor Andrew Rosenthal            Thatletter which has fallen into the hands of Slate protests Seelyes coverage ofa speech the previous day Dole in New Jersey had talked about Clinton beingAWOL in the drug war Where has he been for four years How many hundreds ofthousands of young people started drugs Dole said Three million havestarted smoking while he was playing around with smoking and all this stufffinally in an election year Seelyes frontpage story reported that Mr Doleaccused the President of playing around while the drug war raged out ofcontrol Buckley complains that the story could lead the reader to believethat Dole was talking about a very different kind of playingaroundsomething he did not say and something he would not say The lettercontinues Since May I have been pointing out to you a problem we see withthe accuracy and understanding of context revealed in Kits reporting goingon to assert that Seelye has misquoted Dole on numerous occasions and done soin a manner that distorted the accuracy of her assertions and yourcoverage            No Dole staff would be quoted by name for thisstory but speaking on background a senior campaign official elaborated uponthe complaint Theyve just done a miserable job throughout this campaignthe official said The coverage of Dole has been excessively bitchy from dayone in addition to having a number of extraordinary factual problems WithSeelye the official says the problem is not being able to transcribe a tapeaccurately With Adam Nagourney the Times  other reporter coveringDole full time since the summer the problem is an incredible focus on thelittle picture as opposed to the big picture As an example the officialcites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Doles fall from aplatform in Chico Calif and his mistaken reference to the Brooklyn Dodgersas a rough stretch of politicking Other than those two episodes theofficial says Dole actually had a great week The campaigns complaint extendsto unequal treatmenta ninepart series on Clintons record which theofficial describes as the softest portrait since they invented blackvelvetand the Times perpetually underestimating the size of Dolecrowds Clinton even gets better photographs the official contends            Rosenthal who has direct responsibility for campaign coverage at theTimes  professes bewilderment at these complaints We dont makeeditorial judgments based on disposition to be tough on Bob Dole or nice to BobDole he says On the specifics Rosenthal says that the Times ran aneditors note acknowledging that it shouldnt have truncated the playingaround quote He points out that the Times ran its story on the Miamidrug dealer who visited the White House the same day Dole accused the paper ofnot covering it As for the ninepart series on Clinton Rosenthal says it isthe longstanding practice of the paper to do a lengthy series on theincumbents record If Dole wins and runs again in  he will get ninepartseries too he says            Ithink we have been tough on him Seelyesays This stems however not from any bias she says but from the campaignsown internal problems Doles campaign has been especially porous with aidesemulating the proverbial seafaring rats This is true enoughin recent daysexstrategist Don Sipple has trashed the campaign on the record But theresanother point too Contrary to Buckleys charge that she misquotes DoleSeelye routinely makes Dole look ridiculous by quoting him all too accuratelydepicting him in what one colleague calls a cinema verit  styleFamous for going over and over her tape recordings on the campaign planeSeelye manages to get every Dole mumble repetition and verbal miscue downFor instance in her Oct  story reporting Doles attack on the Times Seelye writes            In Phoenix on Friday nighthe had a delightful time drawing out his vowels as he described financialcontributions to the Clinton campaign From Indoneeesia he said Yeah FromINdiaaaaah Some fellow named Gandhi out there He owes  in back taxesbut he found  to give to the Clinton campaign And now Gandhi isgaaaawn Gaaaaandhi gone gone gone They cant find him            Two days later she quotedDole in another story Theyve turned the White House into something else Idont know what it is Its the animal house Its the animal house Mostreporters would write Bob Dole yesterday compared the White House to ananimal house sparing the exclamation points and making him sound at leastcompos mentis            But thoughunflattering Seelyes Mametizing of Bob Dole can hardly be called unfair Itis not as if the Times cleans up Clintons quotes the president simplyobserves the rules of syntax most of the time Something similar may behappening with the pictures After four years Clinton has learned how to avoidlooking unpresidential He no longer allows himself to be photographed wearingtooshort running shorts and he avoids pulling faces in public Dole who issimply less photogenic is an easier victim for picture editorswho liketheir editorial counterparts have a strong bias against dullness Take forinstance the two pictures shown above The frontpage picture the Timesran the day after the second presidential debate does make Dole look like adecomposing monster But unlike the picture in the Washington Post thesame day it captures the spirit of the event with Dole grimly taking theoffensive and Clinton watching warily but standing aside from the attacks            Dole sounds absurd when he alleges that thepaper that broke Whitewater and the story of the first ladys commoditiestrades has not been aggressive in pursuing Clinton scandals All sorts ofpotential Dole scandals have been softpedaled by the media including theTimes  because he is so far behind Its true that coverage of Clintonon the campaign trail has been somewhat softer than the coverage of Dole aseven other Times reporters acknowledge But the explanation isinstitutional not ideological The press as many have complainedoveremphasizes the horse race aspect of politics As a side effect of thatdisease reporters have excessive respect for a wellrun campaign In Republican George Bush benefited from this phenomenon A cruder reality isthat reporters need to have a relationship with Clinton after Tuesday            None of these factorsthough is unique to the Times  So why is Dole singling it out Dolesattacks on the Times have the appearance of being an exercise inpopulist demagogy In one of his great cuecard reading remarks Dole tried toexplain his recent attacks on CNN the other night by saying I like the mediaThey dont like them in the South But this pat explanation doesnt entirelymake sense Red meat for rightwing crowds doesnt help Dole with the centristvoters he would need to turn around in order to make the miraculous happen Andin fact according to a senior Dole aide the attacks are heartfelt on thecandidates part Dole has been going after the Times over theobjections of advisers who have been telling him theres no percentage inpicking fights with the press            But if Dole is attacking theTimes because he is truly furious and not because he thinks it will helphim get elected what is he so angry about The answer I think is that therehas always been a Nixonian streak in Bob Dole by which I mean a part of himwhich feels shut out of the closed circle of the Eastern establishment At theRepublican convention Dole blasted the Clinton administration as a corps ofthe elite who never grew up never did anything real never sacrificed neversuffered and never learned That phrase recalled an attack he made on thepress long ago in the days of Watergate when he accused the WashingtonPost of being in bed with George McGovern There is a cultural and socialaffinity between the McGovernites and the Post executives and editorsDole said then They belong to the same elite They can be found livingcheekbyjowl in the same exclusive chic neighborhoods and hobnobbing at thesame Georgetown parties The deeper story here isnt whether Dole was wronglyshunted onto D when he ought to have been on A Its his feelings as hesays goodbye to politics about the people who get to decide
