                                  Harkins Objection            Friday afternoon as RepBob Barr RGa was urging the Senate to convict President Clinton of perjuryand obstruction of justice Sen Tom Harkin DIowa rose and objected to theuse of the word jurors when referring to the Senate Reporters scrambledfor their notebooks and senators stirred from their slumber at this deviationfrom the trials script Sen Judd Gregg RNH called Harkins complaint apointless distraction and Barr dismissed it as a semantic quibble ButHarkins objection was neither unscripted nor purely semantic It was animportant strategic maneuver            Regular jurors cannotoverrule the judge Harkin told Chief Justice William Rehnquist Not so hereRegular jurors do not decide what evidence should be heard the standards ofevidence nor do they decide what witnesses shall be called Not so hereRegular jurors do not decide when a trial is to be ended Not so here  Ithink the framers of the Constitution meant us the Senate to be somethingother than a jury Two days later on ABCs This Week  Harkin added Ajury decides one thingfactsand sometimes the law We have a much broaderresponsibility  We cant hide behind the curtain of saying Oh Im just ajuror I cant take that into account We have to take everything intoaccount            Harkin proudly explained that he wasnt surprised whenRehnquist ruled in his favor because he had read Rehnquists book onimpeachment and knew that Rehnquist believed senators in an impeachment trialwere more than just jurors He asserted that Rehnquists ruling underminestheir case for bringing any witnesses because obviously we are not jurorsAbove all said Harkin Rehnquist was affirming that the Senate can take intoaccount not just the facts and the law but the public good  The chiefjustice really means that we can be expansive that we can decide on a muchbroader set of findings than just the findings of fact or law            What Rehnquist actuallysaid however was narrower The Senate is not simply a jury It is a court inthis case he ruled The word court consisting of judges and jurors iscrucial Rehnquist was agreeing that senators could decide questions such aswhat evidence should be heard and when a trial is to be ended which arethe province of judges not jurors But judges like jurors are bound by factsand law Harkin was distorting Rehnquists ruling into an affirmation thatsenators could reach beyond the facts and the law to consider the publicgood            Harkin correctly construed the jury metaphor as aRepublican strategy to frame the debate Click for more analysis of thatstrategy I believe that the continual use of the word juror by the Housemanagers was meant to sort of circumscribe  what we could do in the Senatehe said They were trying to put us in a box in which all we could do was totake the facts and decide Clintons guilt or innocence But Harkins purposewas equally strategic to break out of that box dispense with witnesses setaside persuasive facts and inconvenient law and instead acquit Clinton basedon the undefined public good All the while portraying the GOPs focus onfacts as a cowardly ruse to hide behind the curtain of jury scruple            The public good may indeed be a valid reason notto remove Clinton from office But Rehnquist didnt authorize thatconsideration the court metaphor doesnt square with it and the Democratshave yet to define it
