                    Introduction        Alzheimer disease is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly and is        characterized by accumulation of extracellular and vascular amyloid in the brain         Amyloid deposits are composed of the amyloid peptide A a kDa peptide released        during amyloidogenic proteolytic processing of the Alzheimer A precursor protein APP         APP can also be cleaved by the nonamyloidogenic secretases a disintegrin and        metalloproteinase  ADAM and ADAM  in a reaction that is believed to occur        primarily on the plasma membrane  and is known as ectodomain shedding        Secretasetype ectodomain shedding divides the A domain of APP thereby generating        secretasecleaved soluble APP ectodomain sAPP           This reaction can be stimulated by activation of protein kinase        C PKC or extracellularsignalregulated protein kinases ERKs  or by inactivation        of protein phosphatase  or A         Reports from retrospective analyses suggest that the statin class of        cholesterollowering HMGCoA reductase inhibitors may lower the risk for Alzheimer disease        by as much as   Studies in wildtype guinea pigs and in plaqueforming        transgenic mice have demonstrated that chronic statin treatment can attenuate cerebral        amyloidosis  suggesting that statins may exert their riskreducing effects at        least in part by modulating APP metabolism In cell culture lovastatin and simvastatin        decrease the release of A by rat hippocampal neurons  while activating        secretasetype ectodomain shedding  However the molecular mechanisms by which        statins modulate ectodomain shedding remain to be elucidated         Statin effects on APP metabolism are to some extent attributable to cholesterol        lowering but statin actions on APP may also involve cholesterolindependent actions         Reduction in synthesis of mevalonate leads to decreased generation of a number of        isoprenoid lipid derivatives Isoprenoids such as farnesyl pyrophosphate and        geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate are  or carbon lipid moieties Through the action of        farnesyl transferases and type I geranylgeranyl transferases isoprenoids are attached to        the amino acid sequence CysAlaAlaXaa CAAX at the Cterminus of the Rho family of        GTPases  These posttranslational lipid modifications are essential for attachment of        the GTPases to the cytosolic face of intracellular vesicles andor to the cytosolic leaflet        of the plasma membrane thereby specifying subcellular targets for GTPase actions        Some members of the Rho GTPase family exert their actions through modulation of protein        kinase activities One of the best characterized is Rhoassociated protein kinase  ROCK        also called ROK ROCK is a serinethreonine kinase with an apparent mass of  kDa that        can be activated by either RhoA or RhoB  Structurally the ROCK Nterminus        contains the protein kinase domain while the Cterminus has both a Rhobinding domain and        a pleckstrin homology domain either of which can modulate proteinprotein interactions In        the inactive state the Rhobinding domain and the pleckstrin homology domain form an        autoinhibitory loop by binding and blocking the kinase domain at the Nterminus of the        molecule Activation of ROCK occurs when a Rho protein binds to the Rhobinding domain        causing a conformational change that opens the kinase domain for the phosphorylation of        downstream effectors  Once activated ROCK phosphorylates several substrates        including myosin light chain phosphatase LIM kinases Lin Isl and Mec and        ezrinradixinmoesin proteins  ROCK has recently been implicated in        modifying the site of substrate cleavage by APP secretase  perhaps acting via        ROCKdependent phosphorylation of a component of the secretase enzyme complex        In the current study we demonstrate that activation of sAPP         shedding from cultured cells by atorvastatin or simvastatin involves        isoprenoidmediated protein phosphorylation Treatment of cells with a farnesyl transferase        inhibitor or expression of a dominant negative DN ROCK molecule led to enhanced sAPP         shedding supporting the notion that shedding is modulated by the        isoprenoid pathway Transfection with the cDNA for a constitutively active CA ROCK        molecule led to inhibition of statinactivated sAPP         shedding These results raise the possibility that the apparent        beneficial effect of statins in the prevention of Alzheimer disease could be at least in        part mediated by isoprenoid modulation of APP metabolism                    Methods

indicated LIVEDEAD assays were          performed following the manufacturers instructions Molecular Probes                          Cholesterol Assays          Cholesterol levels in cell lysates were measured using Amplex Red following the          manufacturers instructions Molecular Probes We have previously demonstrated that          standard doses of either simvastatin or atorvastatin reduce cholesterol levels in Na          cells by                            Quantification and Statistical Analysis          Quantification of protein bands was performed using the UVP Bioimaging System and          statistical analysis was performed on paired observations using the Students           t test                            Results                  Atorvastatin Activates sAPP Shedding at a Subcellular Site Upstream of Endocytosis          from the Plasma Membrane          We confirmed our previous observation  that atorvastatin produces an increase in          sAPP           shedding that is dosedependent reaching a maximum effect at  M          The increase in sAPP           shedding is accompanied by a corresponding increase in levels of the          nonamyloidogenic APP Cterminal fragment C data not shown          In order to refine our localization of the subcellular target of statin action we          evaluated the steadystate levels of cellsurface APP csAPP in the absence or presence          of statins After drug treatments cells were subjected to the surface biotinylation          protocol Cells and media were harvested and levels of sAPP            holoAPP and csAPP were measured Treatment with atorvastatin          increased csAPP by approximately fold similar to the effect of the drug on holoAPP          Figure  while sAPP           shedding was increased by approximately fold           p   Since csAPP levels were only slightly raised in the same          statintreated cells in which sAPP           shedding was dramatically increased we interpret this disparity to          indicate that the effector of statinstimulated shedding is probably intrinsic to the          plasma membrane In other studies the plasma membrane has been proposed to be or to          contain the statin target For example statins have been proposed to cause          colocalization of secretase and APP within lipid rafts  statins might also          induce modification of the structure and activity of a protein in the plasma membrane          secretase complex perhaps in an action similar to how statins bind and lock          cellsurface integrins           A pulsechase protocol was also used to study posttranscriptional regulation of APP          metabolsm by statins data not shown This protocol avoids any confound that might arise          because of altered APP transcription Pulsechase studies were performed using a min          pulse with            Smethionine followed by various chase times from  to  min          Typical maturation and halflife of mature cellular holoAPP were observed as was          subsequent release of sAPP            In the presence of either atorvastatin or simvastatin the          time course of maturation and release perfectly paralleled that observed in the absence          of either drug except that the fractional content of cellular mature holoAPP was          approximately fold greater in the presence of drug ie at  or  min chase mature          APP in the presence of statin was approximately  of the level of immature APP at           t   versus a control vehicle treatment of  of the level of          immature APP at           t   also at           t   min the relative percent values for drug versus vehicle were           and  respectively Fold increases in released sAPP           in the same experiments were approximately  to fold           arbitrary units versus  arbitrary units at  min for atorvastatin and          simvastatin respectively Secretory maturation toxicity is one possible mechanism for          elevated levels of intracellular mature holoAPP and causes retarded conversion of mature          holoAPP to sAPP            This pattern was not observed following statin treatment          excluding maturation toxicity as a mechanism underlying the altered levels of mature          cellular holoAPP          Instead the pattern that we observed raises the possibility that statins presumably          via isoprenoids given the reversibility with mevalonate as discussed in the next          section may alter sorting of cellular holoAPP diverting holoproteins away from terminal          degradation in the endosomallysosomal pathway and into the constitutive secretory          pathway that generates sAPP            However the fold effect on reduced intracellular turnover in the          endosomallysosomal pathway or sorting out of the endosomallysosomal pathway and into          the constitutive secretoryshedding pathway is apparently insufficient to explain the          fold effect on sAPP           generation fold for the former vs  to fold for the latter          indicating a contribution from a downstream site in the processing pathway When these          results are taken together with independent work on regulated shedding of transforming          growth factor  TGF  a parsimonious explanation is that an important target          for activation of ectodomain shedding is probably located at the plasma membrane or          downstream of APP residence at the plasma membrane          The identification of the regulatory components of the ectodomain shedding machinery          have been longsought in other studies employing phorbol esters to stimulate shedding of          sAPP           or TGF  Munc has recently been implicated as a          phorbol target in regulated shedding  In our opinion this molecule is rather          unlikely to play a major role in shedding regulation given the specificity of Munc          effects for phorbols and the generalization of the regulated shedding phenomenon to          include activation by protein phosphatase inhibitors and neurotransmitters Neither of          these would be predicted to act via the phorbolbinding C domain of Munc          Sisodia and colleagues  demonstrated that arrest of APP endocytosis from the          plasma membrane by deletion of its           NPXY clathrincoated vesicle targeting sequence  can          dramatically stimulate sAPP           shedding presumably by extending the halflife of colocalized          secretase and APP on the plasma membrane In order to exclude the possible contribution          of altered endocytosis to statinstimulated shedding we evaluated the effect of          phenylarsine oxide PO an inhibitor of endocytosis on statinstimulated shedding          Figure  Treatment with either atorvastatin simvastatin or PO alone increased sAPP           shedding as expected Cotreatment of cells with PO plus either          atorvastatin or simvastatin caused stimulation of sAPP           shedding to levels greater than the maximal levels of shedding          achievable with inhibition of endocytosis using PO alone or with maximal doses of either          statin alone           p   The additivity of statin and POstimulated shedding is          consistent with the hypothesis that statins act at or near the plasma membrane prior to          internalization of csAPP Under all circumstances stimulated sAPP           shedding was completely blocked using TNF protease inhibitor  a          standard secretasemetalloproteinase inhibitor Figure  We interpret this as an          indication that the statininduced cleavage of APP is probably mediated by one of the          molecules usually associated with the phenomenon ie ADAM or ADAM                           Compounds that Modulate Isoprenoid Levels Activate sAPP Shedding          As discussed above there is an established relationship between statins and          isoprenoidmodulated protein phosphorylation We therefore tested the effects of FTI on          statinstimulated sAPP           shedding FTI increased the shedding of sAPP            but the combination of a statin plus FTI increased sAPP           shedding to levels greater than those achievable by using either          compound alone Figure            p   In the same experiment levels of holoAPP were modestly          increased but again to an extent insufficient to account for the increase in shed sAPP           Figure           To test whether statinactivated shedding might be attributable to a metabolite          downstream of HMGCoA reductase cells were treated with  M simvastatin  M FTI and          a series of concentrations of mevalonic acid Since FTI acts downstream of HMGCoA          reductase the stimulatory effect of FTI on sAPP           shedding would not be predicted to be modified by mevalonate          supplementation Low doses  M of mevalonic acid did not affect statininduced          sAPP           shedding but complete inhibition of statinactivated sAPP           shedding was achieved with higher doses of mevalonic acid  M          As predicted the shedding observed following treatment with FTI was not inhibited by          any of the concentrations of mevalonic acid tested Figure  These data are consistent          with a role for isoprenoids in statin control of APP metabolism in cultured cells                          Expression of ROCKRelated Molecules Modulates sAPP Shedding in a Bidirectional          Manner          Since many isoprenoidmediated Rho effects converge on ROCKs we next transfected Na          cells with cDNAs encoding either green fluorescent protein GFP control CA ROCK or          DN ROCK Figure  Simvastatin caused a typical activation of sAPP           shedding from GFPtransfected cells When CA ROCK was introduced          however shedding of sAPP           from both untreated and simvastatintreated cells was diminished          Figure            p   versus GFP control Conversely DN ROCK alone activated          shedding of sAPP            Cellular levels of holoAPP were not affected by transfection          Figure            p   versus GFP control In studies aimed at independent          confirmation of the involvement of ROCK activation in sAPP           shedding we treated SweAPP Na cells with arachidonic acid an          activator of ROCK As shown in Figure  arachidonic acid reduced the shedding of sAPP           without altering levels of holoAPP Based on this series of results          we concluded that both basal and activated sAPP           shedding from cultured cells are controlled by ROCK activity          In some experiments cells were treated with Y  nM to  M a compound that          can inhibit ROCKs Y showed no effect on basal sAPP           release and blocked statinactivated sAPP           shedding data not shown This result was unexpected in light of          the effects of DN ROCK Given the internally consistent actions of DN ROCK and CA          ROCK as well as the results employing either FTI or arachidonate we concluded that          the Y result might be due to inhibition by Y of protein kinases other than          ROCK  The possibility was also considered that cytotoxicity of Y for the          central vacuolar pathway might explain the disparity between the effects of DN ROCK and          those of Y but neither impairment of intracellular APP maturation nor increased          apoptosis as measured by LIVEDEAD assay were apparent following Y treatment data          not shown Ultimately we were unable to document any explanation for the disparate          results of Y and DN ROCK                            Discussion        The isoprenoid pathway involves lipid modification of various members of the Rho family        of small GTPases by the addition of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties         Isoprenylation serves to target the GTPases to the proper organelle membrane where their        actions often relate to cytoskeletal dynamics andor vesicle trafficking  ROCKs are        important downstream targets of Rho Figure  catalyzing the phosphorylation of effector        phosphoprotein substrates  The foregoing data indicate that statininduced activation        of APP shedding in cultured cells involves the RhoROCK pathway More specifically the        data indicate that ROCK activation blocks the effects of statins on APP ectodomain        shedding while ROCK blockade alone can mimic the effect of statins on APP shedding By        extension these data predict that application of statins to neurons might directly or        indirectly inhibit ROCK activity Evaluation of this possibility will be the subject of        future investigation        The first evidence that APP might be a substrate for ectodomain shedding was provided by        Weidemann et al  who identified sAPP         in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood This aspect of APP metabolism        bears resemblance to the proteolytic signal transduction pathways involved in processing        proTGF  and Notch  In the case of Notch the process is set in motion by the        binding of a ligand to the Notch ectodomain triggering its release shedding For APP        intracellular signal transduction appears to be more important  In early studies        the existence of the shed ectodomain of APP was used to deduce the existence of the        proteolytic activity designated secretase which has the unusual specificity of cleaving        its substrates at a proscribed distance from the extracellular leaflet of the plasma        membrane  Ultimately the integral cellsurface metalloproteinases ADAM and        ADAMTACE were found to underlie secretasetype ectodomain shedding         Why is APP a substrate for ectodomain shedding To answer this question requires        contemplation of the physiological function of APP APP is a type  integral protein that        is subjected to a host of posttranslational processing events including N and        Oglycosylation tyrosyl sulfation phosphorylation and proteolysis  Most         newly synthesized APP is subjected to terminal intracellular degradation that        generates no discrete fragments  A smaller fraction of APP molecules approximately         in PC cells under basal conditions  undergoes ectodomain shedding catalyzed by either        the secretase nonamyloidogenic or secretase potentially amyloiodgenic pathway When        PKC is activated the stoichiometry of shed sAPP         rises from  mol shed per  mol synthesized to  mol shed per mole        synthesized Most of this shedding is catalyzed by the secretase pathway but a trace        amount   is catalyzed by secretasesite APP cleaving enzyme  sAPP         and sAPP         differ by the inclusion in sAPP         of the first  residues of A Unlike sAPP          which is generated at the plasma membrane most sAPP         is probably generated by cleavage within the         trans Golgi network and endocytic pathway vesicles HoloAPP levels are        likely limiting at one or more sorting steps in the late secretory pathway since activated        sAPP         shedding is apparently accompanied by diminished generation of sAPP                 What is the function of shed sAPP          Again from other molecules we know that shedding can serve        important cellular functions by releasing diffusible ligands from their membranebound        precursors eg TGF and TNF or by terminating intercellular signaling eg Notch A        popular model holds that sAPP         may function as a neurotrophic andor neuroprotective factor and may        promote neurite outgrowth  More recent evidence suggests that released APP derivatives        modulate efficacy of neurotransmission at the synapse  Targeted deletion of APP has        not revealed a striking phenotype  presumably because of functional redundancy        supplied by APPlike proteins  Mice with double and triple null mutations in various        combinations of APP APPlike protein  and APPlike protein  are now being created in        search of evidence for a definitive function for APP        Cao and Sudhof  have recently discovered that the APP Cterminal fragment generated        by  or secretase is itself cleaved to release A and an APP intracellular domain AICD        that diffuses into the nucleus possibly acting there as a transcription factor The        pathway leading to AICD must be initiated by ectodomain shedding holoAPP cannot directly        give rise to AICD Therefore one important function for  andor secretase processing        of APP may be the eventual generation of AICD Our results suggest that RhoROCK signaling        provides modulation of basal and stimulated secretase activity It will now be important        to dissect pathways upstream of RhoROCK signaling in order to identify the intracellular        and intercellular events that participate in RhoROCK regulation of secretase under        physiological and pathological conditions        The potential role of cholesterol in secretasemediated shedding was discovered by        Bodovitz and Klein  who used cyclodextrin to lower cellular cholesterol Kojro et al         confirmed this observation using not only cyclodextrin but also lovastatin to lower        cellular cholesterol These investigators proposed that elevated ADAM activity and        protein levels contributed to these effects These basic observations dovetailed with        emerging epidemiological evidence that administration of statins might lead to a diminished        incidence of Alzheimer disease  Despite this however the association of        statins and cholesterol levels with activated secretasemediated shedding of the APP        ectodomain was unexpected and not readily explicable by existing knowledge regarding        regulation of secretase activity The best characterized regulation of secretase        processing typically involves protein phosphorylation via PKC  or ERKs  or protein        dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase  or A  We recently excluded the possibility        that either PKC or ERK plays a role in statinactivated shedding  raising the        possibility that other protein phosphorylation signaling pathways might link statins andor        cholesterol to secretase activation        Maillet et al  implicated the Rho pathway in modulation of secretase activity        while dissecting the activated shedding process that accompanies serotonergic signal        transduction These investigators discovered that Rap acts through Rac to modulate        secretase processing of APP Soon thereafter ROCK was discovered by Zhou et al  to        modulate a downstream processing step in APP metabolism that involves        presenilinsecretasemediated proteolysis of APP Cterminal fragments C and C These        investigators discovered that activation of ROCK may account for how nonsteroidal        antiinflammatory drugs specify the scissile bond within the APP transmembrane domain that        is cleaved by presenilinsecretase to generate the Cterminus of A Based on these        reports we asked whether the RhoROCK pathway might play a role in controlling shedding of        sAPP         following statin application        CA ROCK and DN ROCK molecules yielded direct and complementary evidence that ROCK was        indeed a candidate for modulation of statinactivated secretase action Further we were        able to demonstrate that secretase activity could be modulated by molecules further        upstream in the isoprenoid pathway see Figure  FTI an inhibitor of farnesyl        transferase also known as L  mimicked and potentiated statinactivated        shedding presumably by blocking transfer of isoprenoid moieties to a Rho protein by        farnesyl transferase and thereby decreasing Rho activity However FTI treatment can        also increase the level of geranylgeranylated isoforms of certain Rho proteins eg the        inhibitory geranylgeranylated RhoB protein  In further support of a role for        isoprenoids we were able to demonstrate that supplementation of cells with mevalonate        abolished statinactivated shedding see Figure  Statins block HMGCoA reductase        generation of mevalonate from hydroxymethylglutarate see Figure  Therefore the        addition of mevalonate would be predicted to antagonize statin action via the isoprenoid        pathway by relieving statininduced mevalonate deficiency As predicted by this model we        observed that statinactivated shedding was abolished by adding mevalonate Taken together        these results suggest the existence of a reciprocal relationship between        isoprenoidmediated RhoROCK signaling and sAPP         shedding ie activation of ROCK blocks basal and stimulated        shedding while ROCK inhibition apparently relieves a tonic negative influence exerted on        shedding by ROCK activity        As in PKC and ERKactivated shedding the ROCK substrate effector molecule or        molecules that regulate proteolysis by ADAMs remain to be identified The cytoplasmic        domains of both APP and ADAM have been evaluated as candidates for important targets of        protein phosphorylation during the regulated shedding process but neither substrate        activation nor enzyme activation appears to explain the phenomenon ie        phosphorylation of neither APP nor ADAM dramatically increases the efficiency of        secretion  indicating that activation is more indirect        Our data using statins and PO localize the mediator of statinactivated shedding to the        plasma membrane upstream of endocytosis as appears to be the case for PKCactivated        shedding  Similar conclusions were drawn by Bosenberg and colleagues  who        used streptolysinporated cells and Nethylmaleimide to demonstrate that reconstitution of        activated shedding of TGF from CHO cells does not require membrane trafficking and        apparently occurs on the plasma membrane These results suggest that a tightly        membraneassociated regulatory subunit of the secretase complex is likely to be the key        phosphoprotein that mediates secretase activity as a function of its state of        phosphorylation by PKC and perhaps also ERK and ROCK The molecular identity of this        phosphoprotein remains unknown        Secretase activation is a potential therapeutic strategy for modifying cerebral        amyloidosis in Alzheimer disease  This proposal is supported by recent evidence that        either genetic modification of ADAMsecretase activity  or administration of        bryostatin a PKC activator  can modulate levels of brain A in plaqueforming        transgenic mice Secretase activation may explain how statins lower the risk for        Alzheimer disease  since atorvastatin diminishes A burden in plaqueforming        transgenic mice  If secretase stimulation is to be truly viable as a human clinical        intervention it will be essential to assess the possibility that enhanced APP ectodomain        shedding might incur mechanismbased toxicity analogous to the concerns currently        surrounding secretase inhibitors Along this line extension of this work to other shed        proteins will be important to determine the impact of enhanced shedding via ADAM        proteinases on other substrates of those proteinases including Notch proTGF proTNF        and CD         Preliminary results from a pilot proofofconcept using atorvastatin in a human clinical        treatment trial are consistent with the proposed beneficial effects of this class of        compounds  Since atorvastatin has low bloodbrain barrier permeability  this        beneficial effect if attributable to A lowering must be due to altered A metabolism in        the periphery Reduction in levels of free A in the circulation has been demonstrated to        lead to diminution in brain plaque burden following active or passive immunization  It        is conceivable that if statins lower circulating A this effect could secondarily cause        diffusion of central nervous system interstitial A down its concentration gradient and        into the cerebrospinal fluid and circulation from which it is cleared To date however        this mechanism is not supported by data from human clinical trials where statin        administration has shown no consistent effect on levels of circulating or cerebrospinal        fluid A         The results reported here point to several areas for additional investigation As        described above the key substrate or substrates linking cytoplasmic protein        phosphorylation to intralumenal or cellsurface protelysis remain to be identified        Nonetheless secretase activation has been validated as a viable therapeutic strategy for        modulating cerebral amyloidosis  Identification of the role of the RhoROCK pathway in        regulating secretase provides a new avenue for its therapeutic activation even though        the potential relevance of atorvastatinmediated ROCK inhibition in neurons may not        explain the apparent clinical benefits of the drug Still if the reported        diseasemodifying effect of atorvastatin is confirmed in the National Institute on Agings        large multicenter trial of simvastatin one or more compounds of this class may be among        the first diseasemodifying compounds approved by the Food and Drug Administration for        slowing the progression of Alzheimer
