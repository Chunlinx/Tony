                                 For Viewers Like You            In the early s even anovice channel surfer could tell when he had landed on PBS Thered be acheerful chef butchering a Cornish hen Muppets singing songs about friendshiptwo professors and a moderator seated in a barebones studio discussing racerelations a helmeted fat lady singing a Third Worlder criticizing the FirstWorld in a documentary and the lions of the Serengeti stalking an impalaherd            But afterthe manytendriled beast of cable TV conquered the American home the mlangeof chefs Muppets TV talk and prowling lions came to define not PBS but theact of channel surfing itself Of course video vaudeville wasnt the goal ofPBSs early architects the culture shapers at the Carnegie Commission and FordFoundation who dreamed that an infusion of federal funding would make the vastwasteland of television bloom How their dream cracked up resulting in thepablum of todays PBS and how PBS became Washingtons most politicallyskittish organization is the subject of James Ledbetters brief historyMade Possible By                 The Death of Public Broadcasting in the UnitedStates             Public TV was the runt of the postWorld War IItelecommunications litter But it was planned that way Commercial broadcastersbacked the Federal Communications Commission setaside of  coveted VHFlicenses and  UHF licenses nationwide for publicTV broadcasters but theydid so out of selfinterest Each frequency assigned to a noncommercial ownermeant one less competitor selling advertising For the same reasons CBSpledged a million grant for PBSs debut season but the industry blocked atevery turn the British model of a fullfledged public network financed with ahefty tax on televisions            Ledbetterargues that

Julia Child MisterRogers and Jim Lehrer have been slipping us subliminal military propagandasince the beginning Ledbetter doesnt develop his idea that the Cold Warriorscoopted PBS When the government starts any new enterprise it always taps themade guysnot the students of Herbert Marcuse In fact had the establishmentnot been present at PBSs creation in  President Johnsona commercialbroadcaster himself Lady Bird owned broadcast stations in Texaswould neverhave greenlighted it            PBS tookthe public broadcasting handoff from the Ford Foundation which along with theCarnegie Commission had long exhorted the United States to start a publicsystem The Ford Foundation seeded the publicTV idea with  million worthof grants between  and  in the hope that the feds would completelyunderwrite it thereafter just as cities routinely assume responsibility formuseums and libraries once philanthropists found them In the expansionistdays of the Great Society the idea of a governmentfinanced TV network devotedto education culture and politics wasnt that wild Looking back oneimagines that PBS could have evolved into an American BBC and secured the sortof government funding that didnt require the scrutiny of annual congressionalappropriations All this would have required was that its founding bureaucrats make the product seem as innocuous as a museum exhibit and  block theelection of Richard Nixon as president in  They failed on both counts            Instead in the early years of the publicTV experimentPBS which launched in  and NET which received no federal funds airedthe provocative programming they thought was their mission These unflinchingdocumentaries of the Vietnam War shows devoted to militant black politics andNaderesque consumer programs Nader even hosted a

more than he did the commercial networks but his veto over PBSsfunding and his power to appoint board members to the Corporation for PublicBroadcasting PBSs overseers gave him a direct outlet for his hate Hedefunded jawboned and intimidated the fledgling broadcaster and had he notbeen distracted by Watergate he surely would have dismembered it            Reduced by Washington politicians to

rightwingers think of PBS as liberaland lefties regard it as a corporateconservative tool Its neither and bothConflicted over what its true mission is PBS simultaneously whores forcorporate money and

Carnegies prayed PBS wouldspark Commercial channels pour programs down from the heavens that match orsurpass the products of the public broadcasters who are too cowed to produceanything as homoproud
