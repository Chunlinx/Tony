                    Introduction        IL is a proinflammataory cytokine that has myriad        effects on cells increasing proliferation activating        inflammatory responses and inducing matrix remodeling        through the production of neutral proteases Since most        cells can both express and respond to IL complex        signaling programs are likely required to modulate the        timing and magnitude of responses to this cytokine   It        is well documented that elevated expression of IL in the        joint results in the activation of inflammatory and        degradative programs in synovial cells contributing to the        progression of rheumatoid arthritis   Recent work by        Hasty and coworkers   has demonstrated that local        expression of IL by articular chondrocytes activates        autocrine gene expression which contributes to the        pathogenesis of osteoarthritis OA Furthermore        ILreceptor antagonists are effective inhibitors of        inflammation and connective tissue destruction in animal        models of arthritis     Together these studies        implicate IL as a central mediator of pathogenesis in        arthritis        Activation of this pathologic process is complex most        likely involving the activation or repression of numerous        signaltransduction pathways with subsequent effects on        many genes Our previous work has focused on the pathways        by which IL induces several members of the family of        matrix metalloproteinases MMPs enzymes that are active        at neutral pH and that collectively degrade the various        components of the extracellular matrix Specifically we        have focused on MMP and MMP interstitial collagenases        that have the unique ability to initiate cleavage of the        triple helix comprising the stromal collagens types I II        and III Elevated expression of MMP and MMP by stromal        cells and chondrocytes in response to IL contributes to        the pathogenesis of connective tissue disorders               Studies from this laboratory and others showed        that IL activates MMP and MMP gene expression        through common signaling pathways              Specifically nuclear translocation of NFB and        mitogenactivated protein kinase MAPK stimulation of        activator protein AP are required for transcription        of cytokineinduced MMP and MMP Furthermore        cycloheximide blocks mRNA expression of both collagenases           indicating that expression of immediate early        genes is required for MMP and MMP gene expression        Thus IL activation of collagenase gene expression        requires the increased expression of a panel of essential        transcription factors and signaling intermediates as well        as the initiation of signaling cascades that activate these        factors        IL also contributes to the pathogenesis of arthritis        by increasing the proliferation of mesenchymal cells and by        enhancing the expression of other inflammatory mediators            This complex alteration in cellular phenotype        probably involves the coordinated increase and decrease of        genes for cytokines and growth factors adhesion molecules        and signaling intermediates The recent availability of        microarray technology has made it possible to perform an        extensive analysis of IL modulation of genes in cells        that are central players in arthritic disease        We therefore carried out a microarray analysis of        ILstimulated chondrocytic cells in order to identify        immediate early genes that could contribute to phenotypic        changes relevant to OA In these studies we used the human        chondrosarcoma cell line SW for three important        reasons First we and others have found that when        treated with IL SW cells serve as an appropriate        model for primary chondrocytes in OA             Second the amount of total RNA required for microarray        analysis precludes the use of primary human chondrocytes        for these studies Third the inherent genetic variation in        primary human chondrocyte cultures could bias the gene        expression profile and lead to erroneous conclusions We        found increased expression of a large cohort of        transcription factors cytokines growth factors and        signaling intermediate genes that are potential regulators        of metalloproteinase gene expression proliferation and        sustained inflammation Alternatively this was accompanied        by a decrease in a modest number of genes also belonging to        these categories suggesting that IL substantially        reprograms gene expression in chondrocytes A subset of        these ILstimulated genes was then confirmed by        semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain        reaction RTPCR This characterization of ILinduced        immediate early genes in chondrocytic cells identifies        candidate mediators of the expression of collagenase genes        in arthritis                    Materials and methods                  Cell culture          SW chondrosarcoma cells were grown to confluence          in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium supplemented with           fetal bovine serum Hyclone Logan UT USA          penicillinstreptomycin and Lglutamine Cellgro          Mediatech Herndon VA USA At the beginning of each          experiment cells were washed three times with Hanks          buffered sterile saline Cellgro to remove traces of          serum and were placed in Dulbeccos modified Eagles          medium containing  lactalbumin hydrolysate          GibcoBRL Rockville MD USA Then cells were either          left unstimulated or treated with  ngml recombinant          IL Promega Madison WI USA This concentration of          IL was found to be optimal for activation of MMP          gene expression in these cells data not shown                          Harvest and microarray analysis of mRNA          For microarray analysis two confluent mm plates          of SW cells were cultured in lactalbumin hydrolysate          or lactalbumin hydrolysate plus  ngml IL for           hours Cells were then washed with Hanks buffered          sterile saline solution and homogenized in  ml Triazol          Reagent GibcoBRL and RNA was purified in accordance          with the manufacturers instructions The RNA pellets          were stored in  ethanol and shipped on dry ice to          Clontech Laboratories Palo Alto CA USA via express          courier Clontech analyzed the RNA using their Atlas          Human Cancer  K array  unique genes and          AtlasImage  software We chose this data baseline          because it represents a large number of genes that may be          expressed during development and again during disease          pathology We further classified genes that increased or          decreased by twofold or more and sorted them using          Microsoft Excel                          Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain          reaction          A subset of genes whose expression was increased by          IL was then confirmed using a radioactive RTPCR          assay Briefly RNA was treated with DNAse I and then           g was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia          virus reverse transcriptase and oligodT primers One          tenth of the reverse transcriptase reaction was amplified          using genespecific primers Platinum Taq DNA polymerase          and PdATP Singleband products were resolved on native          acrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography Table          shows the genespecific primers that were used                            Results and discussion        Table shows the results of an analysis using Clontechs        Human Cancer  K Array and total RNA from SW cells        treated with IL  ngml for  hours This analysis        revealed substantial increases or decreases in the        expression of several known ILresponsive genes These        include transcription factors panel A cytokines growth        factors and their receptors panel B proteases matrix        proteins and adhesion molecules panel C as well as        signaling intermediates and tumor suppressors panel        D        We focused on genes for transcription factors because        they have been reported as ILresponsive immediate early        genes in chondrocytes   Members of the NFB AP        and ets families of transcription factors substantially        increased in the Human Cancer  K array see Table         panel A To confirm the effect of IL on AP family        members we assayed Jun family members by RTPCR Fig         We found that the cJun and JunB genes increased        transiently within  hour of IL treatment before the        induction of the MMP gene The expression profiles for        cJun and JunB were similar to the profile for egr        another immediate early gene in ILstimulated        chondrocytes   In contrast the JunD gene was        constitutively expressed and IL increased this        expression modestly These data show that in        ILstimulated chondrocytes all three Jun family members        are expressed and can contribute to MMP gene expression        Furthermore RTPCR analysis of the JunB gene Fig         validated the gene expression profile derived from the        Human Cancer  K array Table  panel A        Transcription factor genes that were modulated by IL        included members from the NFB family relB pp        pp IB crel and p the AP family fra        and junB and the ETS family ets While it is well        established that NFB proteins translocate to the nucleus        upon IL stimulation   we were surprised to find so        many family members expressed simultaneously This suggests        that in ILstimulated chondrocytes NFB family members        may compete for dimerization partners and for binding sites        in responsive genes        Members of the AP family of transcription factors are        essential transcriptional activators for both the MMP and        MMP genes     and these transcription factors        are activated by extracellular stimuli through MAPK        pathways   JunB was identified as an ILinducible        gene in chondrocytes by the Human Cancer  K array Table         and this finding was confirmed by RTPCR Fig         Levels of JunB mRNA peaked within  hour of IL        stimulation and began to decline after  hours This was        somewhat surprising since MAPK pathways do not activate        JunB   and in some systems JunB antagonizes        transcriptional activation by cJun   Since cJun        JunB and JunD are all expressed in ILtreated SW        chondrocytic cells it is not clear which family member is        responsible for transcriptional activation of collagenase        genes Perhaps the functional transcriptional complex is        determined by induced expression and activation of AP        accessory proteins such as the Fos family member Fra or        the ets family member ets   This cohort of AP        Fos and ets family members may also preferentially bind to        different AP sites in MMP promoters with subtle effects        on gene expression          egr is an ILinducible immediate early gene in        chondrocytes   and has been implicated in the elevated        MMP gene expression observed in rheumatoid synoviocytes           Surprisingly egr expression was increased only        fold in this Human Cancer  K array data not shown        However when this gene was analyzed by RTPCR we found a        robust increase in egr mRNA within  hour of IL        stimulation which declined significantly by  hours Fig         Thus the relatively short halflife of egr mRNA        resulted in an underestimation of IL induction of this        gene in the microarray It is therefore probable that an        array using RNA from cells treated for  hour with IL        would identify additional important genes        IL repressed three transcription factor genes        including HOXA the retinoblastomalike protein  and        mothers against dpp homologue  SMAD SMAD contributes        to transforming growth factor TGFdependent        transcription of the alpha Icollagen COLA   and        aggrecan   genes Furthermore our microarray data        demonstrated that IL inhibited ColA expression by        fold in SW cells data not shown It has been        reported that IL inhibition of ColA gene expression        requires the p MAPK pathway   Perhaps inhibition of        SMAD synthesis is another component of ILdependent        ColA gene repression While IL promotes cartilage        degradation through MMP synthesis and inhibits matrix        deposition by reducing ColA gene expression TGF has        the opposite effect on chondrocytes   Thus it is        tempting to speculate that IL antagonizes the effects of        TGF by blocking expression of essential signaling        intermediates such as SMAD        Cytokines and growth factors and their receptors were a        major group of ILmodulated genes in chondrocytes Table         panel B For instance leukemia inhibitor factor        precursor LIF was substantially induced by IL in        SW cells and this is consistent with previous reports        of LIF as an ILresponsive gene in chondrocytes           Recently LIF was reported to induce MMP gene        expression   and this may contribute to the role of        this cytokine in arthritis pathology   IL expression        was increased in ILtreated cells and while this may        affect a variety of cellular functions in chondrocytes        this cytokine does not seem to be required for ILinduced        suppression of proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage          Interestingly there was a concurrent increase in        expression of plateletderived growth factor PDGF        subunits and a decrease in PDGF receptor subunits Perhaps        this is a mechanism of ensuring paracrine but not        autocrine effects of PDGF in cytokinestimulated        chondrocytes The role of growth factors in ILdependent        effects is not clear cut since IL can both induce and        inhibit proliferation of chondrocytes   However in        the present model of SW cells under serumfree        conditions we did not observe a mitogenic effect of IL        data not shown        Bone morphogenetic protein  BMP is a member of the        TGF superfamily of proteins and is required for        chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage maintenance           The observed suppression of its expression in        chondrocytes by IL Table  panel B is consistent with        a previous report in osteoblastic cells   and suggests        that IL may enhance cartilage degradation by blocking an        essential autocrine signal for chondrocyte maturation and        function        IL induction of several MMP family members is seen        including collagenase MMP matrilysin MMP and        metalloelastase MMP Table  panel C The        collagenase MMP gene was not significantly induced in        this array and this is consistent with our previous        findings that MMP is expressed at lower levels than        MMP in SW cells   Furthermore the magnitude of        increase observed for these MMP genes was modest despite        the fact that MMP genes are strongly induced in response to        IL However the most likely explanation for the low        level of induction seen here is the fact that MMPs are not        early response genes Rather they are the downstream        targets of the signaltransduction pathways and        transcription factors that do represent early responses        Indeed RTPCR confirmed that MMP mRNA continues to        increase  hours after IL treatment Fig  This is        consistent with our previously published finding that        steadystate MMP mRNA levels peak  hours after IL        treatment of chondrocytes          Tenascin an adhesion molecule that is expressed during        cartilage development   was induced by IL in SW        cells Table  panel C Interestingly the tenascin gene        has been reported to be ILinducible in synovial cells        and chondrocytes and its expression is enhanced in        rheumatoid arthritis and OA    A possible        physiologic consequence of ILinduced tenascin        expression is that it may promote chondrocyte migration        towards the sites of lesions in OA   IL        coordinately reduced expression of integrin a a        celladhesion molecule that chondrocytes use to bind to        type II collagen   Thus IL treatment may modify        adhesion molecule expression so that matrix adhesion is        compromised        We found that IL changed the expression levels for        several signaling proteins and tumor suppressor genes        Table  panel D but the significance of these changes        is not clear Proteins associated with Gprotein signaling        were both increased rho Gem and regulator of G protein        signaling and decreased rho RAD and pROCK        Jagged which is a transmembrane ligand for the Notch        signaling pathway   is induced by IL        Interestingly jagged is important for        epithelialmesenchymal cell interaction in development          and mutations in the jagged gene lead to Alagille        syndrome a congenital connective tissue disorder whose        hallmarks include craniofacial and vertebral deformities          Zhao and colleagues   identified frizzled denoted        FZD as the human homologue of the         Drosophila polaritydetermining gene        Of potential importance is the fact that frizzled family        members have recently been implicated by Carson and        colleagues in rheumatoid arthritis   A new frizzled        family member that is expressed in chondrocytes and is        involved in skeletal morphogenesis has been described          Perhaps downregulation of frizzled family members by        IL is deleterious to chondrocyte function and can        contribute to OA                    Conclusions        Along with confirming changes in gene expression already        known to be associated with IL stimulation chondrocyte        biology and MMP gene regulation this microarray        identified several other induced and repressed genes whose        roles in chondrocyte biology are yet to be defined While        the significance of these findings in terms of        understanding IL effects on chondrocytes is still        uncertain the documentation of these changes in gene        expression may provide the basis for future studies on the        molecular effects of IL on chondrocytes and on other cell        types as well                    Abbreviations
