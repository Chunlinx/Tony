culture from the late th to themid th century a period when the pursuit of improved looks wastransformed from a matter of folk recipes whispered from woman to woman to amultibillion dollar industry In

For the past three decades feminists have been accusingthe beauty industry of fiendishly sophisticated campaigns to undercut womensselfworth A century ago no one could have imagined that beauty could beanything as faceless as an industry let alone one capable of a broad socialagenda In the late  th century beauty connoting as it didindividual service and the laying on of hands was considered a trade toovulgar for respectable people It was a lowclass penny ante affair thereforean excellent opportunity for immigrants and blacks There were men in thefield but women had the edge They could claim to use the products themselvesand other women trusted them The women who rose to the top invented flamboyantpersonas to go with their stepbystep systems but they came from distinctlyunglamorous

forhussies The solution was to tie makeup to the freedoms women were beginning toenjoy The New Woman who worked in the city or went to college or justthought of herself as modern needed and deserved a new face for the world justas she needed and deserved the right to work and vote            Womeneagerly embraced the idea that changing their faces would change their socialstatus The new consumers of beauty products wrote to manufacturers that theyapplied rouge lipstick and mascara for their own pleasure not that of theirmen Men were more likely to oppose makeup than demand it and often forbadetheir wives and girlfriends to use it            The second problem was access to capital and to storeshelves Bankers and distributors were generally loath to do business with thegentler sex The cosmetics queens solved this problem by exploiting theirintimacy with their customers During the first quarter of the century thebeauty industry advanced new sales techniques emphasizing personal contactdoortodoor and mailorder marketing beauty schools and correspondencecourses lines of cosmetics tied to salons Malone and Walker were particularlyadept at what is known today as multilevel

culture of celebrity andunified standards of feminine beauty Suddenly there was a look and everyonehad to have it Whereas once beauty practices had had an appealingly informalkitchen quality now skin

participating inthe wider American culture Making up became an mandatory act of conformityand by the time the womens movement began to address it of oppression            This is the resentfulperception so many mainstream feminists seem stuck in today When Susan Faludiand Naomi Wolf for instance talk about the beauty industry they sound likesuspicious middleclass ladies eyeing a Chanel counter at Sakstheyll resistthose foreign wiles But as Peiss excellent research demonstrates the cultureof beauty isnt all big corporations and victimized customers Even during thes the height of American conformism women consistently ranked advice frommothers sisters and friends as more likely to drive their buying decisionsthan advertising Nowadays lefty female academics dress as white
