A Brief HISTORYI s it history or blarney to suggest that St Brendan a sixthcentury monk from Galway was the first European to reach Canada The good people of Newfoundland where he is said to have landed like to think he was After all on his return he told of being attacked by insects as big as chickens Of course say the Newfies they must have been our giant mosquitoesA more serious claim is made for the Vikings who seem to have sailed to the coast from Greenland around the year  That is the carbon dating of tools and utensils the vestiges of houses and workshops and even an iron foundry dug up at LAnse aux Meadows on the northern tip of NewfoundlandThis takes some of the wind out of the sails of John Cabot the Venetian navigator who claimed Canadas eastern seaboard for Englands Henry VII in  Locals fight over whether it was Nova Scotia or Newfoundland he actually discovered Cabot himself mistook it for the northeast coast of Asia In fact Breton Basque and Portuguese fishermen had been here long before him but kept to themselves the secret of the coastal waters teeming cod fisheries Initially the English were attracted to Canada only by the fish preferring to concentrate their colonizing activities farther down the American coastThe French came looking for gold and diamonds spices and a passage to Asia In  Jacques Cartier ventured up the St Lawrence as far as Hochelaga Village dominated by a hill he named Mont Ral Mount Royal Cartier was not exactly showered with honors when he returned with eleven barrels of worthless yellow iron pyrites and glittering quartz For the next  years Canada was all but ignored until the French turned to the more lucrative new fur tradeThe strange European comings and goings were observed by native peoples whose ancestors had preceded these discoverers by at least  some of them  years Waves of Siberian hunters had crossed a land bridge over the Bering Strait in pursuit of mammoth and bison They spread through Alaska south along the Pacific coast to the region of British Columbia and later east across the Yukon and Northwest TerritoriesNew FranceWith no written culture to document it the preEuropean history of the Inuit and other early peoples is a vague archaeological patchwork of bones stones and artifacts Their brief encounters with Atlantic fishermen left little impact but the advent of French and later British colonizers brought in exchange for their beaver pelts copper kettles and guns blankets and brandy Christianity measles and smallpoxAfter winters on the Bay of Fundy had proved too harsh Samuel de Champlain and his first batch of French settlers left Nova Scotia and moved over to the St Lawrence River in  Within ten years both tenant farmers habitants and fur traders coureurs de bois literally woodrunners were colonizing QubecNew Franceat the point where the river narrowsTo guarantee each habitant equal access to the waterfront the farmland was divided into long narrow strips reaching down to the riverbanks Local conditions were exploited with traditional French ingenuity Manure for instance was shipped downriver by heaping it on ice floes during the spring thaw Tough coureurs de bois sought furs from the Huron in Ontario and Algonquin in Qubec quickly learning language and customs and even marrying into the tribesMeanwhile the huge untapped fur resources of northern Qubec and Ontario attracted the renewed attention of the British In  navigator Henry Hudson thought he had located the fabled Northwest Passage for his London backers when rounding the northern tip of Qubec and heading south he hoped to China he found himself locked in a vast bay on which he left his life and name Over  years later the bay was explored by two enterprising Frenchmen Pierre Esprit Radisson and Mdard Chouart des Groseilliers known to AngloCanadian schoolchildren as Radishes and Gooseberries Exasperated by the cost of the haul to Qubec and by the heavy taxes imposed on fur pelts they sought a new outlet for the fur trade Fearing a commercial threat to the St Lawrence River the governor in Qubec opposed their survey of the regionThis decision proved to be the beginning of the end for New France for Radisson and Groseilliers promptly sold their idea to British merchants who in  founded the Hudsons Bay Company Charles II granted this tentacular private jointstock company control of all territories draining into Hudson Bay they were named Ruperts Land after the kings cousin who was also titular head of the company Its initials HBC came to mean Here before Christ It was here to stayThe first British fur traders were much less adventurous than the French waiting for the Indians to bring their pelts to the trading post rather than seeking them out in the forest The coureurs de bois were more adapted to the wilderness and understood the Indians better From them they learned to make swift light birchbark canoes snowshoes and pemmicana ghastly but nourishing mixture of buffalo fat with bits of dried meat and berries The French also offered higherquality goods The HBC was a pennypincher and Indians soon spottedand spat outits raw London gin tinctured with iodine to imitate French brandyBut Britain backed this vested interest with tough diplomacy and a powerful navy while Louis XIV was too wrapped up in his European power plays to pay much attention to French Canada Although the British made no military conquests here during the War of Spanish Succession  their negotiators forced the French in the ensuing Treaty of Utrecht to give up all of Acadia Nova Scotia except Cape Breton There the French fortress of Louisbourg which defended the sea approaches to Qubec was seized by the British in  It was returned four years later in diplomatic negotiations only to fall once and for all in  in an assault mounted from the new British naval base of Halifax In the final struggle for Qubec the courageous French military commander Marquis de Montcalm led outnumbered troops to a victory at Ticonderoga But poorly coordinated with local Canadian militia they lost the city of Qubec in  to Britains General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham Both Montcalm and Wolfe were killed in the battleThe French army burned its flags and sailed home followed by most of the merchants and colonial leaders leaving the habitants to fend for themselves After  years of courageous struggle against the harsh Canadian wilderness New France was abandoned the old country displaying a cruel lack of enthusiasm for what Voltaire dismissed as quelques arpens de neigea few acres of snow The British Take OverAt first British immigrants did not exactly flock to Canada either Governor James Murray sympathized with the Qubcois whose bravery he much admired Although the established church was now Anglican Catholic privileges and tithes were restored These were enshrined in the Qubec Act of  which also maintained French civil law alongside British criminal law and gave French Catholics seats on an appointed governmental council But when American revolutionaries invaded Qubec in  in the hope of winning the FrenchCanadians over to their cause the latter did not rally to the British side until the American soldiers started taking the habitants livestock and suppliesWhen American Independence was declared some  LoyalistsNew Englanders and Germans from Pennsylvania but also some Indians and black African slavesmoved north to Canada The most resilient settled on Prince Edward Island and in Nova Scotia around the Bay of Fundy while a majority migrated to Niagara and the Eastern Townships in southern QubecTo cope with the rival claims of Loyalists and Qubcois the Constitutional Act of  divided the colony into Upper Canada Ontario and Lower Canada Qubec separated by the Ottawa River Under lieutenant governors each province had a parliamentary system modeled on the Houses of Commons and Lords while Lower Canadas French language and civil and religious institutions were safeguardedThe land west of Ontario was written off as one big empty wilderness until Alexander Mackenzie completed the first transcontinental crossing and Simon Fraser and David Thompson mapped out the rivers and mountains of British Columbia and the Rockies The Hudsons Bay Company fought for control of the fur trade with the North West Company which formed in  The Norwesters commandeered the French system of forts depots and canoe brigades they intermarried with native peoples and produced new clans of socalled Mtis After years of fierce armed struggle for trading posts around Hudson Bay and lakes Winnipeg and Superior the Norwesters threw in their lot with the HBC bringing a wilder more imaginative spirit to the staid old companyWith great pioneering skill Upper Canadas first lieutenant governor John Simcoe pushed new highways north from Lake Ontario and west to Hamilton He established the provincial capital at a trading post Toronto in the heart of a malarial swamp and renamed it York A landed gentry made up of army officers government officials and commercial speculators ran the province creating a hereditary aristocracy known as the Family Compact More Americans were lured over the border with land grants the population rose from  in  to  by  FrenchCanadians were also multiplying rapidly from  when New France was abandoned in  to  fifty years laterCanada bore the brunt of US hostility in the War of  The Americans were convinced that the British were backing Indian raids on American settlements along the Canadian border Congress called for nothing less than the conquest of Canada but MajorGeneral Isaac Brocks tiny Canadian force allied with Chief Tecumsehs Shawnee Indians routed a halfhearted American invasion along the Niagara frontier The Americans burned and looted York provoking a violent British reprisal raid on WashingtonThough greatly outnumbered Anglo and FrenchCanadians fought victoriously side by side at Chteauguay But after the war the militia of LouisJoseph Papineaus patriotes became the backbone of growing antiBritish agitation With British immigration on the increase Qubcois autonomy was threatened by moves towards one government for Lower and Upper Canada Landowners such as Papineau feared being swamped by projected improvements of the St Lawrence trade route In the general paranoia the patriotes even accused the British of fostering Qubecs  cholera epidemic Papineau asked London for guarantees of autonomy for a Lower Canada assembly dominated by FrenchCanadians British rejection in  led to riots opposing patriotes and British militia After a victory at StDenis the FrenchCanadians were crushed by Governor John Colbornes troops north of Montral Habitants farmhouses were burned down earning Colborne the nickname of Old Firebrand Vieux Brlot and defeat left an even more enduring bitterness than the original British conquest Papineau fled to the United StatesIn the same year hatred of the highhanded Tory oligarchy in Upper Canada provoked a rebellion among small farmers and tradesmen beset by economic depression Their champion newspaper editor and first mayor of Toronto William Lyon Mackenzie proposed a USstyle republic Heeding his call of Up them brave Canadians get ready your rifles and make short work of it a few hundred irregulars gathered at Montgomerys Tavern north of Toronto But a Tory militia led by bagpipes put down the socalled Mackenzie Rebellion in a skirmish lasting just a few minutes Short work indeedGovernor General Radical Jack Durham was sent to put the house in order he proposed a unified assembly governing Canadas domestic affairs He scorned the Qubcois for retaining their peculiar language and manners They are a people with no history and no literature But Lower Canadas pragmatic LouisHippolyte Lafontaine accepted the British framework as a means of asserting the Qubcois right to equal representation In the new United Provinces of Canada set up in  he formed a delicate alliance with Toronto reformer Robert Baldwin Immigration increased to meet an ambitious public works program of canals to bypass the St Lawrence rapids and cross the Niagara peninsula as well as of new cities mines and roadsBut the big news was railways The first in  was the Champlain and St Lawrence Railroad a few miles of track between Montral and Lake Champlain By  more than  miles joined Niagara and Windsor The dream of a transcontinental railway with freight revenues drew financiers to the Grand Trunk project to join up Montral the Great Lakes and the western hinterland But initially they had to content themselves with luring American trade to the St Lawrence by linking eastern Canadian cities to Portland MaineChoosing a permanent capital for these United Provinces wasnt easy In the perennial AngloFrench conflict bilingual Montral was too troublesome while Englishspeaking Toronto or Frenchspeaking Qubec City would favor one community at the expense of the other Royal Engineer officers sent watercolors of likely sites for Queen Victorias approval The choice went to Bytown a puny lumber depot renamed Ottawa after the river on which it stood diplomatically situated between Upper and Lower CanadaTo the east and remote from the centers of power the people of Newfoundland and the Maritime Provinces lived in small isolated communities with no unifying geography comparable to the Great Lakes or St Lawrence River Newfoundland turned its back on the hostile interior to reap the harvests of the sea Always psychologically closer to London than to Ottawa Newfoundland did not become part of Canada until  Yankee Loyalists struggled valiantly with a region they called Nova Scarcity The British had scattered Nova Scotias French Acadians some to the nearby islands of St Pierre and Miquelon still French today others as far as Louisiana while a small nucleus remained in New Brunswick The potential of Prince Edward Islands fertile soil was squandered by absentee land speculators who milked it only for the rent and left the settlers no motivation to develop itEven farther away the west was still administered as a separate empire by the HBC until gold discovered on Queen Charlotte Island in  and on the Fraser River six years later prompted Britain to set up a new colony to control the influx of unruly American fortunehunters The companys chief officer James Douglas became first governor of British Columbia The company kept upper Canadian farmers from migrating to the Prairies by depicting a subArctic wasteland but British surveyors found the valleys of the Saskatchewan Assiniboine and Red rivers to be fertile and ideal for agriculture The western trek began The nation was taking shapeConfederationThe British North America Act of  created the Dominion of Canada John A Macdonald an Ontario Tory was the first Prime Minister To resist a turbulent United States torn by civil war AngloCanadians wanted a strong central government delegating little more than municipal affairs to the provinces FrenchCanadians insisted on a federal system with stronger provincial governments to protect specific Qubcois interests in property and civil rights Henceforth national unity always played second fiddle to ethnic religious and above all economic regional interestsOnly the promise of a transcontinental railway brought Nova Scotia immediately into the Confederation with British Columbia joining in  and Prince Edward Island in  Ruperts Land was bought from the HBC in  but incorporating Manitoba was not so easy Led by Louis Riel Mtis descendants of Indians and French fur traders waged an armed struggle for land rights on the Red River in the face of the expansionhungry railway builders An impassioned politician as well as a fiery military leader Riel won local AngloSaxon support for his proposed Manitoba Act guaranteeing equal French and English language rights in school and church But the execution of a troublemaker from Toronto brought in a retaliatory force of Ontario troops and Riel fled to the United States The Mtis were driven off their fertile land and back to hunting on the plainsThe railway literally created new cities like Winnipeg and Vancouver which was the western terminus Against all the experts advice the Canadian Pacific Railway Companys general manager William Cornelius Van Horne built tracks around Lake Superior and west across the Prairies to meet Andrew Onderdonks Chinese laborers working their way east through Kicking Horse Pass in the Rockies The transcontinental dream became reality when the tracks were joined in  But along the way scores of laborers had died hacking through the mountains buffalo were exterminated and Indians and Mtis were dispossessed of their landsThese were booming times Less spectacular than the completion of the CPR but economically vital the first hydroelectric installation began functioning on Niagara Falls in  A year later gold was struck in the Klondike opening up the Yukon to  panhandlers and camp followers The Prairie Provinces profited from soaring worldwide wheat exportsPresiding over this new prosperity was the countrys first FrenchCanadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier an elegant eloquent Liberal Completely bilingual he was determined to forge Anglo and FrenchCanadians into one nation comparing them to the waters of the Ottawa river and Great Lakes meeting below the island of Montral parallel separate distinguishable and yet one stream flowing within the same banks Visiting London for Queen Victorias Diamond Jubilee he charmed his hosts by declaring I am British to the core He was knighted on the spotBut Laurier saw the limits of British support when the British and American negotiators of the Alaska boundary tamely accepted the US claims to a southern coastal panhandle which denied Canada sea access to the Yukon goldfields He asserted greater national autonomy by taking over British military installations and shipyards at Esquimalt on Vancouver Island and Halifax Nova Scotia When Alberta and Saskatchewan acceded to provincial status in  and the countrys mining lumber paper and pulp industries burgeoned Laurier championed a new transcontinental railway that would take a more northerly route to serve themthe stateowned Canadian National Railway CNRLauriers conciliatory efforts did not diminish AngloFrench Canadian differences Conflicts raged over the denial of equal rights to Catholic schools in Manitoba and a Prohibition referendum blocked only by winedrinking Qubcois The Qubcois were slow to jump on the wagon of industrial progress Political leader Henri Bourassa and influential editor JulesPaul Tardivel insisted on timehonored rural traditions Our mission is to possess the soil they said not to pursue American obsessions with industry and money They resented the sending of Canadian troops to South Africa to support the British in the Boer War and were no more enthusiastic about the AngloFrench alliance in World War I Bourassa said The real enemies of FrenchCanadians are not the Germans but EnglishCanadian anglicizers the Ontario intriguers or Irish priestsThe Twentieth CenturyUnder Tory government the country supported Britain with  men in World War I losing over  on the battlefield Emotional European nationalism spread to Canada Citizens of German and Austrian origin were dismissed from public service the German language was banned in schools and Berlin in Ontario was renamed KitchenerBut the war was good for the economy supporting arms manufacture the railways and especially agricultures huge wheat exports Trade union membership expanded from  in  to  in  being emphatically more radical in the west where workers chose to assert their new organizational strength by calling for a proletarian revolution In Vancouver and Calgary they cheered the Bolshevik victory in Russia The government blamed the  general strike in Winnipeg on enemy aliens but the leaders were in fact British immigrants In classic Canadian style the campaign for a united national union movement fell victim to narrow regional interests those of Ontarios tiny Communist Party and the Catholic Union in QubecWilliam Lyon Mackenzie King who became leader of the Liberal Party after Lauriers death made Canada progressively more independent of Britain At the Imperial Conference of  he won the acknowledgement that Canada was autonomous in external affairs and thus not subject to a common Britishdominated policy for the whole Empire This led to the  Statute of Westminster which effected the equality of Britain and the Dominions thus consecrating Canadas full autonomy in home and foreign affairs The governor general in Ottawa became the symbolic representative of the Crown rather than of the British government But the provinces insisted that the Constitution remain with London rather than let Ottawa infringe on their prerogativesAt the same time the country came more and more into the American economic and cultural orbit The boom years of the s saw the growth of a branchplant economy with American automobile rubber chemical and clothing factories springing up around the Great Lakes at Hamilton Oshawa Windsor and Montral The boom in American popular culture inundated Canada with radio movies and massmarket magazines Qubec in particular tried to resist the invasion even going so far as to ban adolescents from cinemas Apart from the Group of Seven a spirited band of Ontario painters who were seeking a distinctive national style most Canadianborn artistsactors musicians and writersfelt obliged to seek fame and fortune in New York London or ParisCanadas Great Depression was felt first by farmers in the Prairie Provinces unable to get rid of their surplus from the wheat glut of  Even the drought in  did not ease matters and ten more years of bad harvests meant they would not recoup their losses Other sectors of the economytimber fisheries mining and constructionground to a halt as production outstripped demand Spirits were raised by the escapist fare of the new Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission todays CBCHollywood extravaganzas and homegrown media stunts not the least of which was the hullabaloo surrounding the Dionne quintuplets born in Ontario in TransCanada Airlines the forerunner of Air Canada started up in  and air travel became vital for covering the vast distances fighting forest fires and carrying provisions and wages to remote corners of the far north Natural enough then that involvement in World War II began with a British Commonwealth Air Training Plan using Canadas safer skies to prepare pilots for combat At the outbreak of war Canadas reputation for welcoming immigrants and refugees from all over the world was tarnished by the blocking of Communists and Jews from Hitlers Germany Asked how many he would allow in Justice Minister Ernest Lapointe said None is too many After  citizens of Japanese origin were interned and had their property confiscatedIn  Mackenzie King and Franklin D Roosevelt signed a joint AmericanCanadian defense pact and a year later integrated their countries economies for the duration of the war War was again good for business Out of a population of  more than a million were directly working in warallied industries most of them in brandnew factories Over  men and women served in the armed forces which suffered  losses In  without adequate Allied naval and air support the highrisk amphibious raid of  Canadian troops on Dieppe proved disastrous almost  killed  captured With more careful Allied planning a year later Canadians played a distinguished role in the Sicily landings and Italy campaign as well as the DDay invasion of Normandy in Social policies made important advances during and immediately after the war In  Saskatchewan elected the first socialist government in North Americathe Cooperative Commonwealth Federation CCF The Liberal government responded by appropriating much of the CCFs reform program But native peoples and Inuit did not win the right to vote in federal elections until Economically the country was closer than ever to the United States The consumer boom accentuated dependency on Americas Canadabased branchplant manufacturers of cars radios TVs and refrigerators The United States was also Canadas main customer for raw materials and energy in what was a veritable explosion of industrial achievement North Manitoba nickel and Labrador iron were replacing depleted resources south of the border huge oil strikes were made near Edmonton Alberta in  a uranium reactor started up in Ontario in  and hydroelectric plants mushroomed all across the country The St Lawrence Seaway was opened in  Six years later drivers could cross the entire continent on the TransCanada HighwayThe national culture fared less well A Royal Commission on the Arts and Letters was spurned by Prime Minister Louis St Laurent as a futile body for subsidizing ballet dancers While there was more cultural aid promised than ever delivered one positive result was the foundation of the highly creative National Film BoardBalancing domestic interests and relations with the American neighbor became increasingly delicate The first Prime Minister from one of the Prairie Provinces Saskatchewan Tory John Diefenbaker made himself popular with the farmers by negotiating a sale of wheat surplus to China that tripled their incomesbut unpopular with his American neighbor for doing business with the Communist devil In the wake of the  Cuban missile crisis with the Soviet Union the United States wanted Diefenbaker to accept nuclear warheads on Canadian soil President John Kennedy attacked Diefenbakers hesitation and prevarication and the Prime Minister was defeated at the next election after the Canadian Liberals had jumped on the American bandwagonCanada celebrated its centenary in  with a Worlds Fair the Montreal Expo It was an opportunity to assert a more creative side of Qubecs identity amid the provinces growing militancy Parallel to the worldwide independence movements in the s Qubcois separatists fought elections demanding to be matres chez nous masters in our own home  In  De Gaulle declaimed his famous Vive le Qubec libre Long live free Qubec from Montral City Hall forgetting for a moment that FrenchCanadian leaders had sided with his Vichy enemies during World War IIAs a progressive minister of justice who reformed laws against homosexuality divorce birth control and abortion Pierre Elliott Trudeau was sympathetic to the FrenchCanadians demand to have their language placed on an equal national footing with English But this sophisticated bilingual Montral lawyer opposed what he regarded as Qubecs tribalistic urge to exclude all things English from its own province Elegant witty and cosmopolitan Trudeau became Liberal Prime Minister in and like Wilfrid Laurier before him just the kind of FrenchCanadian that AngloCanadians love The Qubcois were less enthusiastic With the introduction of the birthcontrol pill the provinces birthrate dropped from the highest to lowest in the nation causing conservatives to worry at the waning influence of the Catholic Church and the prospect that FrenchCanadians would drown in a sea of Anglos When Ren Lvesques separatist Parti Qubcois was defeated in the  provincial elections by Robert Bourassas Liberals embittered militants of the Front de Libration du Qubec FLQ turned to terrorism In quick succession they kidnapped British Trade Commissioner James Cross and murdered Bourassas Minister of Labor Pierre Laporte The country approved Trudeaus tough reaction invoking the War Measures Act he sent in  troops and arrested  militants The FLQ was outlawed Despite Lvesques victory in  Qubec gradually moved away from outright separatism to a militant but more limited program which preserved the provinces specific culture by imposing the French language in schools industry and government Radicals were delighted by the subsequent westward exodus of Qubecs AngloCanadians but in the process Toronto was to bypass Montral in population financial and even cultural activityAfter a brief respite in private life Trudeau returned for what he felt was his crowning achievement the Constitution Act of  the consummation of Canadas political identity The act transferred Canadas constitution to Ottawa by removing the old obligation to refer amendments to London and incorporated a new Charter of Rights and Freedoms similar to the French Declaration of the Rights of ManDespite a referendum vote by its citizens against separatism two years earlier Qubec was defiantly the only province not to sign the new constitution feeling its cultural specificity had not been guaranteed Tory Prime Minister Brian Mulroney won the Qubcois over in  with an accord recognizing them as a distinct society He appeased the other provinces by conceding important new powers in sharedcost programs immigration and appointments to the Supreme Court and Senate In the s Qubec has remained a part of the Canadian federation by only the slimmest electoral margins The Inuit and other indigenous peoples have also negotiated concessions for their lands and resources and in  the immense Northern Territories divided in two The eastern half which takes in Baffin Island the land around Hudsons Bay and most of the Arctic islands is now called Nunavut and essentially functions as an Inuit homeland The remaining Northwest Territories officially retain the territorys old name though many refer to the region as the Western Arctic The success of Nunavut has led other native groups to settle claims with the Canadian government Canadas national unity remains a dynamic work in progress THE EARLIEST PEOPLESApart from a few explorers trappers golddiggers and oil drillers most Canadians have preferred to hug the narrow strip along the American border and know little of the northern wilderness The only people who have embraced all of Canadas vast territory are the Inuit and other preColumbian peoples even though they now number less than half a million and have never been many more Canadas distinctness is better appreciated by a closer look at some of its earliest peoplesThe PioneersIn the beginning as far as human beings were concerned Canada was a void Siberian hunters crossed the ice of the Bering Strait in several waves While the earliest around  bc moved down the Pacific coast to South America the settlement of Canada began some  years after spreading across the continent from the Yukon and much later from British Columbia By  bc Indians were hunting caribou in Nova Scotia Archaeologists believe that the pattern of life in the Stone Age was not so very different from what the first Europeans encounteredIn the Arctic region the stabilization of the sea level and a dramatic cooling of the climate around  bc caused hunters to switch from land mammals to fish seal walrus whale and icedwelling polar bear At the same time these ancestors of the Inuit moved out of their skin tents into warmer igloos of hardened snow blocks They glided over the ice on skates of ivory or antler horn From the Yukon further migrations took them north to the High Arctic south around Hudson Bay to Manitoba east to Greenland and down the Labrador coast to NewfoundlandFor the West Coast peoples as the song says the living was easy The fish were indeed jumping bountiful salmon were barbecued in the summertime smoked for the winter Prehistoric techniques for fishing and trapping have continued right into modern times though bone has been replaced by steel in the weapons One of British Columbias favorite freshwater fishing sites at Hells Gate in Fraser Canyon has been going strong for  years Prairie Indians hunted buffalo by forcing the herds onto marshland snowbanks thin ice or over cliffsone of these nasty surprises being known to this day as the HeadSmashedIn buffalo jump near Fort MacLeod Alberta Already in  bc these people were drying and smoking strips of meatmodern beef jerky In Ontario and Qubec where encroaching forests gradually dispersed the herds of caribou the Iroquois ousted the Algonquin and settled down to cultivate maize beans and squash living in rectangular multifamily longhousesThe InuitThese toughest of all Canadians have withstood the hardships of the far north including its icy deserts and Arctic blizzards but were nearly wiped out by European diseasesmeasles mumps and smallpox Estimated at  in the th century they now number some  living mostly in the eastern half of the Northwest Territories They succeeded in having the eastern section of the Northwest Territories officially renamed NunavutOur Landand in  Nunavut became the th province of Canada Since the s the federal government has gathered most of the Inuit together in village communities to improve their education medical care and general welfare But more scattered groups in the High Arctic still prefer to live in traditional igloos better insulated than in stone houses and with an infinite supply of building materialsThe characteristic snowblock dome measures  to  m  to  ft in diameter at the base An entrance tunnel with a kitchen alcove on one side and storage alcoves on the other leads to the main living area Light is provided by whaleblubber oil lamps as well as by the translucent snow walls or a clearice skylight The igloos are often connected by a whole network of tunnels This proved particularly convenient for the Caribou Inuit practice of comarriage two couples would exchange sexual partners not in a casual way but as a real alternate marriage strengthening ties between two interlocking familiesSocial solidarity in the Arctic cold is of course important In one group on Hudson Bay males became mumiqatigiik or dancing partners a friendship solemnized ritualistically when two buddies hit each other very hard on the face and shoulders exchanged gifts and danced together until exhausted And why do Inuit kiss by rubbing noses rather than with their lips That way they wont stick to one another in belowfreezing temperaturesThe KwakiutlFor the relative opulence of their way of life the Kwakiutl of British Columbias Pacific coast on and around Vancouver Island count among the aristocrats of Canadian native peoples For centuries they have harvested an abundance of fish from the ocean and riversnot just salmon but halibut herring mussels and clams From the forests they have hewed red cedar planks for handsomely crafted houses and m ft canoes to negotiate the coastal waters Before European textiles arrived on the scene the Kwakiutl pounded cedar bark until it was supple and soft enough to weave into capes skirts and blanketsThe mild climate and generally easy living have given them the leisure to develop artistic talents less apparent among native peoples and Inuit facing harsher conditions Elaborate decoration has gone into fashioning the simplest everyday objectsclothing baskets storage boxes even fishhooks Carpentry is the most valued of Kwakiutl skills and is spectacularly displayed in their totem poles But this is not an ancient art form The huge freestanding red cedar poles erected in front of their houses are essentially a thcentury phenomenon dependent for their intricate design on the chisels steel axes curved knives and other metal tools bartered from Europeans for the skins of sea otters Size was originally limited to that of the poles and beams used to build the house to which the carvings were directly attached Then as personal wealth diminished with a slump in the fur trade totem poles became prime symbols of a chiefs prestige soaring to  m  ft and more While they survive now only in museums especially in Vancouver see page  the ritual gift giving known as potlatch has reemerged after years of official prohibition Derived from the Nootka Indian word patschatl meaning to give the potlatch traditionally enabled a chief to demonstrate his prestige to neighboring tribes For a year or more he gathered up his tribes surplus wealthconsiderable during the boom years of the fur tradeto throw a huge party In addition to a splendid feast the host would hand out gifts of oil carvings jewels prized iron tools and above all the coveted Hudsons Bay Company blanket sometimes as many as  of them While the host tribes houses were emptied of everything except bare essentials the guests would depart knowing that in a year or two they would have to reciprocate if they were not to lose faceIn the s the government banned this apparently wanton impoverishment but the Kwakiutl for whom wealth was measured by what they could give away continued the practice clandestinely disguising it as the distribution of Christmas presents Today potlatch is back in the open updated with transistor radios and other household appliances the blankets are now electricThe Dene NationalNowhere is the clash of traditional values and modern industry more acute than it is in the western Subarctic Here some  native peoples from  tribes in the Northwest Territories sharing the Athapaskan language have joined as the Dene Nation Together with the Mtis Association descendants of intermarried French fur traders and Plains Indians they are involved in a tussle with private oil and natural gas companies to protect land rights and traditional cultureProponents of an Arctic gas pipeline passing through Indian lands in the Mackenzie Valley to northern Alberta argued that the Dene need revenues from the pipeline to escape poverty and that in any case they no longer have an autonomous culture They drive cars wear Western clothes speak English and play countryandwestern music But Dene leaders fearful of the projects environmental impact insisted their bushrelated culture of hunting and fishing could and should be protected through more selfgovernment before the pipeline was laid Ottawa compromised with a shorter pipeline one just for oilIn fact quite apart from the more tangible facets of Indian life that the Dene Nation is trying to preservelanguage customs hunting and fishing groundsthe traditional values are what remain vitally important In the past native peoples moved around the Subarctic in small bands with leaders not institutionalized in a sacred or hereditary role but chosen very pragmatically for specific hunting skills or onthespot organizing abilities A tough environment demanded tough qualities of interdependence and industriousness sorely tried by contact with Europeans The fur trade put an end to their seminomadic existence as they settled around the trading posts and became fiercely competitive with one another A collapse of fur prices after World War II coinciding with a rise in prices for consumer goods left them dependent on federal welfareThe old culture however precarious still exists and Dene leaders always pragmatic fought to protect it with a proper land settlement rather than dependence on pipeline revenues in a world where oil and gas prices are just as fragile as fur prices once were Ironically the Northern natives have begun discussions on building their own pipeline which would supply them with a flow of revenue and a boost toward further autonomy The official name of the Northwestern Territories hasnt changed but it is known among the Dene Nation as Denendeh which means our land and as the negotiations between the native groups and the government continue this dream moves closer to realityThe BlackfootOur popular image of the North American Indian is conditioned by Hollywoods stereotypefeather headdress necklace of scalps and whooping war dances around the campfirewhich in fact derived from the prairie tribes or Plains Indians as they are known to American anthropologists The Blackfoot of Alberta are a classic example Their name says the myth was bestowed on them when an ancestor on his way to meet another tribe walked through land burned by prairie fire and blackened his moccasinsFor these great hunters of the Rocky Mountain foothills and prairies wild game included grizzly and black bear antelope deer elk wild sheep and goats but the only real meat was buffalo Before the early s when horses appeared on the scene guile was more important than speed and hunters stalked the buffalo herd disguised with the skins of wolf and buffalo calves Horseback hunting brought new skills and prestige to an lite that had been given no other duties The Blackfoot went to war with Shoshoni and Crow Indians to the south for their horses and were in turn attacked by the Cree from the north for their territorys great buffalo herds Buffalo was everything to these tribesfood clothes and tents and twelve to fourteen buffalo skins were needed to construct a single teepee So the cultural and ecological shock was all the greater when the herds were exterminated in the s Mtis and Cree Indians were devastatingly efficient with their repeater rifles and the transcontinental railway builders made a deliberate policy of clearing the tracks of migrating buffalo By  under the Canadian governments Blackfoot Treaty the native peoples gave up their hunting grounds to raise cattle on reserves insteadThe MicmacLike the Denes of the Pacific Coast the Micmac found a life of relative plenty when they migrated from the Great Lakes to the fishing waters of Nova Scotia Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick The Atlantic provided a gourmet diet of oysters clams and lobster and the rivers teemed with salmon eel smelt and sturgeon They roasted their fish whole boiled it by dropping hot stones into the cooking water or ate it smokedLike their Algonquin cousins back in the woodlands of Qubec and Ontario they showed a great talent for huntingmoose beaver bear caribou and sealwith bow and arrow traps and harpoon Before the hunt the Micmac staged a huge eatall feast to clear out all available provisions confident the larder would be amply replenished When they returned the hunting dogs ended up as the prize delicacy for guests at their ceremonial feasts The hunters lured the moose with a birchbark horn imitating the female call and if that didnt work they poured water from a birchbark receptacle into a pond to reproduce the sound of the female urinating Once the men had killed the beast the women had to carry it home to cook The choice morsel was the head roastedIn the th century the Micmac were courted by the French as allies against the British The French at Louisbourg wrought just as much mayhem among them through smallpox and typhus Some  Micmac remain in  reserves in the Atlantic provinces and QubecModern RealitiesToday colorful folklore is being revived as an assertion of the indigenous peoples identity But it is in terms of hard everyday reality that Indians and Inuit have insisted upon and wonthe autonomy of partial provincial status for the Yukon and Northwest Territories They are continually pressing for a greater share in the profits of the oil uranium and other energy resources found on the lands allotted them in the th century before these riches were ever dreamed ofAfter years of paternalistic
