                                 A Response to My Critics            Many kausfiles readers criticized the previousitem The Ending of the Underclass Part XVIII as excessivelyoptimistic The most common objection is roughly                           How do you get from a declining welfare population to the ending of theunderclass What if poor single mothers on welfare just become poor singlemothers working in lowwage jobs                        My answer is Underclass doesnt mean people who are poor or even peoplewho are poor and live in neighborhoods with other poor people It means peoplewho are poor and live in poor neighborhoods isolated from the mainstream worldof work where there are lots of singlemother households on welfare few malebreadwinners and an adversary culture typically aggravated by racedifferences Although black poverty has been falling lets assume forpurposes of argument that what is happening is poor single mothers on welfarehave become poor single mothers working in hotels and fastfood joints Can wesay the underclass is ending I think so            We can say it because by definition and in practice workingpoor mothersarent in the underclass A maid changing sheets in a Marriott is no longercut off from the world of work On the contrary shes likely to be on thelookout for job opportunities that pay more or offer useful training Sheseligible for raises and promotions not to mention government subsidies likethe Earned Income Tax Credit She cant afford to develop an attitude thatsets itself in opposition to the mainstream culture Her children will grow upknowing the discipline of a working home and they will have at least oneworking role model            We can also say it because a society of poor working single mothers isprobably unstable in a good way If women know they are not going to besupported by welfare checks but are going to have to work they are apt to askmore of the men in their livesspecifically they are apt to ask that mencontribute by going to work Young women will be less likely to have childrenout of wedlock or at least partnership with a man precisely because being aworking single mom is a struggle These trends are already starting toappearthe percent of black births that are out of wedlock has finally stoppedgrowing and the black teen birthrate has dropped  percent since  to itslowest level since recordkeeping began            Will such big favorable longterm trends continue Will othersmaterializein particular will employment among poor AfricanAmerican menincrease I dont knowthats why I fudged and said the dependency dropsuggests  this problem may be on its way to beingradically ameliorated if not solved Four escape hatches in onesentence should be enough But I am optimistic because the logic behind thefavorable scenario seems so powerful I hope more crack welfarereporters will be on the lookout to see if this longtermtransformation is happeningie if the ghettos are becoming differentbetter placesinstead of just tracking down exwelfare moms who are nowworking but are still struggling and not making much money            Yes even if the underclass shrinks through assimilation the problem of theworking poor will still be with us But thats a different fight and an easierone to wage Once people are working its not that hard to boost their incomesthrough familiar means like income supplements the EITC daycare subsidieshealthcare subsidies schools better training etc The peculiar horror ofthe underclass has been in part that those remedies havent been able tocrack an isolated subculture of nonworking nonfamilies Why cant we lookforward to the day when that has changed                           Random endnotes Vice President Gore after bagging the
