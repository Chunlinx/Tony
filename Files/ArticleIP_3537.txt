not go to it            Prudence teetotally                                             DearPrudence                                                      I seethat every editor these days is trying to copy the tone of the wonderful advicegiven by the sainted Mary Killen in the Spectator  Tell me why do youthink this is It cant be because they have no brilliant ideas of their owncan it                                       YoursexpectantlyMichael ElliottWashington DC                                                         DearPrudence                                                      In recent years one ofmy favorite newspaper columnists has become less and less interesting Eppienot her real name used to write an advice column Readers would write herwith their questions on life love and usually microeconomics and she wouldgive them really great advice eg Wake up and smell the coffeehoney                                       Lately however her readers seem to have decided to become AmericasNannies mailing in all sorts of precatory sillinessEppie tell your readersnever to leave a dead fish alone in a car on a hot day with the windows rolledup Or Eppie please please tell your readers not to make fun of fatpeople such as Tipper Gore Theyre human too you know And Prudence sheprints that stuff in her column Every  day Advice FahgeddaboutitBuster Prudence will they ever put Eppie out of her misery Do yourepresent the next evolutionary step in journalism Or are you nothing morethan this years Jeffrey Zaslow                                        Popo not my realname                        DearMichael and Popo            Your letters raise relatedquestions and I hope you wont mind if I answer them both at once DearPrudence did not originate with an editor searching for a new idea It was aresponse to the overwhelming public demand for advice People seek answers totheir real problems and other people enjoy and profit from reading theproblems submitted and the answers given Peoplereal people that isaremore interested in those problems than in the questions that pundits make upjust so they will have something to write about questions selected so that theanswer requires little thought and no research            As for my antecedents Imust confess that I have never heard of Mary Killen Eppie or JeffreyZaslow I trace my lineage back to Joseph Solomon the Delphic OracleCassandra Adam Smith and Benjamin Franklin I deliberately omit that oldfool of an advice giver Polonius Banks thrive by being both borrowers andlenders Thus I consider myself part of the constants of history not part ofan evolutionary trend            But heyits a free country and a free market If no problems are submitted there willbe no answers And if there are problems and answers but no one reads themPrudence will go back to her needlepoint                            Prudencemodestly                                             DearPrudence and how are John and Paul                                                      My girlfriends formerboyfriend broke up with her via a note That she was pregnant at the time makesthe situation with respect to his morality quite clear He had and has themorals of a banana slug That he cringes at salt shakers only bolsters thisconclusion The question that I find interesting concerns the etiquette ofbreaking up I contend that the only way one person should kiss off another isface to face Ive a number of reasons to support this view but my fundamentalreasoning is moral as morality is the basis of so much mannerly behavior Injustice the kissedoff as the offended party should have the right toconfront and possibly to throw sharp objects at the kisseroff                                       Anyother way by telephone by note smacks of cowardice Further it seems to methat my preferred mode serves a useful societal function as well by makingromantic relationships somewhat more stable since somewhat more difficult todissolve during temporary difficulties This last point of course presumesthat society has an interest in stable romantic relationships if you acceptthat society has an interest in marriage and that stable romanticrelationships both include and lead to marriage you must conclude that societydoes indeed have such an interest Have you any thoughts on this A nationholds its breath well except for those holding others at gunpoint                                       Emily Posts MeanerBrother                        DearBrother            Whether a facetofaceencounter is required for a breakup depends on the reason for the breakup If Asplits from B because B has been obviously offensive and fraudulent thecourtesy of a facetoface explanation is not required Suppose for examplethat Mr B has given Ms A every reason to believe that he is not married butshe learns that he is B then deserves nothing In the case to which you referthe young lady deserves a facetoface meeting an apology and whatever solacecan be offered Probably the general rule is that a party who is seriouslyaggrieved owes no consideration to the aggrievor            I am surprised that you didnot mention email as a medium for breakups Isnt there a Web site containingform email letters for breakups            Theyrewell thanks                            Prudence                                             DearPrudence

openingthe door for your loved one The other point is you dont leave her standingalone on the far side of the car and thus more easily jostled andor assaultedby the nearest purse snatcher or other
