                okay what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time   well uh i have two children so i dont have a whole lot of spare time right now one of the things that ive made time for is uh playing softball   umhum   uhhuh   i really enjoy i enjoy softball but i enjoy all kind of sports i enjoy watching and participating i really like water sports like swimming and skiing but i dont get to do that too often   yeah   and then i i really enjoy sewing but i dont get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing how about you   oh i uh like sports type things too we like to get out and walk and we like the water sports too but like you its unless you have a pool in your backyard its kind of hard to get to do that   uhhuh i know it it is do you work full time   very often yeah well parttime were going to have a baby in July so part of my big hobby has been  trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff lately but   parttime oh right yeah that definitely takes over your time   yeah it does ive been   is this going to be your first   yes uhhuh ive been doing some crossstitch for something i wanted to put in the nursery so i havent done that in years but ive kind of enjoyed that but its just hard to find the time to sit there and do it and   oh uhhuh yeah right well thats it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then youve got something to show for it   right yeah   yeah thats neat   and i guess i kind of consider shopping a hobby   yeah i do too   i just go out just to just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes just look   yeah yeah well since ive had kids its kind of funny i i never really was much of a garage sale shopper until i had kids but youll probably find after your children get bigger uh like when they want things like tricycles toys things that cost quite a lot in the store you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars  and   yeah yeah we bought some baby clothes yeah last weekend at a garage sale   yeah oh you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just dont use them and wear them you know for that many years or anything   yeah   so im ive become a garage sale shopper and it is fun on the weekends i drive around look to see you know whos selling what and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class and     uhhuh oh   just you know all kinds of things like that that youd probably pay thirty dollars for and i got them for two dollars  yeah so   wow yeah yeah it kind of a hobby it thats time consuming too really to find the things you want sometimes you have to stop a lot of places   yeah yeah it is it it does take more time but i dont work so uh thats something ive decided im going to make sure my kids have a have a happy growing up years and   right yeah i think thats important too im not going to work after the baby comes   yeah well thats good im glad   so i guess hopefully ill have time for more hobbies i do not know   yeah well at first when you first have a baby you uh seems to take every moment of your time partly because youre not used to you know juggling your time around like that but   right   eventually the youll youll be doing lots of stuff so   yes   but i think my husband is real into sports too he plays on a TI softball team and a church softball team and by the time he plays two games a week and i play a a game a week we go to lots of softball   wow yeah   but the kids enjoy going because theres usually a lot of other kids for them to play with and we thats getting outside and you know doing things they like to do too so   yeah so thats good a whole family your whole family can enjoy those hobbies   yeah and one other thing were doing this year is uh we bought Wet and Wild passes   oh   weve never done that before but the kids are always wanting to play in the water and uh like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play its kind of hard and uh they have real good kiddie areas uh at both of the Wet and Wilds around here so were planning on going two or three times a week   oh wow thatll make the summer go by in a hurry keep the kids busy   yeah i think it will yeah because my oldest daughters in school and she gets bored real fast when shes home with nothing to do   right   so i think thatll be a lot of fun   yeah   so were looking forward to that   yeah um do you consider yard work a hobby at all or is that just a chore   well when i got married i thought it was going to be fun  but my husband and i both i think consider it a chore its our yard has had so many problems its completely died out two times   uhhuh yeah oh no   and uh weve had to start all over trying to plant grass and so its become a chore  do you and your husband like to work in the yard     oh well we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it  i like to put flowers out and you know a few little things like that but as far as mowing every week and finding time to get all that stuff done it gets to be a chore   yeah uhhuh yeah yeah yeah yeah thats true   seems like sometimes hobbies do that they kind of take over and turn into work instead of   yeah well thats how sewing i love to sew and uh i wish i had more time to do it but sometimes ill get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than   fun yeah if it doesnt go crite quite right   yeah another thing i enjoy doing is cooking i i like especially its real strange but i like to cook for other people like i have a friend thats uh pregnant but she cant get up and walk around right now   oh no   so i enjoy you know cooking things to take over to her house or   oh thats nice   yeah it and its fun for me to do that its its something i enjoy doing its funny though its like i dont really want to cook for us  its kind of like when youre a kid and and someone elses house was fun to clean but you didnt want to do your own     yeah your how funny  i think ill enjoy cooking more when im not working when i dont get home until five thirty or six and i have to cook and clean up its not its not fun but i think ill like it better   yeah oh yeah yeah when youre home its it makes a difference it sure does   yeah   well do you guys go camping or anything like that   uh yeah weve done a little bit of camping we like that its there again its just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend   umhum yeah well thats something were plan on doing not this weekend but the next my parents go camping a lot and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them and   oh that sounds fun   yeah were really looking forward to it the girls love it theyve been a couple of times and uh just getting to be outside you know all the time and sleep in a tent and thats really fun to them so   yeah   were looking fo rward to that   well that sounds nice i i think thatll be a good family thing   yeah i think so   to start doing more often if   yeah my uh my husband loves to fish im not much into fishing but uh my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish so i think itll be real good for them  they can go fishing   uhhuh   yeah weve camped with some friends who have young children and uh if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a lot   uhhuh uhhuh   oh they have so much fun doing that and they think theyre really great fishermen because theyre catching so many   yeah yeah yeah oh i know yeah um shes really looking forward im hoping thats another thing though when sometimes your uh hobbies can interfere with each other because my husbands afraid hes going to have a softball tournament that weekend and im saying no no yeah if youre doing a lot of things sometimes you have conflicts and you have to decide what you enjoy the most so   oh yeah skip this tournament right yeah do you do any other crafts or anything besides just sewing   well  not really right now i keep thinking when the kids get bigger and i have a little more time uh i might take up theres id love to crossstitch i think crossstitchings so pretty but i have never done any   its not too hard its i dont think its as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that   yeah yeah yeah i i crocheted when i was younger its funny when i was in high school i made a blanket and but you know i cant even remember how i did it now its been so long since i did it but   yeah yeah i started to sweater knit to knit a sweater and i got off on my rows somehow and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front and then i tore it out and threw it down and i i never have   but uhhuh oh yeah     picked it back up again and now i cant remember anything about it   yeah well i did the same thing uh when i was pregnant with my first daughter i was really bored and i bought one of those latch hook rug kits   oh uhhuh   oh it was a real pretty rug and i thought well i could use this as a gift or something you know and oh it was so its beautiful but i did not realize how long it took and i got about three two thirds of it done       and then i just i had the baby  and then it was just like i forgot all about it and every once in a while ill be digging through the closet and ill find that thing and ill think oh maybe i ought to get the rest of that out you know and finish it   yeah forget it yeah   but uh for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big uh hobby it seemed like people did them a lot uh uh people dont do that much anymore so it was something easy i could do   yeah i remember that yeah yeah yeah they are pretty easy   yeah   well its been real good talking to you and i hope you enjoy your camping trip   yeah you too oh thank you and thanks for calling byebye   umhum bye
