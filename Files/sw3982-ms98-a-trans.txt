        well Wendy have you had any uh experiences with your nieces in school to indicate that somethings wrong with the school system     well they they dont seem to discipline the children like they used to   uhhuh   now when i was in school im im only twenty nine and i i hadnt been out of college that long but when we were in grade school we you know if you got in trouble you definitely got paddled or you know something something was done and now they cant touch the children   yeah do you think thats the fault of the school system or society or     well its really a combination the fact that so many parents refuse to let the school discipline their children and the fact that they let      yeah   parents or or people file law suits for one thing i have a friend that is a teacher in Houston   yes   and she says the kids can hit you kick you stab you and you can not touch them and if you touch them then they can sue you and they can sue sue the school system   yeah so its really no more a failure of society   i i think so i think so and and i you couldnt pay me enough to be a teacher in a bad in a bad city     no   and and and our town where you know maybe thirty thousand people theres not a problem   i have a friend whos a principal of a Dallas school  the stories she tells oh yes   oh really yeah its unbelievable the things and and of course the sweet little kids   within well the neighborhood that shes in is is very economically deprived and that is reflected in the students abilities i mean they have no support at home      umhum   so for if you casually looked at it you could say maybe the test scores in that school are bad and and therefore theres a failure of the public school system but when the parents are not interested or dont have the resources or cant even read themselves   umhum   that sort of thing it its bound to affect the education of the children   well yeah and the fact that theyre not putting enough money into the schools   oh well   you know and they dont even have adequate facilities is   i just wonder where all the money goes i mean my   well isnt isnt that the truth     my taxes are exorbitant and  i i i dont think you solve problems too much by throwing money at it i think you have to get the parents interested and have to get the community support and that sort of thing   umhum umhum and and let the school give them a little more youre right give them a little more support and a little more to work with and as these kids you know as the kids get older its its even harder yeah because then you know their minds are made up as to what theyre gonna do by then   oh im sure it is im sure it is well yes and if you dont develop an interest in reading at an early age it gets awfully hard a lot later on   oh yeah yeah they see no point you know weve gotten away with it this far   thats right but again societys uh influences i think can affect how well the students perform more than this than what the public school is or is not doing   yeah oh yeah   i mean certainly  drugs and and peer pressures of that sort can again make the students fail and therefore look like that theres something something deficient about the public school system   yeah and it just frightens me when i think about  having a child and sending them to school where theyre theyre selling drugs in in grade school     isnt that scary   i cant imagine i mean we wouldnt even have known what they were talking about let alone take something or you know sell it buy it       i i just cant imagine that it has has come so far that theres little kids dealing drugs and older kids dealing to the little kids and   thats right but then then again thats something that thats very difficult for the schools to try to control   yeah   this principal i know does the best she can in terms of dealing with students this is a grade school students who are members of gangs     oh my goodness   yes students who carry weapons to school   um  and when we were little when we went to grade school we lived in Waxahachie and little bitty town you know little bitty school and there was i i i just  it is beyond my comprehension to imagine grade schoolers with weapons and and gangs   oh yeah   and its just you might as well just have a police file on them   thats right   you know because you you know you you learn who the leaders are and you know what theyre doing and its you cant do anything to them   thats right but when there are disruptive influences like that in the school i think it makes it especially difficult for the children who want to learn   it really does because even even the ones that are that want to will let the other ones bully them out of it
