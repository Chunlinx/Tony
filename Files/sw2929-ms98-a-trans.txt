                you want to go first   well i believe that the um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action   yeah like the government if should the government make it universal or something like that   yes i i i i would be committed to that   uhhuh you you would be in favor of it   because oh definitely yes   uhhuh uhhuh   i know that there are many countries that um are very successful with the operation of the government uh providing that plan   uhhuh do they have options on who they uh you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing do you   um im not sure what how their program is run but i know it has been successful   uhhuh   and i would really have to uh read the history of probably i uh the country that has faired very well with it id like to see the uh the data on that   uhhuh thats the way with me i dont know a whole lot about it i would thats the only concern i would have because i think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care and if you didnt have any choice on you know on who you go to   well i yes i think thats primary is if you have a good relationship   uhhuh   with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss   uhhuh   anything with him   uhhuh   and uh   or to change even like if you didnt approve or didnt think you were getting good service   oh absolutely that the choice would be yours   uhhuh   um given the proper guidelines for your health   uhhuh   that you should be able to make um a choice there   uhhuh that thats one of my main concerns i i have a friend that has their boy has been sick for several months and they just have found out whats the trouble and they have gone through uh one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors and they finally determined what the problem was it took that long   yes and the expense of that yes   and that that something like that you know i thought if you couldnt change or look elsewhere you know for help if you want i dont know how that program works you know if you can do that   well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit   uhhuh   to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice   uhhuh   that you could select that individual yourself   uhhuh   and im sure that they would have a history of each doctor and hopefully that they would have their um accreditations there too   umhum i guess thats thats primarily was one of my thoughts you know because you know how government is     yes um but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public   uhhuh   and uh   for them to have a choice on   uhhuh uhhuh   if theyre in favor of it or not   right yes and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be and   it it would   um i think thats primary uh for the health if they were going to have a universal health care plan   umhum uhhuh   that uh they would have all the facts and the figures and uh what it would mean to each individual family and uh and individual   uhhuh   perhaps being single     uhhuh huh   um im not sure what else that uh we could address uh on health care um other than the fact i think um the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh uh included in all of that uh dental eye care and uh  our body as a whole should be included in that because   uhhuh uh uhhuh   there are so many avenues that needs to be um undertaken in a program like that um i wouldnt want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program   uhhuh i know where my son works they have uh an option right now where they can have their own physician or they can choose one that their company has elected   uhhuh   and that costs them less if they take the doctor that the that the company has selected   and does he have an option uh if he doesnt care for the personality   he get well only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense   oh i see   otherwise he would you know he has to take the physician that uh and the hospital that the company has chosen as their   um   you know the one they have taken and their again i mean hes gotten good service he took the less expensive one of course     well if hes pleased with it i guess thats uh the bottom line   uhhuh   so but i i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something   uh right right yeah   yeah cause theres always that opposite story there   uh because thats the first ive really known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option you know to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take   uhhuh its quite different from when i was uh under doctors care thats for sure   uhhuh   im im very thankful that im not under any doctors care   oh  if you have your health youre wealthy you really are yeah     thats right yes   uh we live in a rural area up here   uhhuh what part of uh Pennsylvania do you live in   uh are you familiar with any of the area at all   well i have a brother that lives there   where   uh near uh Philadelphia   oh well thats thats a ways away but we live in Clarion County   okay   uh we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia and uh   are you a native Pennsylvanian   yes uhhuh   okay so im a former Michiganian so   oh uhhuh thats a nice state   yes it is its very lovely its a very lovely state   so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas   uhhuh uhhuh im sure it is uhhuh   as far as uh the doctors that are available of course we have good physicians here too weve been pretty fortunate weve had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields   uhhuh   so uh weve been pretty fortunate umhum   that has broadened so much also   oh yeah   that is the fields that you know are opening up are um just phenomenal they   uhhuh   i mean look at the AIDS uh case you know i mean they   uhhuh   thats a whole new field in itself its just   oh yeah   in itself its just its an auto immune deficiency but it sure is a dilly one   uhhuh it sure is i still wish they could do more with the cancer situation though   yes i do too   they uh they just dont seem to be i know theyre making progress but not like that i would like to see yeah yeah   to eradicate it entirely yeah well theres guidelines that people have to follow and if theyre determined to uh have their cigarettes and the other uh   uhhuh   carcinogenic causing items then   uhhuh   how do you teach them i guess you would   but a majority a lot of them dont do these things even and it doesnt seem to matter   thats true too its i i i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it   so uh it real uhhuh well they say second hand smoke and that is worse than smoking  so so what do you do you know   yeah well you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to   yeah yeah take their rights away from them they say  i never had the desire so i havent ever had that problem as far as that goes   umhum umhum   i cant take any credit for not smoking either so   well its a bad habit thats   its hard to break its a hard one to quit   that yes its they say that it is   yeah   well it was nice talking with you   yes very nice talking to you too and you have a good day   and well you do the same and uh well be talking i guess talking around the country   right  okay   okay you byebye   um bye bye
