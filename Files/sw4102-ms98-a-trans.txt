                so what do you think about caring for older folks Dale   well i think um the elderly is a really neat population to care for   uhhuh   theyve got a lot of special needs and at the same time um majority of them dont want to give up the independence that they have   right very definitely     and so youve got a real balance to make there   uhhuh   what about you   well im thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old They arent really that old but they are sort of wearing out My mamma is a dialysis patient   umhum   and she is only about sixty four but shes had some pretty close calls and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now and so shes phasing out and but shes also a very very very independent person and doesnt like having having people uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to   uhhuh   uh i know they certainly dont want to be in a nursing home but my daddy keeps talking about it i dont i couldnt possibly couldnt never see him in a nursing home         and my grand daddy also doesnt like wouldnt want to be in a nursing home hes ninety i think right on ninety right now   oh really   and hes living by himself My grand mamma died a couple of years ago   oh okay   so but hes you know as long as you can have the families take care of the people id like to see them stay at home   yeah but it gets hard my my grandmother is in her mid eighties   uhhuh   and shes uh suffering from a low uh well uh progressive Alzheimers disease   uhhuh   so she doesnt remember anybody   right   and uh she remembers things but they are things back whenever she was real young   right   and so with she was living by herself but my uh uncle has moved in with her to take care of her and its creating a lot of problems   right especially for your uncle i bet   oh yes yes   now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patients with Alzheimer Do they have anything like that in Dallas   in Dallas um yeah ive ive heard of several things and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them but sometimes its hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up   right So they are pretty limited   right   oh another interesting thing another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives   oh really   to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities   umhum   i dont think that was mainly with Alzheimers patients but just patients people in general who were not as independent as they use to be   umhum umhum well its its its a really day care programs are really neat you know and if the people if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever youve got a person whos mentally very alert and active and their body just hasnt kept up with them   uhhuh right   and i think thats in a way somewhere some an area where some of the day care uh programs have left off because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those   uhhuh right to uh get there and to participate in the activities   right cause i know theres one not too far from from me here in Dallas uh and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work   right   and sports   right   but if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly   thats true You cant play those things   yeah you cant do it   but you can sing songs and uh   well thats true   tell stories about the old times i guess you know you were talking about youre was it your grand mother   uhhuh   that was having Alzheimer   uhhuh   uh being able to tell old stories You can perhaps get a group of people that arent too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way   and they love to recollect i mean they just you know and they will just go on and on with these stories and they have such a memory   do they like to listen to other people recollect though   my grandmother doesnt  she she wants to tell to tell you about her story over again so     right   which is fine you know so   well that is good because we
