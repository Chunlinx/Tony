        okay well two things that come to mind with me first um is one i think more emphasis should placed on       the the English and and some of the basics i mean we we can get so specialized into you know extracurricular activities that weve got kids graduating high school that dont know how to read and write and such like that   oh yeah there seems to be a little bit of bias towards extracurricular stuff even all the way up through college   umhum   gets really out of hand ill agree with you on that one   yes it does   uh you said two things   well the other one is i think we i think we need to do a little bit more to keep kids in school   uh yeah i agree with you on that i happen to think the school systems pretty good   yes   and that uh the problem lies in uh teaching the kids to care and you know raising them up to care im not sure how to do that   yeah   i think uh you know the i mean the obvious examples are kids from broken families or families where the parents really dont care but but i know that a lot most parents do care and you know theres still problems   umhum   im not sure what the answer there is   yeah well i think i mean i think but overall weve got a really good system its just   we crowd a lot of kids a lot of kids in with one teacher and i know i i know im in a im im in college right now and um we have real small classes we were very fortunate in that we do and which is good because i mean the the people that im in class with we all learn different ways   umhum   and this way um i know my teacher real well and we can work on how i learn best      so you like a sort of a oneonone situation with the teacher   well not so much a oneonone but  you know like a ten or a fifteen on one as compared as compared to thirty and such   yeah when i when i was in high school and grade school      uhhuh   i noticed the classes that i got the most out of were the ones where there were a few at least you know a few other students who were interested   umhum   so thered be a lively discussion in the class   yeah   if if no one cared you know it didnt matter if the teacher was exciting or not itd be hed be talking he or shed be talking at you   umhum umhum   and uh and if the teacher was an idiot which did happen   yes   if the other kids were into it you know you could have a lot of fun uh with the material anyway   yeah thats true   so to me i i im im going to back and say its the students have got to be looking to learn uh theyve got to be curious and i think thats something that the the school system really doesnt address at all   umhum   i mean that theres a few interesting good classes were uh you know a teacher will come and really interest a kid but most of them you know its pretty much up to the kids   to carry it through   yeah to to be interested and you know you talk to   yeah   you talk to people on the street and they dont know history they dont know geography and it doesnt bother them they they really dont care its not important to them   umhum umhum   for some reason i mean its its not that theyre stupid because theyre not these things that i feel are important to living in the world are not important to them   umhum but still you know your basic your basic English your reading and your writing and you know and some of your math you know are very essential   yeah and people dont know this because they dont feel that its important   you know right      though thats what okay i i editorialized im sorry   no thats okay   i  it seems to me that they dont feel its important and thats why they dont know English   umhum i ive run into a couple of those yeah yeah i dont know i i think its i mean ive heard some some some school districts that have that have uh found some really unique ways about getting around the problems and you know of even though weve got a really good system the problems of you know as far comparing right now theyre real big into comparing our stats with that of other countries have you seen that   uh yeah were uh falling further and further behind the cutting edge apparently   umhum umhum   uh what are these interesting programs you mentioned   well um i have ive just heard briefly about one
