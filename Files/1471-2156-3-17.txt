                    Background        Trafficking between the nuclear and cytoplasmic        compartments is mediated by nuclear pore complexes NPCs             These large proteinaceous structures are embedded        in a nuclear envelope NE pore formed by fusion of the        inner and outer nuclear membranes The three dimensional        structure of NPCs from both         Xenopus and budding yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae is        characterized by distinct substructures that are arranged        with an fold rotational symmetry     Eight spokelike        structures form the central NPC core and are flanked on the        cytoplasmic and nuclear sides by ring structures Fibrils        protrude from both the cytoplasmic and nuclear rings with        the nuclear fibrils gathered into a basketlike structure        by a terminal ring The global architectures of the yeast        and vertebrate NPCs are highly similar although there may        be differences in the core ring structures     Genetic        and biochemical studies in yeast have identified  NPC        proteins termed nucleoporins Nups that comprise the        estimated  MDa structure     Recent proteomic        analysis has determined that mammalian NPCs are also        comprised of  different proteins     however the        overall size of the vertebrate NPC is predicted to be        larger        Despite their size differences yeast        and vertebrate NPCs are responsible for identical transport        reactions and therefore both structures are predicted to        be functionally equivalent            NPC assembly is likely to be a highly regulated process        that coordinates membrane fusion with the coincident        assembly of peripheral nucleoporins Biogenesis of NPCs        takes place throughout the cell cycle in all cell types De        novo assembly into intact NEs occurs during cell and        nuclear growth to maintain a constant NPC density            In cells undergoing an open mitosis NPCs are also        reassembled with the formation of the NE at the end of        mitosis     The mechanisms controlling membrane fusion        during pore formation and the steps for assembly of the        distinct NPC substructures have not been fully elucidated        Understanding the molecular pathway of NPC biogenesis will        be a critical step in determining the mechanism of NPC        function        Current models for NPC assembly are based on a        combination of in vivo and in vitro studies Experiments        using immunofluorescence in vertebrate cells are beginning        to order the recruitment and timing of incorporation of        individual nucleoporins during postmitotic reassembly               Additionally in vitro assembly studies        with         Xenopus egg or mitotic cell extracts        have revealed several intermediates in NPC assembly and        demonstrated a requirement for an intact double nuclear        membrane prior to postmitotic NPC assembly               The modular nature of the NPC structure has also        suggested that subcomplexes of discrete Nups may initially        form and provide building blocks for biogenesis In fact        Hurt and coworkers have recently demonstrated the in vitro        assembly of a Nup subcomplex from entirely recombinant        proteins     Given the structural and functional        similarities between vertebrate and yeast NPCs and the        insertion of both into a preexisting NEs it is likely        that NPC biogenesis occurs via a similar mechanism in all        organisms        We and others have focused on genetic analysis in the        budding yeast         S cerevisiae to understand the        mechanism of NPC biogenesis This approach has mostly        involved reverse genetics wherein mutations in a gene        encoding a known nucleoporin are evaluated for NPC        structural and functional changes and several mutants that        induce massive morphological perturbations have been        characterized        However the advent of        green fluorescence protein GFPbased technology has        recently allowed forward genetic strategies Using        GFPtagged NPCs we designed live cell assays to monitor        NPC dynamics and assembly rates     Moreover to        isolate factors required for proper NPC assembly and        localization we developed a novel genetic screening        strategy The approach is based on the ability to express        functional GFPnucleoporin fusions and the assumption that        NPC assemblymislocalization mutants expressing a        GFPnucleoporin will have distinct fluorescence properties        as compared to wild type cells Our previous studies used        fluorescenceactivated cell sorting to isolate mutants and        identified a         nup mutant with diminished        incorporation of the GFPNupp at the NPC     As        Nupp and Nupp directly interact in the NPC structure             this provided a powerful strategy for pinpointing        nearest neighbor interaction requirements We have now        extended this analysis and employed classic temperature        sensitive mutant collection with a strain expressing        multiple GFPtagged nucleoporins This modified approach        was designed to isolate mutants that affect global NPC        assembly We report here the complete mutant screen        identifying  individual mutants that subdivide into at        least  complementation groups Further analysis of mutant        subgroups has revealed potential mechanisms for both direct        and indirect perturbation of NPC assembly and localization        and indicates that this process requires multiple        factors                    Results                  Rationale for a genetic screen to identify          temperature sensitive mutants that perturb NPC assembly          and localization          Work in our previous studies suggested that GFPbased          screening for NPC assembly mutants designated           npa  was a powerful approach This          strategy was based on the ability to functionally express          GFPnucleoporin fusions and the assumption that           NPC           a ssemblymislocalization          mutants expressing a GFPnucleoporin would have distinct          fluorescence properties     In wild type yeast          cells fluorescence microscopy localization of proteins          at NPCs appears as punctate staining of virtually the          entire nuclear rim circumference see Figure  Mutants          perturbing GFPNup localization could include cells with           NPC clusters in NE subregions  mislocalization of          the GFPNup or aggregated NPC subcomplexes to the          cytoplasm or nucleus due to either a block in new          assembly or increased instability of existing NPCs           mislocalization of the GFPNup due to indirect          perturbation of the ER and NE membrane or  decreased          GFPNup incorporation followed by turnover resulting in          cells with diminished total fluorescence Given the lack          of knowledge about mediators of NPC assembly and          localization we aimed to bias the genetic strategy          towards those with global assembly defects We predicted          that factors required for total NPC biogenesis would be          essential as functional NPCs are absolutely required for          nuclear transport Thus a primary modification of our          original strategy was to generate a bank of temperature          sensitive ts mutants from a parental strain expressing          GFPNups Examining the direct GFPNup fluorescence of          each member of the bank would isolate potential           npa strains Second we sought to          preferentially isolate mutants that decrease overall NPC          number versus inhibiting the incorporation of the single          GFPNup We predicted that coexpression of multiple          GFPNups that localize to distinct NPC substructures          would allow identification of mutants with global          defects          For such a screen haploid strains expressing          chromosomally integrated GFP fusions to both           NIC and           NUP were generated see          Materials and Methods           NIC is an essential nucleoporin          and a member of multiple biochemically distinct NPC          subcomplexes                NUP  while not essential is          physically and genetically linked to a distinct subset of          nucleoporins        The rationale for using           NIC and           NUP are severalfold Nicp and          Nupp are two of the most abundant nucleoporins               the characterized           nic and           nup mutants do not result in          gross morphological NPC perturbations eg NPC clusters          NE herniations or membrane sealing of NPCs                and in previous studies GFPepitope tagging of Nicp          or Nupp did not inhibit function      our          unpublished observations Finally the encoded proteins          are associated with distinct NPC subcomplexes     and          we speculated that true mislocalization mutants would          require disruption of both sets of subcomplexes and more          likely reflect defects in global NPC structure and          assembly          In the doubly tagged           GFPnic nupGFP strains both          GFPNicp and NuppGFP were targeted to the NE and          showed punctate rimstaining characteristic of NPC          localization Figure  However the combination of          these two protein fusions in a haploid strain resulted in          a ts phenotype at  The ts phenotype was not however          accompanied by mislocalization of GFPNups after growth          for  hours at  The strain was viable at  and          doubling times were similar to wild type cells at  We          predicted this sensitized background might further bias          the screen toward mutations that perturb NPC          structure                          Isolation of npamutants          Wild type           GFPnic nupGFP haploid          strains were mutagenized to generate a bank of ts mutant          strains Figure A see Materials and Methods To          identify mutants from this bank individual ts strains          were visually screened for GFPNup localization by          fluorescence microscopy after shifting cultures to the          nonpermissive temperature  for  hours A total          of  individual           npa strains were identified in          which the GFPNup signal was altered The mutant          phenotypes were largely penetrant with all cells from a          mutant strain responding identically None of the cells          in a mutant population had retained a completely normal          appearance when assayed Although most mutants had          relatively normal growth rates at the permissive          temperature many showed signs of cell stress as          indicated by large cell and vacuole size Figure  DIC          panels While our previous screen identified mutants          with either a diminished GFP signal dim mutants or NPC          clusters     very few of the mutants isolated in          this screen  showed a temperature dependent          decrease in fluorescence intensity Figure  compare          panels A and C to M and O Instead most mutants lost          the exclusive punctate nuclear rim localization the          GFPNups were present in areas distinct from the NE and          often in discrete foci Figure  panels G and K The          majority showed wild type GFP localization at the          permissive growth temperature  however some did          show a weak mislocalization phenotype at  that was          significantly enhanced when the cells were shifted to          growth at  Figure  panels E and G Intriguingly          some of the mutants also had an apparent increase in GFP          intensity Figure  panel M We speculate that this is          due to changes in nearest neighbor interactions such as          those observed with GFPNupp in a           nup mutant              To determine the number of independent mutant genes          isolated complementation analysis of the ts phenotype          was performed Based on pairwise crosses of mutants with          opposite mating type only onethird  of the          mutants were initially catalogued into  different          complementation groups Figure B The remaining          twothirds  of the mutants could not be assigned          to a complementation group Subsequent backcrossing and          isolation of opposite mating type strains for the some of          the mutants allowed definition of an additional          complementation group However the majority of the          mutants were apparently unique with only single mutant          alleles isolated This suggested that the screen was not          saturating Overall the large number of independent           npa mutants potentially  was          surprising and suggested that a number of distinct          proteins can affect NPC assembly and localization                          Nup localization analysis in npastrains          To investigate the effects on NPCs more directly we          first targeted members of the largest independent          complementation groups for analysis The mutants          displaying the strongest GFPNup mislocalization          phenotypes were backcrossed In each case the GFPNup          phenotype segregated  and was genetically linked to          the ts phenotype indicating a single mutation was          responsible for both Interestingly mutant alleles in          the two largest complementation groups showed a similar          pattern of GFPNup mislocalization To investigate NPC          structure more closely in           npa and           npa mutants logarithmically          growing cultures were shifted to the nonpermissive          temperature and assayed for GFPNup localization by          direct fluorescence microscopy at various times after the          shift The parental strain SWY maintained wildtype          nuclear rim localization during growth at  Figure           panels AD In contrast both mutants showed a          temperature dependent mislocalization of GFPNicp and          NuppGFP over a four hour time course Figure  Both                    npa and           npa cells ceased growing after           hours at the nonpermissive temperature During this          time they completed  or  cell divisions Previous          studies of           nic mutants have shown that cells          may undergo  to  cell divisions with no apparent NPC          assembly Thus the more rapid onset of growth arrest in           npa and           npa mutants suggested that the ts          phenotype was not caused exclusively by a decrease in NPC          number and nucleocytoplasmic transport capacity              and may be due to other cellular effects Other members          of the           npa and           npa complementation groups showed          similar phenotypes data not shown In addition Western          analysis showed no decrease in GFPNup protein levels in          arrested           npa cells indicating GFP protein          stability was not affected data not shown          One of our original predictions was that labeling          multiple Nups with GFP would identify mutants with          defects in the formation of the entire NPC structure To          determine if additional nonGFP tagged Nups were          mislocalized in these cells we used indirect          immunofluorescence IF microscopy with antibodies          directed against either Nupp or Pomp Like          GFPNicp and NuppGFP the localization of Nupp          and Pomp changed from a punctate nuclear rim staining          to cytoplasmic foci when shifted to the nonpermissive          temperature data not shown                          Ultrastructural analysis of mutants by thin section          electron microscopy          Thinsection electron microscopy TEM was conducted          to evaluate NPC NE and cellular morphology After          staining with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate NPCs          in wildtypeparental cells were represented by electron          dense structures spanning the pore Figure  In           npa and           npa cells several distinct          perturbations were noted At the permissive temperature           npa cells showed nuclear          invaginations In Figure E a single cell crosssection          showed multiple layers of NE containing NPCs However          the GFPNup localization appeared normal in these cells          at  Figure  After shifting to the nonpermissive          temperature of  for  hours there was a dramatic          change in structural morphology in both           npa and           npa mutants Most striking was          the overproliferation of outer nuclearendoplasmic          reticulum ER membranes This proliferation was often          observed originating from the nucleus and resulted in a          regular honeycomblike array of  nm diameter tubules          Figure Cand F Although it was not always possible to          definitively identify a nucleus in each section Figure          F for example NPCs were present in the envelope          juxtaposed to the nucleus despite the expanded membranes          Figure Cand D Electron dense structures resembling          NPCs were also embedded in membranes distinct from the          nucleusNE Figure F This most likely corresponded          with the cytoplasmic foci observed by fluorescence We          did not observe any evidence of cytoplasmic annulate          lamellae formation although nuclear invaginations          sometimes resulted in juxtaposed double membranes          containing NPCs Figure F There were also no          structures resembling the intranuclear annulate lamellae          observed in some nup mutants      Samples analyzed          by TEM over a time course after shift to  showed that          the membrane proliferation paralleled the GFPNup          mislocalization seen by fluorescence microscopy data not          shown This further suggested that the GFPNup          mislocalization and TEM membrane proliferation were the          consequence of the same process                          Identification of mutants          To identify the mutated genes a yeast genomic library          was screened for complementation of the recessive ts          phenotypes of representative mutants Multiple genomic          inserts capable of rescuing the ts growth defect were          isolated for each strain Sequencing and comparison to          the           Saccharomyces Genome Database          identified a minimal overlapping region on chromosome XII          for the           npa complementing plasmids and          on chromosome XVI in the           npa complementing plasmids Both          regions contained multiple open reading frames however          we focused immediately on a single gene for each mutant           SEC for           npa and           SEC for           npa            SEC was first identified in a          screen for secretory mutants and encodes a protein of the          COPII coat which is required for vesicle budding from          the ER       More recently it has been shown          that a fraction of the total cellular Secp          cofractionates with NPCs in a distinct subcomplex with          Nupp Nupp Nupp NupCp and Sehp                SEC was also identified in a          screen for secretory mutants and it too is a component          of the COPII coat       Copurification of          Secp with intact NPCs has not been reported              however Secp was recently isolated in Nupp and          Nupp affinity chromatography strategies              Expression constructs containing only           SEC or           SEC were transformed into the          mutant strains and assayed for their ability to rescue          growth at the nonpermissive temperature Both minimal          constructs only restored growth of their respective          strain data not shown Importantly the GFPNup          localization phenotype was also complemented Figure                    The ability of           SEC and           SEC to complement the mutants          strongly suggested that mutations in these genes were          responsible for the observed phenotypes However it was          still a formal possibility that the overexpression of          these genes from a low copy plasmid was sufficient for          complementation To eliminate this possibility genomic          DNA from each of the mutants was used as a template in          PCR reactions to generate expression plasmids see          Materials and Methods Sequencing of the           npasec allele identified a          single G to A transition that changed a Gly to Arg at          position  in the protein To test if this mutation was          necessary and sufficient for the observed phenotype the          mutant plasmid was transformed into the original           npa mutant and a           sec covered by p           SEC URA  Expression of p           secGR complemented the          otherwise lethal           sec at  however its          expression was not sufficient to restore growth at the          nonpermissive temperature to either the isolated           npa mutant or           sec data not shown DNA          sequencing analysis showed that the           npasec mutant was identical          to the wellcharacterized           sec            SL  mutant allele              The accumulation of nonsecreted protein in mutants          defective in ER to Golgi transport leads to proliferation          of the ER      The membrane proliferation seen by          TEM in           npasec and           npasec cells Figure  and          the coincident mislocalization of Nups Figure and data          not shown prompted us to test if Nups were accumulating          at the ER Logarithmically growing cultures of           npasec and           npasec were shifted to the          nonpermissive temperature as before and then fixed and          processed for IF with polyclonal antibodies against Karp          to visualize the ER     The monoclonal antibody          mAb which recognizes a subset of Nups distinct from          Nicp and Nupp     was also used because the GFP          fluorescence of the GFPNups was more sensitive to          fixation when the GFPNups were mislocalized than when          they remained at the nuclear rim unpublished          observation In           npasec cells the ER became          punctate and formed discrete foci at later time points          Figure A In contrast           npasec cells rapidly          accumulate an interconnected ER network Figure B          Expansion and changes in ER morphology were observed as          early as one hour after the temperature shift and          continued to increase in magnitude over the four hour          time course Figure  Although the localization          patterns at late time points after temperature shifting          were similar the localizations of the ER protein Karp          and the Nups were not overlapping                          Testing other COPII coat and secretory pathway          components for npagroups          The screen for NPC assemblymislocalization mutants          identified two genes that are part of the COPII coat           SEC and           SEC  To test if other members of          the COPII coat complex were isolated in the screen          conditional alleles in           SEC            SEC            SEC            SAR  and           SEC were kindly provided by other          investigators and tested directly for their effect on          NPC localization The first four genes encode proteins          which along with Secp and Secp form the coat while          Secp is required to recruit and activate Sarp on the          ER for coat assembly     Complementation analysis          between these mutants and those isolated in the screen          failed to identify any of these However when the genes          encoding GFPtagged Nups were crossed into these mutant          backgrounds all displayed GFPNup mislocalization under          nonpermissive conditions Figure and data not shown          The pattern of mislocalization in each case was similar          to that observed in the isolated           sec and           sec mutants          Our continued efforts focused on cloning additional           npa mutants by library          complementation This identified two more genes required          for trafficking between the ER and Golgi A genomic          fragment containing           BET complemented the ts phenotype          of           npa  and           npa was rescued by a library          plasmid only when it contained full length           SEC see Materials and Methods          Betp is part of a complex that binds to COPII derived          vesicles and is required for vesicle targeting               Secp is a component of the COPI coat and required for          Golgi to ER transport      Like           SEC and           SEC mutants others have reported          that mutants in           BET and           SEC result in an          overproliferation of ER membranes               To determine if the overlap between           npa mutants and the secretory          pathway was restricted to gene products affecting the ER          the           sec mutant perturbing Golgi to          plasma membrane transport    was crossed into           the GFPnic nupGFP strain          After  hours at  the same conditions that cause          GFPNup mislocalization in the other assayed           sec mutants the GFPNups in           sec remained localized to the          NPC in the characteristic punctate NE rim pattern          Figure                           Novel npagroups lack secretion defects          The initial isolation of multiple           sec mutants from our screen that          was designed to isolate mutants in NPC assembly and          localization raised the question of whether any of the          mutants were specific for defects in NPC          assemblystructure To pinpoint mutants that lacked          secretion defects we assayed each mutant from the          collection for the ability to secrete the enzyme          invertase in response to low glucose Logarithmically          growing cells were transferred to low glucose media and          incubated at the nonpermissive temperature of  for           hours When invertase activity from individual          mutants was normalized to the activity of the parental          strains a range of relative activities were observed          Figure  With the exception of           npa and           npa  the           sec            npa            sec            npa  and           bet            npa  mutants had less than           of wildtype invertase activity Figure A The           npasec mutants displayed near          wildtype invertase activity indicating that forward          trafficking through the ER was not significantly          disrupted This is consistent with secretion results          reported for other           sec alleles      It is          important to note that despite the lack of secretion          defect the           npasec npasec  and           npasec mutants each had          perturbations in ER structure similar to those of           npa and           npa data not shown The           npasec and           npasec mutants may be unique          alleles that preferentially affect NPC assembly versus          secretion For the unidentified potentially novel          mutants approximately   had less than half of          wildtype invertase activity This suggests secretion may          be impaired in these mutants Alternatively these          mutants may have defects along the pathway leading to          transcriptional upregulation of invertase            SUC  in response to low glucose              Most importantly   of the mutants had          at least  or greater of wildtype activity Figure          B The lack of secretion defects in some of the mutants          indicates that nonnucleoporins are being trafficked          properly when Nups are mislocalized                            Discussion        We have used a genetic strategy to identify factors        required for proper NPC biogenesis By creating a bank of        ts mutants in a doubly tagged         GFPnic nupGFP S        cerevisiae strain and individually screening the        mutants at the nonpermissive temperature we identified         ts mutant strains which fail to correctly localize the        GFPNups at NPCs andor the NE rim In addition to the        mislocalization of GFPNicp and NuppGFP Nupp        Pomp and Nups recognized by mAb were also perturbed        in the mutants characterized to date These Nups are        localized throughout the NPC structure    and indicate a        global defect in NPC assemblystructure Complementation        analysis indicated the mutants were all recessive and fell        into at least  groups In comparison to our previous        genetic screen with a strain expressing only GFPNupp            these results suggest that increasing the number of        GFPNups as reporters for NPC integrity effectively        increases the likelihood of obtaining a panel of mutants        defective in global NPC assembly stability and        localization        Based on the GFPNup localization and genetic analysis        a range of mutant phenotypes and complementation groups        were catalogued Several of the complementation groups        contained multiple independent alleles          npa  and within a single        complementation group the strengths of the defects were        varied However there was only one allele for the majority        of the complementation groups representing potentially         npa This suggests that the        mutagenesis was not saturating and it is likely that        mutations in additional genes that function in NPC        biogenesis would be isolated by repeated application of        this screening strategy In addition the large number of        potential total groups may reflect roles for many factors        in proper NEnuclear morphology and NPC biogenesis We have        identified about  of the groups by complementationbased        cloning The results thus far indicate the screen is        specifically enriched for NENPC specific effects versus        nonspecific mutants that may affect GFPNup protein        stability or levels polymerases transcriptiontranslation        factors chaperones this report and unpublished results        The ts defects in individual         npa mutants may represent failures in        assembly changes in NPC localization or perturbations in        the stability of preexisting NPCs        Here we focused on characterizing the largest        complementation groups The two largest were allelic with         SEC and         SEC  genes encoding known        mediators of vesicular trafficking between the ER and Golgi            The GFPNup mislocalization defects in the         sec          npa  and         sec          npa  mutants correlated with        distinct ER membrane perturbations We also identified         npa as         sec and         npa as         bet  Taken together the recovery        of a large number of         npa mutants that encode components of        the ERGolgi secretory pathway indicate that this is a hot        spot for mutations that cause perturbations in GFPNup        localization        Extensive and elegant studies have documented distinct        changes in membrane morphology in mutants with arrest        points in the secretory pathway Three morphological        classes include         sec mutants with extended networks of        ER membrane those with accumulated Golgi and a third with        accumulated  nm secretory vesicles     The        morphological perturbations directly correlate with        distinct secretory pathway blocks ERGolgi intraGolgi        and Golgiplasma membrane     A recent study in         S pombe has also shown that         sec mutants can affect NE and cell        cycle progression     In addition to         sec  our screen also identified        mutant alleles of         SEC          SEC and         BET  The mislocalization of        GFPNups in         sec and         sec mutants was coincident with the        formation of extensive honeycomb networks of ER        Interestingly we found by direct testing that mutant        alleles corresponding to the genes for all known COPII coat        components resulted in altered GFPNup localization Based        on reports from others all of these mutants have an        overproliferation of ER membranes                   However over the same time course our direct        testing of one         sec mutant with a defect in a later        secretion step did not show perturbations eg the         sec mutant that accumulates        secretory vesicles    did not result in GFPNup        mislocalization Additionally         sec mutants with no apparent defect        in invertase secretion          npasec npasec and         npasec  had both perturbations        in ER structure and Nup localization This suggests that        mutants which disrupt the ER will affect Nup localization        and likely NPC assemblystructure        Connections between Secp and NPC function have been        previously reported A fraction of the total cellular        Secp is isolated in a NPC subcomplex containing Nupp        Nupp Nupp NuppC and Sehp a Secrelated        protein      Hurt and coworkers have also reported        that ts         sec mutants show enhanced growth        defects when combined with a         nup mutant and result in the        mislocalization of GFPNupp to NE clusters and        cytoplasmic foci     This correlates with our        observations of GFPNicp and NuppGFP in our         secnpa mutant However we did        not observe clusters of herniated NPCs in         secGRnpa cells suggesting        the         sec and         sec alleles in the Hurt study        are distinct     Precisely how Secp influences NPC        structurefunction remains to be elucidated        The phenotypes observed in         sec and         sec mutants might indicate that        COPII vesicles andor a vesicular biogenesis step is        required for NPC formation however there are at least two        indirect mechanisms by which NPC structure may be changed        in these mutants Blocking the ERGolgi pathway could        titrate away the pool of Secp that is found at the NPC        Alternatively the extensive ER proliferations that result        are connected to the outer NE and could prevent proper NPC        localization Given that the formation of the extensive        membrane networks in the         sec and         sec mutants was coincident with the        GFPNup mislocalization we favor one of the two indirect        models We feel this conclusion is also supported by our        observation that the distribution of GFPNups was altered        in mutants for all COPII coat components However not all        of the COPII components cofractionate with NPCs              Thus there are COPII components that perturb GFPNup        localization that do not cofractionate with NPCs We        conclude there is no absolute correlation between        localization of a COPII component at the NPC and its        ability to disrupt NPC structurefunction Instead it is        the         sec mutants that alter ER structure        that effect Nup localization        The defects that we have observed in GFPNup        localization in various         sec mutants are distinct from recent        reports characterizing a novel arrest of secretion response        in         S cerevisiae cells Tartakoff and        coworkers have proposed that mutants with a secretory block        show altered nuclear transport capacities changes in the        nuclear localization of particular proteins and potential        perturbations of NPC composition      In our         sec and         sec mutants we do not believe NPC        composition has changed but rather that NPC localization        has been altered by formation of extended ER networks                    Conclusions        Taken together the work to date supports a framework        wherein a network of in vivo interactions mediate NPC        biogenesis structural integrity and proper localization        in the NE A complete understanding of the role of the NPC        in nuclear transport will require the identification of all        the genes that regulate its assembly stability and        localization Although the         npasec mutants characterized here        are due to ER distortions we predict that further analysis        of the other         npa mutants and GFPbased genetic        strategies will significantly contribute to the effort of        identifying factors required for NPC biogenesis                    Methods                  Yeast Strains          All yeast strains

    stored in water at  for three days until the viability          could be analyzed The remaining mutagenized cell          cultures were then plated to obtain  colonies          from each strain To achieve this number we assumed that          roughly half of the cells died during the  storage          Temperature sensitive mutants were isolated by replica          plating the master to both  and

        grown at  for  hours before shifting to  for           hours The majority of the strains were in          logarithmic growth phase at the time of the temperature          shift GFP

overlapping inserts capable of rescuing the temperature          sensitive growth defect were isolated for each strain          Sequencing of the insert ends and comparison to the           S cerevisiae Genome Database          identified a region on chromosome XVI for           npa and           npa and chromosome XII for           npa  Plasmids expressing only           SEC or           SEC were used to test if these          genes were necessary and sufficient for rescuing the          phenotypes Library inserts rescuing           npa contained a region of          chromosome VII encompassing           SEC A partial deletion of           SEC from one of the inserts          pSW was used to confirm that           SEC was responsible for rescue of          the growth defect The temperature sensitive growth          defect of           npa was rescued by a region on          chromosome XI from YKRW to the  end of           MET  The only essential gene in          this region is           BET                           Invertase Assays          Mutants were grown at  overnight in  ml YPD to          logarithmic phase The equivalent of  ml of a  OD            cell culture was washed into YP          media containing  glucose and incubated at  for           hours The incubation was ended by addition of an          equal volume of  mM sodium azide Cell pellets were          washed once with  mM sodium azide then resuspended in           l of  mM sodium azide Assays of invertase          activity were performed with  l of each sample          according to      The activity of each mutant was          normalized to the activity of the parental strain assayed          at the same time
