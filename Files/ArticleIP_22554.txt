                                  A Labor of Linux            Linux may be impracticalfor the masses but its rebel cachetThe Man doesnt have me under histhumbappeals to the motorcyclist in me Walking out of a bookstore with aLinux manual under your arm is like swaggering into a restaurant carrying amotorcycle helmet You can feel the waves of envy            Since my technical education ended with aseventhgrade Computer Literacy class in which we played Lemonade Stand onan Apple IIe for half an hour twice a week my Linux goals for this articlewere modest                           Prove that a computer ignoramus can install the operating system on acomputer that was running Windows                Install a Linuxcompatible Web browser and read                      Slate                   init               Install a few other Linux applications                        Purchasing Linux in a book I must admit was a secondresort Originally I intended to download the free version of themuchheralded operating system but then I found out that it would take fivehours and that the download doesnt come with instructions Chickening out Ivisited the computer section of my local bookstore and grabbed a copy of thefriendly yellow Linux for Dummies  But the cashier all but refused tosell it to me You cant get that book he said obviously speaking as one ofthe Linux initiate On his advice I paid  plus tax for MasteringLinux  a phonebooksized tome which includes a copy of Red Hat Softwares version of Linux on CD            Cracking MasteringLinux open I was struck by its similarity to motorcycle manuals Removecylinder head says the average motorcycle manual without explaining how youdo that Create boot disk commands Mastering Linux  Whats a bootdisk I found myself turning to a dictionaryof computer terminology on the Web to decipher every third acronym BIOSATAPI SCSI and figured out that in this case you create an installation bootdisk by copying files from the CD to a floppy                           Making Room forLinux                        After creating the boot disk I was supposed tomake a new partition on the hard disk of my computer a Pentium  with megs of memory Partitioning a hard disk means corralling off some space andthat can be done in Windows with a program called fips which I copied fromthe Linux CD onto a floppy in Windows I then restarted Windows in DOS modeone of the options when you shut down Windows  and ran fipsexe from thefloppy Although I had never used DOS before I followed the straightforwarddirections and made room for Linux            The next step was to runthe Linux installation program from the boot disk I shut the computer down andput the boot disk in the drive and turned the computer back on Success Theboot disk asked me to check boxes for the language and the keyboard Id beusing and the source from which Id be installing Linux I told it to go to myCDROM drive where the Linux CD residedand promptly hit a brick wall Theprogram refused to recognize my CDROM drive a fairly standard one andrejected the  nonstandard options from the list I studied Windows devicemanager for clues on my CDROM drive Mastering Linux suggested that ifthe installation program fails to detect your drive provide very specificdirections for the IO and IRQ I entered these new settings and stillfailed            Everyone who talks up Linux mentions how elegant it isAs I tinkered rebooted and failed and tinkered rebooted and failed overand over again to get it to recognize my CDROM drive all I could think wasyeah elegant like a JudasCradle And this was only the installation program            So I telephoned theMicrosoft Helpdesk Even though Linux is supposed to demolish Microsoft theMicrosoft Helpdesk which provides computer assistance to its employees wassurprisingly helpful As I described my trouble the Help guy replied Youresetting up Linux Pause Um you know we dont really support that Yeah Iknow but can you help me anyway Well I dont know much about Linux buttalk to Clarence not his real name Hell help you In  or so calls to theHelpdesk I encountered only one person who sounded annoyed rather than curiousand even dare I say gleeful at the fact I was firing up Linux                           A Case of MistakenIdentity                        The Linux that came with Mastering Linux wasnever going to communicate with my CDROM drive and I began to lose allenthusiasm for the project Just the sight of Mastering Linux inducedthe stomachchurning sense of dread that my sixthgrade math textbook once gaveme I dont get this Other people get this Why dont I get this I thinkIll go watch TV            Instead of watching TVI made a fresh start by purchasing a newer version of Linux The version ofLinux that comes in Mastering Linux offers no technical assistance butRed Hats version  which costs  promises one month of free emailsupport CORRECTION After this article was posted I learned thatMacmillan Digital Publishing and not Red Hat Software provided the emailsupport for this version of Linux That new information is now reflected in theremainder of the piece                        The Red Hat manual offered clearer directions and the newversion automatically partitioned my hard drive But it still snubbed my CDROMdrive I emailed Macmillan with my problem and the company emailed back aoneline response Set your BIOS to boot off of the CD I wrote back How doI do that Macmillans email answer was another oneliner a URL I clickedthe link which led to a page of more links to lots of information on BIOS buta halfhour search yielded no information on booting from the CDROM drive Iemailed back asking for a more specific URL and they wrote back Look aroundthere  You also may want to check the site of whoever manufactured themotherboard Thanks a bunch            With Microsoft Helpdesk assistance I figured outthat my CDROM drive was probably connected to my sound card and not to the IDEport and thus was foiling Linux I reluctantly returned to MasteringLinux and found an alternative method for installing the operating systemfor people who dont have CDROM drives install from the hard disk For thisyou create a supplementary disk from the CDROM and use it after booting fromthe installation disk The supplementary disk loaded an unfamiliar blueWelcome to Red Hat Linux page but after  minutes of nothing happening Ifigured I had worn out my welcome I turned off the computer and went home            My next move was tohornswoggle a friend a tech guy at the New York Times Web site intohelping me I informed him of my CDROMsound card suspicions and he priedopen my computers metal box and started gabbing about pin connections Mytroubles were over Here was someone who knew the acronyms someone who couldshine a light into the cave I was blindly fumbling in So with the CDROM drivesecurely connected to the correct IDE port in my motherboard we booted upagain Again no dice It was a new low in my Linux morale                           Any IDE Port in aStorm                        After some chin scratching my friend suggested welook into my BIOS setting There he discovered my IDE port was disabled Heenabled it We booted up and victory The CDROM drive started purring andfrom there the installation was cake The hard disk whirred away occasionallyasking for information I typed it in it whirred some more and within an hourinstallation was complete            I then logged on as rootthe master userandloaded X Windows Linuxs graphical user interface It looked like a pale andwan version of Microsoft Windowswith tiny little crude buttonseven thoughit predates Windows But it worked I loaded the Netscape browser and tried tocall up                   Slate                but                   Slate                did not appear Instead Igot two error messages one telling me to adjust my SOCKS environment andanother saying there was something wrong with my DNS server            So I was on the phonewith the Helpdesk again learning about my SOCKS and my DNS server Myofficemate suggested that maybe all I needed to do was adjust my proxy settingsin Netscape and not my SOCKS He was right and victory was mine                           I Suffer a CoreDump                        Next I wanted a wordprocessing program I downloaded WordPerfect  for Linux from Corels Web siteI unzipped and untarred dearchived the program I installed it And itdidnt run I bribed my tech guy friend to come and help me again He went backto the original download and started over but he couldnt get it to runeither So he fiddled around with my PATH and a few other things beyond mycomprehension when a core dump occurred This is some type of serious erroralthough Im still not sure exactly what it is So we started over anddownloaded again After reinstalling and receiving increasingly mournful errormessages Unable to go on Floating point exception and another core dumpwe called it quits Three and a half hours of help from a guy who makes hisliving working with computers and no WordPerfect to show for it            Why would a person like me want to use Linux The firstreason is price Linux is free if you download it off the Web With a manualand a CD its about  Compare that with Windows   for a full setup for an upgrade or bundled for free as part of nearly every nonMacintoshcomputer I didnt investigate running Windows software under a LinuxWindowsemulator mostly because I already have Windows on my system to runWindows software I also didnt attach my Linux machine to the companynetworkbecause I couldnt find easy instructions in my books and furtherconsultations with the Helpdesk would have been cheating Im fairly certainthat setting up a printer is easy but Im taking the word of Linux experts onthis            Either Im not ready for Linux or Linux isntready for me Or both I feel guilty about having used not one but two manualsto install Linux and worse still that I couldnt make WordPerfect work I feelmalignantly guilty about having paid cash money for a free operating system andfor enlisting both the Helpdesk and a friend in my endeavor Yes I finishedthe marathon but I did it by putting on roller skates and grabbing thesuspenders of those who knew what they were doing
