                    Background        Microglia are leukocytes derived outside the central        nervous system in the bone marrow from where they enter        the circulation as monocytes and migrate into the brain        during late embryonic life establishing permanent residency            Two different phenotypic forms of microglia are        known the activated but nonphagocytic microglia which        play a role in inflammatory pathologies and the reactive        or phagocytic microglia which participate actively in        trauma infection and neuronal degeneration                    In vivo as well as         in vitro administration of LPS        rapidly and potently activates rat adult and neonatal        microglia for review see Ref     Accompanying both        adult and neonatal microglia activation by LPS    is a        concomitant release of numerous secretory products for        review see Ref     that include tissue plasminogen        activator     reactive oxygen species such as O                cytokines like TNF            and proteases in particular MMP      in a time        and concentrationdependent manner These mediators have        been implicated in sublethal and lethal neuronal and glial        injury     neuronal degeneration      that        could potentially affect neurodevelopment in the immature        brain        Exposure to the marine toxin domoic acid an excitotoxic        amino acid structurally similar to kainic acid and to the        neurotransmitter glutamic acid has been shown to lead to        amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans a condition that can        lead to death in extreme cases     Currently the        Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition US Food and        Drug Administration has included amnesic shellfish        poisoning as one of the          five recognized fish poisoning        syndromes in the United States  together with        paralytic neurotoxic diarrhetic and ciguatera fish        poisoning FDA website        httpvmcfsanfdagovdmshaccpfhtml     Recent        behavioral toxicity studies in rodents have confirmed that        domoic acid is a very rapid and potent neurotoxin in        newborn rats at doses far lower than in adult animals              Even though hippocampal pyramidal neurons and        mossy fiber terminals appear to be selectively targeted         in vivo by domoic acid in rat           and cynomolgus monkey brain     recently domoic acid        was shown to affect glutamate uptake by astrocytes         in vitro and          thus produced neurotoxicity             Of interest is the fact that no studies to our        knowledge have investigated the potential contribution of        brain microglia to neonatal neurotoxicity after a        shortterm exposure to domoic acid            The possibility that domoic acid may activate neonatal        microglia both         in vitro and         in vivo is suggested by recent        observations with kainic acid a domoic acid and glutamate        analog that can induce upregulation of neonatal microglia        scavenger receptor mRNA    and tissue plasminogen        activator release     The putative molecular        explanation for these observations has been that kainic        acid activates the ionotropic AMPA glutamate GluR subunit        which has recently been shown to be expressed by activated        microglia following transient forebrain ischemia         in vivo     Because this subunit        of the AMPA glutamate receptor has affinity for domoic acid              we hypothesized that domoic acid might        activate neonatal microglia         in vitro and lead to concomitant        mediator release            The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a        shortterm         in vitro exposure to domoic acid        might activate rat neonatal microglia and cause mediator        release Using LPS which we have previously shown is a        rapid and potent         in vitro activator of neonatal        microglia    as our positive control we focused our        investigation on three microglia mediators which are        released upon LPS activation namely TNF MMP and O               Our present study        demonstrates that in contrast to LPS during a  hour         in vitro exposure to domoic acid        neonatal rat microglia release small but statistically        significant amounts of TNF and MMP Furthermore our        observations suggest that         in vivo brain microglia as well as        the mediators released by this cell type in brain tissue        would appear to play a limited role in the rapid and potent        domoic acid neurotoxicity observed in neonatal rats after a        shortterm administration of domoic acid                    Results                  Determination of domoic acid by electrospray mass          spectrometry          The presence of undegraded domoic acid in both stock          solution  mM and dilutions prepared with LPSfree          water was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry          prior to the experiments As shown for the  mM domoic          acid stock solution in Fig A the dominate ion in the          spectrum was           mz  which is the          pseudomolecular ion MH of domoic acid Also present          in the spectrum were           mz  the sodium adduct MNa          of domoic acid           mz  the dimer MH of          domoic acid and           mz  MNa  the sodium          adduct of the dimer The dimer was formed in the gas          phase due to the high concentration of the sample Mass          spectra for dilution of   and  mM also          showed as the dominate ion           mz  domoic acid MH data          not shown As shown in Fig B for the lowest domoic          acid concentration used in our studies namely  mM          domoic acid although background noise dominated the          sample           mz  the domoic acid MH          was clearly seen in the spectrum                          Immunofluorescent visualization of CDbc and          glutamate receptor subunit GluR in rat neonatal          microglia          It has recently been reported that transient forebrain          ischemia leads to the expression of the inotropic AMPA          glutamate receptor GluR subunit           in vivo    in rat neonatal          microglia In order to ascertain that under our          experimental conditions rat neonatal microglia expressed          the GluR subunit we studied the expression of the AMPA          receptor GluR by immunohistochemistry The top left          photo in Fig shows a bright field phase contrast view          of microglia that were incubated in the absence of the          primary antibodies against GluR and CDbc Note that          the microglia are irregular in shape and show numerous          elongated processes extending from the bodies of the          cells In addition numerous vesicular structures are          present in the cytoplasm of the microglia The top right          photo shows the same microglia when viewed using the FITC          filter configuration Note that the vesicular structures          exhibit an intense autofluorescence but that little or          no fluorescence is evident over most of the microglia          cell bodies or in the elongated processes Interestingly          this same pattern of autofluorescence was evident when          the microglia were viewed with the TRITC filter          configuration not shown The middle left photo shows a          bright field phase contrast view of microglia that had          been labeled with the antibodies against the glutamate          receptor GluR subunit and the leukocyte marker CDbc          Again the microglia are irregular in shape with          elongated processes extending from the cell bodies and          numerous vesicles present in the cytoplasm The middle          right photo green shows this same field when viewed          using the FITC filter configuration As evident the          microglia not only contain fluorescent vesicles but also          exhibit a prominent speckled pattern of fluorescence over          the cell bodies and the elongated processes The fact          that this speckled pattern of labeling is not present in          the samples that were incubated without the primary GluR          antibody compare with top right photo strongly          indicates that the speckled pattern represents specific          labeling of GluR subunit The lower left photo shows          that these same microglia exhibited intense labeling of          CDbc red which confirms that the microglia are of          leukocytic origin In the bottom right photo the images          showing the GluR and the CDbc labeling have been          superimposed yellow Together these results indicate          that GluR glutamate receptor subunits are present on the          cell surface and that these cells are in fact          microglia                          Effect of domoic acid on cerebellar granule cell          and rat neonatal microglia viability          Domoic acid has been reported to be neurotoxic to          neuronal tissue           in vitro in concentrations ranging          from  M to  mM          In order to          determine a concentration of domoic acid that was          neurotoxic           in vitro during a  hour exposure          we investigated the concentrationdependent effect of          domoic acid on cerebellar granule neurons using the WST          viability assay This assay measures cell viability as a          function of cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST by          mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells to formazan          As shown in Fig Cand Dthe viability of primary          cerebellar granule cells exposed for up to  hours to          domoic acid  M mM was significantly affected P            In contrast to our observations with          cerebellar granule neurons domoic acid even at the          highest neurotoxic concentration tested in our           in vitro study namely  mM did          not affect microglia viability during a  hour exposure          Fig Aand B Because  mM domoic acid was clearly          neurotoxic in our studies this concentration was          selected for all           in vitro experiments with          microglia LPS  ngml did not affect microglia          viability           in vitro during a  hour exposure          data not shown                          Effect of LPS and domoic acid on TNF mRNA          expression from rat neonatal microglia          Activation of microglia has been shown to cause the          release of cytokines such as TNF      As shown in          Fig A stimulation of microglia with LPS  ngml          resulted in a timedependent increase in TNF mRNA          expression relative to controls as determined by          semiquantitative RTPCR at the linear range of          amplification  cycles Without LPS treatment          control TNF mRNA expression was undetectable As          shown in Fig  the relative levels of TNF expression          increased  fold by  hour and remained elevated          throughout the  hour observation period In contrast to          the marked increase in TNF expression induced by LPS          as shown in Fig B domoic acid  mM induced a less          potent yet timedependent increase in TNF mRNA          expression as determined by semiquantitative RTPCR over          the linear range of amplification  cycles As shown          in Fig  although not statistically significant the          relative levels of TNF expression increased twofold by           hours and remained elevated during the next two          hours                          Effect of domoic acid and LPS on rat neonatal          microglia release of TNF          In order to determine if the increase in TNF mRNA          after a short term stimulation with either domoic acid           mM or LPS  ngmL led to a concomitant production of          TNF protein the cellfree media corresponding to the          same microglia used for TNF mRNA analysis were assayed          with an ultrasensitive ratspecific ELISA As expected          and shown in Fig  LPS  ngmL stimulated microglia          timedependent TNF release by  hours TNF levels          increased   and were    pgmL          LPStreated n   vs    pgmL untreated          controls n   P   In contrast to LPS levels          of immunoreactive TNF in the tissue culture media          increased    hours after microglia were treated          with domoic acid  mM and were    pgmL domoic          acidtreated n   vs    pgmL untreated          controls n   P   Interestingly the  hour          time point corresponded to the highest level of TNF          mRNA expression shown in Fig                           Effect of domoic acid and LPS on rat neonatal          microglia release of MMP and MMP          We have recently shown that a stimulation of microglia          with LPS will lead to both TNF generation and MMP          production a mediator that has been reported to be toxic          to neuronal tissue     As shown in Fig  when          microglia were stimulated with LPS  ngmL an          increase in MMP and MMP release was observed by           hours MMP inverse OD levels increased   and          were respectively    LPStreated n   vs             untreated controls n   P            In contrast to LPS a   increase in MMP levels was          observed in the tissue culture media  hours after          microglia were treated with domoic acid  mM inverse          OD levels were respectively    domoic          acidtreated n   vs    untreated          controls n   P   Domoic acid  mM had no          effect on MMP release                          Effect of domoic acid and LPS on rat neonatal          microglia release of O           We have shown that while unprimed naive microglia          release low levels of O             pretreatment with LPS results in          an increase of PMAstimulated O                 As is depicted in Fig A          when microglia were pretreated for  hours with LPS           ngmL there was as expected an increase in PMA           Mstimulated O             production    nmoles          hours LPSpretreated n   vs    nmoles          hours untreated controls n   P   In          contrast a  hour pretreatment of microglia with domoic          acid  mM yielded no statistically significant          increase in PMA  Mstimulated O             generation    nmoles          hours domoic acid pretreated n   vs             nmoles hours untreated controls n   Furthermore          domoic acid did not affect PMA  Mstimulated O             generation from  hour          LPSpretreated microglia    nmoles hours          LPSpretreated n   vs    nmoles hours          LPS  domoic acid pretreated n   Finally as shown          in Fig B though not statistically significant a           hour stimulation with increasing concentrations of domoic          acid and PMA  M reduced O             generation from  hours          LPSpretreated microglia    nmoles hours          domoic acid  mM  PMA  M n   vs             nmoles hours untreated controls n                              Discussion        Although domoic acids excitotoxicity to         adult neuronal tissue in humans        rats mice and monkeys is well documented for review see        Ref     a growing body of research also suggests        that there might be increased vulnerability during the         neonatal period       The        fact that the bloodbrain barrier is incomplete            provides a putative explanation as to why neonates and        fetal mice         in utero appear to be more sensitive        to neurotoxins like domoic acid than adult animals              Although microglia contribute to circa  of the        total glial cell population in the central nervous system        For review see Ref     to our knowledge no        previous studies have investigated the potential role of        microglia in mediating the neurotoxic effects of domoic        acid in the developing rat brain We have recently        hypothesized that the marine toxin domoic acid might affect        the developing brain by directly activating neonatal rat        microglia and causing a subsequent release of potentially        neurotoxic mediators            Prior to testing our hypothesis experimentally and        determining whether domoic acid had the potential to        directly activate rat neonatal microglia         in vitro we thought that it was of        critical importance to establish that  the domoic acid        preparation used in these experiments was stable  rat        neonatal microglia isolated by our methodology expressed        the AMPA glutamate receptor GluR subunit which has been        observed in activated rat microglia         in vivo    and  to confirm        that the domoic acid concentration selected for our         in vitro studies with rat neonatal        microglia was one that was clearly toxic to neuronal cells         in vitro after a shortterm        exposure        Although it has been reported that the solubility of        domoic acid in water is approximately  gL  mM            rapid and complete dissolution of domoic acid was        only consistently observed in our laboratory when preparing        a stock domoic acid solution of  mM in certified        LPSfree water To rule out the possibility that domoic        acid might have degraded as a consequence of either our        preparative method or the subsequent freezing C and        thawing of the domoic acid stock solution electrospray        mass spectrometry was run on both the domoic acid stock        solution  mM and the dilutions prepared prior to the        experiments Our electrospray mass spectrometry results        clearly showed that undegraded domoic acid was present        demonstrating the stability of domoic acid in the aqueous        solutions that had been frozen at C and thawed prior to        use in the experiments Interestingly our observations        complement those recently reported on domoic acids        stability in saline solutions            The ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptor GluR subunit has        been shown to be expressed by activated rat adult microglia                in vivo following transient forebrain        ischemia    and also         in vitro by rat neonatal microglia            Because it is well established that AMPA glutamate        receptors bind domoic acid with high affinity in the        nanomolar range     we investigated the presence of        GluR in rat neonatal microglia used in our         in vitro experiments by a        duallabeling indirect immunofluorescence technique Our        results clearly confirmed that GluR was present in the rat        neonatal microglia used in our         in vitro studies with domoic acid        demonstrating that the protocol used in our laboratory to        isolate microglia did not appear to affect the presence of        the AMPA glutamate receptor GluR subunits and their        colocalization with the CD  bc integrin        The cytotoxicity of domoic acid to neuronal tissue         in vitro has been investigated over a        wide range of concentrations namely at  M with primary        cultures of cerebellar neurons     as well as        hippocampal slices     at  M with cultured        prenatal rat hippocampal neurons    and at  mM with        rat lumbar spinal interneurons     In order to        determine a concentration of domoic acid for our         in vitro studies that was toxic to        cerebellar granule cells after a shortterm exposure in our        experimental conditions we completed a viability study        using the WST method The results of this study        demonstrated that even though the highest concentration of        domoic acid tested namely  mM did         not affect rat neonatal microglia        viability         in vitro domoic acid concentrations        as low as  M were clearly cytotoxic to cerebellar        granule neurons after a  hour exposure Because cerebellar        granule cells appear to be inherently resistant to the        cytotoxic effects of excitatory amino acids and        neurotoxicity appears to be          facilitated when cellular energy is        limited in cultured cerebellar neurons             perhaps manipulating the experimental conditions eg        lowering the temperature to C might have enhanced the        intensity of the observed cytotoxicity to cerebellar        neurons even further as was reported recently when        cerebellar granule cells were exposed to  M domoic acid        for up to  hours     Future work is necessary to        determine if similar changes in the experimental conditions        might also increase the toxicity of domoic acid to rat        neonatal microglia         in vitro It is interesting to note        however that in newborn mice a brief local application of         mM domoic acid to the exposed cortical surface led to a        massive degeneration of AMPAKA GluR receptor positive        CajalRetzius neurons     severe impairment of        cortical neuronal migration         in vivo and malformation of the        domoic acidtreated neocortex     Thus because  mM        domoic acid was clearly toxic to cerebellar granule neurons        both         in vitro our current study and         in vivo     we selected  mM        domoic acid for the experiments with rat neonatal microglia        reported herein        Having determined that our domoic acid preparation was        stable and undegraded that rat neonatal microglia        expressed GluR         in vitro and that  mM domoic acid        was toxic to cerebellar granule neurons         in vitro but did not affect the        viability of rat neonatal microglia we then investigated        whether a short term  hour exposure to  mM domoic acid        would activate rat neonatal microglia         in vitro In all our experiments we        compared domoic acids effect with that of  ngml LPS a        potent and rapid microglia activator     to clearly        show that rat neonatal microglia were able to become        rapidly activated and release mediators ie TNF MMP        and O           upon shortterm         in vitro treatment We have recently        reported on the kinetics of LPS activation of rat neonatal        microglia and the concomitant release of TNF protein        MMP and O               These three microglia        mediators are currently thought to participate in neuronal        and glial injury         in vivo             TNF is a cytokine that can mediate myelin and        oligodendrocyte damage in vitro    and thought to play        a key role in central nervous system pathologies             In vitro E coli LPS can trigger rat        neonatal microglia to rapidly activate TNF gene        expression and subsequent protein release    in a        concentration and timedependent manner Although         in vitro exposure of rat neonatal        microglia to  ngml LPS resulted as expected in a rapid        elevation of both TNF gene expression and protein        release we observed only a small effect of  mM domoic        acid on TNF gene expression Interestingly the slight        rise in TNF expression yielded a   p          increase of TNF protein release  hours after stimulation        with  mM domoic acid Although we feel it may be premature        to speculate on the putative pathophysiological        significance of this increase in immunoreactive TNF the        fact that TNF can induce MMP expression in macrophages            suggests that TNF may play an as yet        undetermined role in the mechanism of MMP release        observed in our studies Futhermore immunoPCR techniques        which have allowed investigators to study the kinetics of        TNF release at the femtomolar range     might help        to study the kinetics of picomolar microglia TNF release        triggered by a shortterm exposure to domoic acid These        proposed studies might be of considerable significance in        view of the fact that similar amounts of TNF release have                also been observed after a  hour        stimulation of rat neonatal microglia with kainic acid a        domoic acid and glutamate analog     Taken together        our results with domoic acid as well as those of Noda et        al    with kainic acid support the recently proposed        notion that TNF might not be neurotoxic in some        situations when the release of this mediator is low and        therefore might not be a necessary requirement for neuronal        death involving excitatory amino acids            Proteases such as MMP     which have been        implicated in sublethal and lethal neuronal and glial        injury         in vivo in          central nervous system        diseases     are released by LPSactivated rat        neonatal microglia         in vitro     by a mechanism that        may involve TNF      Clearly because in our        studies  mM domoic acid stimulated both an increase in        TNF release as well as MMP further investigation of a        possible relationship between these two events may be        important Furthermore though the magnitude of MMP        secretion stimulated by domoic acid was lower than the one        observed with LPS this is the first observation to our        knowledge that an excitatory amino acid like domoic acid is        able to trigger MMP release         in vitro Although at the present        time it is difficult to comment on the pathophysiological        significance of increased MMP release it is perhaps        noteworthy that increased MMP expression has been        correlated with increased apoptosis    and increased        microvascular permeability     events possibly        involved in the opening of the bloodbrain barrier           and potential injury to the brain            Microglia constitute the main leukocytedependent source        of reactive oxygen species in the central nervous system            Since microglia were first shown to release O              numerous investigations have        been undertaken over the past  years to characterize        agents than can either prime andor trigger the microglia O                  generating system for review see        Ref     In our current experiments we observed that         mM domoic acid did not prime rat neonatal microglia for        PMAstimulated O           release again in marked contrast        with LPS Interestingly though domoic acid appeared to        modulate LPSprimed rat neonatal microglia O           release suggesting that domoic acid        might potentially play a role in the         in vivo modulation of activated rat        neonatal microglia and perhaps other leukocytes capable of        releasing O                  In summary in our experiments the         in vitro effect of a  hour        exposure to domoic acid on rat neonatal microglia        activation and concomitant TNF MMP and O           release was clearly         distinct in its magnitude from that        observed after exposure to LPS an agent involved in        endotoxic shock and other central nervous pathologies            Even though this present study was limited to the study        of the         in vitro effects of domoic acid on        three microglia mediators namely TNF MMP and O           it provides the first experimental        evidence to our knowledge that domoic acid at         in vitro concentrations that are        toxic to neuronal cells can trigger a limited activation        of rat neonatal microglia and the concomitant release of        modest though statistically significant amounts of TNF        and MMP        Our investigation does not exclude the possibility that         in vitro domoic acid may affect        expression of genes and mediators that might support        survival of neuronal cells Several lines of evidence        appear to support this possibility Thus in a recent        report ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptors were shown to          function not only as ion channels but        also as cellsurface transducers by means of their        interaction with the Srcfamily nonreceptor protein kinase        Lyn  ultimately leading to          expression of brainderived        neurotrophic factor BDNF messenger RNA  in        cerebellar primary culture neurons     In another        study basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF was shown to        significantly protect cerebellar granule neurons in culture        from the neurotoxicity by domoic acid perhaps          through a direct interaction of bFGF        and bFGF receptors on the neuronal surface             Interestingly because rat neonatal microglia have been        shown to express BDNF    and bFGF     and in view        of the fact that LPS can affect BDNF gene expression in rat        neonatal microglia cells     experiments are currently        underway in our laboratory to determine if domoic acid may        affect neonatal rat microglia expression of both BDNF and        bFGF However we do not rule out the possibility that        growth factors other than BDNF and bFGF could be released        by domoic acidstimulated neonatal microglia cells and play        a role in neuroprotection from excitotoxic injury                    Conclusions        Our present results provide the first experimental        evidence to support the hypothesis that a         direct interaction of domoic acid        with rat neonatal microglia         in vitro leads to the release of        small but statistically significant amounts of two        potentially neurotoxic mediators namely TNF and MMP        after a shortterm         in vitro exposure These observations        are of considerable significance if future research        demonstrates that higher levels of TNF and MMP are        generated by neonatal rat microglia as a result of either         a synergistic interaction between domoic acid          when in association with subtoxic        concentrations of excitatory amino acids  a        combination that has been shown to increase the        neurotoxicity of domoic acid to primary cultures of        cerebellar neurons    or  an increase in the time of        exposure to domoic acid as we have reported is the case        with LPS     The fact that domoic acid has been shown        to activate rat microglia several days after         in vivo administration    clearly        raises this latter possibility        An understanding of the potential neurotoxic andor        neuroprotective effects of domoic acid in neonatal rats        will ultimately lead to a better understanding of domoic        acids effect in neonatal human development This concept        is supported by the established fact that glutamate        receptors are highly conserved between mammals            Ultimately studies contributing to the characterization of        the early biochemical as well as cellular events subsequent        to an intoxication with the marine toxin domoic acid will        yield new insights for the rationale
