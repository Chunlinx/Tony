                    Introduction        The term sepsis is used to define the systemic        inflammatory response to an infectious agent ie        bacterial viral fungal or parasitic Despite the use of        new treatment modalities improvements in technology and        increased experience mortality rates in sepsis remain high           Critical care physicians have at their disposal a        variety of data to serve as a guide in discriminating        infectious from noninfectious conditions in newly admitted        patients In a number of newly admitted patients the        diagnosis of sepsis becomes clear after taking the medical        history and completing the physical examination   In        other cases in which noninfectious insults are responsible        for systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS eg        trauma burns haemorrhages hypothermia pancreatitis and        surgery or in comatose patients the diagnosis of sepsis        remains difficult        Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate        antimicrobial chemotherapy is of the utmost importance in        reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with        sepsis The lack of specific early markers of infection may        be responsible in part for withholding delaying or        unnecessary antimicrobial treatment in critically ill        patients   Thus there is an unmet need for clinical or        laboratory tools that can distinguish between SIRS and        sepsis Various markers of sepsis including Creactive        protein CRP tumour necrosis factor TNF IL IL        and IL have all been studied for their ability to        differentiate SIRS from sepsis      Several        investigators have questioned the diagnostic accuracy of        procalcitonin PCT measurement results with which have        been inconsistent and variable        Thus        it may not be easy to discriminate between SIRS and sepsis        even with the use of PCT        The present study was conducted to determine the        procalcitonin level at early diagnosis and        differentiation in patients with systemic inflammatory        response syndrome SIRS and sepsis in comparison with        Creactive protein IL IL IL and tumour necrosis        factor in an unselected population of patients suffering        from a broad range of diseases in an intensive care unit        ICU                    Methods                  Laboratory measurements          CRP was measured using a routine turbidimetry assay          ILAD Instrumentation Laboratory Milan Italy a          value greater than  mgl was considered to be          abnormally elevated TNF and IL IL and IL were          measured using commercially available cheluminesan kits          ImmuliteOne DTC Los Angeles CA USA All cytokine          samples were analyzed in duplicate PCT levels normal          range  ngl were determined by means of a specific          and ultrasensitive immunoluminometric assay LUMI test          PCT Brahms Ag Hennigsdorf Berlin Germany                          Statistical analysis          For multiple group comparisons of CRP ILs and PCT          oneway analysis of variance was applied with least          squares difference for           post hoc comparison The best          cutoff value of parameters for the diagnosis of sepsis          was determined according to the Youdens index method          The ability of PCT to predict sepsis was evaluated by          performing receiver operative characteristic analyses to          compare SIRS versus sepsis patients   Furthermore          the areas under the receiver operative characteristic          curve AUCs were determined as well as the          positivenegative predictive values Positive predictive          values and negative predictive values indicate the          proportion of patients with a cytokine level greater than          or below the chosen cutoff point Test effectiveness is          the sum of the positive predictive values and negative          predictive values Thus the maximum score is  which          represents perfect prediction both positive and negative            The septic shock group was not included in this          analysis because of insufficient data Statistical          analyses were conducted using the Statistical Program for          Social Science SPSS Chicago IL USA           P   was considered          statistically significant Data in the text are shown as          mean  standard error or as median and percentiles                                      Results        A total of  patients  men and  women were        included in the study The median age of the patients was           years The duration of stay of the patients in the        ICU was    days The final retrospectively        confirmed diagnoses of all patients are shown in Table                For each of the time points assessed in the present        study patients were categorized into the three groups        namely SIRS sepsis and septic shock No severely septic        patients were identified Ten patients died on the second        day following admission to the ICU and those patients        underwent only two assessments Thus a total of         assessments of the patients clinical status were conducted        referred to hereafter as conditions  of which        indicated SIRS  of all patients  sepsis  of all        patients and  septic shock  of all patients        Of the  conditions of sepsis and septic shock          involved pneumonia   urogenital infection          intraperitoneal abscess and   wound infection        In three patients no infectious focus could be found but        blood cultures were positive Infections were        microbiologically proven in   conditions with         being Gramnegative  Grampositive and  mixed        infections Of the five conditions with SIRS tracheal        cultures were positive but did not exhibit any host        response they were therefore considered colonization        Eight patients did not receive antimicrobial treatment in        any of the study periods Five of the patients who died          were in septic shock group and the other five        patients who died   were in the sepsis        group        APACHEII scores did not differ between groups No        correlation was found between PCT concentrations and        APACHEII scores          r   Serum concentrations of        CRP TNF and IL were not statistically different        between SIRS sepsis and septic shock groups IL IL        and PCT levels were different between groups Septic shock        patients had the highest level of IL IL and PCT        concentrations Median and percentiles  for        all parameters and APACHEII scores in patients with SIRS        sepsis and septic shock are presented in Table         Because we only six septic shock conditions were        identified we employed only SIRS and sepsis conditions for        statistical analysis of diagnostic reliability of serum PCT        and cytokines Using Youdens Index the best cutoff value        for PCT was  ngml The best cutoff value and AUC for        all markers are shown in Table  The AUC was highest for        PCT Table summarizes the predictive accuracy of the        laboratory variables for the specific diagnoses of SIRS and        sepsis With a cutoff point of  ngml serum PCT        concentration was found to be the most discriminatory        laboratory variable the predictive accuracy of which        exceeded those of CRP TNF IL IL and IL With        regard to positive and negative predictive values we found        that PCT markedly exceeds the values calculated for other        variables The test effectiveness was  for PCT in        predicting sepsis whereas the other variables reached        values between  and                     Discussion        We analyzed the plasma concentrations of various        biochemical markers with respect to their potential use in        differentiating between patients suffering from SIRS and        from sepsis This assessment is of potential interest        because systemic inflammation is a common problem in the        ICU which often leads to shock and death The diagnostic        repertoire for identifying SIRS is poor Verification of        infection site and even the presence of infection remains        problematic in sepsis In  of patients the infection        site is never identified Neither imaging studies nor blood        culture analysis can rule out the presence of infection          Moreover there are classes of patients with        unconfirmed infection or for whom cultures are negative        yet who develop similar symptoms rates of organ failure        and survival outcomes as do those in patients in whom        infection is confirmed The availability of laboratory        tests for accurate and rapid identification of septic        patients by isolation of microorganisms from body fluid        specimens would be of considerable value Thus there is a        clear need for a reliable diagnostic procedure that allows        early discrimination between patients suffering from SIRS        and those with sepsis A relatively new marker that has        been associated with inflammation and sepsis is PCT a        aminoacid protein that is the precursor to calcitonin        The PCT plasma level in healthy individuals is low usually        below  ngml   That PCT concentration is        significantly elevated in patients with organ dysfunction        is undoubted However the difference in PCT between        patients with SIRS and those with sepsis may be small        Reports of the usefulness of PCT for discriminating between        SIRS and sepsis are conflicting               Therefore we selected several cytokines as well as PCT for        early diagnosis and differentiation of patients with SIRS        and sepsis        High serum PCT concentrations were first described by        Assicot and coworkers   in children with severe        bacterial infections and were suggested to be a specific        marker for bacterial infection AlNawas and coworkers          reported higher PCT levels in patients with clinically        documented infection than in those fulfilling the criteria        for SIRS        Two studies compared PCT and CRP in ICU patients and        found that PCT had poorer sensitivity specificity and AUC        than did CRP as a marker of sepsis    In order to        assess the diagnostic utility of PCT and CRP in a medical        ICU prospective measurements were conducted in         consecutive patients with acute SIRS or sepsis PCT did not        clearly discriminate SIRS from sepsis   Another group        from Germany reported average PCT concentrations of           ngml for SIRS    ngml for sepsis and           ngml for severe sepsis On the basis of their        findings the investigators concluded that PCT CRP white        blood cell and body temperature does not discriminate SIRS        from sepsis and PCT was the only parameter to discriminate        between sepsis and severe sepsis          Muller and colleagues   investigated  patients        admitted to a medical ICU and suggested that PCT is a more        reliable marker of sepsis than is CRP IL and lactate        levels To assess the diagnostic value of PCT IL IL        and standard measures for identifying critically ill        patients with SIRS and suspected sepsis prospective        measurements were taken in  consecutive patients admitted        with acute SIRS and suspected infection PCT yielded the        highest discriminative value for differentiating patients        with SIRS from those with sepsis followed by IL and IL          Selberg and coworkers   studied discrimination of        sepsis and SIRS by determination of circulating plasma        concentrations of PCT IL and Ca in a medical ICU Their        data indicated that of PCT IL and Ca concentrations are        more reliable parameter for differentiating between septic        and SIRS patients than are CRP and elastase        Mechanical trauma causes elevated PCT levels the degree        of which depends on the severity of the injury Levels peak        on days  and fall thereafter High concentrations of        circulating PCT during the first  days after injury        discriminate between patients at risk for SIRS sepsis and        multiple organ dysfunctions in the early and late        posttraumatic course          Previous studies compared CRP IL IL and TNF and        PCT separately for differentiating SIRS from sepsis in the        present study all of the available biochemical markers        were measured at the same time       PCT had        the highest sensitivity and specificity for differentiating        SIRS from sepsis followed by IL and IL Thus in        agreement with previous studies    PCT was a more        reliable marker in the diagnosis of sepsis than other        measures        The present study included consecutive unselected        patients who were representative of an ICU population with        baseline characteristics similar those reported in the        literature and strict objective criteria for the diagnosis        of infection were employed   However several        criticisms of the study should be addressed First PCT was        not monitored every day and a shorter monitoring interval        may improve its performance as an aid for diagnosis and        follow up of sepsis Second with the use of clinical        criteria and microbiological evidence it might have been        difficult to ascertain the exact aetiology of SIRS in all        patients This may have introduced some misclassification        bias because investigators who were blinded to the        cytokine results performed the case ascertainment however        we do not believe this lack of an important standard        compromised our study conclusions Third antimicrobial        therapy may have an impact on PCT values Our study design        does not allow us to explain the exact relationship between        antimicrobial therapy and PCT values The temporal        relationship between PCT and antibiotic treatment should be        assessed in further studies                    Conclusion        In the present study PCT appeared to be a more accurate        diagnostic parameter for differentiating between patients        suffering from SIRS and those with sepsis Routine        determination of PCT may improve management of patients        for example by preventing the use of unnecessary        antibiotics that are known to select resistance strains        Further studies of the early phases of sepsis are necessary        to define the role of PCT in possible therapeutic        strategies such as antimicrobial and immunological        therapies and cost implcations                    Competing interests        None declared                    Key message         PCT appears to be a useful early marker for
