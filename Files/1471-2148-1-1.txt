                    Background        Baculoviruses are a diverse family of insect viruses        that are pathogenic for insects particularly members of the        Lepidoptera Diptera and Hymenoptera They have large        doublestranded circular supercoiled DNA genomes of         kb and are characterized by the occlusion of their        virions in crystalline protein matrices There are two        genera of baculoviruses the nucleopolyhedroviruses NPVs        in which many virions are occluded in large        polyhedronshaped occlusion bodies and the granuloviruses        GVs which normally occlude a single nucleocapsid per        small granular occlusion body A novel feature of these        viruses is the production of two types of virions          One the occlusion derived virion ODV type is present in        occlusion bodies and spreads the infection between insects        whereas the other the budded virion BV type spreads the        infection between cells within insects or in cell culture        A major difference between these two types of virions is        their envelope proteins The envelope of ODV is not well        characterized and although it may be composed of multiple        proteins the mechanism by which it facilitates the        initiation of infection of insect midgut cells is unclear        reviewed in   In contrast BV envelopes contain an        envelope fusion protein that causes the merging of the        virion envelope and the membrane of cellular endocytic        vesicles when exposed to low pH        Current evidence suggests that lepidopteran        baculoviruses may be divided into two phylogenetic groups        based on the envelope fusion proteins of budded virions          One group that includes         Autographa        californica multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus        AcMNPV and         Orgyia pseudotsugata MNPV OpMNPV        contain GP in their budded virion envelopes           Homologs of         gp are also found in a genus of        orthomyxoviruses the thogotoviruses   Recently a        number of complete baculovirus genome sequences have been        described and were found to lack an open reading frame with        homology to         gp  Analysis of the genome of the         Lymantria dispar MNPV LdMNPV        revealed a single orf          ld  with predicted signal and        transmembrane domains Characterization of LD indicated        that it localizes to the membrane of infected cells is a        component of budded virions and is Nglycosylated        Uninfected cells transiently transfected with a plasmid        encoding LD showed localization of the protein to the        cell membrane and lowpH mediated cell fusion suggesting        that LD is the envelope fusion protein of LdMNPV          Similar results have been reported for the LD homolog in        SeMNPV          Homologs of         ld are found in the genomes of all        the sequenced         gp minus viruses including LdMNPV        SeMNPV           Plutella xylostella GV PxGV          and         Xestia cnigrum GV XcGV   In        addition homologs of         ld are also found in         gp containing viruses although        they do not appear to be capable of mediating        lowpHdependent membrane fusion Pearson et al        unpublished In contrast to the close relatedness of        baculovirus gp homologs the LD homologs are highly        variable suggesting that         gp was recently incorporated into a        baculovirus genome where it displaced the envelope fusion        function of the         ld homologs          Database searches with LD and its homologs routinely        identify not only homologous baculovirus proteins but        some members also showed significant levels of homology        with the predicted envelope proteins of a number of insect        retroviruslike elements from         Drosophila and Lepidoptera          also see genbank documentation for AcMNPV orf in the        AcMNPV sequence   Evidence suggests that at least        some of these retroviruslike elements are infectious and        have been classified as insect retroviruses            or errantiviruses   In this report we provide        evidence for an evolutionary link between this newly        characterized family of baculovirus envelope proteins and        the envelope proteins predicted for a variety of insect        retroviruslike retrotransposons These relationships        suggest a possible common origin of the envelope fusion        proteins for these two groups of viruses                    Results                  Database searches with members of the LD          family          Routine BLAST searches of the database with individual          members of the LD family of baculovirus proteins          revealed high levels of similarity with a set of          predicted envelope proteins from a number of insect          retroviruslike retrotransposons For example an LD          homolog from PxGV PX   showed significance values          of  with the envelope protein of TED a lepidopteran          retroviruslike retrotransposon   and in the  to           range for a number of other predicted envelope          proteins from retroviruslike retrotransposons from other          insects particularly members from the genus           Drosophila  Searches with other          members of the ld family showed values of  to           to these proteins A           Drosophila orf see below that is          not part of a retroviruslike element was also          identified These values suggested that the relatedness          was significant and may be evidence of an exchange of          genes encoding this important category of proteins          between insect cells and members of the baculovirus and          retrovirus families To investigate this relationship          further we performed BLAST searches of the database with          all members of the baculovirus LD family and also with          all sequences that showed alignments with E values of          less than  to members of this family When sequences          within this category were identified that were over           identical only one was included Similarly fragments          from within complete sequences that were identified by          this search were not included This resulted in a total          of  proteins used in our analyses Table           With one exception all the nonbaculovirus sequences          showing the best scores are derived from retroviruslike          retrotransposons from insects that fall in the T           gypsy group   The exception is          a           Drosophila orf called cg Table           The orfs adjacent to cg two upstream and two          downstream appear to be nonhomologous to retrovirus          orfs data not shown suggesting that it may either be an          insect gene or a remnant of an integrated          retroelement                          Significance of the relatedness of the members of          the Ld family          The potential relationships uncovered by the BLAST          searches were further assessed for significance by the          calculation of Zscores for each of the sequences          compared to each of the other sequences see Methods          This led to the grouping of the sequences into six          subfamilies based on Zscore cutoff values of   Figs            Table  These include the baculovirus subfamily          two major divisions of the dipteran           gypsy retrotransposon group with          four members each and three subfamilies each with a          single member The latter included one dipteran           gypsy sequence the lepidopteran           gypsy like element TED   and          the           Drosophila cellular protein cg          We then compared each subfamily using the conservative          criterion of a Zscore of   as an indicator of          homology          Furthermore guided by the assumption that sequence          features conserved over long evolutionary distances          should also be conserved over short distances a          secondary criteria used for the more distant          relationships was that Zscores derived from comparing          families of sequences should show enhanced significance          over that of the individual sequences The Zscores          revealed strong evidence for the homology of the          seventeen sequences Fig  Members of the LD family          showed Zscores of  and  to two groups containing          eight           gypsy proteins These are similar          to scores determined for comparisons between different          gypsy envelope proteins of from  to In addition only          one other protein called rhoptry from           Plasmodium yoelii accession           T fell within our  BLAST search cutoff in two          instances with T and p Table  However          when aligned to each of the  sequences only one          alignment resulted in a Zscore of  and all the other          zscores were  Also when members of each subfamily          were grouped together and compared with this protein the          scores were not enhanced data not shown A matrix          comparing the levels of sequence identities among these          sequences is shown in Fig  and reveals that in          contrast to Zscores sequence identity is not a reliable          indicator of evolutionary relatedness at the longer          distances For example although the proteins with the          groups composed of   and  Table  are          clearly related to one another their relationship with          other members of the data set are unclear                          Features of the LD protein family          In addition to the overall sequence homology our          analyses revealed a number of other conserved features          Fig  They all are predicted to be moderately large          proteins of  to  amino acids and all contain          predicted signal peptides at their amino terminus and          transmembrane domains near their carboxyl terminus          Another feature of these sequences is the conservation          of cysteine residues In the baculovirus sequences           cysteines are conserved Fig  In TED the          lepidopteran retroviruslike element seven of the          Cterminal cysteine residues are conserved Likewise in          the Drosophila sequence cg that is not a component          of a retrotransposon six of the Cterminal cysteines are          conserved With the two other categories of retroelements          represented by           gypsy and           tom in Fig  four of the          cysteines are conserved The consensus pattern of          cysteine conservation is shown at the bottom of Fig                    It has recently been reported that SE a homolog of          LD is the likely membrane fusion protein for the           Spodoptera exigua MNPV            Furthermore by Nterminal sequence analysis it was found          that in budded virions SE was truncated downstream of a          motif that is a furin cleavage consensus sequence in          other viruses This motif has the sequence KRXXKR One          of the striking features of our alignments is that this          site and downstream sequences appear to be conserved in          these proteins Fig  The downstream sequence has the          amino acid motif gXBGXXKGXDXXD where           represents sites with predominantly hydrophobic amino          acids B represents D or N and X represents any amino          acid The lower case of the initial g is related to its          absense in one group of           gypsy sequences  Table           This motif is present in all the sequences except those          represented by Ac and Op Figs   and cg          Both AcMNPV and OpMNPV utilize GP as their envelope          fusion protein and neither OP nor AC appear to          function as an envelope fusion protein in cell fusion          assays Pearson et al unpublished Likewise cg is          not a component of a viruslike element In contrast the          sequence is conserved in the other proteins that may play          a role in membrane fusion It has previously been          suggested that for members of the           gypsy family of env proteins the          protease cleavage site may be downstream of this sequence             A similar cleavage site location was suggested          for TED   However the major env components were          never Nterminally sequenced and the data could also be          interpreted to be the result of the removal of about           kda from the Ntermini of these proteins at the cleavage          site shown in Fig           Coiledcoillike motifs are a distinguishing feature          of a number of viral fusion proteins A program          LearncoilVMF has been developed to predict the location          and the probability of these domains occurring within a          protein   We applied this program to the LD          family of proteins A summary of the scores is shown in          Table and the location of the coiledcoil domains is          indicated in Fig  Coiledcoillike domains were          predicted for many of these proteins immediately          downstream of the predicted cleavage site With two          exceptions in which two regions were identified Table           the program predicted a single coiledcoil region in          a similar location or in three instances no such          region In the protein from the two NPVs that lack GP          LD and SE the same location was identified          However the program predicted these regions slightly          downstream for the two granulovirus proteins XC and          PX these two viruses also lack gp placing them in          the same position as predicted for proteins from NPVs          that contain GP The baculovirus proteins had a          probability of this motif occurring from  Op to           Ac In one set of gypsy retroviruslike elements           the probability of the coiledcoil motif          downstream of the cleavage site ranged from  to           The rest of the sequences showed a high degree of          variability Two sequences  and  TED showed a          strong probability  and  respectively just          upstream of the predicted cleavage site Fig  No          also showed a broad region of  probability just          downstream of the cleavage site With the exception of            the remaining three sequences  and           had a probability of  This included the cellular          protein cg                            Discussion        In this report we have investigated the evolutionary        relatedness between three categories of proteins the        retroviruslike         gypsy envelope proteins the        baculovirus LD group of envelopeassociated proteins        and an insect cellular protein Globally optimal sequence        alignments in combination with assessment of the        significance of the alignment scores resulted in striking        patterns of relatedness Not only did our analyses link the                gypsy derived envelope proteins        together with a high level of significance as would be        predicted from studies of other         gypsy genes   but it also linked        two of the major categories of the         gypsy sequences to the baculovirus        ld group with similar levels of significance In        addition a cellencoded protein from         Drosophila showed relatedness at a        high level of significance to the baculovirus ld protein        group The parameters we used as a basis for these analyses        were conservative with cutoff Zscore values        representative of at least  standard deviations above the        value for the randomized sequences In addition to the        overall homology a number of other features common to        members of this class of proteins were identified These        included the predicted signal sequences and transmembrane        domains and a striking conservation surrounding a possible        protease cleavage site in the proteins that likely serve as        envelope fusion proteins   In addition predicted        coiledcoil domains in similar locations relative to the        cleavage site in a number of the sequences further suggest        both functional and structural similarities between members        of this protein group        Concurrent with the preparation of this research for        publication a similar study by Malik et al was reported          They also describe a relationship between the envelope        protein of gypsy retroviruslike elements and the ld        group of baculovirus envelope proteins They identified the        predicted signal and transmembrane domains that we describe        in Fig and the conserved region that we compare in Fig         Their alignments also highlight the conservation of the        cysteine residues that we describe in Fig         Although our analyses convincingly indicate a        relationship between the insect cellular         gypsy  and baculovirus membrane        proteins we can only speculate on the evolutionary pathway        leading to the presence of members of this set of proteins        in all three types of organisms If homologs of the cg        gene are conserved among Diptera and Lepidoptera the        interrelationship between members of the baculoviridae and        TED the lepidopteran         gypsy element capable of integrating        into both a host insect and a baculovirus genome provides        a clear pathway via DNA recombination for the exchange of        members of the ld gene family between host cells        baculovirus genomes and the transposable element Indeed        a phylogenetic analysis of the envelope protein of these        elements reported by Malik et al   suggests that they        are derived from a monophyletic event that resulted from        their incorporation of a baculovirus envelope protein gene        in an ancestral member of these retroviruslike        elements        TED has features that suggest that it may have        specifically evolved to exploit a relationship with a        baculovirus and this may have facilitated its acquisition        of a baculovirus envelope protein gene It is present as a        midlevel repeated element in its host insect genome about         copiesgenome    it encodes a set of proteins        gag pol env with features similar to those of        wellcharacterized retrovirus proteins   and it is        capable of producing viruslike particles   A specific        example of TEDs adaptation to baculovirus biology is the        presence of palindromes containing the baculovirus late        promoter element in its long terminal repeat           Evidence suggests that this results in the high level        transcription of the TED genome by the viral RNA polymerase          and could lead to the production of TED viruslike        particles concomitant with the baculovirus late gene        expression This would provide a novel twopronged escape        mechanism from insects suffering from a fatal baculovirus        infection TED might be passed to other insects as an        integrated transposable element in an infectious        baculovirus or as an infectious retrovirus Oral        transmission is the normal route for baculovirus infection        and has been reported for         gypsy retroviruslike        retrotransposons   This strategy could elevate the        retrotransposons potential to exchange genetic material        with the genomes of its viral and cellular hosts        Members of the Ld family of baculovirus envelope        proteins have been demonstrated to mediate lowpH membrane        fusion   In contrast retroviruses normally enter cells        by receptormediated fusion at the cell surface reviewed        in   or by a combination of both receptor and lowpH        mediated events   Despite the differing mechanisms of        cell entry members of these two groups have been related        by a number of structural criteria   The link that we        have described in this report and that of Malik et al          suggests the possibility of a genetic relationship as        well                    Conclusions        The relatedness of a class of low pHdependent        baculovirus envelope fusion proteins to envelope proteins        of         gypsy retroviruslike elements was        demonstrated to be highly significant Transposon mediated        exchange provides a documented pathway for the movement of        this gene between insect cells and two different types of        viruses                    Materials and Methods        Blast searches were performed using the GapBlast search        engine   Sequence alignments were performed with the        program SEQUOIA by CM Bruns which is available on the web        at httpwwwscrippsedubrunssequoiahtml SEQUOIA uses        a conventional dynamic programming algorithm based on the        work of Needleman and Wunsch   to find the globally        optimal alignment given a particular residue comparison        matrix and gapping model The statistical significance of        the optimal alignment was assessed by calculation of their        Zscore The Zscore is derived by comparison of an        observed alignment score with the distribution of scores        obtained for alignments after one of the sequences was        shuffled to create a random sequence with the same amino        acid composition  shuffles were carried out for each        sequence comparison and the significance was measured        relative to the mean and standard deviation of scores from        the shuffled sequences Quantitatively the Zscore is        defined as the number of standard deviations of the        observed score above the mean of the shuffled scores and is        determined by the following equation        Zscore  Observed score  mean shuffled scoreStandard        deviation of shuffled scores        In the work we describe here alignments were done using        a gap penalty of  and the BLOSUM scoring matrix          An additional important feature of SEQUOIA is that a        sequence need not be just a single sequence but can be a        prealigned family of sequences that are treated as a        unit
