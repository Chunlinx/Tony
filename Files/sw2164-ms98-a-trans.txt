        well oh our topic is capital punishment i guess uh one thing is to compare uh how it is maybe here in Texas versus uh   in Rhode Island   maybe your part of the country   yeah i you know im not sure if we have the death penalty here to be perfectly honest with you hold on a second do we have the death penalty in Rhode Island no  okay no we dont but you know um   yeah   i i have some feelings about it in the sense that i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and its a really heinous crime i feel like the Bible says an eye for an eye   umhum describing a heinous crime being like murder or   yeah you know something really a serial killer or   what other ones would be   you know someone who who really has no remorse you know that that just does these things uh i dont know without feeling guilty about it at all you know and the and their we in fact we have an example going on right now with this uh school teacher involved some teenagers   uhhuh   into uh committing murder get getting rid of her husband   um   i dont know if youre familiar with it Pamela Smart in New Hampshire   dont think ive heard of that one   see now in a situation like that the boys are only sixteen years old and they were sexually involved with her and i think like at that particular point she was twenty three you know so she wasnt really that much older than them and being a boy at that age i think that theyre very um you know lets face it thats at a point in your life when you youre just starting to realize all the things of life   yeah   i think she probably had a lot of influence on them and they probably would have never done something like that if it wasnt for the crime of passion type of thing   yeah we had one uh course in Texas they uh  used to string them up now they   and uhhuh   got more uh civilized and uh give them lethal injection so we definitely do have uh capital punishment   yeah now see i agree with that i i dont think a person should be electrocuted or hung or you know in in other words i believe that they should be punished and done away with on one hand like i say if theyre if theyre guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but if theres the the other the other hand where you say you know if theres just that slim chance that they didnt do it and then you know spend the time say life imprisonment then at least they have a chance to over the years be proven not guilty   yeah   you know   there was one here recently that comes to mind thats about a woman that uh this is ridiculous i mean its almost uh itd be funny if it wasnt so so sad i mean this woman this woman went out and hired somebody to uh   yeah   to uh kill another mother   oh thats the cheerleader thing   yeah right have you heard about that one   oh yes that was on TV here   yeah isnt that something   it made national um   i didnt know it made the national news   yeah really     that was something wasnt it uh its unbelievable this   but you know i i i saw i cant figure out what people are doing any more i mean its getting so bad and i dont think unless that the crime that the laws get to the point where people are afraid to do something because they know theyll be punished you know what im saying   well that brings up i guess part of what would be a question is uh you know is i guess you feel like thats a deterrent in uh capital punishment should be   yeah and you know and i i dont know if it would be but i mean we dont know that it wouldnt either   well it uh  must be i think its a matter of degree and uh of course uh course it varies from case to case or individual   yeah and the other point someone made at one one time was that if someone is guilty of a terrible crime or theyre a serial killer or mass murderer that if theyre in prison that gives you the chance to um get into the persons mind to find out uh what led them to the point that they were at when they committed the crime to uh try to understand how their mind worked to prevent uh you know another person from getting into the same situation   yeah   but i dont know you know  maybe you could do that for a certain period of time but i mean how long does that kind of a thing take you know to to um say to question the person or to get into their head   yeah   you know even if it took five years i think that if at that time you you feel that they were guilty or that they were uh of sound mind where they knew what crimes they were committing i mean people know what theyre doing   huh   you know that that i really do i believe that that capital punishment should be there the prisons are overcrowded       it costs the taxpayers a lot of money   thats one thing down here we certainly have a problem with overcrowded prisons   yeah  ill tell you in the state of Rhode Island it was so bad that the intake center that they have to house the the criminals before they go to the uh penitentiaries and stuff um were overcrowded and the judge fined the state thousands of dollars a day   um   to build a bigger intake center   yeah   so i mean it its like where does this all stop   well theyre releasing them uh early here   exactly same thing here and thats thats what they did   and and then uh then you hear about ones that are on early release going out and   yep   committing a   in fact the news tonight they had uh someone come on a seventy three year old man they they had gotten into a housing for the elderly and and the person who perpetrated the crime went in with someone who had a relative there and uh apparently this this person was on drugs and the old man was an invalid and he was in an elevator and he died for twelve dollars   um well i tell you what i think that uh you know this may this may be a cause rather the actual topic but uh i think that a lot of this is caused by the steady diet of violence they seem to   yep   want to be uh you know showing on movies and television   yeah and i also think that the uh fact that a lot of mothers are working today and that children are not bonded to the parents   umhum   and other people take the responsibility for raising these kids or the children are left out you know   thats true   on their own and they dont really feel the family um closeness that we had when oh when i was growing up my my mother didnt work you know  and when she did uh a part time job she was there you know it wasnt like she   well well what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on uh you know the children   getting mothers back in the home   well yeah well i dont know if thats   you know kind of   going to be necessarily workable but it would be uh one way   oh i know i know   it certainly has to start with the children   how do you feel about it do you do you think there should be capital punishment   yes i do i think its uh something that unfortunately uh at this stage of the game i would hope that at some point we would become you know civilized enough where we could do away with it but as of right now and the way things are i think its uh something we just have to have   yeah i i do myself i really think that its its all well and good to um be a dogooder or to to um you know try to spare everyones life but when someone has no regard for another person excuse me their property or their personal uh being or their families i mean you know when whole families are killed and   umhum   and and yet you have someone wholl commit a crime of robbery and spend twenty five years in jail i mean to me its like we have things messed up somehow you you know what i mean     yeah   and and like this banking crisis thing where people have stolen millions of dollars and theyre out walking around   huh well i just uh   i think all our laws are are really screwed up       i do i i dont know what to do about it i wish i did but uh   well i think it comes back to uh starting with the children once you get them you know if you get them   yeah   where they have a sense of values and uh you know that uh thats what it takes   yeah exactly morals yeah   that people start uh oh you know repeat about it you know they start to see this violence in a steady diet and uh its to be uh just   did you ever see the program uh Why Does Johnny Kill   uh   about these young children who were were not even like sixteen years old they were eleven and twelve and fourteen and fifteen year olds and they they actually committed murders and the question was whether to try them as adults or as children   all right cant remember that   and whether or not to uh institute you know capital punishment where it was necessary and things like that   yeah   that has to   thats a tough one too   yeah i i mean what would you do in a situation like that you say well hes only ten years old but the crime he committed is that of an adult   yeah   he made that decision   we had a personal experience with something like that it wasnt didnt go as far as murder but this this girl young girl had uh she had gotten hold of a gun and she came around to the office where my wife worked and she was she had this mental problem with uh with a doctor she works for him and uh he was she was just after him you know and the cops pick her up   uhhuh   and uh there wasnt a thing they could do you know theyd take her down to the juvenile hall and then theyd have to let her go and shed be back  doing it   yeah imagine so see this is what im saying and even with uh people who are mentally incompetent you know uh like deranged its so hard to get people even institutionalized because theyre overcrowded so you have people walking the streets that are child molesters or uh
