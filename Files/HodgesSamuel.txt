      Uhhuh                     Its a horror story no doubt so you have to picture the setting that its around                     Uhhuh                     Um I was about eight um um we were out camping in the back basically in the back of a friend of mines house in Orange County                     Uhhuh                     Which is the county right next to where I lived         He basically they had basically woods outdoors and there were parents there with us but we were only eight so were learning how to camp um we actually slept that night in a teepee uh uh an original teepee that uh were used by Native Americans at one time sort of as a historical artifact         So were getting ready for bed weve eaten dinner were around the campfire and the owner of the property its Dwayne Hobgood I guess I can say his name                     Uhhuh                     Um says Boys Ive got a story for you                                                                        Now picture

while we answer the cell phone         Do you want to hear or do you want to keep                              Where was I before we were interrupted                     The uh you were uh Hobgoods property and                     OK                     A bunch of kids are listening and hes got boys Ive got a story for you now                     Eh boys Ive got a story for you and were sitting around the campfire he goes Gentlemen let me tell you the story of Two Feathers         He goes Two Feathers was and this time political correctness wasnt                                 Right                     Wasnt par for the course wasnt nomenclature         He said Boys Ive got this story about an Indian for you         His name is ah Two Feathers         He grew up in Orange County or what was Orange County it wasnt named Orange County at the time         Um and act and he says Two Feathers was um once again was an Indian who uh lived there back before before it was settled by the Europeans         He says Two Feathers grew up he hunted he fished bas basic the basic Indian life um until one day when he was about   he was out hunting and he was hunting a mountain lion         He came across a mountain lion                     Uhhuh                     And um they got into a tussle                     Uhhuh                     He stabbed the mountain lion a few times the mountain lion bit him a few times                     Uhhuh                     They struggled back and forth struggled back and forth         Finally the mountain lion ripped off his arm his left arm                     Uhhuh                     And uh takes off with it goes         So he doesnt know but he he doesnt die he survives um and grows old becomes an old old an old Indian and um um becomes you know one of the leaders of the tribe but hes always got this one goal is to find that mountain lion that got his arm and really he doesnt really care that much about the mountain lion he wants his arm or somebodys arm                     Right                              So um time goes on and um he dies but he comes back as a ghost                     OK                     Um and what happens is as the settlers move in he actually finds um because he doesnt want to take people you know from his own tribes arm but he needs an arm so hes spending all of eternity hunting for his arm and um as you know time comes on and the settlers start in the region settlers                     Uhhuh                     Um one day one guy wakes up in the morning hes bleeding he felt like he doesnt have an arm and he sees this ghost of an Indian                     Uhhuh                     Hes got his arm and uh hes trying to put it on his body and it didnt fit and its too short and it didnt look like his arm so he throws it aside and goes on         Um this happens all throughout history and he was telling us how it keeps going on and on                                                               And you know as an adult its not its you know he its a good story but as an eightyearold kid youre worried about your arm                     Thats right                              And because he usually catches people not in their house but when theyre out camping or sleeping                     In a teepee right                              In a teepee yeah         So                                                               He tells us his story he says you know Youve got to watch out for your arm         Spend the night um you know because if he comes his names Two Feathers but theres a chant um in regards to you know to getting him away and it goes something like Two Feathers be gone I want my arm                                                                        Um and theres also other things you can do to deter him         You can also um in front of your teepee you have to stack stones in a certain manner in order to say Hey Im a friend and not a foe Id like to keep my arm                                                               So he proceeds to have us um build the stones and um you know learn the chant were chanting and sends us off to bed         Now we all spend the whole night staying awake listening for Two Feathers         Two Feathers is coming Two Feathers is coming          He would do that to us in the night         Two Feathers is coming                     Thats terrible                                       Uh so you have eight scared boys that are Two Feathers         Now I dont know if this actually applies as a story I heard sort of an embellishment on this story in regards to I give you the details but                     Uh a good campfire um                     Its a good campfire story um so its I guess something to start with                     Yep thats good                     Um                     Yeah thats about  minutes Id say
