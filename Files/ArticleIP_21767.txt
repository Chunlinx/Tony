                                 The Politics of Port            There are some things sointangible that only culture explains them a friend said to me many yearsago It had been a long winefilled dinner and the talk had turned to seriousmatters My friend an Englishman was warming to his subject that the Britishlove affair with claretred Bordeauxwas one of the great and for himjoyous mysteries of life Another he continued was the Englishmansproclivity for port As you can tell his interests were limited but he wasmaking a vinous version of an argument that has been given great credence inintellectual circles of late            Culture is hot Byculture I dont mean Wagner and Abstract Expressionismtheyve always beenhotbut rather culture as an explanation for social phenomena People now usethe concept of national or ethnic culture routinely to answer seemingly complexquestions Why is the United States economy bursting with growth Its obviousour unique entrepreneurial culture Why is Russia unable to adapt tocapitalism Alas it has a feudal antimarket culture Never mind thatAmerican culture was around to witness stagflation not to mention the GreatDepression And Japans and Germanys feudalism seem to have adapted nicely tocapitalism            Cultural explanations persist because intellectuals likethem They make valuable the detailed knowledge of countries histories whichintellectuals have in great supply And they add an air of mystery andcomplexity to the study of societies But beneath them usually lurks somethingmore simple and straightforwardsuch as politics            Consider claret TheBritish drink Bordeaux because for hundreds of years the wines of that regionwere given preferential tariff treatment for powerful political reasons In the th century when our story begins the English actually liked andimported vast quantities of somewhat acidic wines from La Rochelle now theCharentes region north of Bordeaux a sunny and frostfree area whose wineexports were aggressively promoted by its ruler the Duke of Aquitaine Thedukes lands included Bordeaux The duke died and in  his daughterEleanor of Aquitaine married Henry Plantagenet Duke of Normandy Two yearslater he became Henry II and Eleanor became queen of England Their fieryrelationship was memorably replayed by Peter OToole and Katharine Hepburn inThe Lion in Winter             Initially little changed since Eleanor like her fatherstill favored La Rochelle But the Bordelais coveted the English market andworked tirelessly for special favors Over time as it always does thelobbying worked Henrys grandson John set up a classic political trade thatwould make any K Street consultant proud In return for support against theKing of France who knows why they were always at war in those days Johnwould exempt Bordeaux from the principal tax on its exports The merchants ofLa Rochelle miscalculated and did not counteroffer infuriating King John whodecided to favor Bordeaux further The king ordered that all his householdwines would come from Bordeauxa huge order since it included the armyssupplies What finally decided it against La Rochelle was not the acidity ofits wines but the disloyalty of its citizens writes wine historian HughJohnson Thus was born the special mystical relationship between England andBordeaux            As for port in the th century the naval rivalry between England and Holland on theone hand and Spain and France on the other was still intense In thisdiplomatic game keeping Portugal happy was crucial so that its seaportsparticularly Lisbon would not become enemy bases In  England struck adeal the Methuen Treaty which got Portugal to ally itself with England andHolland against the Catholic powers Naturally Portugal got something out ofita lowering of import tariffs on its products and some royal patronage Whenwar between France and England did break out the English consumer marketneeded substitutes for Bordeaux Portuguese wines proved cheap andwithin afew yearsreadily available Amusingly the wines that created the Englishinterest in port were not actually the sweet wines of today but rather normaltable wines Far from having a natural affinity for port the English simplydrank it because the Portuguese had already made inroads into the consumermarket            The moral of this story is not that taste let aloneculture doesnt matter After all once the English got hooked on Bordeauxthey stayed with it even after most preferential treatment abated around And the Englishmans love of red Bordeaux wines has had massive globaleffects For one thing it created the modern Bordeaux wine industry Wholeswaths of Bordeaux including much of what is now considered the best winecountry were cultivated in response to English demand Also since the Britishwere the global superpower and style setters of the  th centuryworld everybody copied their tastes Thats why today from Australia to SouthAfrica to California to Chile the most expensive wines in the world are madefrom the same grape cabernet sauvignon and in the same style as red Bordeauxdown to the shape of the bottle            But culture itself can be shaped and changed Behindso many cultural attitudes tastes and preferences lie the political andeconomic forces that shaped them even in something as intangible as wine andfood All of which makes me glad that the two great powers that lost out inthis centurys power struggles were Germany and Russia or we might be savoringthe delights of borscht potatoes and sauerkraut washed down by gallons ofvodka
