                                 Family Plots             The term black comedy hasbecome so elastic in the last few years that it now extends to entertainmentsas various as Life Is Beautiful  in which Chaplinesque sentimentality isjuxtaposed with concentrationcamp horror and Lock Stock  Two SmokingBarrels  in which flyspeck louts machinegun other flyspeck louts withfarcical haplessness Somewhere in the middle comes my ideal black comedy inwhich humans are base but their emotions have weight and the human conditionwhile irremediable is leavened by the artists cheery sleight of hand A greatblack comedy should be palatable but hard to digest slipping easily down thegullet and then sticking in the gut The form is currently represented by anunheralded lowbudget jewel called Six Ways to Sunday  directed by AdamBernstein from a script he wrote with Marc Gerald Its young protagonist HarryOdum Norman Reedus a frycook in the postindustrial wasteland that isYoungstown Ohio lives with a shutin mother Kate Deborah Harry who hascontrived to keep him in a state of sexual ignorance A breathy exprostitutenow going to seed she bathes Harry controls the light in his room and warnshim off relations with sluts while hovering inches from his face in lowcutnighties Harrys a walking Freudian time bomb            Invited by his buddyArnie Adrien Brody a Jewish boy with garish rapper affectations to helpcollect a debt for a mobster from the proprietor of a sex club Harry findshimself bombarded by images of topless women and unable to keep from whaling ona man they came only to threaten I hope I killed him he says when pulledfrom the mans bloody broken body And then I hope I didnt kill himSeasoned criminals love to exploit such youthful intensity and Harry is soonadopted by Abie The Bug Peter Appel and then by his boss Varga JerryAdler Jewish gangsters in search of a more dependable bully boy than thechaotic Arnie Bringing Harry along means teaching him how to dress and spendmoney Having money and not flashing it is strictly for gentiles theyexplain treating him to a whore Anna Thompson whom he reluctantly acceptsand then pays not to have sex with Do I seem normal with girls Sexually heasks and presenting him with a huge switchblade which Harry is shortlyexpected to plunge into the heart of a man he has never met            S ix                Ways to Sunday is freely based on the novel Portrait of a Young Man Drowning  by Charles Perry anAfricanAmerican playwright and performer who died of cancer before completinga second book Set in Brooklyn Perrys novel which features white charactersis bleaker than the film less archly distant with a nastier ending Bernsteinand Gerald have made it their own The movies slapstick and brutality inhabitthe same psychological landscape and Harrys acts of violence are viewed instroboscopic flashes held long enough to convey their garishness but sofleetingly that you might giggle at your own uncertainty Did he really dowhat I think he did I hesitate to use the word offbeat which has cometo describe a metronomical quirkiness thats as predictable as anything on thebeat but here the surreal touches are sprung without overture like frogs thatjust happen to be hopping across the screen Harry is dogged by a phantomslickster Madden Holter Graham who leers at women and then demonstrates howto molest them Is it Madden whos attacking Vargas Hungarian maid Iris ElinaLowensohn or is Madden a standin for Harry Iris is a tiny yet imposingthing Lowensohn was Draculas daughter in Michael Almereydas  movieNadja  with a game leg it was her affliction says Harry later thatwas the source of his attraction Thats why I was attracted to you she replies prompting a look of puzzlement Here as elsewhere Reedus isremarkable his face both masklike and porous so that you never consciouslyregister the ways in which Harry is dissolving before your eyesbut youre notin the least surprised when he does            Deborah Harry is noactressher speaking voice is as dead as her singing voice is glassy But Kateis meant to be zonked and zombielike a Mummy Dearest and this bedraggledghost of a glamorous icon is startlingly potent Those cheekbones seem tostretch from one side of the screen to otherthey hold up Harrys featureswhich might otherwise collapse The director underlines the tension between herpast and present by using the Blondie song Sunday Girl in a tender encounterbetween Harry and Iris in a diner At first I questioned the wisdom of thatitseemed a little cheap But Bernstein has brought off a coup making Kate aliteral presence in that scene and reinforcing Deborah Harrys stature Itseven a coup that Harrys mom is played by a Harrythe incestuousness extendingto their very names            My first professional movie reviews were written in  atthe weekly Boston Phoenix under the tutelage of Stephen Schiff then amagisterial film critic as well as an exacting editor Presented with asentence containing two adjectives in succession Jason Tiddlywinks gives afunky severe performance Schiff would say Choose one Well gee Idunno the performance is funky but also kinda severe so you kinda need bothChoose one he would repeat Squirming I would direct him to eliminate anadjective and then Schiff after a respectful beat would strike the otherWhere adjectives are concerned theres no substitute for tough love            Now that Schiff hasbecome a bigdeal screenwriter his Lolita generated scads of ink andhis adaptation of True Crime  directed by and starring Clint Eastwoodopens next week its as if those last  years didnt happen Im sittinghere trying to choose one or another adjective for his newest script TheDeep End of the Ocean an exhausting task because Im genuinely of twominds about the picture I want to say its subtle but I also want to say itsheavyhanded I want to say its incisive but I have too many problems withits psychological elisions to let it off the hook Based on a novelone ofthose Oprah best sellersby Jacquelyn Mitchard its the story of a motherBeth Cappadora Michelle Pfeiffer whose yearold son vanishes in a hotellobby The first section of the film dramatizes the apparent kidnapping and itsagonizing aftermath Then after nine years in which Beth and her husband PatTreat Williams achieve a queasy normalcy with their remaining two childrena yearold boy Ryan Merriman shows up at their door offering to cut theirlawn for money Is it Could it be I hope Im not spoiling anythingall thisis in the films coming attractions            The first part of The Deep End of the Ocean ispowerful all right but given this kind of material that isnt much of anachievement And Im not sure what Whoopi Goldberg is doing there as a lesbiandetective with about as much verisimilitude as Goldbergs yearold alienbartender on Star Trek The Next Generation  But in the nebulous middlesection the movie develops layers and Schiff and director Ulu Grosbardachieve something extraordinary They dramatize the undramatizedthe latentWhen an actress such as Patricia Arquette presents a blank face to the cameraits really blank but Pfeiffers blankness can make you seasick with itssloshing stormy underpinnings Williams gives off glints of suppressedviolence and as the couples older son Jonathan Jackson has a queeraffectlessness that signals something roiling underneath The familys fakeequilibrium creates a tension thats nearly unbearable and when the front doorswung open and that boy stood there it was all I could do to keep from jumpingout of my seat            But the movie growsincreasingly frustrating The kid we learn was taken by a woman crazy withthe loss of her own baby and then raised after her suicide by a bigheartedguy called George John Kapelos who had no knowledge of his adopted sonstrue origins So the Cappadoras elation at the return of their son isgradually eroded by the realization that their boy still thinks of George ashis real father But how are we to take the evident inability of Beth and Pateven to address the subject of the boys nine years with another couple ortheir bland expectation that hell nestle himself into the family bosom as ifhed never left Are they supposed to be so shallow so uncurious sodim Its hard to tell since so much has been left offscreenincluding aclimactic discussion between the boy and his stepfather that triggers thefilms absurd ending            Theres another aspect of Mitchards narrative that bugsme although here my reasons are entirely personal As someone born to a motherin her first year of medical school and a father in his third I waswithgreat regretplaced in the care of grandparents for the first years of my lifeand later reclaimed before my third birthday Hundreds of thousands of dollarsin psychiatric bills later I can speak about this with limited objectivitythe point is that although very young when taken from my primarycaregiversmy grandparentsI recall both the joy of my years with them andthe hellish trauma of separation more vividly than much of what happened to melast week I risk boring you with my autobiography to buttress my contentionthat The Deep End of the Ocean is fundamentally bogus I dont buy thatSam in his fourth year at the time of his snatching would less than a decadelater have no recollection of the parents and siblings with whom hed spentthe first three and that only the aroma of a cedar chest would rekindle faintmemories of his warm life among the Cappadoras I find it absurd that he couldever have settled into life with his new family especially a certifiably crazymother with no scars growing into a happy snubnosed uncomplicatedadolescent instead of say the delusional mommasboy assassin of Six Waysto Sunday or for that matter a vaguely unstable wannabe movie criticPeople differ of course and there might be ways to account for Samssurprising evolution but theyre not in the novel and theyre certainly not inthe movie
