                                 Pay Scales in Black and White            This column is about racialdiscrimination But more importantly its about how a little arithmetic can goa long way toward settling a controversy            The controversy I have inmind is Why do blacks earn less than whites do The easiest hypothesis is thatthe employers discriminate Some commentators have attempted to dismiss thathypothesis on the grounds that discrimination is costly because it entails awillingness to pay premium wages for white workers and therefore unattractiveto employers with an eye on the bottom line            But thatkind of dismissal is too glib because it is not based on any estimate of howmuch it costs to discriminate Without that estimate we cant evenbegin to think about whether the cost is high enough to make muchdifference            Iwant to provide the missing estimate starting with a fewassumptions that are reasonably commensurate with reality First Ill supposethat blacks constitute  percent of the work force Second Ill suppose thatblacks because of discrimination earn  percent of what whites earn ThirdIll make an assumption again guided by realworld observations about whathappens to corporate revenue Ill assume that for every dollar paid to theworkers a half dollar gets paid to the bondholders and the stockholderscollectivelylets say the bondholders and the stockholders each get aquarter            To make those assumptionsmore concrete suppose youre the manager of a corporation that employs oneblack and nine whites paying the black  and the whites  apieceThat makes your total wage bill  The bondholders and the stockholderseach receive one fourth as much as the workers thus each group gets So your payouts look like this                         Thespecific numbers in the preceding paragraph dont matter If you assume employees instead of  or wages of  and  instead of  and the conclusions to follow will remain unaffected            Now we can estimate the cost of yourdiscrimination Notice first that discrimination must be quite common in yourindustry otherwise your black worker would have gone elsewhere long ago Thatmeans there are a lot of blacks working for  in this industry If youcould put aside your racism youd fire your nine  white employees andreplace them with some of those  blackscutting your wage bill by            Where would the  insavings go The same place any corporate savings gointo the pockets of thestockholders increasing their earnings from  to a percent increase overnight Your payouts now look like this                         When thereturn to stockholders rises by  percent so must the price of yourcompanys stock Thats enough to put you on the cover of Time magazineas the financial genius of the century To continue discriminating is to throwaway an opportunity for unprecedented financial success            In fact that same opportunity is available to every othercorporate manager in the industry as well and theyre rejecting it tooremember that discrimination must be widespread or all blacks would move tonondiscriminatory firms So in order to believe that discrimination explainsthe blackwhite wage differential you must believe that managers throughoutthe industry are so blinded by racism that they are willing to throw away a percent gain for their stockholders and the acclaim of all Wall Street forthemselves Personally I find that wildly implausible            Thats not an irrefutabledisproof that discrimination exists but its at least a calculation that needsto be taken seriously If we had come up with a number like  percent ratherthan  percent it would have been far easier to maintain a belief thatemployers discriminate            The figureof  percent is based on numerical assumptions that are reasonable but notironclad If you juggle those initial assumptions a bit youll get a numberother than  percent coming out at the end and you might or might notdiscover a scenario in which discrimination is plausible My guess is that youwont but then again you and I might have different standards for whatsplausible Regardless of how that experiment turns out its well worthperforming Without some such test there is simply no way to know whetherdiscrimination is a credible hypothesis            If we rule out employer discrimination theremust be some other explanation for the blackwhite wage differential Supposefor example that there is discrimination not by employers but by customerswho are willing to pay a premium for goods and services produced by whiteworkers To advocate that theory convincingly youd have to estimate the sizeof the premium and assess whether its something that consumers would plausiblypay I invite readers to do their own arithmetic            Alternative theories positthat blacks earn less because they have fewer marketable skills Like theoriesof discrimination these theories are best judged by quantitative criteria butnow we have to go beyond what can be computed on the back of an envelope andlook for example at what we can learn from standardized test scores            Accordingto recent research by Derek Neal of the University of Chicago and WilliamJohnson of the University of Virginia blackwhite wage differentials arelargely explained by differences in skill levels which are already detectableat an early age Richard J Herrnstein and Charles Murray had previouslyreported similar findings in their bestselling book The Bell Curve  Toexplain those skill differentials one can try pointing either to training orheredity            Herrnstein and Murray argued that heredity plays asubstantial role but Neal and Johnsons more recent findings tend to refutethat interpretation For one thing Neal and Johnson report that theperformance gap between blacks and whites is considerably larger for youngadults than it is for teenagers Thats hard to explain if the gap is causedby heredity why should an inherent difference become larger over time butnot if its caused by training if blacks get inferior schooling then its notsurprising that the effects are greater after  years of schooling than aftersix            Much research remains to bedone and is being done and will be done All of that research at least whenit is useful will be quantitative in one way or another Some of it requiressophisticated techniques and sophisticated measurements But there arecasesand discrimination is one of themwhere the inherent plausibility of atheory can be well tested with nothing more than the back of an envelope and anopen mind
