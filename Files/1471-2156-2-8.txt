                    Background        Dystrophin and its associated proteins are thought to be        involved in the anchoring of the muscle cell membrane to        the extracellular matrix   and the absence of many of        these proteins can lead to the phenotype of muscular        dystrophy   The dystrophinassociated protein complex        DAPC consists of several subgroups of protein complexes        each associated either directly or indirectly with        dystrophin The sarcoglycans are four transmembrane        proteins   that are organized by a fifth protein called        sarcospan   This complex is thought to be involved in        signalling at the cell membrane   A second subcomplex        known as the dystroglycan complex   interacts directly        with dystrophin in the cytoplasm and laminin in the        extracellular matrix thus providing a structural link        between the inside and the outside of the cell A third        subcomplex involves the dystrobrevins    and        syntrophins   which form a complex at the Cterminal        region of dystrophin     and have an as yet        unidentified function        Desmuslin DMN was recently identified as an        dystrobrevininteracting protein via the yeast twohybrid        method   Both desmuslin mRNA and protein are expressed        primarily in cardiac and skeletal muscle and the gene        encodes a novel intermediate filament IF protein of         amino acids Electron microscopic analysis shows that        desmuslin colocalizes with desmin another muscle IF        protein Coimmunopreciptation experiments revealed that        the desmuslin and dystrobrevin interaction involves the        region of protein encoded by exons  of dystrobrevin        and domains A through A of the desmuslin rod domain        Desmuslin is hypothesized to function as a mechanical        support to the muscle myofibers by making a previously        unrecognized linkage between the extracellular matrix via        the DAPC and the Zdiscs through desmin and plectin                 As several IF proteins including desmin have been        implicated in human genetic disorders such as dominant and        recessive congenital and adult onset myopathies             desmuslin becomes a candidate to be involved in        myopathies as well Supporting this is the exclusive        expression of         DMN in skeletal and cardiac muscle        The         DMN gene was analyzed for mutations        in  patients with various forms of muscular dystrophy and        myopathy In addition to  singlenucleotide polymorphisms        SNPs that do not change the protein sequence we        identified  SNPs that do alter the residue they encode        Although examination of controls has shown that none of        them is likely to cause the phenotype our results are        useful for future disequilibrium studies of this region of        chromosome q and for mutation analysis and        association studies in other genetic disorders                    Results and Discussion        Using the         DMN cDNA sequence AF as a        query to blast the public human genome database we found a        genomic clone AC that included the entire desmuslin        coding sequence The alignment identified  exons which are        schematically indicated in Figure  Eleven sets of primer        pairs were developed to amplify the  exons and the        flanking intron sequences Table  The primers were        designed to amplify overlapping segments of the desmuslin        coding sequence as indicated in Figure         Desmin a desmuslininteracting protein has been        implicated in hereditary distal myopathies implying that        desmuslin itself may also be involved in myopathies of        unknown etiology DNA samples isolated from  dystrophic        and myopathic patients as described in Table  were        analyzed by direct sequencing to determine whether the        phenotype was the result of a desmuslin mutation All        observed variants were subsequently tested in   control        individuals These analyses revealed  common and  rare        SNPs    that alter an amino acid codon  result in        nonconservative amino acids changes Table         None of the SNPs seem associated with the patient        phenotypes as each was also found in the control        population Nine silent SNPs which did not alter an amino        acid were also identified in the patient population        several of these SNPs showed a high degree of        heterozygosity Most were tested for and detected in the        control population thus making desmuslin an unlikely        candidate to be involved in these myopathies but this        first pass can be followed by others in a larger set of        patient samples        Interestingly SNP  a CT substitution resulting in        a premature stop codon in exon  was detected in a single        Nemaline myopathy patient Neither the probands mother nor        any of the other patients was found to carry this mutation        Figure A The CT mutation removed a Pvu II site thus        permitting detection of the alteration by restriction        digest analysis of a PCR product generated from genomic        DNA The assay is outlined schematically in Figure Band        documented in Figure C Using this Pvu II assay the CT        change was detected in the unaffected father of the        patient making it unlikely that heterozygosity for the        CT change is the causative mutation in the myopathic        proband        The removal of the Pvu II site allowed rapid screening        of additional patients and control samples by DNA        amplification of the region and subsequent digestion of the        PCR product with Pvu II One of  control chromosomes was        found to have lost the Pvu II site and the heterozygous        presence of the CT mutation was confirmed by DNA        sequencing of the PCR product Thus it is likely that the        CT mutation is not responsible for the myopathic        phenotype of the proband This is a surprising result        considering that a single copy of this stop codon is        present in   of the population and  of        the population is predicted to carry this nonsense mutation        in a homozygous state The phenotype of the latter        individuals is not known        There is the possibility that either the heterozygous        CT         DMN mutation combined with another        mutation in a different gene or the CT in a homozygous        state causes muscular dystrophy or myopathy of unknown        genetic pathogenesis The CT         DMN mutation is a good candidate to        be a modifier for muscular andor cardiac phenotypes        considering i the frequency of the mutation in the        normal population in the heterozygous as well as homozygous        state and ii the key role of desmuslin in connecting the        Zdiscs to the extracellular matrix The desmuslin SNPs        should be examined in a larger set of myopathy and muscular        dystrophy patients to test this hypothesis More        specifically it should be determined whether there is a        statistically significant difference in the frequency of        individual or clustered SNP haplotypes between the patient        and the control populations        The desmuslin coding sequence is highly polymorphic with         SNPs that do not alter an amino acid and  that do Ten        of these variations have minor allele frequencies that are        represented in over  of the chromosomes sampled These         are spaced within a genomic interval of   kilobases        or approximately  per  bases These highly informative        markers are thus very useful for genetic analysis The        presence of so many SNPs within the coding sequence of a        protein is somewhat unexpected and is much greater than        that documented for other genes This degree of variability        may reflect a redundancy of desmuslin at the Zline where        other IF proteins with potentially overlapping functions        are located                      Conclusions        The characterization of the individual components that        form protein complexes in skeletal muscle and heart        especially information concerning genotypephenotype        correlations will increase our understanding of the        pathophysiology of human muscle diseases We encourage        other groups to test for the presence of the CT         DMN mutation in their human patient        samples affected by muscular and cardiac diseases The        generation of desmuslin null animal models will also        contribute to the understanding of the role of this protein        in muscle and cardiac disease                    Materials and Methods        Blood samples were obtained from patients and control        subjects under IRBapproved informed consent
