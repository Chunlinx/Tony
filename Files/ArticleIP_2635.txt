                                 The FinancialNews Fad            I believe it was thetransformation of Maria Bartiromo into a household name that told me thatsomething new was really afoot Granted shes only a household name in certainhouseholds but the yearold host of CNBCs Business                Centerhas enjoyed a precipitous ascent up the fame ladder seeing herself featured inNewsweek and USA Today and interviewed by David LettermanBartiromo in short has been anointed the new face of the new boom in businessnews            Theboom can be seen in the arrival of business news on the front pages of dailynewspapers the rise of business coverage at mainstream publications likeGQ and Vanity                Fair and above all in the new attentionbeing paid to television networks like CNBC and CNNfn The buzz at least isthat the growing diffusion of stock ownership has made Americans care much moreabout the stock market than ever before while the uncontested authority of thefree market has placed business at the center of the culture            As it happens its difficult to figure outwhether business news really is much more popular or whether networkexecutives and media analysts have just decided it should be  CNBCsbusiness shows have an average viewership of somewhere between  and The networks viewership peaked at just over a million when the marketcrashed Oct  CNNfn meanwhile still gets hash marks instead of Nielsenratings which means that its audience is so small that it cant be measuredAnd while Moneyline CNNs  pm business roundup hosted by Lou Dobbswhos also in charge of CNNfnoften draws close to half a million viewersthats still insignificant next to anything the major networks do            Ofcourse CNNfn is hindered by the fact that so few cable systems carry ititsavailable in only  million homes For its part CNBC insists that itsaudience during the trading day is underestimated by at least  percentbecause a significant number of brokers and traders supposedly keep theirtelevisions tuned to it as they go about their business This may well be truebut even if it is it doesnt tell us very much about the broader impact of thefinancialnews boom since those analysts presumably have always paid seriousattention to the market            Nonetheless it seems likely that the growingimportance of the stock market to the retirement plans of middleclassAmericans has translated into steppedup coverage of business news and agreater willingness on the part of mainstream news outletsdaily newspapersand network televisionto showcase pieces on market turmoil The problem isthat the new wave of business news doesnt really illuminate the workings ofthe system all that well In fact most socalled business news isnt reallynews about businessthe creation and distribution of goods and servicesatall Instead most of it is market newsfruitless attempts to explain whattraders are going to do in the near future or somewhatbesidethepointexplanations of why traders did what they did in the near past If CNBC andCNNfn are the sports pages of the late s the way they cover the stockmarket is analogous to a football commentator worrying more about a teamspopularity than about its wonlost record            To besure if you watch CNBC all day long youll pick up some interesting news aboutparticular companies and the economy as a whole Unfortunately to get to theuseful information you have to wade through reams of useless stuff withlittle guidance on how to distinguish between the two The basic reality of anallnews channel after all is that there is a huge amount of time to fillevery single day As a result CNBC and CNNfn both offer a hodgepodge offundamental analysis technical analysis macroeconomic news trend spottersand the occasional hardnews story A day spent watching CNBC is an objectlesson in what the word pastiche really means            From one angle of course this might seem tobe the ideal expression of the supermarket approach to understanding theworldor in this case the stock market CNBC doesnt offer just one angle onthe market It offers multiple perspectives in order to let viewers choose forthemselves Ill have two pounds of technical analysis one pound of momentumtrading and a halfpound of fundamentals Thanks So first we get atechnical analyst who believes that if you look at the charts of a stocksmovements over the past year you can discern coherent patterns that will guideyou in predicting when that stocks price is due to rise or fall That analystis followed by another who believes that the key is to seek out and buy thoseindustries currently in favor with investors She in turn is followed by anadvocate for a more conventional approach looking for companies with strongearnings growth that are currently trading at low stock prices            Theproblem here is not that the technical analyst is crazy although he is Theproblem is that these analyses of the market are presented as if theyre all ofequal valuewhen in truth for any one to be correct the others with someminor exceptions must be incorrect The network intervieweroften the sameonetalking to these various analysts never says Your argument directlycontradicts the one we heard just  minutes ago Why should we believe youInstead theres just a lot of nodding in assent            One way of averting this problem would be forCNBC or CNNfn to feature discussions among advocates of different approaches tounderstanding the market But that sort of open conflict would run the risk ofrevealing the inherently futile nature of the project these networks areengaged in namely trying to make sense of the stock markets movement in theshort term Each day after all there are lots of different reasons why themarket does what it does But youll never be able to summarize them allandmore importantly whatever reasons you find today arent going to help youunderstand what the market will do tomorrow In the short term investing isreally just a random walk            Whats really wrong withthe financialnews boom then is that by creating the illusion that the walkis other than random it depends upon and encourages a traders approach toinvesting The point of having a stock market after all is not so that peoplecan buy Intel at  when its on its way up and sell at  to reap a quickprofit The point is that investors are supposed to direct capital towardcompanies that will make productive use of it and direct capital away fromcompanies that will not Just as indexfund investing defeats this purpose sotoo does trading based on anything other than an evaluation of a companysunderlying prospects for the future Thats why ideally CNBC would featurenothing but informative pieces on publicly traded companies with occasionalglances at the overall economic climate Of course its ratings would soon beturned into hash marks Which might suggest that real business news isno more popular than it ever was
