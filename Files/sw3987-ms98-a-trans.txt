                okay um have you ever had to put one a a family member in a nursing home   no but were getting pretty close to it my wifes uh uh stepfather uh is in the hospital right now and hopefully we can pull him out uh back home but we dont know yet   oh uhhuh oh   how about yourself   well my mom is sixty five and shes which i feel is you know quite young still but shes not in the greatest of health and   uhhuh   so recently she has been talking a lot about what we would do if we had to put her in a nursing home shes adamant that she does not want to live with any of her children   uhhuh   and put that burden on us   yeah so so is uh so is our uh my  my uh my mothers parents   oh uhhuh   my family my mother mother and daddy are dead   uhhuh but their parents are still alive oh my goodness wow  oh   umhum eighty four and eighty   yeah see eighty four one eighty four year old man thats in the hospital     uhhuh   but uh weve been looking into it and uh course nursing homes i think uh you would find that uh you would want uh one close to home   right   and one that has a pleasant surrounding   umhum   and one that has good staff that uh you know will take care of you and treat you you know like a a like an individual   right   and uh and look after your every needs i know down here in Texas weve had a lot of problems with nursing homes that uh that dont uh take care of their people   umhum oh   theyve gone in theyve closed down a lot of them and they put new regulations on some of them you go in you find an old person with a bed sore because they havent been turned or havent been cleaned   oh oh dear   so uh all of that uh you know i think someone needs to know uh about uh the qualifications of a nursing home   umhum   and the staff   now  how do you go about finding out things like that you   well lets assume that uh you wanted to take your mother to a uh nursing home there locally in Ogden im sure youve got some thats close by   uhhuh   it would it what would be real nice is find one around the corner that you could visit that you could go in and uh talk to the people talk to some of the peoples uh uh siblings   right umhum oh thats right   or uh you know children children and uh find out how they like it you know course one of the most important things is is uh can you afford it   uhhuh well thats true   and uh down in some small cities here in Texas its about fifteen hundred dollars a month over here in Dallas its closer to three thousand if you really wanna get super care you know you can pay anything you want to   thats right oh my     course we havent even mentioned Medicaid uh which and uh which uh would take care of an individual who is destitute   boy well umhum uhhuh   and course theres a lot to be said about uh making a member destitute   oh well   as opposed to uh paying for it yourself because the government you know uh provides for a destitute person   umhum well thats what my moms been saying you know shes been just saving her money and not paying a penny of it but she says my little bit of savings will probably pay for a nursing home for maybe a year and then ill be on Medicaid anyway so she said   yeah   why dont i go out and and enjoy life while i can and you know  when i get to that point of being in a nursing home then maybe Medicaid will just have to take care of me but why dont i just enjoy life now   yeah well yeah and thats true because uh after the years gone all of her savings are going to be eaten up and if she owns her house uh       im not sure about the total rules on the house but i assume that youd have to sell the house and those proceeds would go to pay for the nursing home     i think so yes   and anyway its while its unlawful       um theres nothing wrong with a parent gifting everything she has to uh to uh to an individual like uh like like you   uhhuh uhhuh   and then uh from there on out uh saving that money uh so that uh you could supplement her income after she goes under Medicaid   oh   a lot of people do that   oh   and most one of the most important things uh about sending a person to uh the nursing home is is the burial provided for   uhhuh   see that should be provided for before she ever goes out of her monies or otherwise you know the the uh the uh the kids have to provide that   thats right uhhuh   so uh you know i sure youve thought of all this   yeah well its its kind of a sad thing to think about isnt it   oh yes its very sad we had a discussion with her mother who is uh is eighty years old this past weekend and uh   yeah     hm
