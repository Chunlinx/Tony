        so you have a child     yeah we have a   two years old in child care right now   two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh   umhum     pretty reasonable price we think how about you do you have any children   uh yes our first and he just turned three months   oh boy   so were  just starting into hunting for child care right now both of us are students   yeah are you where are you student   uh uh University of Southern Mississippi   no kidding   um   i was a professor in a university here in California for a while   shes yeah   yeah uh are you gonna uh put your son in child care in a a year or two   uh probably um   yeah   actually spring semester a year from now hes gonna have to be in child care for uh five days a week       more than likely uh depending on how my class schedule runs because my wife will be doing her internship that semester itll be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing   yeah uhhuh yeah   so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four six anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care by that point right now were trying to avoid it but we just a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him uh i get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class you know once a day this overlap happens where we cant one of us be home so for about twenty minutes twenty thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in   yeah yeah well thats a good experience i think and uh  there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternatives and what we found   umhum   um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were gonna be loving and uh  thats more important than anything else we could have sent uh her to a fancier   umhum yeah   um facility um she goes to a home this is a um   umhum   a couple uh emigrated from China early in in their lives theyve been here probably thirty forty years theyve got three daughters   umhum yeah   um and they have a loving home and uh theyre both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon     umhum   and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so its a good experience i think if its good i think its very good for the child   yeah uh that makes a big difference yes   and if its a loving environment i think its very good and and thats really what weve learned about it shell have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of a preschool in a year   yeah   but um we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace i dont know what its like around uh Hattiesburg   theres a lot of child care available but invariably theres waiting lists   uhhuh yeah   and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh universitys uh uh department of um uh well their Home Economics Department   yeah ill bet theyre involved yeah   um they uh they have a subbranch uh American Family Counseling and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus but uh they have a pretty good size  waiting list  so uh   yeah well thats uh i know its its a real uh hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities out here at Stanford they have a   umhum   you know a a a real good facility and there uh is is quite a waiting list to get into that so its uh   yeah   you know its a its a its an important decision its an industry thats still a cottage industry and i think that it it really is buyer beware     yeah well its best yeah a cottage industrys the best way to do it really because if you over   well it is the best way to do it interestingly i think that um my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that thats a good sign and that um   umhum   private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn because i think what were gonna go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market as a matter of fact my future is banked on that   yeah   yeah   uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for   umhum   uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life   yes its amazing how much good things like uh Sesame Street will do   its its phenomenal its phenomenal the the programming   is uh   the human operating system is my area
