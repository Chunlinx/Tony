                                 Inside Out            About  years ago artistChris Burden arranged to have a friend shoot him in the arm with a rifle Healso crawled over broken glass and was briefly crucified on top of a VolkswagenBug Works like Shoot made Burden famous within art circles after aGuinness Book of World Records fashion But Burdens masochisticperformance art had something in common with more mainstream American art ofthe s and s Like pop and minimalism it was provocatively easy tomake Aside from the hours spent documenting such feats and recovering fromthem Burdens art didnt occupy much of his time            At thisyears Whitney Biennial the prestigious roundup of new American art BurdensPizza City is one of the highlights of the show There are no guns or glassshards here however Burden has abandoned drama for a childlike laboriousnessComposed of thousands of miniature parts Pizza City is a scale model of asprawling whimsical metropolis laid out on table topsa model train setminus the trains Some of the houses shrubs trees and cars actually comefrom trainset manufacturers The other elements are miscellaneous plumbingfixtures kitchen appliances yardsale leftovers all ingeniously recycled tobecome skyscrapers factories freeways The result is likable but not muchmore Its a kids toy albeit one that an established artist devoted sevenyears of his life to making            Such cottage industriousness is the ruling spirit of the Biennial At its best it translates into a kind of stoopsale livelinessTheres lots to look at most of it has an introverted madefromscratchintensity Like Burden Michael Ashkin does scale models though his aresolemn not whimsical stretches of miniature Western highway so realistic thatphotographs of them are indistinguishable from photos of real highwaysAshkins fastidiousness pales beside that of Charles Ray For a film projectcalled Self Portrait with Homemade Clothes Ray learned how to sew his ownclothing and grind his own eyeglasses then traveled to Switzerland to learn tomake a watch from scratch Obsession is the name of the game Devote threemonths to a project and youre a hobbyist Devote seven years and youre inthe Biennial            Obsessionhas always been a buzzword in the art world a less corny moresecularsounding synonym for inspiration But suddenly its a word that artis measured against Obsession after all is what connects increasinglypopular outsider artists such as Henry Darger a Chicago janitor who painted and wrote apage fantasy about little girls with penises to insider artists such asBurden Ashkin and Ray Darger isnt in this exhibition but his work ethicis In the catalog essay curators Lisa Philips and Louise Neri give a nod tothe insideroutsider connection but they dismiss it as a fluke of economichistorythey claim that in todays weak market artists have more time ontheir hands This is ridiculous For most artists fewer sales meansless time to work more time spent paying the rent The explanation forthe ethos of laboriousness strikes me as much simplerit serves as proof ofthe artists personal commitment Even the worst work demands from you theadmission that at least the artists are authentic Theyve put in too muchsweat equity to be bluffing            Of course getting shot in the arm is about asfar as you can go in the Im not bluffing department which may be why thecurators call Burden one of the two role models for the mostly younger artistsin this Biennial The other is Vija Celmins who paints numbing meticulouscopies of nature photographs But the real role model here is Marcel DuchampDuchamps The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors Even familiarly known asthe Large Glass is the granddaddy of this kind of handson conceptualistart Duchamp worked for more than  years on the Large Glass devising petnames for its idiosyncratic imagery and writing detailed incomprehensiblenotes Calvin Tomkins an ardent Duchampian calls them magisteriallyunclear As anyone who has ever been to Philadelphia to see it knows theresult isnt particularly engaging By the time he made it Duchamp was opposedto visual art as such He disparaged painting as retinal stupidity            Many ofthe works on display here could be seen as personal variations on the LargeGlass They vary enormously in appearance since appearances are notnecessarily important They can be big and messy as in Jason Rhoadesfactoryfloorstyle installation or small and neat as in Bruce Connersinkblot drawings The only visual quality they have in common is a doggedintricacy This intricacy isnt just unlike minimalism it is its ideologicalopposite Minimalist art was simple serious and totally public It sat on thewall and left us to make up our own minds about what it was all aboutObsessivism drags us into its space though we remain voyeurs Minimalismenforced a pokerfaced code of silence Obsessivism chatters to itself in abizarre idiolect Both however leave us out in the cold            For me the low point of the showand of obsessivism ingeneralis Annette Lawrences Moon series Lawrence draws large spiralscomposed of hundreds of calendar dates    etc arranged were told according to a Mayan counting system Once worklike this might have at least had a polemical feminist edge Now it just comesacross as a new form of navelgazing Its menstrual narcissism            In hismost recent book philosopher Arthur Danto claims that this bleak retreat intothe fortress of the self is a permanent one Art history has flickered out hesays and though art will continue to be made each artist will follow his orher bliss without any larger motive or connective scheme Its Pizza Cityforever Walking around this Biennial which happens to be the last of the th century I had the glum feeling that Danto was right            On the other hand millennial melancholia has away of being wrong There are reasons to be optimistic about the future of arteven at the Whitney One of them is Kara Walker a young AfricanAmericanartist from Atlanta who makes narrative murals in a  thcenturystyle silhouette technique Walkers works are a sort of lewd fantasiaabout the Old South full of sex cannibalism chivalry folklore and humorIt isnt always easy to figure out what she is talking about Her stories toocan seem hermetic like pictures from a private universe But most of the timeher cutouts are generously imaginative and outwarddirected connecting viewersto their shared national past Walker makes History painting that mustypatriarchal fossil seem like the most seditious and vital new idea of the st century
