        the biggest social change that ive seen in the last ten years       is that i you know im only twenty four twenty five right just turned twenty five and ten years ago i can remember when it was not common to see two people in a family or household working and getting behind and uh running into economic problems the way things are today um you know today just to get by in many cases you have to have two people working in the middle income house just to stay with where they were in the seventies   umhum umhum umhum i agree with that   and and its its really rough thats probably the biggest thing ive noticed   well id have to take a slightly different thing uh viewpoint uh im uh thirty five uh and um uh to me its something a little more subtle it its just a prevalence of computer technology and uh everyday life i mean i can remember when everything was still done by by hand by paper by hand  as opposed to computer generated paper now   yeah     um you know uh before uh you know when uh clerks in grocery stores uh actually had to be able to add things up and in their head and check it       which is  plusses and minuses there i guess   yeah i remember when we were going to the grocery store when i was younger those big monstrosity cash register   oh yeah yeah   with the greens buttons the rows and rows   yeah umhum and it was actually quite and art form to see some of the you know older or or more experienced cashiers go you know fly through that is like those Japanese hippies see what the abacus is still   yeah   uh so uh maybe thats just a different viewpoint uh but uh i just remember everything well just writing a letter for for work you know i mean in word processor you know we can to me i cant even image now how they even produced books or letters before word processors you know then wed have to through fifty iterations at least the way i write letters and things       yeah i i found all through school you know you write your hand to death you go through pens and uh im actually because i have two computers here im actually loosing the ability to write by hand and feel comfortable doing it         its too slow i think the speed of the computer i think much faster because i can type much faster than i can actually write now   yeah   and i what happens is words will drop out of writing and ill go back because im thinking so im thinking at the speed that i type on the computer   right right   and you know we didnt have that problem ten years ago and then we didnt have fax machines and we didnt have to you know press one if you want to be directed to the service department press two   right yeah i you know i i i dont even write any more mainly because uh well i can type faster like you can and also my handwriting is  legible i cant i cant blame it on that printer most of the time so         its its incredible you know i remember i started on a Commodore sixty four in ninety eighty six that was my first computer and today im on a three eight six thirty three and its too slow you know i cant wait   yeah hey same here same here yeah we     its got to go faster you know   well were getting greedy i guess but uh well with regarding to your comment i i have to agree with that too theres a prevalence of uh       of uh two income households that uh you never really saw before although i probably on the exception of that my both my parents did work but most of my friends parents when i was growing up   hum   the mother did not and uh its simply not the case and uh to to keep the uh bank that owns your house happy the bank that owns both your cars happy and the bank that owns your credit card happy  you do have to         i think my wife in fact uh started to work parttime now because wed started out we got married she had not uh uh wanted to work uh after we had our first kid and i said fine but now paying for these kids  shes shes had to back to work parttime   oh yeah up here up here in Rochester almost everybody works for Kodak or Xerox and ten ten years ago you were always assured of having a job   um yeah i remember that   and now you you know i my grandfather worked for his entire life for Kodak my father the same thing but now everyones worried and and uh you cant rely on that kind of thing anymore everything sped up so fast and theres no more oldfashioned reliability in things anymore the way pace the pace has changed   i remember when i got out of college which was seventy eight people said now if you get a job with General Motors or ATT or IBM youre set for life   umhum not after ATTs going to let go fifty thousand people i im uh constantly putting stuff up in  telecom from the CWA the union there and theyre letting people go like crazy its just it theyre replacing them with computers   well you plus you know you know after the uh divestiture or well break up
