        okay what kind of house do you live in     well uh we live in a a brick home in far north Dallas and its uh four bedrooms and three and a half baths and  swimming pool in the back and   uhhuh     its about thirty five hundred square feet   well it sounds like ours are pretty similar i live in one i dont have a swimming pool and mines about twenty seven hundred square foot   yeah   but the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about  about alike i think its pretty much typical for this area   it is have you been living there very long   ive been in the house im in here right now about twelve and a half years   so youve been there longer we built this one about uh its been lets see       its been six years six and a half years ago and we subcontracted it on ourselves we bought the lot and     umhum oh really   uh had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications and then we subbed it out so   umhum   weve been here a little over six years now and uh have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in   umhum well i bet you have uhhuh uhhuh   my husband got his big garage he had we have a three car garage but he has a big work area in it and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and   umhum     so he has all the work space he needs   well that sounds interesting i bet hes enjoyed having it that way because some kind of hard to find one prebuilt thats kind of fits those specifications   he it is and thats why we decided to build we looked at things that were already uh built and the garages were always   uhhuh   if the house were was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have   well then most of them dont have a three car garage theyre kind of rare   umhum so we put a three car garage in but even if they had three car garages they didnt have a work space all of it was taken up with just car space   uhhuh uhhuh   and so he has a big landing area thats between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on     umhum well that my weve just got a two car garage but my husbands got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything   well sounds like our husbands have similar interests   now mine does not work on cars he just piddles on this and that but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his his piddling things   oh i see uhhuh well thats nice that its not in your house   it really is because you know they have a lot of little things of their own and i you know i wouldnt mind having   umhum   and i at one time was gonna fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff   umhum   but i someone i dont know it ended up i got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something so i didnt end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would   right well we still have a a son and daughter in college that come home and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husbands family come   uhhuh     his parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay and so it seems like its always used as a bedroom   umhum umhum well ive still all three of my daughters are married but i dont know i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time and some of them coming back home and things you know   right umhum oh i understand well   and weve got grandchildren now so   well we  thats true and you dont want them to not be able to come because theres no room   when they come they have to have a place thats right you sure dont at times i keep thinking though that might be kind of nice   well i okay i havent reached that point yet ive heard people say that but uh         my middle son is engaged my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while hes out of college and has a good job so he could afford to get married but   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   is not engaged yet and my daughters been going with the same boy for a while but shes still in college and were just as happy for her to finish her education first   uhhuh well i dont blame you for that   thats what she plans to do so i hope so   well i have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons   oh ho ho   and little boys are around the house   a whole new world umhum   a whole lot more than girls and uh i enjoy them coming but for short doses     i can understand   it feels after theyve been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house they know everything but theyre theyre fun   umhum so youre all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute   well i just watch them i dust i never did put things up when my kids were little and i havent with a them i try to teach them not to get into things   yeah um well thats the same thing that i did and i hope ill be able to do the same with grandchildren   i think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes at least my daughters have they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up so its worked pretty well theres i dont really think anythings been broken every now and then we have to kind of go and say now dont bother this you know but all in all they mind pretty well but i guess most of the houses what kind of roof does your house have here im getting off the subject   well we have
