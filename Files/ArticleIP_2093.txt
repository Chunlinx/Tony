                                 I Smell a Rat            The National Institute onDrug Abuse concludes every press release on its Web site with the boast thatNIDA supports more than  percent of the worlds research on the healthaspects of drug abuse and addiction and publicizes the results of thatresearch            That thegovernments drug warriors are the customers for most health studies on drugabuseand that they aggressively peddle these studiesdoesnt make thestudies automatically suspect In fact the science behind NIDAfunded studiesis reputable  percent of the time But what is suspect is the spinNIDA routinely applies to its sponsored studies such as the successfulflackery that accompanied the marijuana study that appeared in the June edition of Science             The authors of the Science paperActivation ofCorticotropinReleasing Factor in the Limbic System During CannabinoidWithdrawalsuggest in their conclusion that marijuana may be as addictive asheroin and cocaine and that pots subtle disruption of brain chemistry mayleave users  primed for further disruption by other drugs of abuse            Both the New YorkTimes and the Washington Post published pieces based on theNIDAsponsored study The first sentence of the Times story isindistinguishable from that of the NIDA press release            The Times  People whoregularly smoke large amounts of marijuana may experience changes in theirbrain chemistry that are identical to changes seen in the brains of people whoabuse heroin cocaine amphetamines nicotine and alcohol scientists havefound            NIDA Longterm use ofmarijuana produces changes in the brain that are similar to those seen afterlong term use of other major drugs of abuse such as cocaine heroin andalcohol            Althoughthe Post s lead was more original it too followed the NIDA lineMarijuana may be a far more insidious drug than generally thought thePost reported and apparently alters the brain chemistry of pot smokersin ways that may make them particularly vulnerable to hard drugs such asheroin or cocaine two independent research groups have found            How seriously should we take these findings Inone study researchers injected rats with cannabinoidschemicals that act likeTHC the main active ingredient in marijuanafor weeks habituating them tothe compounds Because cannabinoids can linger in the system for some time fewmarijuana users experience anything approximating physical withdrawal if theystop smoking To mimic coldturkey withdrawal the researchers then injectedthese habituated rats with a drug that blocks the effects of allcannabinoids Following the injection of the blocker the researchers observedan increase of the brain chemical CRF in the amygdala a portion of the braininvolved with the emotions of fear and aggression The presence of CRF in theamygdala is associated with stress and anxiety Withdrawal from heroincocaine and alcohol also increases CRF in the amygdala The authors of thepaper lean on these findings to suggest that marijuana acts on the brain asother drugs of abuse do and that users who stop smoking marijuana mightindulge in heroin cocaine or alcohol to stave off the unpleasantness ofincreased CRF in the amygdala            A notfinanced by NIDA that also appeared in the June  Science  and whichwas also mentioned in the Times and Post articles furtherinvestigates the effects of cannabinoids on rats The study found an increaseof the neurotransmitter dopamine in rats nucleus accumbensoften termed thepleasure center of the brainfollowing several cannabinoid injections Mostrecreational drugs like heroin cocaine alcohol and nicotine increasedopamine in the accumbens While recognizing that other researchers have triedand failed to induce an increase of dopamine in the accumbens by injectingcannabinoids the authors use their results to suggest that marijuana is morelike heroin and cocaine than was previously thought            Before going any further consider two points Firstinjected cannabinoids may not mirror the effects of smoked marijuana There areseveral other chemicals in marijuana that may modify the effects of THC aloneand smoking a drug is a different experience from injecting it Imagine thedifference between smoking a cigarette and injecting pure nicotine directlyinto a vein            Second rats are not humansThis does not mean cannabinoid research on rodents is worthless But there areseveral pharmacological and social differences that reduce the relevance of ratresearch to social policy And since the pleasure derived from smokingmarijuana is a core issue consider a third point Rats dont like pot            I knowthis firsthand from my on cannabinoids and rats Initially I felt guilty aboutdrugging rats and then killing them for the necessary dissection At leasttheyre getting stoned first I rationalized Then I realized that beingstoned means very different things to rats and humans Marijuana makes ratsslothful and they excrete all over themselves Before the injection theyrequite friendlythese are lab animals remember not hardened street ratsAfter the injection theyhonestlyseem rather depressed            Another fun fact about rats and pot is thatrats wont  When given the choice of receiving an injection of THC or aplacebo rats consistently choose the placebo And when given the choicebetween a placebo and the cannabinoid blocker rats choose the blocker Tens ofmillions of humans as we know willingly partake of marijuana and thesedifferences between rat and human behavior should discourage us from using tworat studies to assert that a marijuana is addictive in the same way as harderdrugs are and b marijuana primes humans for addiction to harder drugs            TheScience studies also ignore simple truths about brain chemistryConsider that sex causes dramatic increases in dopamine Laughter tooincreases dopamine The syllogism that dopamine equals pleasure and pleasureleads to addiction just doesnt apply directly to human behavior How seriouslywould anyone take a researcher who suggested that laughter could lead to drugsand deadly addictions            And the CRFproducing process associated by the researcherswith marijuana withdrawal is not unique to drugs Just as sex increasesdopamine in the accumbens stubbing ones toe may ignite neurological anxietyIndeed chronic toestubbing can lead to the abuse of analgesics like aspirinAgain the science reported in Science is reputable Its just taken outof context            Also lost in the mix is thatfact that other published and studies have found that cannabinoids dontincrease dopamine in the accumbens Still other researchers have shown thatmonkeys dont like the effects of cannabinoids any more than rats do Butfindings like these that dont support the governments drug agenda are rarelycatapulted into the news by the publicity machine            So lets set aside for amoment the drug preferences and predilections and propensities of rats and turnour attention back to humans Of the estimated  million Americans who havetried marijuana only  percent have gone on to heavy cocaine use Perhaps NIDAand the pliant journalists should inject themselves with a big dose of commonsense
