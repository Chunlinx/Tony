                uh do you want to start do you have any ideas   well the the the changes of course in the past past generation are the women in the work force   thats for sure   um and the while their positions salaries still arent there yet the opportunities for women who are at least driven uh do do tend to be a little bit more compatible with uh changes in life style   um umhum   so i suspect that that may have had more to do with uh changes in society than anything else is the number of the women in the work force   umhum yes and you know you said um along with salaries i also think that i think theres a little bit um that can be i dont know a little more development in the area of respect as well i dont know if women in higher positions are necessarily given the same respect as men   umhum um i think it depends on which positions and perhaps the personalities of the women   yeah thats true   um lets face it there there are men executives who have um uh gotten gotten there by uh rather um unsavory means uh you know  trapping everybody up along the way um when uh uh they may not be necessarily liked but if when a woman does that she is ridiculed   umhum umhum right   uh to the nth degree where as its almost expected of men so some of that is stereotype i think   right its true like the uh the movie Working Girl did you ever see that   umhum i think i have although at the moment you i mean i know a little bit about it but   oh umhum well i think that sort of it was funny because it it sort of gave two very different types of women that both had very strong potentials and one had extremely aggressive and step on whoever you can   yeah right   way of getting to the top and the other one just worked hard and did you know her job and did it well and all that but um   umhum umhum umhum i think the educational opportunities have made some difference uh because at one point i know my motherinlaw used uh talked about when she went to college   yeah   she really sort of had to to do her own way because although she was one of three daughters um and while her parents were um very supportive in many ways they didnt really seem to have the um the the uh i dont know the understanding that that daughters should go on for a college degree uh had they been sons uh you know that would have been expected but for daughters it wasnt as necessary um and see i dont think thats so true anymore i think   sure oh yeah exactly oh not at all   people expect both daughters and sons to have whatever opportunities are available uh i know we have three sons and one daughter but the differences   umhum right and   are are negligent in that area and in fact they they were in my own families as well um it was never considered that my sister and i wouldnt go to college uh you and you know certainly my brothers would but but we were included in that so i think those things do   umhum umhum umhum right well my mother i my parents are older because my siblings are all older im the youngest of older siblings and my mother um was   umhum   had the uh had three sisters and one brother um so she had two sisters and one brother in any case um her she and her two sisters actually had to work and not go to school to put him through school   uhhuh oh yeah   and that i when i mean she  she obviously at the time people didnt think twice about it you know that was just the way you did it but um and and and what was most important to them if they wanted to get a job was if they could type   right right right right well you know that hasnt changed so much   you know um take shorthand and umhum well thats true thats the   i know uh its it its always appalled me because i did not uh suffer that same problem fortunately uh because i went into biological research when i first got out of college um and so you know i was not in a in a situation where i would   uhhuh oh   asked to do typing uh  but um i know that even now um many young women getting out of college   right   tend to find themselves in that position of of having to be uh sort of part of the secretarial pool it might not be called that but that boils down to what it is   yes no it is it is   until they work their way up and i dont think very many young men are ask to do that although perhaps they are asked to do somewhat uh less uh technical jobs or you you know too perhaps uh you know start working their way up but i dont think its quite as um as low on the totem pole   umhum umhum no exactly i know and you know just another whole thing i work at Manpower Temporary Services so i see i see the work force out there and i see a lot of um like whats just whats going on and im finding that   umhum   and maybe this is just the way it always was people in the secretarial pool um that really stand out are the people that that end up being the supervisors of the departments or the managers or whatever and so even though it might be belittled when they first go for the job   umhum umhum umhum   it really is a stepping stone to something a lot greater   yeah i do know that uh there are plenty of uh executive secretaries whose responsibilities are greater than the CEOs uh  that and they may not make the money but they they have a lot of prestige many do make the money too actually but   sure and they i know well but they keep the CEO running you know they keep them oh yeah   umhum and sometimes those are men too sometimes those secretaries are men which is good im glad to see that change um   thats true yep umhum but you its its ive always heard i i dont know if you know this joke its uh it talks about um this this child and his parents were in a car and there was a car accident and you know that one right right   oh yeah and they go to the hospital and uh uh uh one parent what what i guess the the uh father was killed   uh yeah right   and they get to the hospital and the doctor comes in to uh work on the injured child and says oh i cant uh do that thats my child   uhhuh right how does that happen   yeah i mean but see its so obvious i guess the first time i heard it i immediately thought of a doctor because thats what i originally wanted to do  so its but its amazing how many people do you know for a minute stop and think   oh okay well you know i well i think i even did seriously and i   yeah im im yeah sure were all victims of this sure weve weve been brought up in the society thats perpetrated that problem   umhum right um oh what was oh you know one other place is um women in the Army that i think thats really changed a lot   yeah yeah   um i i dont know if i necessarily agree with that but i  i dont think i agree with the Army but thats a whole different topic   well i dont have yeah right right i i suppose my feeling is that it doesnt matter male or female uh at least they if theyre given the same opportunity then thats good although they cant always there there are certainly differences of men and women the i guess the other thing that was asked in this to for us to discuss was um what kind of changes this has brought about or what do we see in the future and uh just because this Sunday past Sunday was Mothers Day of course there was some articles in the newspaper about the uh mother s in the work force and that has that has certainly made a tremendous difference in society   umhum oh oh yeah   but what is interesting is at least in the Washington Post there was um a a a report of a study that suggested that there were more women now who regretted the necessity for having to work and and leave their young children and that more if given the opportunity if if financial if it were not financially necessary would stay home you know would have the choice would make take make the choice of staying home   umhum yep yep   while their children were young um and its interesting because i dont know if thats a switch if somehow maybe thats being revalued or reevaluated or not i was fortunate enough that um well it was a decision   yeah um   uh when we had children to make that decision and we determined that we would live on my salary on my husbands salary when we first got married so that when we had children we would not you you know fall into that necessity of having my having to work and so we made that choice we didnt live as well but we lived well enough   umhum umhum right uhhuh umhum but you made sacrifices and you gained things you know but   uh uh sure but you see for me that was the more more important i know of plenty of friends of friends who did not were not able to make that choice   right right   and thats difficult because i think in the long run uh part of the problem in society and maybe part of what happens to the bad the negative attitude of women working comes about because children remember the the traumas of their mothers trying to work and run the household and some of those things that that has not changed and i think thats a serious issue   yeah yeah right and and and you know and then the marriage suffers because how much time can you physically spend with your husband if your being torn in in all the direction   exactly yeah right oh yeah it its very difficult so that needs to be done and education perhaps education will eventually do it but uh the idea that that all those uh things that were traditionally thought to be the housewife when she was home as a housewife are still hers even if shes out working   yeah right umhum yeah right   uh you know thats a serious problem uh   right uh one thing that i i think Rochester is being a little proactive um several companies are actually now providing some on site very reasonably uh reasonable cost day care   wow thats nice yeah   that is great because then at least the child is going with the parent to you know right to the company   umhum and can take care of the child if if if the child is ill or something yeah yeah   yeah exactly and then the mother the mother or the father whoever can see them during their lunch or you know the um theyre just a lot more available even though theyre still at work theyre not over at some strangers house you know   umhum umhum right and actually i have a few friends who who uh have a a nontraditional a nontraditional uh family in that the husband is is home with the children   oh really   uh and the wife is is out with the more uh uh nine to five kind of job and then the husband in one case is a is a musician so he does uh was uh   uhhuh umhum oh   guitar lessons and does a lot of uh professional playing you know for weekends and so on but essentially its his wife who uh is the primary uh uh money provider there its an interesting situation and they have three children   umhum huh it is oh wow   uh so and it seems to have worked very well but um but those things are rare i i must say theyre still not uh   thats great umhum society still isnt up to just being okay with that you know theyre really not um because even the way you say it you you talk about it as the exception you know right and um   no no it is the exception yeah
