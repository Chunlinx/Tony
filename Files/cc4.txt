                    Introduction        In patients with ARDS and acute pulmonary hypertension        inhaled NO has been shown to selectively dilate pulmonary        vessels perfusing ventilated lung areas and to improve        arterial oxygenation           The        plateau effect of NO on pulmonary vascular resistance and        gas exchange is obtained at various concentrations ranging        from  ppm         In the majority of        patients a major improvement in arterial oxygenation can        be obtained with NO concentrations   ppm             In addition the degree of response as well as the        optimal NO dose varies both between individuals and from        day to day   In sheep with experimental acute lung        injury receiving inhaled NO a dosedependent increase in        arterial oxygenations is found with a plateau effect at NO        concentrations of  ppm    Nitric oxide        concentrations   ppm may result in elevated        concentrations of nitrogen dioxide NO           and methemoglobin particularly when         oxygen is administered together with NO   Because        of the potential lung toxicity of NO           knowledge of the factors influencing        the optimal dose of inhaled NO in humans is of critical        importance for intensivists Recently it has been        suggested that the presence of septic shock may decrease        responsiveness to inhaled NO   among  patients with        ARDS and septic shock only  responded to inhaled NO        with an improvement in PaO          FiO           This proportion was estimated as        abnormally low although there are no published data        reporting the proportion of nonseptic patients with ARDS        responding to inhaled NO by an increase in PaO          FiO            In the present study we        hypothesized that the presence of septic shock and the        administration of vasoconstrictors to patients with ARDS        could modify the doseresponse to inhaled NO We wanted to        assess whether in NOresponding patients with septic shock        higher NO concentrations were required to obtain a        pulmonary effect similar to the one obtained in nonseptic        patients In addition the effect of intravenous        norepinephrine on an NOinduced decrease in pulmonary        artery pressure and increase in arterial oxygenation was        investigated Therefore doseresponse studies were        performed on two groups of critically ill patients with and        without septic shock whose lungs were mechanically        ventilated for ARDS All patients enrolled were NO        responders and patients with septic shock were exclusively        receiving intravenous norepinephrine for hemodynamic        support                    Methods                  Patients          During an  month period  consecutive hypoxemic          patients with ARDS diagnosed on or after admission to          the Surgical Intensive Care Unit SICU of La Piti          Hospital in Paris Department of Anesthesiology were          prospectively screened at an early stage of their          respiratory disease Written informed consent was          obtained from the patients next of kin The study was          approved by the Comit Consultatif de Protection des          Personnes dans la Recherche Biomdicale of La          PitiSalptrire Hospital          Inclusion

increase in          PaO            FiO             PEEP  cmH            O of at least  mmHg after NO          inhalation at an inspiratory concentration of  ppm          These response criteria were fixed in order to select          patients responding to NO by a decrease in MPAP and an          increase in PaO            of sufficient magnitude to allow the          determination of doseresponse curves It was considered          that when the variation of the parameter studied either          PaO            or pulmonary artery pressure was          close or inferior to the precision of measurement it was          not possible to accurately assess the doseresponse          Exclusion criteria were           left ventricular failure defined as a cardiac          index  minm associated

the recent AmericanEuropean Consensus Conference            and its severity was graded according to Murray           et al            In each patient the trachea was orally intubated with          a HiLo Jet TMno  Mallinckrodt tube Inc Argyle NY          which incorporates two side ports one ending at the          distal tip of the endotracheal tube and a more proximal          port ending  cm

       In order to accurately assess the extension of          pulmonar hyperdensities and thereby the severity of ARDS          patients were transported to the Department of Radiology          Thoracic Division for a lung scan The scan was          performed from the apex to the diaphragm using a Tomoscan          SR  Philips Eindhoven and a semiquantitative          assessment of parenchymal consolidation in ZEEP was          performed according to a technique previously described               CT scans were obtained in all patients          except patient  who could not be transported to the          Department of Radiology because of an unstable pelvic          fracture                          Measurements          Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures SAP and

endexpiration were used to determine P           ET CO             In patient  VD           A V           T was not calculated because no          plateau could be identified on the expired CO

the          tank Thus V           T and minute ventilation delivered to          the patients were kept constant for all concentrations of          inhaled NO          Inspiratory expiratory and mean concentrations of NO          and NO            were continuously measured using a          fast response time chemiluminescence apparatus NOX           Srs AixenProvence France Intratracheal gas was          sampled by continuous aspiration through the proximal          side port of the Mallinckrodt endotracheal tube ie           cm from the site of NO administration The NOX  is a          chemiluminescence apparatus specifically designed for          medical use When using an aspiration flow rate of           mlmin the response time  defined as the time necessary          to reach  of a reference NO concentration  is around           s and only mean concentrations of NO can be accurately          measured When an aspiration flow rate of  mlmin is          selected the response time is  ms and inspiratory          and expiratory NO concentrations can be accurately          measured In a previous study we demonstrated that          inspiratory and expiratory concentrations of NO were          adequately measured by the NOX  with a precision of                      During the study inspiratory and expiratory NO          concentrations were continuously measured and recorded          after setting the aspiration flow rate of the NOX  at           mlmin In addition in steady state conditions          mean intratracheal NO concentrations were measured by          setting the aspiration flow rate of the NOX  at           mlmin When the aspiration flow rate was changed the          tidal volume setting of the ventilator was modified          accordingly in order to achieve a constant minute          ventilation and stable NO concentration In order to          increase precision two different operating ranges of          measurement were used depending on the concentrations of          NO administered to the patient an operating range of           ppm was selected for inspiratory tracheal concentrations          of    and  ppm and an operating range of           ppm for inspiratory tracheal concentrations of            and  ppm When  ppm was selected calibration          was performed using a tank of NO with a reference          concentration of  ppm CFPO Air Liquide France          when  ppm was selected calibration was performed          using a tank of NO with a reference concentration of           ppm CFPO Air Liquide France Nitrogen oxides NOX          were calibrated using the same reference tanks according          to the manufacturers instructions The oxygen analyser          of the NOX  was used for continuous monitoring of          oxygen concentration in order to ensure that a constant          FiO            was maintained during NO inhalation          whatever the concentration administered                          Protocol

both groups of patients the existence of a          doserelated effect was investigated using a oneway          analysis of variance for repeated measures including only          the different

PaO                     FiO            was significantly increased by the          presence of septic shock In patients with septic shock          inhaled NO increased PaO            FiO            by

In          patients without septic shock the decrease in MPAP          varied from  to  whereas the increase in PaO            FiO            varied from  to  Fig  In          five patients a clear plateau could be identified for the          decrease in MPAP Fig c whereas MPAP continued to          decrease with higher NO concentrations in three Fig a          Different patterns were observed for PaO            FiO             in four patients the PaO            FiO            ratio deteriorated at the highest          inspiratory NO concentrations Fig d whereas in the          other four PaO            FiO            continued to increase Fig b The          patients whose PaO            FiO            ratio continued to increase with the          highest NO concentrations demonstrated a clear plateau          effect in MPAP at NO concentrations of  ppm suggesting          that the effects of NO on gas exchange and pulmonary          circulation can be dissociated In patients with septic          shock Fig  the decrease in MPAP varied from  to           whereas the increase in PaO            varied from  to  In five          patients a clear plateau could be identified on the          doseresponse curve of MPAP Fig cc whereas it continued          to decrease with higher NO concentrations in three Fig          a In two patients PaO            FiO            deteriorated at

shock the effects of          NO on arterial oxygenation and pulmonary artery pressure          were dissociated In two patients only patients  and           doseresponse curves were characterized by a          concurrent dosedependent decrease in MPAP and an          increase in PaO            FiO            in the range of  to  ppm          inhaled NO                          Toxic effects of increasing concentrations of          inhaled NO          As shown in Table  methemoglobin and NO            significantly increased at          inspiratory NO concentrations of  ppm A mean          intratracheal NO            concentration of    ppm and a          mean methemoglobin concentration of    were          observed at an inspiratory NO concentration of           ppm                            Discussion                  Factors influencing individual doseresponse          curves          During mechanical ventilation intratracheal NO          concentrations fluctuate according to the phase of          respiration   the inspiratory concentration being          greater than the expiratory concentration because NO is          absorbed at the alveolar level In the present study NO          concentrations delivered to the patient were determined          by sampling the endotracheal gas using a fast response          chemiluminescence apparatus in order to accurately          measure inspiratory NO concentration   If used slow          response chemiluminescence would have underestimated the          true inspiratory NO concentration by averaging it          together with the expiratory level as probably occurred          in two of our previous studies    Another reason          for determining the inspiratory NO concentration in this          way was the method of NO administration used Continuous          administration of NO through the initial part of the          inspiratory limb during volume controlled ventilation          invariably results in fluctuation of the NO concentration          within the inspiratory limb due to a bolus effect             Although mixing of NO increases with distance from          the site of administration   a fast response          analyser is required to accurately measure the peak NO          concentration during the inspiratory phase We previously          demonstrated in an in vitro experiment that the NOX           was able to measure rapid fluctuations of NO          concentrations with a precision              In the present study two different patterns of          doseresponse curves were observed In  patients five          in each group a plateau effect for MPAP could be          identified at NO concentrations ranging between  and           ppm In six patients three in each group MPAP          continued to decrease with the highest NO concentrations          Figs and  These different variation profiles did not          appear to be related to the presence of septic shock          Although the mean pulmonary vascular effect of inhaled          NO was not affected by the presence of septic shock the          resulting improvement in arterial oxygenation was of a          greater magnitude in patients with septic shock Fig           The reasons for this difference are not clear It can be          hypothesized that the same degree of inhaled NOinduced          vasodilation of the pulmonary vessels perfusing          ventilated lung areas resulted in a greater          redistribution of pulmonary blood flow in patients with          septic shock This implies that for the same extent of          lung consolidation basal pulmonary blood flow perfusing          nonventilated lung areas was greater in patients with          septic shock As a matter of fact although the          percentage of lung consolidation tended to be greater in          patients without septic shock            vs  their mean PaO            tended to be higher              vs    mmHg suggesting some          degree of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction impairment          in the nonventilated lung areas of patients with septic          shock It is well known that acute lung infection and          septic shock may impair hypoxic pulmonary          vasoconstriction through the massive release from          activated endothelium of vasodilating mediators such as          prostaglandins and endogenous NO and hence result in          disproportionately high shunting and hypoxemia                  In addition exogenous          catecholamines used to maintain arterial pressure during          septic shock interfere with hypoxic pulmonary          vasoconstriction vasodilators like isoproterenol or          dobutamine tend to inhibit hypoxic pulmonary          vasoconstriction whereas vasoconstrictors like dopamine          epinephrine or norepinephrine tend to reinforce hypoxic          pulmonary vasoconstriction In the present study          patients with circulatory shock receiving vasodilating          inotrops were excluded in order to eliminate the          interferences between these agents inhaled NO and          hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction          Confirming a previous study   an important          interpatient variability was found in both groups of          patients Figs and  Several factors may account for          this variability at the time of investigation          endogenous vasoconstricting mediators involved in          pulmonary artery hypertension were probably different          between patients In animal studies NO doseresponse          curves depend on the model of acute lung injury and on          the pathophysiology of pulmonary artery hypertension              In patients treated with extracorporeal          membrane oxygenation doseresponse curves of inhaled NO          on MPAP have been found to be in the range of  ppm            It has been suggested that pulmonary vasoconstrictors          are continuously activated by the extracorporeal circuit          and released into the circulation thus contributing to          pulmonary hypertension      Therefore it          is conceivable that higher concentrations of NO are          necessary to obtain the maximum effect of NO on pulmonary          artery pressure In the present study doseresponse          curves in the range of  to  ppm were observed in          three patients without septic shock and in three patients          with septic shock By analogy with the doseresponse          curves obtained in patients on extracorporeal membrane          oxygenation it can be hypothesized that the presence of          large amounts of circulating pulmonary vasoconstrictors          in these patients led to the need for greater NO          concentrations The variability of circulating vasoactive          mediators from one day to another has been recently          advocated to explain the variability of the doseresponse          to NO on different days in the same patient            There are three factors that could have a potential          influence on the responsiveness of patients with ARDS to          inhaled NO  the anatomical remodeling of the          pulmonary circulation  the reduction of the lung          volume accessible to gas and  the presence of septic          shock          External compression of the pulmonary vessels by PEEP          thickening of pulmonary arterial walls observed in the          late stage of ARDS and thrombosis   contribute to          further increase pulmonary artery pressure which becomes          less and less sensitive to inhaled NO If the alveolar          space available for distribution of NO is reduced only a          small number of pulmonary vessels can be reached thus          limiting the efficiency of NO Because all patients were          enrolled in the study during the first  days of acute          respiratory failure it is unlikely that wall thickening          was an important limiting factor of NO efficiency          However a major reduction in lung volume was likely to          account for the limited effect of NO observed in some          patients with lung consolidation   patients            and  in Figs and  Recently it has been suggested          that the presence of septic shock may impair          responsiveness to inhaled NO   However due to the          small number of patients included in this study and the          absence of a control group further studies are required          to confirm this interesting hypothesis          Finally the maximum pulmonary vascular effect and the          doseresponse of inhaled NO on pulmonary artery pressure          depends on many diverse factors that may be associated in          a given patient type and concentration of circulating          pulmonary vasoconstrictors and vasodilators endogenous          and exogenous relative importance of fixed and          nonfixed components of pulmonary artery hypertension          and loss of lung volume The results of the present study          show that during the early stage of ARDS inspiratory NO          concentrations around  ppm provide the maximum decrease          in pulmonary artery pressure in the majority of patients          whereas higher concentrations are necessary in a minority          of patients                          Dissociation between pulmonary vascular effects and          effects on gas exchange          Quantitatively the effects of NO on pulmonary artery          pressure and arterial oxygenation were well correlated in           of patients In  subjects patients  to  and           to  quantitative variations in PaO            and pulmonary artery pressure were          in agreement a decrease in MPAP   of the control          value was associated with an increase in PaO            FiO              of the control value and          vice versa In five subjects patients  to  and patient           inhaled NOinduced changes in MPAP and PaO            FiO            were quantitatively dissociated          Patient  illustrates this Fig   although among          patients with septic shock he had the greatest NOinduced          decrease in MPAP his PaO            FiO            ratio only increased by  These          results clearly suggest that although linked NOinduced          pulmonary vascular effects and effects on arterial          oxygenation can be dissociated in patients with ARDS In          patients with septic shock pulmonary arterial pressure          plateaued at  ppm whereas PaO            FiO            continued to increase at higher NO          concentrations This is in apparent contrast with two          previous doseresponse studies showing that the increase          in PaO            in patients with ARDS generally          occurs at an inspiratory NO concentration range lower          than the one necessary to decrease pulmonary artery          pressure    Further undetectable changes in          pulmonary artery pressure may induce pulmonary blood flow          redistribution and changes in arterial oxygenation              Recently however Lowson           et al   found as did this          study that PaO            continued to increase whereas          pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular          resistance plateaued at NO concentrations   ppm          In fact among six doseresponse studies already          published        only two    have          suggested that NO concentrations required to improve PaO            are less than those required to          decrease pulmonary artery pressure At high          concentrations it may be that NO reaches pulmonary          vessels perfusing nonventilated lung areas and worsens          arterial oxygenation by inhibiting hypoxic pulmonary          vasoconstriction as observed in patients     and           This spillover of NO into the pulmonary circulation          could occur either by diffusion through the lung          structures or directly by transportation in the blood          stream            In conclusion in patients with ARDS the presence of          septic shock treated by norepinephrine administration          does not modify the inhaled NOinduced pulmonary artery          vascular effect but amplifies the resulting improvement          in arterial oxygenation Although doseresponse curves          are characterized by a wide interpatient variability           of the pulmonary vascular effect is obtained for NO          concentrations   ppm in patients with or without          septic shock The use of such low concentrations          precludes any potential toxicity due to the generation of          high concentrations of NO            and methemoglobin In many patients          the pulmonary vascular effect and effect on gas exchange          although linked are dissociated suggesting that          redistribution of pulmonary blood flow does not          exclusively depend on the intensity of the pulmonary          vasodilating effect In a minority of patients          inspiratory NO concentrations   ppm may be necessary          to obtain the maximum improvement in arterial          oxygenation
