                    Background        Mitochondria participate in numerous functions in the        cell In addition to producing energy mitochondria are        involved in intermediary metabolism ion homeostasis        synthesis of lipids amino acids and nucleotides active        transport processes cell motility and cell proliferation               Recent developments also demonstrate that        mitochondria are key regulators of programmed cell death            Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most profound        features of cancer cells Several distinct differences        between the mitochondria of normal cells and cancer cells        have been observed at the microscopic molecular        biochemical metabolic and genetic levels            Microscopic study of oncocytic tumors revealed        mitochondrial hyperplasia     and differential        expression of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II in benign        and malignant breast tissues has also been reported            Furthermore mutations in mitochondrial DNA mtDNA are        commonly found in a variety of cancers including the        ovarian thyroid salivary kidney liver lung colon        gastric brain bladder head and neck leukemia and breast        cancers            Mitochondrial DNA encodes two rRNA  tRNA and         proteins     Each of the polypeptides form subunits of        four respiratory enzyme complexes localized to the inner        mitochondrial membrane     These subunits include seven        subunits of respiratory enzyme complex I one subunit of        complex III three subunits of complex IV and two subunits        of complex V     All other mitochondrial proteins        including those involved in the replication transcription        and translation of mtDNA are encoded by nuclear genes and        are targeted to the mitochondrion by a specific transport        system     Although the mitochondrial and nuclear        genomes are physically distinct there is constant        communication between the two genomes to carry out many of        the mitochondrial functions For example in the yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae RTGproteins        monitor the functional state of mitochondria and mediate        the intergenomic communication between the mitochondria and        the nucleus In this organism RTG regulates transcription        of numerous genes involved in several pathways that help        cells adapt to mitochondrial dysfunction     In        addition yeast cells shift their metabolic profile by        altering expression of a number of genes that respond to        depletion of the mitochondrial genome     As in the        case of yeast the depletion of mitochondrial DNA from        human cell lines leading to the generation of cell lines        devoid of mtDNA denoted Rho  provides an opportunity to        study nuclear responses to impairment of mitochondrial        function In the present study we isolated a Rho        derivative of a breast cancer cell line Our results        demonstrate that Rho derivative experience increased        oxidative stress and has impaired mitochondrial function        Using cDNA microarray we compared differences in the        nuclear gene expression profile between parental Rho        breast cancer cell line and its Rho derivative Our study        suggests a variety of structural genes as well as genes        involved in cellular signaling and transcriptional        regulation are differentially regulated in Rho breast        cancer cells                    Methods                  Reagents

Generation of Rho breast cancer cell line          The rarity of recombination in the replication of          mtDNA is prohibitive to the possibility of selectively          inactivating mtDNA encoded genes by homologous          recombination     However by culturing cells in the          presence of low concentrations of ethidium bromide it is          possible to preferentially inhibit the replication of          mtDNA generating a cell line that are devoid of the          mitochondrial genome     These cells denoted Rho           have altered metabolic requirements due to the loss of          components of the electron transport chain and require          both uridine and pyruvate for growth     Cells with          this engineered mitochondrial dysfunction require          exogenous uridine because a functional electron transport          chain is needed for pyrimidine biosynthesis     We          generated a mtDNAdepleted variant of the breast cancer          cell line MDAMB by culturing cells with EtBr           ngml for approximately  cell generations then          isolating clones by limiting dilution Total DNA from          this Rho clone clone  was digested with PvuII which          cuts at a single site in mtDNA Southern blotting and          hybridization with a mtDNAspecific probe showed the          presence of a  kb band in the MDAMB Rho cell          line The  kb fragment was absent in the Rho cell          line Figure AB To further verify loss of mtDNA          encoded protein the expression of mtDNAencoded          cytochrome oxidase II COX II was assessed by western          blotting Expression is not observed in Rho cell lysates          as compared to the parental cells Figure Aand B To          assess the growth characteristics of the Rho clone cell          growth was measured in glucose and galactose media Cells          with dysfunctional mitochondria are unable to efficiently          utilize galactose as a primary carbon source for energy          production  Following an initial growth lag          parental MDAMB cells grown in galactose medium          proliferated at a rate comparable to the rate observed in          glucose Figure A However Rho cells were unable to          grow in galactose media indicating an impairment of          mitochondrial function Figure B These results          demonstrated that we had isolated Rho breast cells that          do not express protein encoded by mtDNA and which lack          proper mitochondrial function                          Increased lipid peroxidation in Rho cells          Mitochondria are the major site of reactive oxygen          ROS production     OS cause oxidative damage It is          conceivable that altered mitochondrial function in Rho          leads to increased oxidative stress We therefore          measured lipid peroxidation in parental and Rho breast          cancer cells Malondialdehyde a product of the          catabolism of peroxidized lipids forms a pigmented          reaction product with thiobarbituric acid that can be          measured spectrophotometrically      Levels of          thiobarbituric acidreactive species were measured in          extracts of parental Rho and Rho cells to determine if          altered mitochondrial function results in lipid          peroxidation Figure shows that thiobarbituric          acidreactive species were increased in Rho cells solid          bar compared to the Rho parental cells open bar We          conclude that an increase in lipid peroxidation is          associated with the impairment of mitochondrial          function                          Microarray analysis          Nuclear and mitochondrial genomes interact at least in          two possible ways First they contribute essential          protein subunits to important mitochondrial function          second they collaborate in the synthesis of and assembly          of mitochondrial proteins     To identify genes that          respond to lack of mtDNA encoded genes we compared the          mRNA level between the Rho cell line and parental Rho          cell line by cDNA microarray analysis We analyzed           genes present in the array The microarray analysis          revealed that  genes were significantly up regulated          and  genes were down regulated in Rho cells Table          and  The differentially expressed genes were          classified into various classes including transcription          factors and architectural proteins Table and  Eight          genes were selected randomly to confirm the microarray          results by RTPCR The messages for each particular gene          needed different cycle numbers to assess the exponential          amplification accurately indicating the relative          abundance of the individual messages The RTPCR results          confirmed differential expression of the genes indicated          by the microarray results Figure  Tables and           RTPCR results show Figure  that p cyclin dependent          kinase inhibitor and vmaf were maximally up regulated          followed by phospholipase C epsilon a gene involved in          signalling by increasing the intracellular levels of          calcium ions Among the down regulated genes          phospholipase A was maximally down regulated followed          by progesteroneinduced blocking factor  PIBF a          protein that acts on the phospholipase A enzyme and          interferes with arachidonic acid metabolism These          results suggest that impairment of mitochondrial function          leads to altered expression of nuclear genes involved in          communication between mitochondria and nucleus                            Discussion        This paper reports on a comprehensive analysis of the        nuclear gene expression in response to the absence of mtDNA        in breast cancer cells We demonstrate that expression of a        number of nuclear genes is altered in response to the        absence of mtDNA in breast cancer cells These genes ranged        from transcription factors to genes that are involved in        metabolism cell architecture and signaling Our results        are consistent with previous studies in yeast and mammalian        cells that reported altered pattern of nuclear gene        expression due to elimination of mtDNA              We conducted comparative microarray analysis on Rho        MDA cell line and its Rho derivative Rho cells have        been used extensively to study the role of mitochondria in        a variety of cellular processes that are affected by        mitochondrial dysfunction    Our results showed        that  genes are up regulated   fold and  are        down regulated  fold in Rho breast cancer cells We        chose  genes randomly to confirm the results of        microarray analysis with RTPCR Figure  Among genes        that are up regulated in Rho cells p INKd a cyclin        dependent kinase inhibitor is focally expressed during        fetal development and plays a role in terminal        differentiation     Members of the group of INK        proteins are involved in arresting cells in G phase of the        cell cycle Conceivably p may be involved in the        observed slow growth rate of the Rho  A number of genes        that influence gene transcription are differentially        expressed after mitochondrial impairment The Maf        oncoprotein a basic leucine zipperbearing transcriptional        activator that recognizes the Maf recognition element        MARE DNA sequence  is noticeably up regulated in the        Rho cell line cMAF is highly expressed in developing        skeletal tissues cells where mitochondria play a central        role in their functioning      The transcription        factors TFIIH and AML were also up regulated in the Rho        cell lines TFIIH is associated with the RNA polymerase II        transcription complex which is involved in transcription        and transcriptionmediated DNA repair     The        transcription factor AML is frequently found translocated        in leukemic cells     Conceivably altered expression        of these transcriptional regulators in response to        mitochondrial impairment could directly or indirectly lead        to the changes in expression of other genes seen in Rho        cells        Phosphoinositidespecific phospholipase C PLC  was        among the signaling molecules that were up regulated in the        Rho cell line PLC is a critical signaling enzyme that        hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids to generate inositol        trisphosphate IP           which binds to IP          receptors and increases intracellular        Ca      The  isoform of PLC is a novel effector of         ras      Another signaling        molecule of significance that is up regulated in the Rho        cells is the Slit Drosophila homolog  Three vertebrate        orthologs of the fly slit gene Slit  and  have been        isolated Each displays overlapping but distinct patterns        of expression in the developing vertebrate central nervous        system implying conservation of function     Slit        gene product is the least evolutionarily conserved of the        vertebrate Slit genes The fact that Slit but not Slit        is predominantly localized within the mitochondria makes        its up regulation in the Rho cells an intriguing        phenomenon            One feature of the Rho cell line is the differential        expression of certain genes that are involved directly or        indirectly in metabolism of fatty acids or signaling        Figure and Table and  Among those that are up        regulated are apolipoprotein D ApoD and arylacetamide        deacetylase While ApoD may have a similar function as the        other apoproteins it does not share a similar protein        structure to the other family members and does not bind        cholesterol with high affinity     Hence it may have        a unique effect via binding of different ligands ApoD may        be involved in the binding of steroids or fatty acids Apo        D interacts with ObRb but not ObRa in hypothalamic        neurons         in vivo     In the central        nervous system it was found that Apo D may be activated        through its interaction with a leptinstimulated ObRb and        may bind a specific ligand in hypothalamic neurons where        it exerts signaling functions     Arylacetamide        deacetylase may also function as a lipase during the        process of lipoprotein secretion      Other genes        involved in fatty acid signaling were down regulated in Rho        cells These include phospholipase A a protein closely        involved with arachidonic acid metabolism and also involved        with cell signaling       that was found to be        maximally down regulated in Rho cells Phospholipase A        also plays a role in the translocation of PKCmediated by        fatty acids Another gene with functions closely related to        the arachidonic acid metabolism that is down regulated in        the Rho cells is the progesteroneinduced blocking factor         PIBF PIBF is known to act on the phospholipase A        enzyme and so interferes with arachidonic acid metabolism        inducing a Th biased immune response     PIBF exerts        an antiabortive effect by controlling NK activity            A gene related to lipid signaling that encodes        agoutirelated protein was also down regulated in the Rho        cells Agouti is a paracrinesignaling factor that acts to        block melanocortin action      Disruption of        melanocortin signaling with antagonist administration leads        to an increase in feeding and eventually to obesity Such        blockage has been observed in both        lipopolysaccharideinduced animals and also during illness            The data exhibiting down regulation of the agouti        gene is further strengthened by the down regulation of the        LPS reponse protein in the Rho cells        The ATP synthase A subunit gene that is directly        involved in mitochondrial function was up regulated in the        Rho cell lines ATP synthase is a multimeric complex        composed of at least  different polypeptides two of        which are mitochondrially encoded and the remainder        encoded by nuclear genes     Certain leukemic cells        show an increased production of the ATPA subunit            Interestingly a down regulated gene CYPB encoding an        oxysterol  alphahydroxylase Cytochrome P subfamily        VII BI is involved in many metabolic processes including        bile acid synthesis and neurosteroid metabolism                   Mitochondria control Ca homeostasis     Protein        kinase C  neurotensin receptor and neuromodulin GAP        are among the genes that are involved in calmodulin        regulation or related to calmodulin function             which are down regulated in Rho cells Neuromodulin is        also a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase C           which may reflect an influence of mitochondrial        function on multiple members of a signal transduction        pathway Another interesting feature in the expression        profile of cells lacking mtDNA is the low expression of        many genes that play a role in the development and        maintenance of the nervous system      Of particular        interest is the gene that encodes neurotensin receptor I a        short peptide receptor for neurotensin that exerts        neuromodulatory functions in the central nervous system and        endocrineparacrine actions in the periphery            Neuromodulin is also involved in the growth and        regeneration of axons and in the elongation of axons as an        axonal transport membrane protein     Synuclein is        expressed in the nervous tissues and mutations in this gene        are associated with rare familial cases of earlyonset        Parkinsons disease     Gamma synuclein is also        involved in tumorigenesis     PKCg mutation has been        shown to lead to neurodegeneration     Dachshund a        putative transcription factor plays a role in retinal        development     Huntingtininteracting protein is        involved in the neurodegenerative Huntington disease                   In summary our data provides an overview of the genes        that are involved in the nuclear and mitochondrial cross        talk and respond to oxidative stress manifested due to        impaired mitochondrial function The identification of a        large number of genes whose expression is influenced by        mitochondrial function provides a foundation for future        investigation of the pathways affected by the impairment of        mitochondria in pathological conditions An understanding        about the role of the proteins in the maintenance of proper        mitochondrial function and in oxidative stress response is        critical for understanding the role of mitochondria in        carcinogenesis                    Authors contributions        RD isolated and analyzed the Rho derivative of breast        cancer cell line RD SK and AR performed
