                                 Unplug the DOE            George Washington had onlyfour Cabinet departments Since his time  new departments have been createdand only two eliminated the Navy Department was absorbed into the Departmentof Defense in  and the Post Office was spun off as a federal corporationin  Ronald Reagan promised to close down two Energy and EducationInstead he added one Veterans Affairs George Bush proposed adding anotherEnvironment but didnt get to do so The Republican revolutionaries whotook over Congress in  pledged to abolish three departments EnergyEducation Commerce but quickly retreated            IfPresident Clinton is looking for an easy symbolic way to cement his reputationas a small government Democratand if we know Clinton he surely istheanswer is clear Be oneup on the Republicans and actually abolish a Cabinetdepartment            But which one The corporatewelfaredispensing Departmentof Commerce is an obvious candidate since it mostly serves a bigbusinessconstituency with an array of subsidies and favors By punting CommerceClinton could portray himself as a more principled defender of the free marketthan Republicans who tolerate the corporations that are chronically dependenton the federal government            Whats thedownside Taking on corporate welfare might backfire casting Clinton in thediscredited role of Democratic scourge of business Also using Commerce topromote US business abroad has shielded Clinton against critics on the leftwho say hes helplessly infatuated with free trade            Another option is Education created by JimmyCartermostly as a favor to the National Education Association which gave himits first presidential endorsement Federal spending on elementary andsecondary education remains small in aggregate amounting to just  percent oftotal public spending on schools Most of the departments popular programslike college student aid and Title I which provides money for educating poorchildren existed before the department was born Another sacrosanct federaleducation effort Head Start is not even under the Ed Departmentsjurisdiction Education does finance science and math instruction but so doother agencies            JunkingEducation probably isnt politically feasible though For one thing it wouldanger the teachers unions a powerful constituency in the Democratic Party Afull  of the  delegates at the partys Chicago convention belonged toeither the NEA or the American Federation of Teachers And having alreadyvilified the Republicans as enemies of learning for their proposed cuts infederal education outlays Clinton and the Democrats would appear hypocriticalif they abolished the Department of Education Cant have that            That leaves Energy which is perfectly suited to abolitionon practical as well as political grounds Aside from the environmentalistswho are fixated on renewable fuels few Democrats care much about theDepartment of Energy anymore The chief motive for creating the department in was to regulate oil prices which only exacerbated the energy crisisReagans decontrol of energy has resulted in the steady decline of gasolineprices in absolute terms and has removed the issue from the table Evenduring last springs spike in prices no Democrat advocated price controls orpunitive taxes on Big Oil            For themost part the DOE is an anachronism whose main function under Clinton has beento generate embarrassing news stories about Secretary Hazel OLearys expensiveglobetrotting Twothirds of the DOEs budget pays for programs unrelated toenergy nuclearweapons production maintenance and cleanup Those tasks cantbe eliminated but they can logically be transferred to the Pentagon Many ofthe DOEs functions like owning oil the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and oilfields the Naval Petroleum Reserve can be privatized Clinton has alreadyproposed selling off the petroleum reserve Subsidies for solar power andenergy conservation likewise deserve the ax energy taxes would do the job farmore efficiently if the job needs doing or they could migrate to InteriorFunding for science research at  national laboratories may be moredefensible but even a DOE task force recommended an end to governmentownership of the labs Much of their research is in commercial applicationswhich belongs in the private sector            Skeptics will carp that it is not criticalwhether the department survives but whether its programs do Its true that ifthe programs arent winnowed down not much changes apart from the stationeryBut even if Clinton were to parcel the existing programs out to otherdepartments without appreciably reducing their cost it would still makepolitical sense to dump DOE Nobody will bother to compare the beforeandafterbudgetary authority but few will fail to notice that a department hasvanished            After shuttering the DOEClinton could depict himself as a crusader against waste and bureaucracy whosucceeded where even Reagan failed Like his agreement last year to asevenyear plan to balance the budget this step would change the terms of thedebate with Republicans Before the balancedbudget accord the GOP framed allopposition to its budget cuts as fiscally irresponsible conduct by peoplecommitted to everlasting deficits Afterward the Republicans were obliged todefend the proposed cuts on their individual merits an argument which theDemocrats generally carried            Democrats have donethemselves a lot of harm by refusing to discriminate between those programsthat are vital and those that are not For Clinton to abolish the DOE would bea bracing lesson in how to do just that The question is whether Clinton hasthe nerve Republicans have long demanded smaller government They should prayClinton doesnt give it to them
