                and what movies have you seen recently   well  we arent just real big go to the you know first time it comes out kind of thing we neither one like to stand in line so we uh a lot of times will just kind of hold on until it comes to a dollar theater or   i dont blame you were the same   something or maybe rent the video although i prefer the dollar theater because it is kind of fun and i say dollar theater i think theyre actually two dollars these days   right  theres been inflation all the way along   its like saying go to the five and dime you know its not five and dime anymore but the   umhum   a analogy is there   right   but um uh we have teenagers and we have we have a guideline i shant say rule  that uh you know we like to see the movies that they want to see first   umhum   um   so that we can kind of talk about it and decide whether its really appropriate or you know or not and uh  were probably stricter than most parents i know we are because i know that my childrens friends even the youngest ones routinely see things that   well i know that my kids have gone to things that i would never set foot in but they havent gone with me and i havent paid the bill   umhum   so theres are there are an awful lot of movies that i just think are uh unconscionable to be shown on especially to kids and i have had to hope that they would enforce the R ratings and not let kids under eighteen in   umhum umhum and i dont really think they do i mean uh   excuse me   were having an pollen attack here and im having hay fever excuse me   oh bless your heart ive ive have a throat that is so sore i know exactly what you mean just from that   oh but anyway anyway um my kids are now twenty one and twenty four so i dont have to   with absolutely no you know   do anything now   yeah yeah   but once in a while what i try to do is try to entice them into something that i think is going to be useful or educational or something so the two   yeah yeah   recent recent films that we have seen where ive been able to drag them along um are the uh Henry the Fifth the Kenneth Bronoff   uhhuh   version and Rosencranz and Gilgenstern are Dead   oh   which were wonderful   really   both of them were just outstandingly good   well   excellent acting wonderful sets costumes and really worthwhile   umhum umhum we uh i guess probably the last one that we really paid full price for was um oh the Russian one that they made the book   hum im a bad one to ask because i dont   i think the submarine the uh with Sean Connery there we go   oh yes yes i know the one youre talking about Hunt for Red October yes   there we go which i was so glad that uh my husband had read the book before we went because otherwise he you know he had to kind of sit and explain it along the way to me that uh you know that uh i thought it was very well done though uhhuh   uh oh yes well uh my husband went and took his son and he enjoyed it a lot but ive never cared much for war and spy movies so they let me stay home and work in the garden   umhum yeah yeah that was  a a nice trade     but they thought it was a good movie and uh i like Sean Connery so i said if it comes out on video ill be willing to pay the two dollars to rent it and then if im bored i dont feel like ive lost a lot and i can turn it off   umhum umhum thats right thats right we uh have have have thoroughly enjoyed the uh Dancing with Wolves   umhum   that was uh i guess we paid full price for that one too   well i   that one was very unnerving for me i uh i have an American uh native American heritage and   um   i knew going into it that it was probably affect me deeply   umhum um   and i was right  it definitely did definitely did it definitely did   well uh i have to tell you a comment that the man whose office is next door to mine goes to a lot of movies and uh he will come back with his capsule review and he said   umhum   well it has absolutely beautiful scenery but you wouldnt like it because of the cruelty to animals and any movie i have to say i where i notice the scenery means i didnt like the plot so   well i have to agree with you it that that part of it was somewhat unnerving although it was cruelty to animals yes but not kinds of things   um   you know it was very much in the natural you know the way it really probably was not some sadistic crazed person you know whos going around pulling the wings off flies and birds  you know swinging cats by their tail not not that kind of   yeah   uh torturistic type thing you know it was   uhhuh   but it it was awfully graphic that way but   well i keep telling people that i dont go to movies where theres lots of blood and uh shootings and i certainly dont go to horror films   oh yes i agree   oh i if they are are trying on purpose to scare me then i dont want to go   im certainly not going to give them money to do it   absolutely not oh ill tell you one though that i heard such good things about um oh lets see what was it um its a David Lynch movie and its about Sailor and Lula theyre the two characters main characters i cant remember the name of the film now   well ill   but anyway got lots of just wonderful reviews and i had heard that it had violence in it but i thought well ill go give it a try and the first five minutes of that movie were so disgusting that i went and got my money back   said im leaving   i did i told my husband ive got a book in the car give me the car keys you can stay and watch this if you want to but i dont need this   yeah   and i just got up and left and in about two more minutes he joined me and we asked for ou r money back i said you know i i realize that this is advertised as an R movie        and i had heard that it contained violence but i had no idea   that this was what i was getting myself into   how disgusting this was going to be and in the five minutes i watched there was no let up it was it was just filthy   umhum yeah and theres   and now i dont mind uh nudity and i dont mind suggestiveness if its appropriate to the story im not a prude and im not a prig but i do not see any reason why you should have one string of filthy language with no intermission in it and uh graphic violence and blood and uh it total disregard for human beings   umhum umhum one of the i read something here just a while back about it was a newspaper thing just about the movie moguls and the television writers and what not that basically they individually personally are not even close to living the lives that the normal American person does that   oh yeah   we uh excuse me   and i think thats got to be true if you look at what they produce  that they think is the ideal normal person   so how could they possibly you know so when they do find something that relates to some of us you know its just kind on the seedy   um   side of our lives you know its not the uplifting   yeah and most of us arent that seedy   yeah exactly  were a lot more mundane and humdrum and     at least the ones with the money to go to the movie right   you know we uh we saw that little Home Alone with our children at Christmas   uh   you know thoroughly enjoyed that but it was uh you know   i heard that was real cute   totally different you know kind of thing and even in that there were a few things that had i been making it i wouldnt have put in you know so  but uh   umhum   but you know we uh we try to you know catch things when they come back on the television and theyre redone   yeah   you know so that the bad language is out and the heavier scenes are   umhum   removed for the kids we rent a lot of the old musicals and Broadway type things you know for the kids to watch here at home and try to   theres a theater here in town that has uh been renovated by a foundation to its heyday of the twenties and it has the big old organ and everything and the big screen and they show only movies made before nineteen fifty   umhum oh how fun oh how fun   and it is just great we go to that probably once a month or more uh at the very beginning when they were having film festivals like a Katherine Hepburn festival and a Fred Astaire festival and so on we were going a couple of nights a week and its great for one thing its not   i wish theyd do something like that in Dallas   well its not full of rowdy teenagers who are uh spilling their Cokes and throwing their popcorn and talking all the time mostly middle age folks who are pretty decorous and sit still and listen to the film   thats true but   thats cute   and they get these absolutely terrific prints that are from the uh film archives in Los Angeles that have just been specially restored and sometimes they are made from the original negatives so theyre really crisp and good so theyre really crisp and good like they were when they first came out   umhum oh thats neat though thats you know thats good i wish more teenagers would take up some of those that they realize that they can be entertained and and enjoy a   and you can go to a movie like that and you know that its going to be entertaining and its going to have some wit in the dialogue   evenings activity
