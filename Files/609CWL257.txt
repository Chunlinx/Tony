              January       Dear Friend      For  years I have had the tremendous opportunity to be an actor at      the Indiana Repertory Theatre One of the joys of being an actor is      having an opportunity to talk with members of the audience following a      performance      One such event occurred last season      Following a show a young couple came up to the stage to say hello      They said they both felt they knew me like an old friend because theyd      been coming to see IRT shows since their high school days In fact even      though they had gone to separate schools each ones first experience      with live theatre was an IRT production      I was delighted at their vivid recollections of some of my favorite      shows at the IRT Midsummer Nights Dream and You Cant Take It With You      They said that because of those high school trips to the IRT they have      made professional theatre an integral part of their cultural lives      So many people have told me that seeing a play as a student literally      opened their eves and minds to a whole new world a world of imagination      more powerful than any futuristic movie or television sitcom As adults      they crave that potent mix of actor playwright and audience which is      the magic of live theatre      Its that magic I am asking you to keep alive and well for all      children in the state of Indiana      Fully professional fully produced theatre has made a difference to      children like Becky Stephanie Marcus Emily and their classmates from      across the state of Indiana Ive enclosed letters they and some of      their teachers have written us Please read them They touched my heart      and I know theyll touch yours      The one thing I am most proud of is that the IRT is a leader across      the country in providing theatre experiences for students The work the      IRT does with teachers and students has a profound impact on their lives      Most important is the fact that attending a performance at the IRT is not      just a field trip The IRT has staff educators artists and a statewide      StudentTeacher Advisory Committee that carefully plan all the education      programs The plays which are performed are selected because they have a      specific link to what is being studied in the classroom Whether its a      literature topic a humanities issue or an important person in history       every play has a direct tiein to classroom curriculum      The education programs at the IRT are more comprehensive than any      other performing arts organization in the state of Indiana and possibly      the nation      A full array of educational services are incorporated to enhance the      learning experience for the students including      Printed study guides and detailed audiovisual materials      Docent or artist preperformance classroom visits      Behindthescenes tours of the theatres workshops and rehearsal      areas      An extensive slide show library on a variety of theatre topics      Preperformance teacher workshops and      Direct contact with artists and actors through postperformance      question and answer sessions      I am writing to ask for your direct assistance in educating a child      With a donation of    or whatever you can give to the IRT      you can play a role in the development of a young person through the      educational outreach programs at the Indiana Repertory Theatre Each      year between  and  students from over  schools in       Indiana counties culminate their lessons on a variety of topics by coming      to the IRT to see a play      Because were committed to provide these education services donations      must be sought to offset ticket discounts we give to students Ticket      income doesnt begin to cover the cost of these programs We need your      assistance as your generosity allows us to keep these programs      affordable to schools and students You can help directly      A gift of  allows  students to receive discounted tickets to an      IRT performance      A gift of  provides an entire classroom with study guides and      other curriculum materials      Take a moment right now to consider a gift of    or      whatever you can give to the IRT It means everything to me to ask for      your support It means everything to Becky Stephanie Marcus and Emily      and students like them You can make the difference TODAY      I look forward to hearing from you      Best Wishes      Priscilla Lindsay Actor and Educator Indiana Repertory Theatre      P S From the bottom of my heart thank you You can make the      difference today with your check Theatre allows students to experience      worlds outside their own and to see their classroom studies come to life      To continue to impact the lives of Indianas students with first class      theatre productions that support and enhance their academic and personal      growth your support is needed TODAY
