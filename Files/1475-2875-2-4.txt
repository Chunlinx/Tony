                    Background        Mefloquine Lariam is a prophylactic antimalarial that        is also used for malaria chemotherapy Adverse central        nervous system CNS events have been associated with its        use Severe CNS events requiring hospitalization occur in         and  patients taking mefloquine for        chemoprophylaxis and treatment respectively     Milder        CNS events eg dizziness headache and insomnia are a        more frequent occurrence occurring in up to  of those        receiving chemoprophylactic doses and  of patients        receiving therapeutic doses     Higher blood levels of        mefloquine are reached under prophylactic as compared to        therapeutic regimens      The relative incidence of        adverse effects is therefore probably doserelated        although the concomitant effect of malaria during treatment        cannot be dismissed It is likely then that the        neurological events associated with mefloquine have a        biochemical basis In this study an attempt was made to        deduce a possible mechanism of action for mefloquine in rat        neuronal cells using Affymetrix rat toxicology arrays        Microarray analysis offers the unique potential to        identify unknown targets of toxic agents as        transcriptional responses of the entire genome can be        measured in parallel     Ideally one should be able to        identify new targets quickly confidently and without        recourse to alternative methods Appropriate selection of a        method for filtering gene expression data is therefore        critical to this process One of the first definitions to        emerge was the arbitrary designation of a particular level        of  usually twofold up or down regulation  gene        expression as representing significance      Such        arbitrary definitions emerged from the observation that        foldregulation of genes between control cultures with        identical cell populations seldom varies by more than this        level discussed by Ideker et al            However arbitrary designations cannot be considered        significant in the traditional statistical sense unless        experimental variance is taken into consideration An        evolving method of analysis is to define significant        changes in gene expression in terms of a particular         P value after performing appropriate        statistical tests that take into account the variability of        gene expression data and sample size                However care must be taken to use appropriate statistical        tests         P value thresholds for significance        and sufficient         n  otherwise variancebased        methods as with less rigorous foldchange approaches will        generate high error rates Recent studies have discussed        the utility of the Z score the parametric ttest and        the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test for expression        profiling      However the effects of inadequate        sample size and         P value correction methods are only        beginning to be addressed            Due to restrictions on the type and availability of        biological samples and the prohibitive cost of arrays many        array studies have resorted to the use of extremely low        sample sizes for a recent example see Lang et al            This is potentially problematic because the power of        statistical tests decreases with sample size There is also        the multiplicity problem     As the number of        hypotheses being tested increases so does the number of        type I errors false conclusions of significance This is        of great concern in microarray studies given the number of        statistical comparisons being made ie one test per gene        on an array Therefore         P value correction is essential in        expression profiling to control an appropriate type  error        rate although undue conservatism may result in the failure        to detect transcriptional changes for some genes that might        indeed be verifiable by other means As shown in this        study adoption of an experimental design that incorporates        an adequate sample size and appropriate selection of a         P value filtering method is critical        if genes with altered transcription are to be efficiently        and effectively identified                    Materials and Methods                  Reagents and media          Mefloquine was obtained from Walter Reed

         P value correction and gene            expression filtering methods The methods were compared            in terms of their ability or failure to detect genes            defined as having

of microarray            and RTPCR             P values and because it            represents the highest unadjusted             P Value for which an associated            mefloquineinduced expression

unadjusted                        P values according to several            different methods i The normal             P   threshold ie             P   for significance            ii the modified

procedure     the             P value threshold for            significance for each genes is determined on the basis            of its rank according to the following formula             P  total

applied in reverse            utilizing starting             P values of  and             according to the following formula             P   or gene rank            This approach is hereafter referred to as the reverse            Holm procedure For comparison the expression data            were also filtered using an ad hoc foldchange method            For the foldchange method the expression ratios were            calculated for each gene and a twofold change was used            as the criterion for significance                                Power analysis using mefloquine data set            In general when using statistical tests in this            case a paired ttest the required sample size to            detect a particular change eg treatment versus            control depends on the magnitude of the difference            variability of the data the required statistical power            and the acceptable type  error The mefloquine data            set was used to assess the power and implications of            sample size in terms of the minimum detectable average            foldchange in expression of the six genes defined as            being truly upregulated by the drug First a publicly            available powersample size calculator                 available at httpwwwmcvanderbilteduprevmedps            was used to determine the power of the paired test            twosided df   Then based on this level of power            and the same critical values absolute change in            expression was calculated at different sample sizes            The critical values for the calculations were as            follows The detectable difference  was the            absolute average changes in the expression values of            the control group The standard deviation  was the            square root of the average variance of differences in            expression of the six genes in individual pairs of DMSO            and mefloquinetreated cultures The type  error            twosided was set at    which corresponded to            the maximum             P value for which expression            changes were confirmed by RTPCR Absolute changes in            expression at different sample sizes are presented as            minimum detectable foldchanges in expression using the            following formula Minimum detectable foldchange

NG cells and        primary neurons were  and  M respectively and the        overall shapes of the dose response curves were similar        Figure         The eleven genes with the lowest array         P values are presented in Table         The upregulation by mefloquine of transcripts encoding the        transcription factors cJun and IkappaB IkB and the ER        stress protein GADD were confirmed by RTPCR Table         Figure  All the genes listed in Table had         P values for the microarray        expression data substantially less than  However        expression changes were only confirmed for those genes with        array         P values   Also there was        a good correlation between         P values for the microarray and        RTPCR expression data r           P   Figure  Therefore        the seven genes with array         P values   were considered        to have expression truly altered by mefloquine Table                The foldchange and         P value filtering methods were        compared in terms of their ability to detect not detect        genes differentially modulated by mefloquine Table  The        foldchange and         P   filtering methods        detected all seven differentially expressed genes but also        identified many other genes which given their relatively        high unadjusted         P values are unlikely to be        differentially expressed ie are probably false        positives The HolmBonferroni procedure failed to detect        any differentially expressed genes Other conservative        filtering methods described in the literature           performed similarly poorly eg the Sidak and Hochberg        procedures The reverse Holm procedures detected more        significant genes than the HolmBonferroni method and        generated fewer false positive results than the         P   method However the more        conservative reverse Holm method initial         P   failed to identify two        significant genes        The effect of sample size on the ease of detection of        mefloquineinduced transcriptional changes was then        examined The power of a paired ttest capable of detecting        the average change in expression of the six genes        upregulated by mefloquine was found to be  The effect        of sample size on the minimum foldchange detectable using        a test of such power is illustrated in Figure  The        minimum detectable foldchange increased with decreasing        sample size Reduction of total sample size from  to         modestly increased the minimum detectable foldchange from         to  At a total sample size lower than  the        minimum detectable foldchange exceeded the maximum change        in expression induced by mefloquine                    Discussion        The detection of differentially expressed genes depends        critically on having adequate replication sample size and        on the selection of appropriate filtering methods in the        case of this study a         P value filtering method In terms        of their ability to detect genes differentially modulated        by mefloquine the different         P value filtering methods can be        ranked in terms of their conservativeness as follows        HolmBonferroni  reverse Holm initial         P    reverse Holm        initial         P    no correction ie                P   These results are not        surprising if one considers the distribution of observed        unadjusted microarray         P values and that expected uniform        if independent tests under the complete null hypothesis        that all genes are unaltered Figure  Application of the        reverse Holm procedures generates relatively few false        positive results compared to no         P value correction but detects        genes more efficiently than if the HolmBonferroni        procedure is applied        This of course begs the question as to whether it is        appropriate to now conclude that the reverse Holm procedure        is the most appropriate         P value filtering method The        answer of course depends on the goal of the proposed        study If for example one wished to be certain that a        gene is differentially expressed or does not wish to        resort to laborious conventional techniques to confirm        expression changes the only appropriate filtering method        is the Bonferroni or other related procedure as the        chance of generating false positive results using such        methods is negligible However if one wishes to identify        all differentially expressed genes and possesses the        resources necessary to confirm all expression changes using        traditional approaches the         P   threshold or a        foldchange method might be the most appropriate However        for many studies that do not fall at either of these        extremes application of a reverse Holm procedure might be        the most appropriate choice        The choice of an appropriate sample size is also        critical if true differentially expressed genes are to        have a high probability of being detected A power analysis        was conducted to determine whether the transcriptional        changes induced by mefloquine might have been detectable        using lower sample sizes There was a modest increase in        the minimum detectable foldchange of an average gene when        the sample size was reduced to twelve from sixteen In        theory then a modest reduction in sample size may still        have allowed many significant genes to be detected However        at sample sizes below ten the minimum detectable        foldchange exceeded the maximum transcriptional modulation        of any gene by mefloquine implying that such changes would        be extremely difficult if not impossible to detect These        observations may be directly relevant for planning future        studies in which transcriptional changes of similar        magnitude and datasets with similar variance        characteristics are expected However such a power        analysis might be considered conservative for studies in        which larger magnitude foldchanges are expected        Appropriate experimental design is also necessary to        ensure that any changes in gene expression observed are        relevant to the problem being investigated The choice of        cell system toxicant concentration and exposure time must        all be carefully considered In the present study an        immortal NG cell line was selected as these cells are        easier to maintain         in vitro and large amounts of RNA can        be routinely isolated Cell lines do not always respond in        the same manner that untransformed cells would in an         in vivo context therefore their use        in experimental model systems may not always be        appropriate However this does not appear to be the case        for mefloquine since NG cells and primary embryonic rat        neurons appear similarly susceptible to the drug Figure         The mefloquine concentration  M was selected on        the basis of its physiological relevance      and        ability to elicit a measurable physiological response        without inducing maximum cell death Figure  A short        exposure time  h was selected for two reasons Firstly        shorter toxicant exposure time ensured that any changes        observed in specific mRNA transcript levels were due to the        direct cellular effects of mefloquine rather than        secondary effects caused by changing culture conditions        since drugtreated NG cells divide less rapidly than        DMSOtreated cells Secondly a short         in vitro exposure time is appropriate        since the adverse neurological effects of mefloquine         in vivo occur within  hours of        the first  doses administered             Mefloquine induced changes in the expression of three        genes GADD IkB and cJun CJun is a transcription        factor upregulated in response to many forms of        neurological injury     thus its modulation by        mefloquine under conditions of cellular stress is        unsurprising and does not imply a specific mechanism of        action However this is not the case for GADD and IkB        Two highly conserved responses are observed under        conditions of endoplasmic reticulum ER stress the ER        overload and unfolded protein responses      The        unfolded protein response is characterized by generalized        suppression of protein synthesis and the specific induction        of ERresident proteins and GADD     The        transcription factor nuclear factor kB is activated during        the ER overload response leading to the downstream        induction of proinflammatory proteins     Therefore        the transcriptional modulation of GADD and IkB by        mefloquine suggests that the ER might be a target of the        drug        In neurons GADD is selectively upregulated under        conditions of endoplasmic reticulum ER stress arising        from depletion of calcium stores     Here the        upregulation of GADD was observed after mefloquine        treatment in NG cells  M for  h In preliminary        experiments utilizing primary rat neurons we have also        observed an upregulation of GADD after mefloquine        treatment unpublished data Mefloquine has been found to        alter calcium flux into and out of isolated skeletal        muscle and brain microsomes via an inhibitory effect of        the compound on the ER calcium pump and calcium release        channels IC          of  uM      Plasma        mefloquine concentrations therapeutic dosing may reach         M    and the drug crosses the bloodbrain barrier        accumulating to concentrations in excess of  and  M in        the brains of humans and rats respectively             Therefore these biochemical effects occur at        concentrations within a relevant physiological range        Collectively these observations suggest that mefloquine        disrupts neuronal function through a combination of        disrupted calcium homeostasis and ER stress This        hypothesis is currently under investigation in this        laboratory                    Conclusions        Adequate sample sizes and appropriate selection of         P value filtering methods are        essential for the efficient and effective detection of        differentially expressed genes Mefloquine induced changes        in the expression of genes encoding cJun IkB and the ER        stress response protein GADD The upregulation of        GADD by mefloquine suggests that the drug might affect        the function of the ER in neurons perhaps by disruption of        calcium homeostasis                    Competing interests        None declared
