lyricwriting Alan JayLerner used to bemoan the fact that writers like Paul Simon never went into thetheater But since the advent of the LP and the gatefold sleeve with theprinted lyrics and the college courses that study rock songs for their elusiveallusiveness pop texts have been freed from the first requirement of aBroadway lyric that it be made up of words you can catch when youre sittingin a theater and theyre flying through the air at you Paul Simon once took methrough one of his songs Hearts and Bones which begins One and onehalfwandering Jews LINK TO AUDIO CLIP
