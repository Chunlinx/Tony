                                 Questioning the Cocaine Question                           Ask but DontTell                        Real reporters dont write I asked because itsnot important who asked the question While framing questions in a way to drawout interesting or informative answers is important as your article  pointsout its still the answer that matters And while reporters print andelectronic talking on television often talk about themselves and how theydeveloped a story in the newspaper itself its the story that matters Therereally is enough selfpromotion in the business and your suggestion that weadvertise our authorship of questions would make it worse            Moreover you misrepresent the article youcriticize Gov George Bush was not asked that day in Akron Ohio aboutlongago cocaine abuse and my story did not say he had been He had declinedto answer a question about what he had told his daughters about drugson thereasonable ground that he wanted to leave them out of the campaign But asNBCs David Bloom was trying to rephrase the question in a more general wayBush did it for him and said baby boomer parents should tell their childrennot to use drugs and do so forthrightly            I then followed up with this question for which Imake no apology because it corresponds with an obvious reality And if a childasks a baby boomer parentWell did you             His reply which Iquoted and characterized as awkward was I think the baby boomer parentought to say Ive learned from mistakes I may or may not have made And Idlike to share some wisdom with you              Adam Clymer                        NewYork                                             WilliamSaletan replies                               Youre a fine and careful reporter Acareful reporter gives the reader enough context to put each quote inperspective and to understand how the events of the day were shaped Whydoesnt this rule apply to your questioning of Bush                                       Bush evidently would have preferred to talk tothe press that day about tax cuts and religious charities Instead reportersasked him about issues arising from the controversy over his alleged drug abuseandin the case of your questionthe implications of that controversy forwhat boomer parents should say to their kids about drugs In short you DavidBloom and the other reporters on hand chose the topic Thats a major reasonalbeit not the only reasonBush provided some justification in his speechwhy questions about drug use ended up in your headline and faithbasedinstitutions ended up buried at the bottom In that sense you helped drivethe story If you dont report this fact arent you omitting information thatthe reader needs in order to understand the persistence of the drugstory                                       You say that its not important who asked thequestion But if a protester had shouted your question at Bush would you havereported who asked the question If so why not follow the same practice whenthe person posing the question is a reporter                                       I share your distaste for journalists talkingabout themselves and I dont propose that we print our names every time we aska question Usually as you know the choice of topic is fairly obvious Butisnt there some point at which the medias choice of topic can become socontroversial and so determinative of the course of the campaign that theprinciple of selfdisclosure supersedes the principle of modesty                                       Youre right that I oversimplified the exchangewith Bush in Ohio The questions were about what he had told his kids aboutdrugs and what other parents should tell their kids Of course we both knowthat the implicit background to these questions was the rumors of Bushs owndrug abuse and in that sense this larger topic was what your question and theothers were about Nobody was asking Gary Bauer such questions that dayexcept perhaps for pointed contrast because the obvious hook for thesequestions is Bushs alleged hypocrisy                                       Still I should havecharacterized your question more carefully Ill take responsibility for myoversight Will you take responsibility for yours                                       Lines ofSuccession                        Carter as Henry VI see  by Steven ELandsburg At times Henry was mentally ill or at least clinically depressedSo much so that it was unsafe to leave him alone with sharp objects Doesntsound like Carter to me            Edward IV a great king This is the guy who spurnedan offer of marriage with the daughter of the king of France a marriage thatwould have created a valuable alliance in favor of a commoner He married herwithout notifying anyone in his court This shortsightedness caused his chiefally Warwick to defect to Lancaster and they were able to oust Edward fromthe throne for a time It was only with the aid of his brother the eventualRichard III that Edward was able to reclaim it            English people turning to Henry VII Thats thebiggest joke of all Henry won one battle and fortunately for him killedRichard The English people accepted Henry as king despite his having the aidof foreign troops because they were tired of civil war not out of any lovefor Henry The fact that Henry killed off all the York heirs and blamed some oftheir murders on Richard helped him keep the throne And it let his son HenryVIII become the most powerful and autocratic of all English rulers            So if Landsburg iscorrect it
