Introduction As recognized by the Presidents National Energy Plan NEP oneof the principal energy challenges facing us is increasing ourenergy supplies in ways that protect and improve the environmentThus the President directed EPA to propose legislation that wouldsignificantly reduce SO NOx and mercury emissions from powergeneration through a cap and trade program Such a program coupledwith appropriate measures to address local concerns would providesignificant health benefits even as we increase energy supplies andmaintain reasonable electricity ratesOur work on this issue has given us insight that I believe willbe helpful to you The more I learn about the cost andinefficiencies of the current and future regulatory regime to whichpower generators will be subjected if we do not have newlegislation the more I am convinced that we can and must develop a smarter approach that protects the environment and publichealth while reducing the cost to consumers and industry andoptimizing the size of both the state and federal governmentmachinery necessary to achieve that protection It is possible toachieve better results at lower costsbut not if we simply add yet another program on top of all ofthe existing regulationsThe current Clean Air Act has been enormously successful but wecan do better Significant cost savings can be achieved for powergenerators and consumers through a comprehensive legislativepackage I look forward to working with you to develop such anapproach to reduce emissions from power generation We applaudSenator Jeffords for tackling this important issue and forrecognizing that a cap and trade program is the best way to achievethese reductions However we have significant concerns with S as drafted Our analysis to date suggests that it could increaseconsumers electricity rates by as much as  which we believe isunacceptable In addition the combination of emission reductionsand timing is not feasible and could threaten the reliability ofelectricity supply We are concerned that S s short timeframesfor installation of controls could lead power plants to be takenoffline at important times which could lead to electricityshortagesIn addition there are a number of issues that Congress shouldconsider that S  does not address As drafted S  wouldmake some existing requirements unnecessary but would noteliminate them Rather than add yet another layer of environmentalregulations on top of the existing ones we believe that S should eliminate those unnecessary existing requirements S also does not have an allocation scheme One lesson we should learnfrom the success of the Acid Rain cap and trade program is thatwhen certain key issues can be resolved through clear legislationwe can avoid years of litigation business uncertainty and costsand delayed environmental protectionFinally and most importantly the Administration stronglyopposes including CO reductions in any multipollutant bill TheCO provisions in S  will cost consumers too much and endangerour energy security by causing too much electricity generation toswitch from coal to natural gas Greenhouse gas emissions should beaddressed in the context of climate change which is beingundertaken by the Presidents Cabinet level working group For allof these reasons the Administration must oppose S  In mytestimony today I will elaborate further on these key pointsBackground Over the last  years we have made substantial progresstowards improved environmental quality under the Clean Air ActDuring this time gross domestic product has increased almost At the same time we have reduced emissions of six key airpollutants by  while coal consumption has increased  andenergy consumption has increased  Eleven years ago PresidentGeorge H W Bush signed into law the most far reaching amendmentsto the Clean Air Act since its enactment in  Included in thoseamendments was the Acid Rain cap and trade program the firstprogram tailored specifically to the utility sector which isachieving significant environmental and public health benefits at afraction of the initial cost estimates and with relatively littlegovernment bureaucracy It is time to revisit and update the CleanAir Act once again in order to achieve the additional reductionsneeded to address public health and environmental problems in themost cost effective mannerThe Acid Rain Program is achieving its emission reduction goalat a fraction of the estimated costs because it allows andencourages innovative thinking and long range planning Theexisting program establishes a cap on SO emissions to ensure thatthe environmental goal is met and employs an innovativemarketbased allowance trading program to achieve the goal atlowest cost Allowances are the currency with which compliance withthe SO emissions requirements is achieved Sources rather thangovernment decide the most costeffective way to use availableresources to comply Units that reduce their emissions below thenumber of allowances they hold may trade allowances with otherunits in the system sell them to other sources or save them forfuture use There are neither restrictions on trading norgovernment secondguessingAllowance trading provides incentives for energy conservationand technology innovation that can both lower the cost ofcompliance and yield pollution prevention benefits Simply theallowance market puts a price or value on each ton of SO not emitted The association of a monetary valuewith reduced emissions encourages innovation in the sscrubber costs decreased by approximately  and scrubber sulfurremoval efficiencies improved from  to  and experimentationled to the blending of fuels to lower emissions To ensure that thecap is met and to provide credibility sources also are required toinstall systems that continuously monitor and report emissionsThe Acid Rain Program has proven to be an excellent model forcap and trade programs Compliance with the program has been nearly percent and annual emissions of SO from power plants havealready been reduced over  million tons about  percent from levels Greater reductions earlier than expected have loweredrisks to human health and provided benefits to the environmentsooner Acid rain levels were dramatically reduced over large areasof the US and trading did not result in geographic shifting ofemissions or hot spots as some fearedDespite the significant progress we have made under the CleanAir Act air emissions from power generators are still contributingto serious public health and environmental problems AdministratorWhitman addressed these concerns extensively in her testimonybefore you on July   Rather than reiterate her testimony Iwill emphasize just a few of her key points Problems associatedwith sulfur dioxide SO nitrogen oxides NOx and mercuryemissions are of national and international significance and theinterstate and long range transport of emissions continue to playsignificant roles in the nature and magnitude of the problemsEmission and deposition of SO NOx and mercury and theirtransformation byproducts are known to have a wide range of adverseeffects on human health and the environment including SO and NOx emissions contribute to fine particles which areassociated with premature mortality aggravated chronic bronchitishospitalizations due to cardiorespiratory symptoms emergency roomvisits due to aggravated asthma symptoms and acute respiratorysymptoms Governor Whitmans July   testimony before thisCommittee contains a detailed discussion of the success of the AcidRain cap and trade programFine particles formed from power plant emissions as well asmobile source emissions are ofconcern  NOx emissions contribute to groundlevel ozonewhich aggravates respiratory illnesses and causes lunginflammation particularly for atrisk populations such aschildren the elderly and those afflicted with asthma emphysemaand other respiratory ailments Mercury emissions contribute to mercury deposition in waterChildren born to women who consume large amounts ofmercurycontaminated fish while pregnant may be at risk forneurodevelopmental defects SO and NOx emissions contribute to atmospheric sulfate andnitrate concentrations that cause visibility impairment includingimpairment in many national parks and wilderness areas SO and NOx contribute to acid deposition which damageslakes and streams adversely affecting the fish and other speciesthat live in them and leaches nutrients from the soil NOx emissions contribute to nitrogen deposition that may leadto eutrophication of estuaries and nearcoastal waters and candamage forested watershedsEPA states and industry working together have made importantstrides in addressing the adverse impacts of fossil fuel combustionby the electric power industry since the passage of the Clean AirAct in  Despite significant improvements in air qualitythroughout the country however emissions from power generationcontinue to result in serious health environmental and economicimpacts In  the electric power industry was responsible for of sulfur dioxide emissions  of nitrogen oxide emissionsand  of mercury emissions in the United StatesBusiness as Usual The Presidents flexible marketbased approach to reducingemissions from power generators stands in sharp contrast to thecomplex web of existing regulations which currently confront theindustry Over the years Congress EPA and the States haveresponded to specific environmental and public health problems bydeveloping separate regulatory programs to address the specificproblems Each individual program uses its own approach on its owntimeline to serve its own purpose Absent changes to the Act EPAand states will be forced to follow the same approach in futureregulations It is time to consolidate and simplify to achieve ourclean air goals A comprehensive legislative approach withmandatory caps could replace a good portion of the currentregulatory requirements with a system that will reduce theadministrative burden on industry and governments use marketbasedapproaches to lower compliance costs reduce consumers costs andincrease national energy security by providing the industry withmore certainty about its future regulatory obligations By enactingsuch an approach we can achieve environmental and public healthprotection more effectively and at less cost If we do it thePresidents way it will be a winwinThere are many regulations in place that will reduce airemissions from electric power generation These regulations includeboth federal and State requirements that address a variety ofemissions including SO NOx CO PM and a number of hazardousair pollutants These programsinclude the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for SOparticulate matter and ozone the section  and the NOx SIP Callrules the Acid Rain Program new source review new sourceperformance standards and the regional haze ruleBut the regulation of power generators does not end withexisting regulations EPA is obligated by a settlement agreement toissue by the end of  a Maximum Achievable Control TechnologyMACT standard to require sourcespecific controls of mercury andother hazardous air pollutants from electric utilities Emissionsreductions are required by the end of  States will also berequiring utilities to comply with Best Available RetrofitTechnology BART programs either sourcespecific standards or atrading program to meet requirements to reduce regional hazeIt is expected that the existing fine particle and ozonestandards now in place will also result in further regulation ofpower generators Modeling shows that when full implementation ofexisting regulations such as the acid rain program the NOx SIPCall the Tier II standards for cars and trucks the heavy dutydiesel engine standards and the low sulfur gasoline and dieselfuel rules are taken into account additional reductions will beneeded to bring areas into attainment States will be required todevelop plans for these areas In addition NOx and SO reductionsare also needed to reduce continuing damage from acid rain andnitrogen depositionBecause states and EPA will have to find some way tosignificantly reduce NOx and SO emissions it is probable thatpower generators will be required to reduce their emissionssignificantly Power generation accounts for a significantpercentage of these emissions and our analysis shows that thereare significant reductions available at lower cost than from othersources Additionally states know that if they do not get thereductions from power generators they will have to imposesignificant reduction requirements on other local industrial andcommercial sources or impose local transportation controlmeasuresUnder current law the necessary reductions would be achievedthrough the development of individual state plans States will notjust control their own sources however They will be reaching outto control power generators and large industrial facilities inother states because transport from other states contributes toboth ozone and fine particle pollution in many areas This is whathas happened in the eastern part of the country when statesrealized that emissions from sources in other states weresignificantly contributing to their hour ozone nonattainmentproblems Under section  of the Clean Air Act a state canpetition EPA and request that EPA require reductions from sourcesoutside the petitioning states borders The petitioning state isentitled to relief if EPA finds that the sources are significantlycontributing to the petitioning states nonattainment problemEPAs requirement adopted in response to section  petitionsthat sources in a number of eastern states reduce NOx emissions wasrecently upheld by the Court of Appeals for the District ofColumbia Circuit Since states now know that EPA has authority toaddress transport pollution through responses to  petitions orby issuing a rule like the NOx SIP Call we anticipate that stateswill be turning to these types of control approaches early in theSIP process Although those of us who aretraveling that path with the current  petitions and NOx SIPCall believe it will eventually take us to our environmental goalit has been  and still is  a very rocky road for industryenvironmentalists the states EPA and other stakeholdersThis oneatatime uncoordinated series of regulatoryrequirements for the power industry is not the optimal approach forthe environment the power generation sector or Americanconsumers With most plants needing to install control equipment tomeet these requirements it is likely that this approach would leadto installation of controls that become obsolete and strandedcapital investments as additional requirements are promulgatedFurther the attainment efforts of individual States and localitiesnot only impose costs on these entities but also can increasecomplexity for companies which face differing requirements whenoperations cross state lines These factors are exacerbated bylimited timeframes that may constrain available compliance optionsand thwart long range planning These and other inefficienciespoint to the need for a nationally coordinated approach that couldreduce cost while improving environmental progress andaccountabilityChanging the Way We Do Business Certainty FlexibilityAccountability and Innovation We believe there is a better way one that could cost Americanconsumers and industry far less than under current law and ensureprotection of the air we breathe in a far more certainstraightforward manner I know that many members of this Committeeshare that belief and are also working to develop such an approachIt would provide power generators with more certainty about theirregulatory future and thus allow them to make wiser decisions aboutinvestments in new technology which would improve energy securityThis Administration is developing such a proposal It will build onthe successes of the Acid Rain cap and trade program It wouldestablish national capandtrade programs for NOx SO and mercuryemissions from power generators with appropriate measures toaddress local concerns Such an approach will benefit the powergeneration industry the economy and the states while improvingpublic health and the environmentUpfront knowledge of future requirements for multiplepollutants would lead firms to follow significantly different andless expensive compliance strategies at individual plants comparedwith compliance choices which must be made as requirements areaddressed in a sequential manner under the current law The savingscome from the opportunity to make costeffective plant investmentand retirement decisions with full knowledge of upcoming SO NOxand mercury requirements rather than investing in addon controlequipment to meet the requirements of each regulation Integrationadvance knowledge and certainty regarding environmentalrequirements will have even greater value over the coming decade asthe electric power industry undergoes further structural changesAn integrated package of measures that addresses both the existingregulatory requirements as well as many future environmental needswould provide the greatest degree of certainty and flexibility forthe industry while achieving the necessary emission reductions atlower cost than under current lawIn exchange for flexibility in methods to control emissions afull accounting of emissions throughcontinuous monitoring and reporting is essential as well assignificant consequences for failing to comply Such provisionshave been critical to the success of the Acid Rain Programencouraging individual sources to find the most costeffectivemeans of compliance with the collective emission reductiongoalFlexibility stimulates technological innovation fuels economicactivity and reduces cost to industry and consumers Strategies andtechnologies for the control of SO NOx and mercury emissionsexist now and improved methods are expected to become availableover the next several years The air pollution control andmonitoring technology industry is expected to continue to respondwith costeffective compliance solutions just as they have done forthe past  years A predictable demand for such jobs over the next years is preferable to the boom and bust cycle created by thecurrent regulatory approachThis approach also would reduce states administrative burdensand obligations A national cap and trade program with appropriatecaps for NOx and SO could provide the emission reductionsnecessary to bring a significant number of areas into attainmentwith the ozone and fine particle standards Even those areas thatwould not be brought into attainment by these caps would needsignificantly fewer emission reductions to come into attainmentOur approach would significantly reduce the state resources neededto conduct modeling planning and regulatory activities to attainthe standards Additionally the Acid Rain cap and trade program isadministered with a relatively small staff relying on strongstateoftheart data tracking and reporting capabilities Thuswelldesigned national cap and trade programs can help usegovernment resources and taxpayer dollars more efficiently at boththe state and federal levelCaps ensure that environmental goals are met A cap thatrepresents significant reductions of emissions protects theenvironment by reducing overall loadings Consideration of localconcerns is important in conjunction with trading provisionsTherefore the National Energy Plan recommended that theAdministrations approach include appropriate measures to addresslocal concerns such as the unlikely occurrence of an SO hotspot or area of concentrated emissions Significant reductionswill go a long way towards addressing local concerns In additionEPA will be conducting modeling that will predict where emissionsreductions will occur Under the Acid Rain cap and trade programwe have not seen local hot spots because the highest emitters areoften the most costeffective to control and therefore the mostlikely to controlAs I mentioned EPA and the Administration are still in theprocess of developing our proposal Several guidelines are shapingour efforts These guidelines may provide a valuable basis as youweigh the proposals before you They will also guide our assessmentof other proposals including S  These principles arestructured to ensure consistency with the NEP objectives The NEPgoals of increasing energy supplies accelerating the protectionand improvement of the environment and increasing our nationsenergy supply must be advanced Towards that end energy diversitythe preservation of electricity generation and transmissionreliability and improvement of energy efficiencyenergy intensity of the electric power industryshould be a key consideration In particular to prevent thereoccurrence of energy shortages and price volatility a diversemix of fuel sources should be maintainedSpecific Comments on S  We share the desire expressed in S  to significantly reduceand cap emissions of SO NOx and mercury from power generation Weapplaud your acknowledgment of marketbased incentivesparticularly cap and trade systems as a powerful tool inenvironmental protection In this way S  builds on successfulelements of the Clean Air ActWe do however oppose S  because of concerns with the bill both with some provisions that are in the bill and with somethat are missing We believe the emission reductions and timing inthe bill will be too costly for consumers and will endangernational energy security We believe the bill is missing someprovisions  it should address the allocation scheme andintegration with existing programs Finally we oppose inclusion ofCO in this billFirst let me explain some of our specific concerns about theSO NOx and mercury provisions in the bill We are concerned thatthe significant emissions reductions are required too quickly Wedo not believe it is reasonable to expect all the controltechnology installations to be completed in that time frame withoutvery high costs and electricity reliability problems To meet thesedeadlines facilities may need to be taken offline during criticalperiods Reliability problems could arise as large amounts ofcapacity are taken out of service for extended periods of time toinstall the control equipment necessary to meet the emissionsreduction requirements The abbreviated time frame would force manygenerators to make these retrofits simultaneously This wouldsignificantly reduce the amount of generating capacity available tomeet consumer electrical needsWe have not modeled the specific provisions in S  butuseful information is provided by comparing the analyses EPA andEIA conducted to respond to a request from Senators SmithVoinovich and Brownback with the analyses responding to a requestfrom Senators Jeffords and Lieberman In theSmithVoinovichBrownback analysis when we analyzed SO and NOxreduction levels similar to S  mercury reduction levels moremodest than S  and no CO reductions we did not findsignificant impacts on coal production or electricity pricesHowever in the analysis responding to the JeffordsLiebermanrequest that had NOx SO mercury and CO reduction levels similarto S  we found significant ramifications approximately a decline of coal generation and a  increase inelectricity prices compared to the reference case depending onassumptions of energy technology penetrationThe  sourcespecific control for mercury is also problematicWe have not seen anything that demonstrates that every coalfiredpower plant would be able to achieve  sourcespecific controlsfor mercury by  without considerable fuel switching whichwould be very disruptive to our economy and undermine energysecurity In addition requiring the same level of reduction ataplant that emits  pounds of mercury and a plant that emits pounds of mercury  regardless of cost  is neither efficientnor necessaryWe are also very concerned about the outdated power plantprovision Requiring every plant over  years old to meet NewSource Performance Standards and New Source Review modificationrequirements seems unnecessary and could undermine the benefits ofthe cap and trade approach Allowing sources to make reductionswhere it is most economical to do so is one of the reasons cap andtrade programs should be less costly than commandandcontrolprograms that achieve the same or even fewer reductions When youhave a hard cap as you would under S  requiring emissionreductions at a specific source does not reduce the overall levelof pollution it just limits industrys flexibility about where tomake the reductions Layering additional requirements such as theoutdated power plants provision on top of a cap and tradeprogram is very likely to increase costs without providingsignificant environmental benefitsSecond we have concerns about what is not in S  Comparingour experience on the Acid Rain Program with the NOx SIP Call andthe Section  petitions demonstrates the benefit of havingcertain key issues decided by Congress rather than left to Agencyrulemakings Congressional resolution of key issues simplifieswhatever Agency rulemaking is needed and decreases theopportunities for the program to get tied up in protractedlitigationPerhaps the most important program element not addressed in thebill is integration of this new program with the existing Clean AirAct provisions An effective marketbased approach would make someexisting provisions of the Clean Air Act unnecessary For exampledepending on the ultimate cap levels chosen by Congress this typeof legislation would obviate the need for Best Available RetrofitTechnology requirements mercury MACT and new source reviewcasebycase technology requirements for power generatorsAlso missing from S  is the scheme for allocatingallowances Developing an allocation scheme requires answeringnumerous questions Should the allowances be auctioned off or behanded out for free If they are not auctioned should they beallocated based on heat input or electrical and steam outputShould power generators that do not emit air pollutants eghydropower facilities be given allowances Should allowanceallocations be updated and if so how frequently Shouldallocations be fuel neutral Imbedded in these and other questionsare important environmental and energy policy choices withsignificant equity consequences It may not be efficient for EPA tomake these choices in rulemakingThere are other issues as well that this Committee shouldconsider such as coordination with existing state and regionalprograms like the Western Regional Air Partnership and the NOxreduction programs in the east The Committee may also wish toconsider provisions to track environmental progress to evaluate theefficacy of the program this bill would establishFinally the Administration strongly opposes includingreductions for CO in S  or any multipollutant bill Pursuingsharp reductions in CO from the electricity generating sectoralone would cause a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas andthus would run the risk of endangering national energy securitysubstantially increasing energy prices and harming consumersThe Administration will not support any legislation that wouldcause a significant decline in our nations ability to use coal asa major source of current and future electricity At the same timethe Administration will not support any legislation that does notenhance the cleanliness of coalfired electricity generation andpromote a future for clean coal technologies In short theAdministration supports a clean coal policy as a critical componentof our nations energy and environmental policies recognizing thatother sources of energy also have a critical role to playAdditionally as Governor Whitman said when she testified beforeyou in July including CO in this bill will slow down if notprevent the consensus necessary for passage of legislation tocontrol multiple emissions from power plants Governor Whitman andI both believe consensus on the appropriate levels and timing forreductions of NOx SO and mercury is achievable relatively soonWe should not delay the public health and environmental benefitsfrom reduction of these emissions while we wait for consensus todevelop on COWe agree that climate change is a serious issue we need toaddress However CO has never been regulated as a pollutant underthe Clean Air Act and does not pose any direct threat to humanhealth unlike NOx SO and mercury The current body of scientificknowledge does not provide information regarding atmosphericconcentrations of CO or reduction levels necessary to preventdangerous interference with the climate systemIn April the President convened a Cabinetlevel policy reviewof this issue and was provided with initial recommendations that heaccepted and announced on June  In that regard theAdministration is implementing two major initiatives on climatescience and advanced energy and sequestration technologies TheUnited States now spends  billion annually on climate scienceto reduce uncertainties  a commitment unmatched by any othernation The National Climate Change Technology Initiative willaccelerate priority research and the application of advanced energyand sequestration technologies recognizing that the real answer toaddressing climate change in the long term lies in the developmentand global introduction of such technologies in this century Andthe cabinetlevel policy review is ongoing Finally as greenhousegas emissions are projected to grow exponentially in the developingworld in the next two decades we must evaluate the costs ofimposing domestic reductions as a very high cost againstpotentially lowcost opportunities for mitigating and sequesteringcarbon emissions in the developing worldWe appreciate the role of S  in generating importantdiscussions and emphasizing the importance of a new approach tocontrolling emissions in the power sector I look forward to theadditional hearings you will need to address these important issuesand to working with the Committeeto develop an approach that the President can supportThe history of Clean Air Act legislation is one of greataccomplishments made possible by bipartisan efforts I thank youfor the opportunity to work with you to continue that greattradition
