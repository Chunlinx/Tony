                 well Nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two      well of course working   umhum   thats definitely got to be the biggest thing is that everybodys out there working   uhhuh   including me  well what do you think it is   umhum um yeah i agree i also think that there are more um the people are women stay single longer it seems like   yeah yes they do yeah they do   yeah i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty and i waited until i was thirty two so   right uhhuh yeah   you know um i know that   yeah thats true its a big change im an OB nurse and so i really do see what youre saying there   uhhuh   it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients ages and now our care plans look more like thirty two thirty three if we get somebody twenty one we go oh look how young so yeah youre right theres a big change and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   so thats true but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers   yeah umhum   if they didnt have if they werent out there working and having their careers they probably would be married and having their children  so  i guess its a combination   yeah yeah yeah seems like there uhhuh go ahead   no go on   oh it just seems like there are more single mothers too i mean thats therere a lot of   yeah   either divorced or um you know never been married so   yeah yeah yeah theres a lot of mixed up families thats for sure yeah   yeah i agree well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so   well just that i think the families the the role in the family and the mother doesnt stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children   umhum   um we do it all  i really think that and i know that theres a lot more participation by the fathers but i still think the mothers   yeah   have the major role i really do i think theyre just   umhum   theyre not doing very much less i dont think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and theyre contributing to the income besides   yeah yeah uhhuh   i think that were really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves   umhum yeah and it really its affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home and yet you know um   oh it is   i mean i i dont blame anybody when they have to work  because um yeah   yeah yeah its its difficult and i think that i live in Plano actually so   umhum   its very wealthy town and were not part of that but i  it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better   umhum   and i really hate that you know i hate to see that and and ive been here for a very long time   umhum umhum   but um i dont know now im a single parent and i dont have a choice anymore but   umhum   i used to just work occasionally for extra money but now i have to work all the time and thats really hard and and i dont know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and   umhum yeah   and leave the kids in a way its good its very good to get out with adults and i think thats a good thing if you can do it part time but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and   umhum yeah   and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think thats not very smart i think thats difficult on them so   umhum yeah well what do you thinks gonna happen in the next generation you think itll continue yeah   well its gonna be interesting i yeah i think it will change but im not sure how its going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world theyll ever afford to buy a home and and to raise a family i dont know how theyre gonna do it   umhum umhum   and so i dont know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i dont think that ever will go backwards   umhum   but i dont know what effect its gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how theyre gonna feel about it   umhum   it you know it could lead to another Woodstock type thing you know where where theres just too much material things and and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things   yeah umhum   and they might wanna do without things rather than do that to their families its hard to say   yeah umhum yeah it is i think some i dont know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children i guess i see that happening already   uhhuh   some choosing it and and they get you know therere people chide them for it you know why arent you out
