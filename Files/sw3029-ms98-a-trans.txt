        okay well ill start off being controversial im in favor of it   that doesnt necessarily mean youre controversial   well it seems to be in the current situations but uh i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime particularly with the increase of serious crime thats going on now   well i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence need to be reevaluated i think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all crimes against children is one of them   okay yeah i think that oh definitely any any crimes against person   yeah   uh i feel uh there should be more than a slap on the hand and being sent to prison and being released in uh two or three years   umhum actually i would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries if you steal you lose a hand   ooh yes thats yeah   you know uh  if you kill you lose your life whats wrong with that   i dont see a thing wrong with that i believe that uh   yeah uh   well its just an an example i think theres uh someone thats on trial right now   umhum   here in the Dallas area and they were interviewing the its a a young lady was killed sometime back a a young girl   umhum umhum   and a personal trial and the reporter was asking a sup stupid question of the people outside well how do you feel about this   umhum   and they you know i  thought thats   umhum   how do they feel about it im sure that uh they want it over with and they want the person punished and punished properly   umhum umhum   but   deciding what that proper punishment is is one thing i think that there should be no way i i realize that innocent people could go to uh what is it lethal injection now   yes   innocent people could do that but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty   yeah well i feel like the the cost of someone someone was quoting figures made the cost at like thirty thousand dollars a year   uh the umhum umhum umhum to maintain a prison inmate thats right thats stupid   to keep someone in prison and well the problem there is theyre not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases there are more and more instances   umhum thats right   being on the news where this individual was out on the streets on probation or parole and killed someone else   umhum umhum sure sure   or seriously injured someone   well i dont have solutions to the problems but you know you have these this would be nice if and theres probably thousands of holes in that theory but i think that if you did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living i remember a man drove by randomly shot a women in the head while she was driving blinded her   yeah   i think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate i think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual   yes yes indeed   or the family of an individual   yeah   uh who has been harmed youre you you know people who kill policemen policemen who are killed in the line of duty they may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman but that family still has no provider   yeah well here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind   and i umhum   uh the opportunity exists for someone to get killed   thats right   now im not in favor of gun control to the nth degree or anything because uh there are uses for guns which are non criminal   umhum   but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them uh aside from domestic disputes husband shooting wives or vice versa   umhum   but these individuals if they have a gun with them i think that the the sentence should be even longer than if they dont   i dont i dont agree with the length of the sentence though i think expediency is the answer   well well but here again uh if a matter of expediency part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years there should be some uh i know theres a law i believe that   umhum umhum thats right   its automatic appeal if its a death sentence   umhum   well i think that automatic appeal ought to take place uh within a reasonable length of time say six months   umhum   and a decision be made and not drag out in the courts   umhum   for years because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities there might be   thats right technical i think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals   right theres theres got to be a theres got to be a time limit   you you you can appeal it once i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is if if it is contradictory   a a legitimate a legitimate appeal not a technicality of uh if   yeah thats right uhhuh   and theyre not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime theyre arguing over well were his civil rights violated because uh   umhum   someone didnt file the proper paper at the proper time those are the things that have caused them to drag out i think   umhum umhum thats right well one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of of the process in which the criminals were apprehended   yeah   i mean uh you know the guy is guilty you know hes done what hes done you you may have stood there and seen it but because he wasnt read his rights whenever he was arrested   yeah   you know he he goes free uhhuh uhhuh yeah   he didnt see his lawyer as quickly as he should have or or some some Mickey Mouse type thing like that   right and i realize that that is designed to protect the innocent its also designed to line the pockets of lawyers and uh i   oh yes   i just dont think that i think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers  i hope youre not a lawyer   yes no im not a lawyer i its i i im an accountant and i agree we practice law ourselves because its too expensive to hire lawyers  to a degree   yeah absolutely thats why you check books out from the library but i really believe that   there you go   our justice system is is the best around but its not perfect and that doesnt mean that you leave it in tact   well its its a case that we have a a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself   thats right   so   thats right   thats how we get caught in this uh sort of a catch twenty two   umhum thats right   but you have to continue uh to protect the innocent youre giving an open door to the guilty   thats right and and it i dont know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter   yeah   and that just that really does ruffle my feathers at times i mean i can just get so aggravated about it   yes  it does most people   but you know its its going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem and and i hope not lawyers   but again one of our one of our problems is that uh our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members there of are lawyers
