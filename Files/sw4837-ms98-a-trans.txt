        so what do you think   um well i think uh theres been significant change over the last couple of decades uh i guess i would say that one of the most um important changes seems to be um that the family the definition of family is changing a lot   yeah oh yeah no doubt about it the nuclear family and just the whole downsizing approach   right   you know a lot of people are are are not having kids are not having kids as as early or as many   right   you know and thats yeah that goes hand in hand with some of the stuff that i had you know like maybe the whole emphasis on the environment and on social kind of a social awareness approach to where people are starting to think about pollution and trash a little more and uh and the ozone layer and things like that   right yeah exactly   its really putting some constraints on your whole uh the whole lifestyle which is   it seems to me it seems to me like um like everyone is lamenting you know the loss of the nuclear family and saying that its going to be the downfall of America but to me um   umhum   i dont know i guess that thats thats probably a pretty liberal view but i mean to me the the old um traditional nuclear family um       seems to only work seems to work real well uh you know when uh husband is in charge of the family when hes working when moms home taking care of the kids   umhum yeah   and you know as soon as mom gets equal rights and she can work too then all of the sudden you know theres all these constraints on the family i mean face it its basically   yeah   an old um you know religious construction so um its its   sure yeah see to me it   no i i actually i actually think um its its better the way its working out i i think   yeah im   i think that when each person is is working that uh it makes for more it makes for like two dependent people   yeah   and two independent people who are sharing their lives rather than one person dependent on another person seems to me uh   umhum it could be im im kind of a conservative uh myself although i dont know ive got mixed views i come from a very very conservative family where there are you know its like you mentioned you mentioned its like you described the first time   uhhuh   um where the the husbands in control the wife stays home raises the family things like that however   uhhuh   i dont think thats a realistic approach anymore especially with the the rising cost of living and things like that theres theres almost no way you can make it with a one income family anymore   yeah it just seems that way   um you know regardless of the of the social impact or the the familial impact you got to think about just the pragmatic side of it in terms of how can you afford to raise however many kids one or nine   exactly   um with one income and its never going to work i dont think um   see i came from um a pretty conservative family too   yeah   but the uh thing is that it didnt work out and my parents split up so maybe thats what  yeah maybe thats what um influenced my view   oh really yeah my parents yeah my parents fought like cat and dogs um they they did stay together finally and theyve been married like forty years now but   right right   i know i know what you mean because theres theres a lot of stress in that kind of an environment where the husbands gone all day and comes home at night and like the wife is like the first thing she hits him with is all these problems you know so both sides are are under a lot of stress that way   right right   i dont know i was   of course of course when both um parents are working the big question is you know who how how do the kids get raised   exactly you know thats something my sisters having to face right now theyve both got theyve got working parents both of them and its like theyre always shuffling them off to day care   right   and youve got to ask yourself whose morals and whose values are being you know enforced on my kid   exactly exactly umhum   you know they come home and start swearing like a blue streak wait a minute i didnt teach them that stuff you know   one system that um is interesting that that we we may take in that we might be good might be good for us to take into consideration is um in Israel they have this  you heard of that   no i havent   where the kids are its kind of like of like uh a community school i guess where you know all the kids um its kind of like a boarding school i guess and theyre but theyre raised by adults who sort of act as   umhum   their parents you know because i guess in Israel um you know that happens a lot too that the women are working and or in the army or something like that well um   right     um i dont know it seems   thats kind of interesting   seems to work really well and they somehow they um do it in such a way you know that they they pass on morals pretty well
