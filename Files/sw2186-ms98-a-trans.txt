        okay so i guess um i start with maybe if if does do you know if the population favors statehood or what are we you were supposed to whether we favor it   well im not im not sure what what the people of Puerto Rico feel uh how do you feel about uh the possibility of Puerto Rico becoming a state   well see i have mixed feelings because um it it the with the financial situation i dont really quite understand what would happen there if they would be a burden to us or if they already are a burden so i i really what uh i really dont care you know i mean   yeah well i question whether its in their best interests to become a state right now they are a commonwealth and that means that they are under US protection in the event of uh defending their their country uh they do not have any voting privileges though and i dont believe they have any representation in Congress   yes that i think thats true so that makes them feel definitely like outsiders but like getting back to the their government benefits they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits   yeah i dont believe they have to pay any uh like federal tax uh   yeah so um also of course they they can they join the they can always join the military service they are considered citizens i believe   uh yeah i think they are they they do get uh privileges privileges like that   yeah they can   im not sure how much that uh carries on   yeah thats a strange situation you youre a citizen yet you cant vote   yeah   so so if   well i think weve got uh like a language barrier too i think most of the people there speak only Spanish im not sure how fluent they are in English and thats one of the major problems i i see with uh other countries as such being uh say the possibility of becoming states that we dont have a common language with them   yes i went i worked um i went there for a class in a factory and some of the people in my class couldnt speak fluent English they had a very difficult time with it and they and they couldnt the ones that could speak speak it had a really hard time reading it so   right i think wed have the same type of problem say with Mexico uh Canada on the other hand uh English is one of their national languages they have   yes as well as the the um the Quebec people that that speak French   yeah uhhuh   and theyre supposed   so i think theyre     theyre supposed to be bilingual   yeah   but um   i just see a lot of uh social and cultural differences that could uh pose problems with uh Puerto Rico becoming a state   yes what do you what do you um do you do you think they should become independent maybe or do you think they should  benefit   um i dont think theyre strong enough myself to become independent uh i think that its in their best interest right now just uh to remain as is keep the status quo and uh keep uh stay under the United United States protection   yeah i think if i was a middle class Puerto Rican maybe that that would be the um stablest thing to do   yeah because i think that if they if they tried for independence they would probably have uh   they would   military factions that would oppose each other and and they would vie for leadership and uh the people who are well off there the middle upper class if there is such a thing uh they would probably be at a disadvantage losing possibility of losing their uh their assets or wealth   yes so theyve been talking about this for a long time do you think theyre going to ever vote   uh   whether they want one one of the three choices   i dont see it in the near future   i know because i think ive been reading i read this ten years ago that they were having these big uh um rallies and people would be in the streets flashing signs statehood yes and other people would statehood down the statehood its it down there if youre um familiar with their politics they uh its very uh i i dont know its called Latino there they have loudspeakers on their cars and they run down the neighborhood saying vote for you know Pierre hes or uh Pedro uh Pedro hes the best its its really kind of comical     yeah well ive never been there im not quite familiar with with uh the way they do things   yeah these these people they have the big loudspeakers because they have uh democratic system just like ours where they elect their mayors and their councilmens its really kind of funny its its kind of an invasion of your privacy privacy too theyre going down these streets with these really loud speakers   uhhuh yeah oh i think that you know part of the biggest problem there is that they still really are third world country and they havent uh caught up uh economically with uh say the United States   yeah there theres some really poor areas where when i went  uh it it looked like it was it was always you couldnt if you didnt know the area they they didnt advise you to go out and uh you know go in the the uh poorer sections of town but the the big cities where the uh big hotels were that that was that was safe ground to walk around but uh particularly in San Juan we wanted to go walk on the beach at night and they looked at us like we were crazy   uhhuh   says no you cant go at night because uh we were we our business was on the other side of the island we were only in San Juan it was at night   okay   they dont want us go out on the beach you know said it was very dangerous   well did you have guides from the area or escorts or uh   um actually we um met met some people that were in the naval base down there   okay   and uh they didnt particularly like living down there because it was very foreign very different the the people they they didnt treat them nice they you know um so i think there i what i learned from them there was a lot of resentment towards the Americans   okay   so and it was like they were theyre Puerto Rican and were Americans   right   so thats why theyre so um emotional about about statehood yet like you say its they cant really support themselves so   yeah well theyve got that Latin blood they get fired up about every little thing anyway   yeah thats very true   i think one of the most interesting things about the possibility of uh attaining a fifty first state is what would we do about our flag how do you arrange fifty one stars         what kind of pattern does do we come up with for that   i dont know that thats a good one   could have a contest           yeah but the thing the thing that bothers me about it the most is they dont make decision they dont vote i i think if they voted that that as you say the um they they would probably stay commonwealth or that would be the best for them   well that would give them them more of an interest in what goes on in this country if if they had uh uh a a uh a privilege of voting uh that would give them a vested interest in the government and uh i would see that as as a positive uh thing for them to consider   yeah but as you say its two different two different cultures i dont i dont know um so uh you like i say i was reading this ten years ago whether they could theyre going to be talking about this in another ten years   probably   i dont see them doing anything   uh yeah i really dont see any change in the near future   so i dont know and its also a long way away         if you know if it was Cuba   well Cubas closer but uh   yes Cubas really close but uh Puerto Rica is uh is its like uh i live in Vermont from Vermont to Florida its another another uh what fourteen hundred miles across the ocean   right   but uh   that is a good distance   yeah and they have to they have to import a lot of their um cereals and things and and i dont understand now why they dont have a processing i guess it i uh they its just as easy to bring the uh cereal in boxes as it is to bring it in in you know bulk grain and produce it there   what is their major industry   uh i really dont know um   is it uh i i believe is it sugar cane or im not sure sure exactly what they do   it could be im sure they rely heavily on tourism and even the all the American companies down there with their uh electronics industries and pharmaceuticals are big down there   right okay   thats one thing i did notice uh pharmaceuticals electronics that makes up i mean enough to be like eight or ten percent of their business but um i really dont know agriculturally they could have so much and they and they dont they dont seem to uh i dont know if i heard they dont feed themselves or not i dont think they support themselves agriculturally i found that to be really odd   yeah im not very familiar with with the the state of their agriculture agriculture   you know well they see they cant grow the grains i mean theyre if the i guess their grains dont do well in the tropics so like you say they grow grow sugar beets and sugar cane and thats all export   right you have to question you have to wonder how much tillable land they have uh being an island   well yeah that is its mountainous and uh but it   uhhuh   it looks fertile and it it um i mean it rains enough they have the climate and the rain and if not its like ive been to Saint Thomas and it just starts from the ocean up   uhhuh   and its and its very its like one big rock but uh Puerto Rico has lots of uh   right   lots of uh mountainous region and coastal regions   yeah i know they must have a lot of tourism too but i dont see as much advertising there as you do in the Bahamas the say the Bahamas   yeah i dont know uh i it   with uh say uh uh Saint Thomas uh Virgin Islands uh places like that   thats very true i dont know if they just take it for granted that they you know its an American commonwealth they really dont have to advertise that much but that is an interesting point but i i believe its a very popular vacation destination   right well the Virgin Islands are an American territory   yep   and but you see a lot of advertising for that uh as far as uh vacation uh cruises and retirement
