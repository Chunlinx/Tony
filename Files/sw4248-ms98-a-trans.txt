        well this is something i just got back from working out yes um id spend about five or ten minutes stretching and then i i used to be just a walker i i was really into walking about three miles everyday and     oh did you   id go to the weight room and and and get in every part of my arms and work on legs   uhhuh   but now im training to run and i i fun run here in Tyler and its just two miles but um im up to running a mile so i walk real fast for two miles which takes me about thirty minutes   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and then ill run a mile and then ill cool down and feel like im going to die  but its a lot of fun for me its its a task when i dont feel like it   thats great yeah yeah thats true are you a member of a club or anything is that where you go lift weights are you a member of a club or   but most of the time its fun huh no um in college and the junior college im going to right now has a really good fitness center   uhhuh   and so they have a cardiovascular room where they have a Stairmaster   oh thats great uhhuh   and sometimes i do that i kind of got burned out on the Stairmaster and uh they have a real good weight room and i do a lot of free weights free weights more than machines i enjoy those more   yeah uhhuh oh huh ive been uh im more ive never seriously seriously lifted weights i wrestled in high school and i couldnt and they always made us and i hated it and stuff hadnt done it since but   uhhuh   uh now im just more of a recreational sport player i dont really do much exercising other than i play softball five or six nights a week and   uhhuh   uh some basketball but ive God ive never have since high school i dont think ive been on a serious or uh exercise program course it shows getting a little bit heavier  but uh i have a hard time going out and running though thats thats pretty difficult for me to do i dont know why but     yeah yeah yeah its its pretty difficult for me too but ive got one month to train for the two mile run im fixing to do     umhum uhhuh   and thats not very fun fun fun you know thats not very far to run and a month isnt very long and they call it a fun run i dont see how they can put fun and and run together   yeah yeah well are you are you doing it yeah yeah its true are you running for serious or you just running to kind of get through for the fun of it or do they   and im running to get in shape yeah im in im in really good shape now but uh ive only been seriously in a workout program since September   are you umhum umhum   so im knocking close on a year just to be you know mean you know almost but um im just i really i had a partner last semester in school that was into body building and hed been in it for about three years   yeah umhum oh   and so he really got me into lifting weights and i and i did that a lot for the first time i i got i went into a weight room in September  and it was real intimidating i was one of the only girls and uh that didnt help any   uhhuh uhhuh yeah ill bet   no   but uh i got started into that and i ended up gaining uh almost ten pounds from muscle   oh really just in muscle though   just in muscle well i i had a bigger appetite too so no i actually i lost size   yeah uhhuh   but i gained in weight you know because of muscle but now im trying to to get rid of some of the bulkiness   yeah yeah   and my arms got quite a bit bigger and i i didnt really want them to get that much bigger so now im  im doing they say to define your muscles   yeah   umhum   you do a lot less weight and a lot of repetition so thats what im working on now   yeah so how often you go and lift then do you do it daily or   well um i go Monday through Friday i walk and run but um   umhum   yesterday i wasnt feeling good so i missed Monday and im out of town on Friday  so im going to have to go on Saturday so ill at least get four days in   yeah uhhuh yeah well thats great yeah i im trying to like i said i play softball of course not in the winter up here but uh i usually do something for about two months just to get me in shape for that i do a lot of situps and pushups but   but uh uhhuh uhhuh   i still like i say the running and ive weve been meaning to buy some mountain bikes i hard part for about me for running is just i dont   ooh   you see the same thing you never go far enough to see anything really different and i like the change of scenery and stuff so thats why i was thinking of my wife and i about getting a bike for each of us and then you know we you can go     right yeah do you live in the mountains   uh we live right close by them we i live right at the base of the Wasatch mountains here and so i close enough that we theres trails and everything all of the way around and that we can go up and use and we go camping quite a bit and we take them with us you know we take them with us there so   oh uhhuh uhhuh   theres a lot of area we can go in up around there i have just one little daughter   do you have any kids oh my goodness   you know and actually thats my exercise now just trying to keep up with an eighteen month old thats more than enough so   eighteen months   yeah shes well she learned to walk about six months ago and she hasnt stopped she  she just ongoing so we chase her around the house all the time so           its uh   you get a little of exercise in on that   oh yeah we do believe me theres nothing like having a kid to chase thatll  do it for you   well im going to wait a long time till that happens im im ill be twenty May sixth and im just going to get through college and hopefully move to some different states   yeah uhhuh good idea uhhuh   and stay single for a while  but in the mean time im im trying to stay in shape and i i love to play racquetball   not a bad idea yeah
