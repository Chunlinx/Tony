                    Introduction        Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE MIM    is        an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of        autoantibodies with specificity for a wide range of        selfantigens These antibodies cause disease directly by        binding to target tissues eg platelets and        phospholipids and indirectly by depositing immune        complexes in vascular tissues leading to organ damage          The current evidence suggests that SLE is a complex        genetic disease with contributions from both environmental        eg ultraviolet light viral infections and genetic        factors        A number of recent genomewide screens support the        genetic hypothesis in human SLE and have reported in        aggregate  potential susceptibility loci              reviewed   Of these intervals significant        attention has been directed at the q chromosomal        region After the identification of the syntenic region in        mouse          Sle  as a susceptibility interval        for murine SLE   a targeted study by Tsao         et al   was the first to        implicate this locus in human SLE marker DS         P  Subsequently two        independent SLE genome scans also found suggestive evidence        for linkage at q     Poly ADP ribosyl        polymerase PARP also referred to as ADPRT adenosine        diphosphate ribosyltransferase was initially suggested as        the relevant candidate gene in the region    but        that finding was not reproduced in other family collections                 The work of Moser         et al   provided the initial        evidence that the susceptibility locus in this region might        lie centromeric of PARP In  multiplex SLE pedigrees        the best evidence for linkage was at DS with the        greatest extent of allele sharing in the white families at        the DS marker The data reported here confirm the        evidence for genetic linkage at q in  SLE sibpair        families families with a pair of affected sibs from the        Minnesota collection    Furthermore we report new        evidence for transmission disequilibrium of both single        marker alleles and short marker haplotypes from the q        interval in  trio families families with a single        affected offspring and both parents and in the total        dataset of  SLE families These data suggest that a        human SLE susceptibility locus is located centromeric to        PARP near the DS marker                    Materials and methods                  SLE family collection          The collection of  affected sibpair families in          Cohorts  and  of the Minnesota collection have been          described in detail elsewhere    An additional          group of  sibpair families was collected and members          were genotyped for the  markers in the q region          One hundred and twentytwo trio families were also          collected This study was approved by the Human Subjects          Review Board at the Mayo Clinic and at the University of          Minnesota The clinical features of the sibpair and trio          families are provided in the Supplementary material                          Samples and genotyping          Genomic DNA isolation and genotyping of families was          performed as described    The  markers from the          q region originally typed by Moser           et al   were typed in the          Minnesota collection Marker order Fig  was          determined using the public databases described in the          Supplementary material                          Data analysis          See Supplementary material for details of linkage          analysis and transmission disequilibrium testing                            Results                  Genetic linkage in the q region          In the combined data from the original Cohorts  and           genome screens the highest LOD score in the q          region was  at marker DS   With the addition          of five new finemap markers and  new families the          best evidence for linkage was slightly reduced LOD            and shifted telomeric to marker DS Fig           This level of linkage support corresponds roughly to a          nominal           P value of  When only white          families were considered the peak multipoint LOD score          remained at marker DS LOD   Fig                           Transmission disequilibrium in the q          region          The standard transmission disequilibrium test TDT            applied to the data for a single marker allele          failed to identify significant transmission          disequilibrium Fig  Analyses with the CTDT the TDT          combined with the discordant sib TDT STDT which          allows additional families containing discordant sibs to          be evaluated for disequilibrium   were then          performed Among the  families with discordant siblings          but missing parental information several microsatellite          alleles in the q region demonstrated significant          evidence of transmission disequilibrium Fig  Markers          DSallele             P   DSallele             P   and DSallele             P   showed the strongest          evidence for disequilibrium using the CTDT          The TDT and CTDT are limited by the fact that only          one triad or discordant sibship is analyzed from a given          family thus these two tests examine only a subset of the          data from general pedigrees The pedigree disequilibrium          test PDT improves upon these two tests by generating a          measure of linkage disequilibrium for every discordant          sibship and triad in a pedigree   Because it          examines the entire data set the PDT can result in much          higher power than the other two tests   The version          of the PDT used in this analysis has been modified to          accept dyads a single typed parent and an affected          offspring A dyad is informative only when the offspring          has a heterozygous genotype different from that of the          parent thus avoiding the bias of using inferred phase          assignments    Using the PDT three single marker          alleles of DS exhibited evidence of transmission          disequilibrium Fig  Consistent with the CTDT          results DSallele  yielded the strongest PDT result                     P                            Transmission disequilibrium of marker haplotypes in          the q region          Two and threemarker haplotypes from the q          region were next tested for evidence of transmission          disequilibrium Fig  Haplotype clusters were          generated for exact match haplotypes with more than           founders Analysis of two and threemarker haplotypes          revealed that haplotypes from DS to DS had the          greatest number of transmissions and yielded the most          significant           P values with the majority of the          significant haplotypes centered on DS The twomarker          haplotypes DSallele DSallele           DSallele DSallele  and DSallele          DSallele  were significant in the TDT CTDT          and PDT The DSallele DSallele  and          DSallele DSallele  haplotypes had            and   transmittednontransmitted ratios          TNT respectively          Using threemarker haplotypes the strongest evidence          for disequilibrium was in the region spanning the markers          DS to DS Notably the DSallele           DSallele DSallele  TNT    T and          the DSallele DSallele DSallele           TNT    T haplotypes yielded biallelic PDT           P values of                           Global multiallelic disequilibrium statistic          The PDT test also calculates a measure of the linkage          disequilibrium for all the alleles of a given marker in          the form of a global multiallelic           P value Using this statistic the           markers of q fine map were tested for global          transmission disequilibrium Fig  Importantly two          markers in the q region reach the  level of          significance in the data set from the  SLE families          DS results in a global           P value of  which appeared to          be largely driven by the contribution of families in the          trio collection            P   DS showed the most          significant result using this test            P   with both the sibpair          and trio collections contributing to the linkage          disequilibrium observed Significant results for this          global disequilibrium statistic were not observed for any          other markers in the q region including ADPRT          PARP Two and threemarker haplotype analysis with the          global PDT identified only one significant result The          DSDS window yielded a PDT global           P value of                             Discussion        The localization of genes in complex genetic diseases is        a challenging proposition given that these disorders are        likely to show significant locus heterogeneity genetic        epistasis and incomplete penetrance as well as        environmental effects In SLE all the available evidence        points to a similarly complex genetic etiology with six        recent genetic linkage studies implicating as many as         genetic loci        While some of the loci        identified are likely to be false positives or relatively        minor genes enriched in one population or another the        locus at q is unique in that it has provided a        significant though modest linkage signal in three        independent SLE populations              Finemapping in the q region by Moser         et al   also showed that the        highest overall LOD score in  families of the Oklahoma        collection was at DS and the greatest degree of allele        sharing in  white families was at DS DS also        showed the strongest evidence for linkage in the UCLA        collection   and was the best marker in genome screens        performed on the Minnesota family collection    Thus        the evidence for linkage at q is reproducible in        independent collections using the identical markers        To detect association with SLE we used the transmission        disequilibrium test TDT as well as two additional tests        the CTDT and the PDT The PDT is the strongest test of        association because of its ability to maximize the        information extracted from complex pedigrees Importantly        marker DS in the q region was significant on the        multiallelic PDT Fig  Supporting the global finding        the CTDT and PDT tests also identified evidence for        transmission disequilibrium with several alleles from        DS and nearby markers Fig  Marker DS in the        q region also demonstrated significant transmission        disequilibrium particularly in the trio collection Fig                We sought to confirm and expand upon the results of the        singlemarker tests by examining haplotypes from the        q region for the presence of transmission        disequilibrium Haplotypebased association methods may be        more powerful than singlemarker tests     For        example the same microsatellite allele ie same size        microsatellite repeat may be present on a number of        haplotypes some of which may not be associated with        disease Indeed haplotypebased association methods        employing a dense map of markers have been used to localize        genetic effects to small segments of chromosomes               The knowledge of marker order and        intermarker distances in the q region allowed the        generation of haplotypes with unambiguously determined        phase in our large collection of SLE families The        DSDS twomarker haplotype window in the q        region showed evidence for transmission disequilibrium via        the global PDT while no other windows showed evidence of        association using this multiallelic test However several        individual two and threemarker haplotypes from the q        and q region showed significant transmission        disequilibrium Fig  These haplotype results should be        viewed with some caution since they are uncorrected for        the multiple allele combinations tested and the        possibility of Type I errors may be increased        At present the most interesting candidate gene in the        region showing the strongest evidence for disequilibrium is        the estrogenrelated receptor gamma ESRRG This gene is        found on the same contig as DS NT and is an        orphan receptor within the steroid hormone receptor        superfamily It is expressed in lymphocytes and other        tissues and is an interesting candidate given the        suspected role of sex hormones in the pathophysiology of        both mouse and human lupus    Other genes in the        region include those for the cathelicidin antimicrobial        peptide near DS an innate microbial defense peptide        expressed by the skin during inflammation MARK near        DS a serinethreonine protein kinase and at least        three uncharacterized genes        The data reported here provide some additional        perspective on the initial reports that PARP might be the        relevant gene in this locus The finding of significant        transmission distortion of marker alleles centromeric to        PARP in the Minnesota collection suggests the possibility        that the disequilibrium initially reported for PARP alleles        may be due to more extensive disequilibrium  to include        the PARP marker  in the families studied by Tsao and her        colleagues compared with other populations and groups of        families studied A dense mapping of this interval by all        the various groups and a pooling of data would help to        resolve this question It seems likely that as in the HLA        region   there will be a limited number of ancestral        haplotypes in the q region and that these ancestral        haplotypes will be identifiable by typing a dense map of        microsatellites This should facilitate the identification        of the responsible genes in the region                    Conclusions        The data reported here confirm the evidence for genetic        linkage at q in  SLE sibpair families from the        Minnesota collection Furthermore we report new evidence        for transmission disequilibrium of both single marker        alleles and short marker haplotypes from the q        interval in  trio families and in the total dataset of         SLE families These data suggest that a human SLE        susceptibility locus is located centromeric to PARP near        the DS marker                    Abbreviations        ADPRT  adenosine diphosphate

studied in          this report is summarized in Supplementary Table see          below Twentyfour additional families were included          beyond the families that comprised the original Minnesota          Cohorts  and   S S In addition a collection of           trio families one SLE patient with both parents was          assembled Demographics and selected clinical          characteristics of the affected individuals within the          sibpair and trio collections are presented in          Supplementary Table  The trio collection was highly          enriched for white families  compared with  in the          sibpair families Compared with patients from the          sibpair collection trio individuals were more likely to          be positive for antidsDNA antibody and to have evidence          of hematologic or renal disease Lower percentages of          trio patients had pleuritis skin involvement or CNS          lupus The differences in the clinical manifestations          observed may reflect the greater ethnic diversity within          the sibpair collection as well as potential differences          in familial compared with sporadic SLE

those families carrying threemarker haplotypes from          DS to DS that displayed at least a           transmissionnontransmission ratio see Fig in the          main text of this article Families with the q risk          haplotypes            n   demonstrated a multipoint          LOD score of  at DS while the remainder of the          family collection            n   showed a LOD score at          DS of  Thus SLE families carrying the risk          marker haplotypes with the strongest evidence for          transmission disequilibrium were also the families that          accounted for most of the evidence for linkage in the          q region                          Localization of the q effect through haplotype          analysis          The two most significant threemarker haplotypes          identified in the movingwindow analysis were          DSallele DSallele DSallele  and          DSallele DSallele DSallele           Interestingly none of the  individuals who carried one          of these two haplotypes contained both of these on a          further extended haplotype Furthermore  of           patients with the  haplotype  also bore          allele  of DS while  of  individuals with the           haplotype also bore allele  of DS          This suggests the possibility that the major effect in          this region is between markers DS and DS an          interval of approximately  megabasepairs          Alternatively there might be two effects in the region          each carried on one of the haplotypes The twomarker          haplotype data provide some support for the former          interpretation since the peak number of significant          haplotype transmissions is found within the          DSDS interval with the number of events          falling off at surrounding windows Although the current          evidence for linkage disequilibrium at q extends over          quite a broad interval it is important to note that the          marker density in the current study is still rather          sparse Efforts to further localize the gene in this          region will require the identification and typing of          additional microsatellite markers and single nucleotide          polymorphisms SNPs in a large cohort of SLE cases and          controls
