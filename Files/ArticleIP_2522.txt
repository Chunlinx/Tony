epidemic of addicted gamblers but a recent studyby researchers at Harvard Medical Schools Division on Addictions arguesagainst this notion An estimated  percent of American adults will

noted in a study by University of Maryland Professor PeterReuter homicides barely increased at all despite the influx of outsiders andassaults rose only about as fast as the average daily population The realincreases have come in robbery and aggravated assaults Elsewhere though itsimpossible to detect any consistent relationship between the existence ofcasinos and the prevalence of lawlessness Jeremy Margolis who headed theIllinois State Police when the state introduced  riverboat casinos hastestified that crime has not been a problem Looking at rural Colorado TexasAM scholar Patricia

normally extol anything that allows consumers tosatisfy their preferences but several members of the profession depict casinosas the enemy of prosperity Earl Grinols of the University of Illinoisexcoriates them as a shell game attracting dollars from one persons pocketto another and from one region to another Another view holds that life forthe casinos means death for restaurants car dealers hardware stores andother wholesome businesses unless legal gambling attracts massive numbers ofnew tourists            But theseare the wrong measures of the economic value of gambling establishmentsExisting businesses are threatened when a new business comes to town whetherits Nordstrom or a shoe repair shop No economist with ambitions for tenurewould dream of dismissing a business

according to the ultrafastidiousCenter for Responsive Politics            Casino owners are right totake a greaterthanaverage interest in the workings of government  Untilrecently their industry was illegal almost everywhere  They cannot operatewithout hardtoget government licenses  Their many enemies want tolegislate them out of existence            As longas were talking about corruption and exploitation we should not forget thatthe wickedest gambling sharpies dont live in Las Vegas but in the statecapitals where the lotteries are headquartered The lotteries pitifulpayoutabout half of all

onthese games and let the market compete away the excess profits                           Whose Life Is It Anyway Gamblingsopponents never tire of reciting statistics and anecdotes to suggest that thecosts of legalized gambling dwarf any possible benefits But they fail to countthe central benefitthe diversion and pleasure it provides to millions ofpeople Until  casinos were accessible only to people with the means totravel to Las Vegas The relaxation of prohibitionist laws has brought themwithin easy reach of most of the American public and the public has voted forthem with its feet The overwhelming majority of these patrons gambleresponsibly and impose no burden on their fellow citizens They treat games ofchance as exactly thatgames            Yet critics insist onportraying gamblers as a pitiable class of suckers enslaved by fantasies ofunearned wealth Its hard to see why No one accuses movie theaters orgardeningsupply outlets of ruthlessly exploiting the weaknesses of clients whoturn over their money only because they lack the selfcontrol to refuse Mostpeople who patronize the lottery the track or the slot machines end uppoorer with nothing to show for the transactionwhich is also true of peoplewho eat in restaurants and attend concerts To incurable bluenoses gambling isan infuriating scam But why assume gamblers are being fooled Its morereasonable to assume that they know they will probably lose but are happy totake that chance for  the pleasure of playing and  the chance of coming outahead            In the end thats a decisionthey ought to be free to make unimpeded by moralists and social reformers whothink ordinary people cannot be trusted to look after their own interests Ifgambling were the grim scourge portrayed by its opponents it would not havegone from a contemptible vice to an innocent diversion in a single generationPeople who have visited casinos and played the lottery have seen that miseryand damnation dont necessarily follow either for themselves or forsurrounding communities Gambling has become a widespread pastime for thesimple and unassailable reason that it adds to the sum of human happinessThats reason enough to leave it alone
