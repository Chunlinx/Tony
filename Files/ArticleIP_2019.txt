                                 Jesse Helms Poison Gas            Since Jesse Helms becamechairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in  many of hismissteps have been harmless even amusing Who among us didnt chuckle when heintroduced the prime minister of Pakistan to the Senate as the distinguishedprime minister of India But now comes the horrifying prospect that Helmscould actually play an important role in world history The Chemical WeaponsConvention signed by roughly the entire civilized world awaits Senateratification and is bottled up in Helms committee            Accordingto Helms the CWC has two large defects First the treatys verification ruleswould violate US sovereignty allowing foreign inspectors to swoop down on afactory without probable cause without a search warrant and interrogateemployees remove documents and so on Second the treaty isnt toughenough to reliably sniff out chemical weapons Hard man to please            Lets leave aside Helms factual errors hes about thesearch warrants and look at his basic paradox that the treaty is too toughyet not tough enough This is not logically impossible Chemical weapons couldin theory be so elusive that even a sovereigntycrushing inspection regimecouldnt find them But if thats Helms view then he is opposed not just tothis CWC but to the very idea of such a convention Why doesnt he justadmit it            In anyevent the second half of Helms paradox is the claim now being emphasized byhis allies in their crusade against the CWC Via radio TV and oped pageswere being told that the treaty is not verifiable In a sense this is trueThe convention will definitely not succeed in sniffing out all chemical weaponseverywhere But it will definitely do a better job than is being doneor notdonenow Given this upside the question becomes Whats the downside Helmsand his allies offer five downsides all of which vaporize underinspection             Huge regulatory burden Opponents ofthe treaty initially exercised the basic Republican reflex of complaining aboutthe cost to US business Its true that US chemical manufacturers will haveto fill out some forms But if the United States doesnt join thetreaty these same manufacturers lose sales to nations that do join Thats onereason the Chemical Manufacturers Association heartily supports the treaty             Mediumsizedregulatory burden Faced with the big chemical companies support of thetreaty opponents tried arguing that Americas small businesses wouldbear an unwarranted burden Helms resoundingly declared on the Senate floorthat the National Federation of Independent Business opposes the treatyUnfortunately an NFIB spokesman then pointed out that this isnt true It isour belief the spokesman told the Wall Street Journal  that ourmembers are not going to be impacted by the treaty             Our men inuniform Some treaty opponents argue that if the United States destroys itschemical weapons it will have surrendered a vital deterrent to chemicalattacks But you dont need chemical weapons to deter chemical weapons AsLeonard Cole author of The Eleventh Plague  has observed SaddamHussein refrained from using his vast chemical stockpile during the PersianGulf War not because he feared retaliation in kind  but because hefeared retaliation of comparable or greater magnitude  Gen NormanSchwarzkopf who has retired and thus neednt toe the administrations linesupports the CWC Even before the treaty the United States had decided todestroy its chemical arsenal deeming it a needless headache No one had evenbothered to complain about this until the treaty linked it to the dreaded NewWorld Order             Surrender ofsovereignty Part  In a USA Today oped piece Helms asserted thatthe treaty would require that the US assist Cuba and Iran in modernizingtheir chemicalweapons facilities That would be strange wouldnt it Atreaty expressly devoted to eliminating chemical weapons obliges members tohelp build them This claim is based on of a somewhat opaque section of thetreaty and is widely considered ridiculous            Triumph of the rogues Helms North Korea Libya Iraq and Syriaallprincipal sponsors of terrorism and repositories of chemical weaponsare notsignatories and wont be affected Well its true that these nations arentsignatories though most suspected chemicalweapons possessors including Chinaand Iran are But its quite false to say that they wont be affected Infact they will be shut out of the market for many chemicals including dualuse chemicals that are ingredients of both nerve gas and things like ink Thisis part of the innovative genius of the CWC permanent economic sanctionsagainst nonmembers            Right now about two dozen countries are suspected ofpursuing chemicalweapons programs and they do so with impunity After thetreaty they will fall into one of two camps  those that suffer economicsanctions and a clearcut stigma and  those that have agreed to allowshortnotice inspections of any suspicious site in their territory Thats notprogress            Its truethat once an inspection is demanded Iran for example can stall Though thenational government must escort inspectors to the perimeter of the suspectedsite it can then argue that the search violates its constitution or whateverIf this national prerogative werent preserved Helms and company would be thefirst to object Such a standoff when it occurs will trigger a global mediaevent with CNN broadcasting satellite shots of the suspected facility every minutes and so on If this drags on for too long and Iran say seemsinexcusably obstinate it can be judged noncompliant by a vote of conventionmembers and sanctioned accordingly            All told the treaty is so much tougher thananything in the history of global arms control that to call it an importantevolutionary step borders on understatement And it comes just in time becausetechnology for making biological weapons is spreading What you may ask isthe key difference between chemical and biological weapons Oh about a millioncorpses Industrious CWarmed terrorists could kill thousands of New Yorksubway riders in a day Industrious BWarmed terrorists could more or less doManhattan in the same time Right now there is nothing approaching aninternational regime for keeping biological weapons out of the hands ofterrorists If there is ever to be one it will have to resemble this treaty atleast broadly surprise inspections of suspicious sites the economic and moralostracism of nations that dont cooperate etc            Will this approach work Wedont know It depends on such questions as  how effectively theindustrialized nations can monitor the average rogue state once they startsynergistically pooling their intelligence and  how tough economic sanctionshave to be before even the Syrias of the world fall into line Its much betterto answer these questions now with chemical weapons than  years from nowwith biological weapons            The basic flow of worldhistory as Im not the first to note is toward interdependence Increasinglythe worlds nations face common problems soluble only through concerted effortThis often involves some marginal sacrifice of sovereignty an agreement byeach nation to constrain its future behavior so long as others do andsystematic deference to international judgment You see this logic at work inenvironmental issues the Rio accords now being toughened economic issuesthe World Trade Organization growing in importance and other areas Theproliferation of chemical and biological weapons is a paradigmatic problem ofthe future and the CWC is a paradigmatic if imperfect solution Jesse Helmsis a paradigmatic relic
