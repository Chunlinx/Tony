                well the topics about government um  im not altogether sure that thats my best topic um   i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and um how many people are selfserving   yeah umhum   i mean that you i i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt  and that people arent selfserving   umhum uhhuh umhum   i mean thats what i would like to think   yeah i i i think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting um  about um uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal   umhum   uh because it it it seems to me that when  uh government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that  you have to have so many explicit ethical codes um parallel to the legal codes  that uh were focusing on the wrong thing  maybe   umhum umhum yeah   maybe maybe thats what is happening maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past  you know ten to twenty years that uh   right   it becomes more evident perhaps things that we didnt think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know etcetera like that  and we   umhum   were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons and i couldnt help thinking when that last question it was a funny question  when that last part of the question came about how how many   umhum umhum   things can we um actually put a legal code on  that um uh how how much um   umhum   should it be our  uh prerogative to see into the private lives of these people you know um   yeah yeah that makes sense because you pry start prying in peoples private lives you ruin their lives as well as and sometimes you know i dont even know how much of a difference it really makes you know i mean i guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past but uh   thats right yeah umhum   sometimes i dont know it i think it gets in the way of the better judgement i mean just because he did something in his past doesnt mean hes not a good enough person to be a politician   umhum i i i agree with that and  um and also that if the  results that they are putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is whats   umhum   you know going to the public  then um   umhum   then theyll pay for their private life in their own private conscience  and uh uh you know when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous   thats right umhum yeah   the the thats thats the thing that  um it it things that   umhum   you dont know uh do do do not worm their way around then and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray people could say oh they do it so  i guess you know but as soon as things do get public   umhum yeah umhum   um there there is that terrible concern so sometimes i ask myself what are  um people doing that are in the media   umhum   when somebody you know comes up to office it seems that one of the first thing thats done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines   umhum oh yeah  its i guess its what sells newspapers you know   its a very low way of living um so and and and and as far as um   um umhum umhum umhum   you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it im not terribly involved in it just in a very cursory way i vote and i  you know try to do whatever i can on a little local area but i i it it just is not one of the things that i have uh placed um   umhum right hm   and uh a lot of my particular time and effort into so i i always feel very   yeah   outside this kind of um  this kind of an issue but um um   umhum yeah im kind of the same way i just kind of read the paper followup on people i mean just you know keep an eye on whats going on but i dont really play an active role in any kind of politics   yeah umhum umhum yeah right yeah uh um umhum im not im not in there im not one of those uh you know volunteers thats there at headquarters and whatever um although i admire the people that do that and they certainly do get inside information and um of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing   umhum right umhum   the more you can trust their their judgment and their insight but the media insight as you said i just kind of read and   right umhum   kind of be aware and then uh i dont like to make a whole lot of um judgment my myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that uh   yeah yeah yeah
