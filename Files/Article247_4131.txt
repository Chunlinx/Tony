                                 Tommy Hilfiger Solos at the Met            Have you read the Brooklyn Museum article in the Times  is aquestion Culturebox overheard twice at the press preview of Rock Style anexhibition of rock n roll outfits at the Metropolitan Museum of Arts CostumeInstitute The show which opens Thursday is the boldest display of corporatemuscle and easy museological virtue to appear at a respected New York artinstitution in oh about two monthssince Sensation opened at the BrooklynMuseum Rock Style celebrates the influence of rock on fashion deploying tothat end an excess of media more often seen on the E channel than in publicmuseums videos a soundtrack floortoceiling photographs of musicians infull stage regalia that cover several ancient Egyptian frescoes The show wasbrought to you by Tommy Hilfiger USA the quasiofficial couturier to thehiphop generation That means that Hilfiger funded the show of course andalso that he served as its principal designer according to the press kitHis name is printed in large white letters on the cover of the catalog whichhe cowrote with Rolling Stone contributor Anthony DeCurtis            It was a nice coincidence that Rock Style should preview the same day thatthe New York Times laid out in sordid detail the kinds of compromisesmuseums make in pursuit of bigticket shows The article revealed that thedirector of the Brooklyn Museum Arnold Lehman granted the owner ofSensation s artworks Charles Saatchi an astonishing level of control overthe shows budget and layout that Saatchi is now claiming that money seeminglydonated was actually a loan and that Lehman probably lied to the press as wellas to potential donors about exactly how much money Saatchi had contributed andwhether Lehman had personally laid eyes on the Sensation show when it was inLondon            The Met is unlikely to suffer similar embarrassment since its directorPhilippe de Montebello inoculates himself against criticism by being moreopenly corrupt than Lehman Under Montebello it has become standard practiceto ask interested parties to sponsor and curate shows Christian Diorsubsidized a show of Dior couture Tiffany paid for a show of Tiffany bibelotsFaberg underwrote a show of Faberg eggs jewels and bricabrac for which aFaberg consultant was the guest curator Next to the Metropolitan theBrooklyn Museum looks like a bunch of amateurs Why bicker over artisticcontrol when you can just cede the hall to the sponsor            The justification offered by museum directors for shows that double ashighbrow advertisements is Hey get real thats the only way museums canafford to get expensive stuff inside its walls No museum except maybe theGetty has an endowment big enough to be free of the marketplace so all othermuseums have to retail products solicit corporations franchise themselvesGlenn Lowry the director of the Museum of Modern Art told a reporter a fewyears ago Its up to each institution to make sure that none of it affectsthe content of the exhibitions or the integrity of the museum In light ofthat excuse Culturebox thinks the following standards should be applied toRock Style and other shows of its ilk Does it add value above and beyondwhat youd find in a commercial for the sponsors product and does hosting itcompromise the integrity of the museum            In the case of Rock Style the answers to those questions are no and yesIt goes without saying though Culturebox will happily say it that the show isa Hilfiger commercial legitimating as art the marketing strategy embraced sosuccessfully by Hilfiger in the past few years which mainly consists ofturning rock musicians into fashion models Whats notable is that the showsexhibition strategy is essentially the samereducing rockers to clotheshorses and without adding an iota of critical perspective             The thesis advancedin Rock Style is that individual rockers had a transformative effect onfashion The evidence lies in their stage costumes Elvis Presleys gold lamsuit and the Beatles Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band outfits andJanis Joplins feathery ensembles and George Clintons outsize rabbitandfoxfur coat and David Bowies metallic clown suit and Madonnas peachcoloredconical bras and Becks cream cotton Nehru getup and Tori Amos Tori Amoslilac jumpsuit all looking suitably outrageous if somewhat wilted behindglass The whole glorious spectacle is thrilling to look at even absent theperformers For the categorically minded there is a nominal division ofstyles icons Elvis and the Beatles poets and dreamers Janis the ArtistFormerly Known as Prince Bruce Springsteen rebels Lou Reed Alice CooperCourtney Love and the categories of brilliant disguise Bowie Bono Bjrkand high style Cher Madonna Puff Daddy            But fun like this we could have watching old video clips on VH The Metafter all is supposed to be an educational institution So what do we learnfrom the show about the history or sociology or even the aesthetics of rockmusic or fashion Can we say that Janis Joplins and Jimi Hendrixs romanticthriftstore eclecticism created the late hippie look or emerged out of itDitto with Mick Jaggers and Bowies androgyny and the disco aesthetic of thelate s or Kiss heavymetal goofiness and punk What about rock itselfHow did it change once music videos made a bands appearance more importantthan its sound            There are no answers because Rock Style s wall captions are stunninglyfatuous The concept of the rock artist as poeteven visionaryendures andmany performers uphold the tradition in their music and dress reads a typicalone The wall commentary at Costume Institute which was overseen by fashionhistorian Richard Martin until his death last month has not always been thisinsipid The bubbleheadedness in this show surely reflects Hilfigers inputThe videos etc are no help either The book exhibits a modicum of historicalconsciousness its broken up into periods at least But it is also stuffedwith Hilfigers personal reminiscences about serving as designer to the starswhich are as presumptuous as they are empty Making clothes for KeithRichards is easy because he knows exactly what he wants            In the end all we have to go on are the costumes themselves Thats plentyof courseCulturebox would never discourage you from going anywhere to seeMichael Stipes grayblue sheer organza suit a beautiful embodiment ofandrogynous glamour or the wholly deconstructed Edwardian getup JeanPaulGaultier designed for Madonna with its exuberant bursts of taffeta twill andsatin as well as an overthetop silk top hat Its hard to keep in ones mindjust how outthere David Bowie once was so its instructive to see his blackquilted jumpsuit from the mid s the thighs of which are so exaggeratedthey form a perfect vertical disc then taper in neatly at the knees Get thebookwhich Culturebox forgot to mention is very snazzily designedand giveit to the most rockandfashionconscious teenagers you know Just dontexpect it to add to their ability to analyze the activity theyre soobsessively devoted to Those insights will have to wait for a less
