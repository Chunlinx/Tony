        okay where have you been on vacation lately   um well the last vacation i went was to Cozumel and that was last uh March and April   oh yeah have you got another one planned   not at this point   um   although if we take another vacation i think we might like to go to Cancun this time have you been there   yeah yeah we went there well actually i went there before i got married i havent been back with Kyle yet but  he is very much wanting to go there and since i have some free tickets with some frequent flyer stuff thats where he wants to go but um also since my parents my inlaws just moved to Utah were kind of pressured to go up there and go snow skiing and ive never been snow skiing so im not really into that i would rather do the beach scene   i agree i mean if im going to go on vacation i want to lay out in the sun and relax   yeah   drink  tropical drinks   definitely do that   and someplace id like to go is like to the other side of the Caribbean as you you know as opposed to the Mexican side i want drink rum drinks and uh   oh really   lay on those beaches over there   like in the in the Virgin Islands   that sounds good another place that i heard is really pretty is uh the Cayman Islands   oh yeah   although i hear theyre expensive   yeah thats definitely true well i got a magazine the other day called Caribbean Life and it had um different charter boats in there where like three couples could could charter a boat and have a crew and everything but um you just pretty much go wherever you want to go and they had great summer rates so like if you do it before September or October or something like that you really save a ton of money and i would love to do that   well our tenth anniversary is coming up in October uhhuh yeah and uh   oh really i didnt know that   id like to you even if we just get away for three or four days i think it would be kind of neat   yeah   just to do something originally a couple years ago we were hoping to do a trip to Greece   um   but uh i dont think thats going to be possible now   um thatd be fun   now that is probably the number one place on earth that i would like to go umhum   really wow well all the pictures ive ever seen of it has just been gorgeous but i dont know i think i think id theres other places that i would rather go first i think maybe   like where   um Australia and down in there i mean the the pictures ive seen of that even um oh i had a  when i was in school i had a nun that was from um oh i cant even think of the island now but she told us just wonderful stories of the island and and the pictures she showed us and all that i cant think of the place now its a pretty big one oh Venezuela   i dont think thats an island but thats okay     well uh i wherever she wherever she was she was out you know on the edge but anyway she uh had some great pictures and i always thought that would be fun to go there and they have great beaches too   well the main place that Nick would like to go is uh Rio   yeah oh really yeah   umhum hes been talking about that for years   hey that would be fun yeah when i was little i always heard how romantic Rio was but i would like to go to Tahiti too thatd be fun but even just like in the States it was fun when we went to Mackinac Island that was pretty cool   thats uh up in Michigan yeah we talked about doing one of those drive around trips you know you drive around   yeah   i guess Lake Michigan and then you take the ferry over to the other side and umhum   oh really huh   but id only want to do that in the summer   yeah because it i was there at the end of July and it was still pretty cool so yeah im not not a cold weather person at all   no neither am i     well um um um i think that uh once we get the house refinanced were going to probably try to take our free tickets and either go to Cancun or do the little uh trip to California Southern California and then on up to Utah so i dont know well see   well Nick just got back from San Diego last night and he said it was absolutely gorgeous and i havent been there since i guess it was seventy three   oh really uh   and uh id love to go back that was just one of the prettiest places on earth i have ever seen   yeah i think im going to uh work in a business trip and go to San Diego   how do you work in a business trip           youll have to ask Bill how my business trips work   they work very well  and i have definitely needed a business trip lately   uhhuh uhhuh         well since you already set up the office out in Southern California theres nothing left for me   well thats true hadnt thought about that   and it doesnt appear were going to be opening any new offices   well they could get really big though and hire a secretary and then you could have to go train   thatd be all right   yeah tell them to do that   i guess were straying from the uh the vacation part of it   yes   but i mean a trip is a trip     thats right ill go anywhere   so oh i would too in a drop of a hat fortunately we arent tied down with uh any other little two legged responsibilities we can go   umhum you can do that yeah   yeah makes makes a big difference   as a matter of fact i was offered a free ticket air ticket today if i want one   well take it   well eventually i might but Archie offered me a ticket umhum   oh really well good   and uh i thought wed you know i wouldnt want to just take it but he has American and a couple of other ones and he said they just go to waste   uhhuh   and i Nicks going to New Orleans in January i think next year i havent been there for so long   ooh i love New Orleans oh yeah such good food   and drinks   oh yeah  well and even just to go sit in the bars and listen to the jazz thats so much fun oh yeah   yeah or watch the people or the hookers go up and down the street   oh God yeah thats the first time i ever saw an actual transvestite i think was in New Orleans     oh i saw them in uh San Diego i went to a shore a show you know one of those transvestite shows   really oh yeah yeah   that was something     well i guess ill go take my shower ive been working out so ill do that   okay   well ill talk to you later   okay now do you push the buttons now      no we just hang up   okay talk to you later bye   okay bye
