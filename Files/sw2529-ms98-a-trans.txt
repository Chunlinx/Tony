          um she asked if i i guess they went ahead and told you were supposed to be talking about uh drug testing and what do we think about the policy of most companies and government agencies and of course thats something were familiar with   right       um   you want to go ahead or   okay go ahead no no go ahead   um personally it was something that uh i mean i know it presents an emotional issue moral issue people feel like maybe my rights are being violated but i work in human resources so i work with a lot of folks that um are in accidents or where safety considerations are concerned and   okay yeah   i really feel like that TIs decision to go with drug testing was good you know because i i feel like that you know well all all it takes is one person coming to work under the influence of some narcotic um truly injure a lot more of our workers   yeah and thats thats funny youre in human resources and im in uh health and safety   are you   yes um       i think its a good idea i i i dont think that theyve gone far enough though i think they should they should uh also test for alcohol   well now the thing you you know course theyve always said separately that um you know we have a we have a policy on alcohol course if anybodys under the uh influence or if you have reasonable suspicion then that would result in corrective action for them also and that of course has been in place for years   right but   but its not specifically tested for that   yeah   yeah   no and and from everything that i can gather you know reading different articles and and just a newspaper in general uh       uh news on the um television it seems that alcohol is the is the most prevalent um addictive addictive drug   yeah   even though the all the college campuses now the theyre saying that the majority of of uh students uh drink   umhum   and most of them are partying       but yet we dont test for that and i wonder if we dont do that because it is so prevalent and would put probably lose a quarter of all our population here   how long does alcohol stay in the system i mean like if somebody went out and had some drinks the night before is that going to be there the next day     well they say your system a normal a normal person       should be able to metabolize an ounce of alcohol per hour   okay   and then again it it depends depends on the the bigger you are and you know the more bulk that you have you you can your system can tolerate more alcohol so a large person can probably um metabolize maybe a little bit more   uhhuh   than a smaller person       but even that yeah if you go out you know because some people go out maybe   oh you know they drink up a gallon   yeah they do   um whats whats the uh consensus down there when when uh TI announced that uh the drug testing program did you get a lot of uh animosity against that   we had i didnt get a lot no not like i expected um we had you know one or two that were extremely outspoken you know felt like it really violated their rights and and um and it was not the people that i would have expected um its uh one of them stands out in my mind as an extremely uh just a super person in management you know and hes hes very family oriented his familys very close he he also opposes in the schools like for his kids because he says you know we are a good Christian family we do not do this type of thing it definitely violates our rights and he was very outspoken   yeah   but for the most part people were like well i dont like it uh its not something i prefer to do but i understand the reasoning and i think part of the attitude is that i think TI went to really great lengths in communicating and tried to prepare them and and tell them why and you know they didnt just announce it without really any forethought   yes no thats youre right yeah   and uh i i think they dont go far enough uh kind of on a different vein and that is that i think every time we have any type of industrial accident at TI i think somebody ought to be tested immediately and you know maybe thats just me personally but i i feel like   sure thats an idea too i just uh   you know i i feel like if something happens uh that causes an accident you ought to test the parties involved immediately just just if if nothing else to rule it out   yeah thats a thats a thought um i dont know if you can go   um   depends on the severity of the accident i think you know if you get like up here because weve got heavy industry weve got you know uh uh smelting plant and weve got a   yeah   weve got a lot of uh metals rolling and slitting and stuff like that so weve got a lot of we are we end up with a lot of uh hand injuries you know cuts and things like that but perhaps um   yes   if you could weed out those the people that have chronic accidents and test those you know thats a start   uhhuh   and thats a good idea thats a good point   i guess what makes me think of that you know uh you hear them doing that like its a or like Amtrak you know if if they have a derailment or or transportation industry it seems like if theres accidents train accidents things like that they test and i think well why not because we do have some large industrial accidents sometimes   yes   uh you know if you have a large acid spill you know well gee maybe you better check this person whos handling all these acids you know i work with a wafer fab so we do a lot with chemicals and acids and   oh okay yeah   uh things like that but i i do feel like companies are justified and i do feel like i i mean i i guess i hate as an individual that anything like this has ever become necessary in our you know in our nation but but i feel like that its a good thing to do   well i can see transportation because now youre dealing with or they have the responsibility over a great number of people   thats true   rather than themselves um but but thinking on that yeah because weve got weve got truck drivers here that go between plants you know locally   umhum   and carry material and they carry acids and things too   sure   um i dont know what the what the uh company plant is they went through i guess key personnel first   uhhuh   and then it funneled down to uh the general population   uhhuh now that started in January of last year   but i wonder if yeah and i i still havent been called yet in fact yeah in fact out of our office staff is lets see theres uh four six theres seven of us and theres only one been called   is that right well ive been lucky ive been called twice       well i   oh oh i i should probably shouldnt be talking to you then right   no i had to test once um when they did the key personnel they test all human resource folks and so i i i was once there and then in the general random sampling last year i was i contacted   okay and then you just got lucky again right   yeah and that you know i have that same uneasy feeling that other folks have you know i know i  i mean i dont drink i dont smoke i dont do nothing   yeah yeah i used to smoke years ago but i dont now   you know but you still walk in there and go gee what if something i ate what if something ive done what if something ive eaten shows up   well its not only that but ive read different articles and they said even the even the best of labs they come back with erroneous samples and even if they get a a reading i guess they test the same sample again     umhum yeah   and theyre going to get the same reading suppose they uh you know its a do they crucify you right then and there or do they do they go back and retest   well now if the lab is making an error on the sample then when they retest the error should not be there uh   but they retest the same sample   yeah but the error is on the part of the lab not on the sample in other words if somebody makes a mistake in what theyre reading then theyre not going to get the same reading the second time   oh i see oh okay but if they do then youre youre pretty well   if they do then you have you always have the recourse um you know before we do anything we sit down and talk with the person about is there any reason why this should have shown up and a lot of times you know uh   condemned right to be retested   theyll go oh yeah i was on a prescription for this and they can go get it and bring it in   yeah   you know in which case theyre fine obviously those are recorded as negatives if youre under you know legal qualified medical care um   yeah but i often wondered wondered about that too   if if were talking marijuana if its in the system uh then   yeah   yeah you know that would be grounds for uh if its their second positive it would be grounds for termination if its their first positive then theyre setup with E A P counseling   do you know of any incidences of of of uh erroneous   uh weve had a couple   you know something they they make a mistake the lab made a mistake and it really wasnt nothing   no no in fact see TI actually sends uh test samples from time to time uh   oh just to see just just to check on a lab   just to check the validity of the lab yeah and uh so thats kind of an ongoing test process for the we do for Compucam and you know they dont know which ones are test samples   uh we must be yeah we must be doing the same up here too we were probably send to a different lab than you guys down there   yeah   i dont think so i think the whole company uses Compucam which is over there on the east coast somewhere   oh   and ours actually are mailed there uh  theyre the i think the largest and they do a lot of the government contractors they have an excellent excellent rate um   oh yeah   and just uh they
