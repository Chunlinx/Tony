        yeah Jim uh so uh how many children do you have and what are their ages     uh we have two theyre going to be two and four years old in April   uhhuh   and thats after uh twenty one years of marriage  so so we weve had quite an experience over the last four years of readjusting our time in terms of spending with the kids how about yourself Frank   oh is that right wow i imagine we have uh four children but theyre all grown and out of the house now but we still uh spend a a lot of time together really its a its a close family uh we have one daughter thats going to college uh in Boston and uh we dont see uh you know an awful lot of her every couple of weeks uh we manage to get together maybe three weeks   umhum   and ive got uh one son that lives uh about ten miles north of us and a couple other sons that live uh about an hour away a piece they they live in the same basically in the same area about an hour away from us   umhum   but i would say that every uh couple of weeks uh were together with one of the you know one of the kids sometimes we have uh family get togethers probably every oh couple of months   umhum   so its kind of a different situation are you do you have a boy and a girl two boys two girls   two girls yeah yeah and  my wife and i are both from Saint Louis and weve been in New Jersey now for uh eleven years   two girls uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   so weve been away for a long time and when it was just the two of us wed go back about every year but now that we have the two girls we try to get back twice a year     uhhuh   because we both grew up with uh family all around us and weekend with the cousins and uh both of our families have uh we have siblings that have lots of children so   umhum   we miss that environment but and i think partly because of that because our familys a thousand miles away   uhhuh   we might even overcompensate   umhum   we uh pretty much uh between between that thousand mile distance from uh relatives and the fact that we had uh uh eighteen years together   umhum   married life uh before our daughters were born and uh we we pretty much it it seems like our whole life is devoted to the girls i mean from  waking until       uh till night time we we literally have an hour and a half to ourselves every night   i i know what you         no uh does your wife work or not   no she stays at home uh and   okay thats good uh my son uh one of my sons i should say that uh had been married for nine years just had a a uh daughter uh back in July last July and you know they were getting pretty set in their ways after nine years and uh it was quite a readjustment for them so i imagine after uh eighteen years it really was a a a an adjustment in your lives   umhum   it wasnt it wasnt um uh partly because we had all that time together were ready to focus on a family so and of uh course the changing economy you know helps focus on the the home life also   umhum umhum   um i mean our lifestyle changed drastically we went from two incomes and no children so we had Caribbean vacations and new cars and expensive cars down to   um right   one income two children and uh the total uncertainty of the job market now so we we pretty much stay at home   right uhhuh   focus we we do have our older daughter in a preschool a Montessori and thats quite expensive and   uhhuh   in fact my wife just joined the uh was just elected last night to the board of the school   uhhuh   so shes spending quite a bit of time in fact shes on the other line right now doing school board talk   oh is that right huh     so it it seems like even our leisure time its been focused more centered around the kids   what do what do you find is the trend amongst families in your observation for how they spend their time together what activities theyre doing and how they spend the time do you think they have more or less or what   uh it seems to me uh that families are spending more fractional time together   umhum   that maybe one parent will go off with one child and another parent will go off with the other children   umhum   um rather than and focusing more on the childrens activities rather than family activities and   uhhuh i think with so with so many parents working both husband and wife that its difficult to find time for everybody to be together   yes and partly because of that working phenomena then the kids end up getting their lives scheduled with ballet and football and soccer i mean we we live in an area that uh soccer and football is just taking off phenomenally   umhum   uh we we have terrible problems with scheduling soccer fields and finding enough land to even to build new football fields that they need   right   and part of that phenomena is the dual working household and i think   uhhuh   rather than spending the time in the evening with family activities
