                            Viruses are intracellular pathogens that are subject to intense selective pressures        during their ongoing battles within the host To propagate successfully they must exploit        numerous machineries of the infected cell Thus studies of their replicative cycles have        yielded fundamental insights into eukaryotic biology A prime example is the human        immunodeficiency virus HIV which is a lentivirus that causes the acquired        immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS Unlike simpler oncoviruses that rely exclusively on host        cell machinery lentiviruses code for additional accessory and regulatory proteins that act        as molecular switches at different stages of viral entry and exit from the infected cell        Studying the actions of these viral proteins has yielded understanding of diverse cellular        functions such as the innate immunity against retroviruses control of transcriptional        elongation export of macromolecules from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and intracellular        trafficking of proteins reviewed in         The transcriptional transactivator Tat is a key regulatory protein of HIV It is        expressed early after the virus integrates into the cell and stimulates the elongation of        RNA polymerase II RNAPII This type of transcriptional control had not been previously        appreciated thus work on Tat established a new paradigm in the field of eukaryotic        biology Moreover these findings impacted greatly studies of cotranscriptional processing        of nascent mRNA To understand these processes better we need to start with the basics of        transcriptional control        RNAPII is the enzyme that transcribes proteincoding genes in eukaryotic cells Elegant        studies in vitro first suggested that the simple recruitment of RNAPII to transcription        units was not sufficient for the copying of genes and cotranscriptional processing of their        transcripts Rather distinct steps could be defined which began with the assembly of the        preinitiation complex PIC promoter clearance pausing and arrest and ended with        efficient elongation of transcription reviewed in  The central component of PIC is        the general transcription factor GTF TFIID which contains the TATAbox binding protein        TBP and  to  TBPassociated factors TAFs TFIID acts as a landing pad for other        GTFs and RNAPII to nucleate PIC assembly Moreover TAFs serve as coactivators to a diverse        set of activators Both an ordered stepwise assembly and the recruitment of the        plussubunit holoenzyme have been proposed to be critical for the positioning of        RNAPII at start sites of transcription        Next the GTF TFIIH unwinds the DNA opens the transcription bubble and phosphorylates        serines at position  in the Cterminal domain CTD of the RPB subunit of RNAPII        reviewed in  This phosphorylation is critical for the recruitment of complexes that        put a methylguanylate cap on the  end of nascent transcripts After the transcription        complex clears the promoter the negative transcription elongation factor NTEF is        recruited to the RNAPIIa reviewed in  It consists minimally of         dichloroDribofuranosylbenzimidazole riboside DRB sensitivityinducing factor        DSIF  and negative elongation factor NELF  They bind and arrest RNAPII distal to        the promoter cooperatively Such arrested transcription complexes have now been found on        many inducible genes in         Drosophila melanogaster reviewed in  and humans         The transition to robust elongation depends on the positive transcription elongation        factor b PTEFb reviewed in  PTEFb contains the cyclindependent kinase  CDK        and one of four possible Ctype cyclins When recruited to stalled transcription complexes        PTEFb phosphorylates serines at position  in the CTD  the Spt subunit of DSIF         and the RD subunit of NELF  These modifications result in heavily phosphorylated        RNAPII RNAPIIo the recruitment of the Elongator which contains splicing and        polyadenylation machineries and the conversions of DSIF and NELF into elongation factors        RNAPIIo now copies the gene and directs the cotranscriptional processing ie splicing        and polyadenylation of primary transcripts Upon successful polyA addition the CTD        phosphatase FCP dephosphorylates RNAPIIo RNAPIIa dissociates from DNA and the        transcription cycle starts all over again reviewed in         Tat is unique among transcriptional activators in eukaryotic cells in that it functions        via RNA rather than DNA promoter elements Figure  It binds the transactivation response        element TAR that forms a stable RNA stem loop at the  end of all viral transcripts        Thus Tat requires minimally the transcription of TAR before it can stimulate HIV        transcription from the long terminal repeat LTR Indeed in the absence of Tat RNAPIIa        clears the HIV LTR successfully but soon arrests yielding predominantly short viral        transcripts  Tat binds the  bulge in TAR via its argininerich motif from positions         to  where a central arginine R is key for this interaction However this binding        is not sufficient for Tats function in vivo Adjacent to the argininerich motif lie        Nterminal core and cysteinerich regions which form the activation domain of the protein        This activation domain binds cyclin T CycT from PTEFb whose partner is CDK  As        a consequence PTEFb and Tat bind TAR cooperatively The final proof that PTEFb is the        cellular cofactor for Tat came from studies of HIV transcription in murine cells where the        introduction of the human CycT protein restores Tat function  The same effect can be        achieved by substituting just the tyrosine with the cysteine at position  such as are        found in murine and human CycT proteins respectively  A paper in this issue of         PLoS Biology suggests that Tat and PTEFb can also recruit        TAFindependent transcription complexes to the HIV LTR  Figure  Possibly this        assembly reflects interactions between CycT and the unphosphorylated CTD of RNAPIIa                The assembly and disassembly of the complex between PTEFb Tat and TAR is a regulated        process in vivo Whereas the phosphorylation of CDK strengthens this complex  the        acetylation of the lysine at position  in Tat weakens it  Upon this disruption        acetylated Tat is liberated from PTEFb and recruits the pCREBbinding protein        associated factor PCAF to the elongating RNAPIIo most likely facilitating chromatin        remodeling In this issue of PLoS Biology Pagans et al now demonstrate that acetylated        Tat is deacetylated by SIRT  Figure  In this way Tat can reassemble with PTEFb        on TAR        Clearly PTEFb plays a key role in the control of transcriptional elongation Although        Tat was the first activator known that could recruit PTEFb to initiating RNAPII        additional members of this group were soon identified They include the androgen receptor        cMyc the class II transactivator CIITA myoblast determination protein MyoD and        nuclear factor B NFB The last one is of great interest as it explains how the HIV        genome can be transcribed before the synthesis of Tat  Cellular activation triggers        the nuclear translocation of NFB where it binds the HIV enhancer leading to the        stimulation of viral transcription It is not surprising that proviral latency in which        low levels of transcription or only short HIV transcripts containing TAR are observed        would in large part reflect the absence of these activators Indeed in many of these        latently infected cells the induction of NFB or the addition of Tat leads to the        reactivation of viral replication and spreading of the infection         Recently important aspects of the regulation of PTEFb have been revealed Figure         Of interest PTEFb exists in two complexes in cells  The larger measures        approximately  kDa and contains the hexamethylene bisacetamide HMBAinduced protein         HEXIM and SK small nuclear RNA snRNA in addition to PTEFb  In this large        complex Cdk is enzymatically inactive HEXIM was identified as the inducible gene        following the exposure of vascular smooth muscle cells to a potent differentiating agent        HMBA  SK snRNA is one of the most abundant snRNA species whose function remained a        mystery for over a decade Of interest targeting of PTEFb by HEXIM and SK snRNA        contributes significantly to the control of cell growth and differentiation For example        growth signals liberate PTEFb from the large complex in the course of cardiac hypertrophy        in mice a disease characterized by the enlargement of myocytes due to a global increase in        mRNA synthesis  Also following stress ultraviolet light or the administration of        actinomycin D and DRB to cells the large complex is converted to the small complex to        stimulate transcription         How central is PTEFb to eukaryotic transcription In         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  there are two candidates for PTEFb        CTDK and Bur CTDKnegative but not BurBurnegative yeasts still grow albeit        poorly and only on rich media reviewed in  In         Caenorhabditis elegans  genetic inactivation of CDK or CycT        and CycT resulted in the inhibition of all RNAPII transcription  Moreover in         D melanogaster  following heat shock PTEFb is recruited        upstream of activated promoters  Although no murine knockouts of subunits of PTEFb        have been reported DRB and flavopiridol two ATP analogs that inhibit the kinase activity        of CDK can inhibit nearly all transcription by RNAPII in human cells  Indeed as        PTEFb is a coactivator of potent activators that mediate effects of enhancers and can        itself activate transcription when placed on sites distal to promoter elements  it        might mediate many more signaling events than those of heat shock ultraviolet light        stress and hypertrophy Conversely the inhibition of PTEFb could explain the mode of        action of some transcriptional repressors Indeed the global transcriptional repressor        PIE the regulator of embryogenesis in         C elegans  binds the histidinerich stretch in CycT thus        decoying PTEFb away from RNAPII and blocking the elongation of transcription         These are exciting findings and suggest a plethora of future experiments including the        genetic inactivation of subunits of PTEFb and isoforms of HEXIM in the mouse Of special        interest are questions as to where to place this mechanism of transcriptional regulation in        the hierarchy of competing or complementary processes What roles do different PTEFb        complexes play in the transcription of specific genes How central will the regulation of        PTEFb be to cellular growth proliferation and differentiation and what roles will it        play in normal development and disease states As to HIV how can we use our knowledge of        PTEFb to slow down viral replication andor to eliminate the state of proviral latency in        the host Obviously we are only at the beginning of this journey which promises to change        radically our view of eukaryotic transcription
