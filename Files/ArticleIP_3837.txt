                                                            AuteurAmateur                        Alex RossIsland ofLost Auteurs suffers from deficiencies that his just verdict on the latestfilm cannot alleviate In praising John Frankenheimers earlier works Ross ismuch too gripped by a childish auteuristic fascination with the technicalaspects of what are very minor works And his appraisal of actors and acting isshockingly amateurish It is amusing that he could mistake Brandos ludicrousand perfunctory posturing as some controlled experiment in caricature andparody but the homoerotic slavering over Val Kilmer is infantile andunbecoming of anyone who is supposed to make informed aesthetic judgments Onewould think a magazine like Slate would hire a film commentator who hassomething other than breezy popcultural enthusiasms to offer            AlexKhan                           Pointless                        HuhCould Ann Hulberts review of Joan Didions latest novel The Last Thing WeExpected be any more convoluted Hulbert takes Didion to task for writingstories that go nowhere I think Hulbert likes Didions new workUnfortunately her review reads like any one of Didions earlier novels denseon prose short on directness If Hulbert has a point to make she missedmaking it I think Ill buy the book and take my chances            TedHopper                           PropertyRights                        The premise of The NorplantOption by Stuart Taylor Jr reminds me of the plan my township put intoeffect in the mids to protect and preserve prime farmland by purchasing thedevelopment rights            This concept was picked up inthe Clean Air Act Polluters who reduce their toxic output beyond requirementscan sell the right to molest the environment to others less willing or lessable to control emissions            Taylor proposes thatteenagers on welfare be paid to use an implanted device to prevent pregnancyIn effect he suggests the government purchase reproductive rights at leastfor a limited time            Since wageslavery is a wellestablished phenomenon and getting better established by theday a little nonreproduction bribery sounds pretty mainstream Our loyalopposition on the right used to tell us that a man can do anything with hisproperty Landuse regulation is a plot by Commies Isnt a womans body hermost personal property Cant she do with it what she will            PaulSilver                           SexualExperimentation                        I believe we would probablybe justified in experimenting with the initiative outlined in The NorplantOption by Stuart Taylor Jr in a limited and controlled way At the sametime I am struck by what I find to be considerable conceptual confusion aswell as an absence of fundamental analysis based on solid biology andsociology            The initiative is in factan intrusion by the government upon the individual True the governmentalready makes or withholds payments based on a number of individual conditionsincluding the birth of a child etc However there is a quantum leap inintrusion levels when payments are made based on something that is put underpeoples skin            Coercion is inevitable Theargument that beneficiaries will get paid more rather than less for somethingis disingenuous They will be paid less than would otherwise be the case ifthey refuse to submit a point that no doubt will be made by many programadministrators            More fundamentally thedebate seems to ignore the biological forces at work While underclassteenagers may consciously have no interest other than in fooling around theirunderlying reproductive strategy is a wide dissemination of genes to numerousoffspring in the statistical hope that a few will make it The proposedinitiative equals an attempt to buy people out of their biological destinySome may reject it  some others may in effect make a successful transitionto a higherclass reproductive strategy and become like us Still others maybe neutered with their vital energies being redirected in potentiallydangerous directions            Havingsaid this and given that there presumably are no panaceas it might beappropriate to proceed with caution and let different proposals compete in themarket of real life            PaulKailor                           Us andThem Rights and Wrongs                        I was disappointed that Slatechose to publish The Norplant Option by Stuart Taylor Jr Why are we sointerested in interfering with the sexual and reproductive rights of Themthose other than Us If we turn the tables and ask ourselves what laws wewould choose to enact to curtail our sexual and reproductive rights it becomesimmediately clear how offensive and obtrusive such laws are to the rights ofThem What law would I be willing to sign against myself to curtail my sexualand reproductive freedoms If I were certified insane I might want thegovernment to assign a guardian who would act to protect my reproductiverights as I would not have the mental faculties do so myself Otherwise Icannot imagine any situation in which I would choose to have someselfrighteous neighbor a k a our government sticking his nose into mybusiness by telling me if when and how I can have sex or reproduce            The factthat these sexual and reproductive intrusions are typically proposed by whitemen for black women should raise a red flag for anyone listening to suchnonsense One moment these selfrighteous men would force a woman to bear achild The next moment these same selfrighteous men would force a woman not tobear a child Either way I cannot think of a more intrusive actshort ofhanging            JimAdcock                           Duh                        MichaelKinsley you really are braindead to propose eliminating the  thAmendment to solve the welfare problem Good Jobs atNow Wages You should consider this truism For every complex problemthere is a simple solution and it is always wrong            JohnJames                           TwoCheers for Slavery                        I was disappointed thatMichael Kinsleys modest proposal to reform the welfare system byreestablishing slavery Good Jobs atNow Wages did not mention the book from which it was likely inspiredHilaire Bellocs The Servile State             Unfortunately a reader might consider the article merely humorous describingan impossible proposition where in fact the basics of The ServileState concentrated ownership and statusbased laws governingemployeeemployer relations have been long established and the need forslavery in the light of the increasingly degraded condition of the welfareclass becomes more evident Slavery has been part of organized human societyfor thousands of years people should not assume that it has breathed its lastDespite its obvious drawbacks I doubt it is the worst way to organize societyand it may be better than our present narcissistic fashion

a perplexing phenomenon I have observed during thepast few years I am talking about the apparent growth in the popularity ofblue food            A study conducted at OregonState University where the maraschino cherry was invented about  years agofound that blue was almost universally disliked as a food color            Recently however somethingseems to have changed I have seen many blue foods on the market blue JellOblue juicelike drinks blue ice cream and blue candy            MrSteingarten are we seeing a trend here Assuming the Oregon State study wascorrect what has changed in the Zeitgeist of the eating public to causeblue food to become acceptable Do you think its rise in popularity parallelsthat of blue lipstick and blue nail polish Are we talking about postmodernfood here
