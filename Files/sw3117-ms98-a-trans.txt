                okay well having uh personally uh helped uh two children attend or or to select colleges one of them not very successfully im not sure if im any authority on this topic at all   well which colleges did they go to   well a daughter uh went to the University of Virginia that was a good selection she   thats a beautiful school beautiful school   yeah really is and she was she was very very happy there and very and very successful in what she picked to do so uh shes just graduated from there so that was a good selection uh our son has this kind of you know hes well he started out going Stephen F Austin and that turned turned into you know flunking out because of of of uh too many parties going on then he stayed out of school for a while then he went to Richland for a couple of years and then he went to to DePaul in Chicago which would have been great but uh it was so expensive so now hes now hes back   well i guess the question then becomes how did you all make the selection or did you just let them do them by themselves   well in in that case with him uh he kind of made the selections by himself and i think that we should have given him more direction and he was our first you know so we we didnt have quite the insight that uh that we would have had if hed been our second like we did with Karen so uh but i i think you know i just in terms of of what happened i think that first of all id i would know the reputation of the school and uh for more than just academics  but you know if its a party school or not although i think every school  is a party school to some degree personally   well thats true of course uh you know for me my son hes only six and but i had the experience with my sister going to school and she was i treated my sister almost like my daughter because she was nine ten years younger than i was and its   right uhhuh right   and she ended up going to the University of Oklahoma   uhhuh   i can say that because it was a big well known school it had a well known education and it was a wonderful education but yet it was a small school   yeah right   whereas i went to the University of Texas which was you know a million people go there   yeah yeah   i think that for me its going to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big   yeah ive heard that from people who have gone to Texas yeah i went to uh Iowa State which is also a big eight school like Oklahoma   its way too big yes yes im im quite aware   yeah and uh when i was there it was maybe eleven or twelve thousand people which was just a great size i thought its its   Texas only had fifty five thousand when i was there   oh gosh  thats just awful   and for me i had to admit the one thing that i lacked was the uh interaction between uh students i knew everybody within my dorm but that was it   uhhuh yeah   because the school was just too big and whereas my sister when i went to visit her she knew everybody on the whole durn campus   yeah yes that thats true it makes a lot of difference and uh   so uh course now were were already telling our son you know Texas uh Oklahomas good and Arkansas is good now of course Texas is good only because you know   uhhuh you went to school there yeah right uhhuh   i went because i went there of course but uh were going my parents let me choose on my own and i want to pretty much allow him to choose on his own but i kind of keep an ear open as to what hes doing   uhhuh sure oh yeah yeah well our daughter chose uh Virginia because she didnt want to go to school in Texas i mean she just sort of didnt want to go to school here   well i was when i was in Louisiana in Shreveport i would go to any school except LSU i did not want to school in the in the same state   uhhuh yeah same deal yeah and uh in fact she was accepted at two schools in Texas uh Rice and Trinity but she decided she wanted to go out of state and uh Virginia was uh you know in the east it wasnt a you know it wasnt an Ivy League school but it was well its quite a bit further and it was uh of the state schools that she could have gone to it was one of the cheapest yet one of the best too you know with the academics and the tradition and everything that is there uh she made a really good selection we thought and so uh she pretty much made that herself herself but she did have some others in the wings you know theres another school that she she would have have gone to if she hadnt been accepted there so uh  i dont know i think it really depends a lot on the child because our daughter is was just a lot more levelheaded about her process the process   luckily i still have twelve more years to worry about it   yeah  so uh but you know i guess you have to really look at your finances and uh Texas has such a bargain in education i mean   right now they do now if the uh legislature has their way theyre going to raise the tuition in in double   yeah i know i know   and see back when i went to school there when i first entered the school it cost me two hundred dollars as an out as an out of state student   uh thats something uh   but then i was there for about two and a half years they then switched it to forty dollars per semester hour so almost overnight i went from two hundred dollars to eight hundred dollars   oh wow my gosh   and i have to admit uh   that was a shocker   i wasnt i wasnt quite ready for that one   no ill bet not   it took me only about twelve years after i graduated to finish paying off the bill but thats   yeah yeah yeah i know how that is   but at least i was one of the good guys i did pay my bill off in full yes i did yeah   you did pay yours good yeah my husband went to school on loans too and and we he was able you know we paid his off after we were married but uh well im at the university of Texas at Dallas and as a graduate student and uh you know i have to say that uh its a real bargain i mean for as far as im concerned its been a real bargain of course you know living at home makes a lot of difference if i had to to pay room and board somewhere that would make a lot of difference uh in   yeah well what about the University of Virginia how much did it end end up costing   uh  i think uh on a yearly basis im trying to think i would just make it a rough figure of about uh with with the travel expenses and so on although she didnt come home that much uh actually i would say between twelve and thirteen thousand a year   thats a long way uh thats not too bad   its not when you look at the you know the school and the fact that she was   now did she get to did she get to live in the dorm on that very front row you know that goes up by the rotunda   uh no on the lawn no no thats thats an honor thats bestowed on very few and she didnt get to do that although she knew people who did live there but yeah thats that would have been neat         when we went to visit it we didnt know what it was and my little kid he was opening every one of the mailboxes looking inside to see what he could find   well you know the graduation takes place right there on the lawn on on that in that big fat grassy area and uh   yeah   they had four thousand graduates this spring and boy that was quite an event ill tell you   yeah we went on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year and we went to visit th at was the very last thing we saw was at the tail end of the Parkway we had we had a blast   oh yeah yeah thats a great place to visit that really is yeah   it is it i can see why you want to go there thats   yeah well theyre just so its just steeped in tradition and and the uh you know theyre they still talk about Mister Jefferson the you know i mean the founder of the school of course was Mister Jefferson Thomas Jefferson and they and and a lot of   uhhuh and of course youv e got to go to say hello to Monticello yeah yeah   right uhhuh and and a lot of the of his traditions i mean for instance they dont call the students freshmen sophomore junior senior they call them first year second year third year and fourth year because Mister Jefferson felt that ones education never ended and to you put those four designations of freshmen sophomore and so on on the persons education limited them and he felt that you could go on to school forever you should just have the number of years that you were there attached to your name if you want to do identify someone so   huh   i had to be very careful about talking about seniors or fourth year students  you got to get the terminology right     well i tell you what ive enjoyed talking im going to go ahead and hang up on this end because its just about time for supper so   yes all righty yes it certainly is i got to go make it here   actually it it was a fun conversation i enjoyed it   well i i this is my last one youre number ten of ten that i can i   congratulations well congratulations
