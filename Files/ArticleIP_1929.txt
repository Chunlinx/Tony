                                 Entertainment Values            Thirty years ago when JohnKenneth Galbraith published The New Industrial State  he was sure heknew where the modern economy was going and was contemptuous of economists whoclung to their old ideas about the primacy of markets Clearly giantcorporations driven by the imperatives of technology were replacing the chaosof the market with bureaucratic order The age of business heroes was overWith the rise of the modern corporation the emergence of the organizationrequired by modern technology and planning and the divorce of the owner ofcapital from control of the enterprise the entrepreneur no longer exists as anindividual person in the mature industrial enterprise The economy of thefuture would be run by faceless organization men whose ability to manipulatepliable consumers would eliminate the traditional uncertainties associated withmarket competition In effect capitalism was evolving spontaneously intosocialism without the justice            Insteadof course only the paranoid survived or something like that And yetGalbraiths mistakebelieving that one can discern the shape of tomorrowseconomy by extrapolating from todays iconic corporationsis one that eachgeneration seems to repeat Yesterday every industry was going to look likeautomobiles and every company like General Motors today every industry isgoing to look like software and every company like Microsoft            Like Galbraith the prophets of what is variously calledthe business revolution the Knowledge Economy the Network Economy and thenew economy not to be confused with the New Economy I wrote about last month are likely tobe disappointed Even though information technology may well be the maindriving force behind future economic growth its very unlikely that theinformationtechnology industry is ever going to be more than a fairlysmall share of the economy In its day electricity changed everything too butthere was never a time when most people worked for electric utilities or evenfor employers who looked anything like electric utilities Still even if everyindustry isnt about to look like software it is worth asking what isspecial about those industries that do            Itsimportant to get past the obvious but mainly irrelevant surfaces of thingsOf course information technology is nifty but the latest technologyalways seems nifty At the  Philadelphia Centennial Expositiontriumphant banners proclaimed All By Steam The real question is whetherthere really are as Wired s Executive Editor Kevin Kelly put it in thetitle of a widely read recent article New Rulesfor the New Economy            Kelly manages to come up with no less than such rules ranging from the more or less incomprehensible Embrace dumbpower to the basically silly Follow the free all wrapped in trendyrhetoric about living on the edge of chaos and all that But most of hisrules amount to variations on two themes In the Network Economy supply curvesslope down instead of up and demand curves slope up instead of down At leastthats what I think hes saying To the extent that he is he is actually on tosomethingthough not something new            Truetraditional economic theorythe stuff that occupies the first  or sochapters of most introductory textbooksdoes assume diminishing returns inboth production and consumption That is the more units of something theeconomy is already producing the harder it is to produce one unit more themore units of something people are already consuming the less they are willingto pay to consume one unit more That is why the conventional supply curvewhich shows how much will be produced at any given price slopes up and thedemand curve which shows how much people will buy at any given price slopesdown            But even Alfred Marshallthe Victorian economist whoinvented supply and demand as we know itwas well aware that while diminishingreturns are a good assumption for agriculture The more wheat you try to growthe worse the land on which the marginal bushel is grown elsewhere in theeconomy it is quite possible to have increasing returns in which themore you produce the easier it gets Way back in  he explained thatconcentrations of industry yes they existed before Silicon Valleyhis primeexample was the Sheffield cutlery district can create a virtuous circle inwhich the availability of skilled labor the presence of specialized suppliersand the diffusion of knowledge  Increasing returns to consumption are probablyless common but can result among other things from network externalitiesabit of useful jargon for what happens when the usefulness of a product dependson how many other people possess something similar A telephone is a toy whenonly a few people have one it is a necessity when everyone has one            Theoldfashioned examples are deliberate Increasing returns have been around fora long time And while economists may historically have downplayed theirimportance those days are long past In fact by now increasing returns arerather old hat Everybody knows that sufficiently strong increasing returns cancause discontinuous change with markets exploding when they reach a criticalmass that small events can have big effects when a market is near a tippingpoint that economic choices like VHS vs Betamax or Silicon Valley vsRoute  can be subject to lockin by past accidents and so on Everybodyalso knows that while it is easy to tell good stories along these lines its alot harder when you get down to real cases Its amazingly hard to identify acritical mass or a tipping point for an actual industry even after thefact            So whats new about Kellys New Rules Wellfor one thing they may be new to him Cybercritic Paulina Borsook has pointedout to me that technology enthusiasts like Kelly are prone to Luke Skywalkerfantasies imagining themselves heroic rebels against the empire of orthodoxyThe quintessential example of the Luke Skywalker Syndrome is the story ofBrian Arthur as described in my column last week They are sosure that boring conventional thinkers could not have anticipated their radicalideas that it would never occur to them to check            Or maybewhats new about the rules is the claim that now for the first time theyapply to a large part of the economy However technology boosters who wontstop thinking about tomorrow often forget to think about yesterday Its notat all clear that increasing returns are any more important in software thanthey were in the early days of railroads electricity telephones radio evenautomobiles What good is a car without gas stations Why open a gas station ifnobody has a car And its very unlikely that in the future everything willlook like softwareindeed its much more likely that eventually theinformation sector itself will turn into a boring mature industry            If there is something new in the writings of Kelly andother cyberprophets it is the fact that they dont just predict afuture in which the curves slope the wrong way they endorse it Thatis along with the geewhiz pronouncements about how the economy supposedlyworks goes a pronounced libertarian bent a belief that the new economy is toodynamic organic or whatever to be regulated from above            What isodd about these libertarian conclusions is that they do not at all follow fromthe premises On the contrary A world in which increasing returns areprevalent is one in which markets are likely to get it wrong Products thatshould be developed never get off the ground or do so much later than theyshould because everyone is waiting for other people to move Ill buy a faxmachine only when enough other people have them to make it worthwhileIndustries can get locked into the wrong technology Macintosh is better thanDOS but everyone uses DOS because everyone else uses DOS Waste occursbecause of coordination failures In the early days of railroads each line hada different gauge Indeed increasing returns have traditionally been used asarguments against free markets for government intervention Youmay not believe that such intervention will work in practice but thats ajudgment about the rules of politics not economics            Of course the informationtechnology sector hasbeen wonderfully successfulbut that is because it has been in a position toexploit the extraordinary possibilities offered by photolithography notbecause of any special virtue in the way it operates Other sectors in whichincreasing returns to both production and consumption prevailand there arequite a few outside what is normally thought of as high technologydo not seemespecially admirable            Consider in particular anindustry few would regard as a role model Hollywood It is obviouslycharacterized by increasing returns to production Once youve made a movieshowing it to another person costs virtually nothing It is also characterizedby increasing returns to consumption Many people want to see a movie becauseother people have seen it In fact by my reckoning the movie business handilyfits  of Kellys  rules It even fits Follow the free which I thinkmeans Sell your signature product cheap and make money off accessoriesmajor blockbusters make much of their money off product placements and toysales and even theater owners depend on sodas and snacks to turn a profit Theonly rule I cant apply to Hollywood is Embrace dumb powerbut then againsome of those studio bosses             So think of it this wayWhile the prophets of the new economy may seem to be telling us that wereheading for a future in which every industry looks like Silicon Valley whatthey are really saying is that we are on our way to an era in which theres nobusiness that isnt like show business Lets hope theyre wrong
