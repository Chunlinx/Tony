                    Introduction        In  Norman Stoll the distinguished Rockefeller Institute scientist who helped to        establish human parasitology research in North America described the unique health impact        of hookworm as follows                    As it was when I first saw it so it is now one of the most evil of infections Not          with dramatic pathology as are filariasis or schistosomiasis but with damage silent and          insidious Now that malaria is being pushed back hookworm remains the great infection of          mankind In my view it outranks all other worm infections of man combinedin its          production frequently unrealized of human misery debility and inefficiency in the          tropics                Like many other global disease experts who witnessed dramatic reductions in malaria        prevalence as a result of DDT spraying during the late s  Stoll did not anticipate        malarias imminent reemergence in India However he articulated with eloquence the        magnitude of the disease burden resulting from hookworm infection He further offered the        silent and insidious character of hookworm as a partial explanation for its neglect by the        global medical community        This neglect subsequently intensified during the s s and s with the        omission of hookworm from the list of diseases covered by the World Health Organizations        Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical                  Hookworm has proven to be extremely difficult to eliminate or eradicate in areas of          poverty and poor sanitation                Diseases as well as from other global health initiatives Over the last ten years        however there has been increasing recognition of the global health importance of hookworm        Today new international efforts to control the morbidity of hookworm and other        soiltransmitted helminth infections are in progress wwwwhointwormcontrol                    Etiology and Global Distribution        Human hookworm infection is caused by bloodfeeding nematode parasites of the genus         Ancylostoma and the species         Necator americanus  Worldwide         N americanus is the predominant etiology of human hookworm        infection whereas         A duodenale occurs in more scattered focal environments         These two hookworms together with the roundworm         Ascaris lumbricoides  and the whipworm         Trichuris trichiura  are often referred to collectively as        soiltransmitted helminths STHs        No international surveillance mechanisms are in place to determine the prevalence and        global distribution of hookworm infection However based on an extensive search of the        literature since  the worldwide number of cases of hookworm was recently estimated to        be  million people  The highest prevalence of hookworm occurs in subSaharan Africa        and eastern Asia Figure  High transmission defined below also occurs in other areas        of rural poverty in the tropics including southern China  the Indian subcontinent         and the Americas  In all regions there is a striking relationship between hookworm        prevalence and low socioeconomic status Figure   Hookworms neglected status partly        reflects its concentration among the worlds poorest  billion people who live on less        than  a day                    Clinical Features Epidemiology and Disease Burden        Hookworm infection is acquired by invasion of the infective larval stages through the        skin         A duodenale larvae are also orally infective Following host        entry the larvae undergo a journey through the vasculature then the lungs and other        tissues before they enter the gastrointestinal tract and molt twice to become        onecentimeterlong adult male and female worms  The worms mate and the female        hookworms produce up to  eggs per day which exit the hosts body in the feces        Figure         Because hookworms do not replicate in humans the morbidity of hookworm is highest among        patients that harbor large numbers of adult parasites Estimates of the intensity of        hookworm infection are typically obtained by using quantitative fecal egg counts as a        surrogate marker for worm burden The World Health Organization defines moderateintensity        infections as those with  eggs per gram of feces and heavyintensity infections        as those with  or more eggs per gram p  in  Compared to other STH infections        and schistosomiasis hookworm infection exhibits a unique ageintensity profilewhereas the        intensities for the former peak in childhood and adolescence hookworm intensity usually        either steadily rises in intensity with age or plateaus in adulthood  The biological        basis for this observation is unknown         Adult hookworms cause morbidity in the host by producing intestinal hemorrhage  The        adult hookworms then ingest the blood rupture the erythrocytes and degrade the hemoglobin         Therefore the disease attributed to hookworm is silent blood loss leading to iron        deficiency anemia and protein malnutrition There is a correlation between parasite        intensity and host intestinal blood loss  in children women of reproductive age and        other populations with low iron stores there is often a correlation between parasite        intensity and reductions in host hemoglobin  In children chronic        heavyintensity infections are associated with growth retardation as well as intellectual        and cognitive impairments in pregnant women they are associated with adverse        maternalfetal outcomes         When measured in disabilityadjusted life years the global disease burden from hookworm        exceeds all other major tropical infectious diseases with the exception of malaria        leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis pp  in  In addition hookworm has        been associated with impaired learning increased absences from school and decreased        future economic productivity  Therefore like other neglected diseases chronic        infection with hookworm promotes longterm disability and increases the likelihood that an        afflicted population will remain mired in poverty                    Hookworm Control Strategies        Because of its high transmission potential hookworm has proven to be extremely        difficult to eliminate or eradicate in areas of poverty and poor sanitation  Indeed        in the absence of comprehensive economic development the impact of sanitation footwear        and health education has been minimal  Control efforts have therefore shifted to        reducing morbidity through mass treatment also known as deworming of affected        populations with anthelminthic drugs         Although benzimidazoles BZAs are the most commonly used agents for treating STH        infections levamisole and pyrantel may also be used in some circumstances Periodic and        repeated deworming with BZAs and praziquantel complemented by basic sanitation and        adequate safe water is considered the most costeffective means to control the morbidity        caused by STH and schistosome infections  Efforts led by the World Health        Organization have focused on annual twiceyearly or thriceyearly doses in schools        because the heaviest intensities of STH infections are most commonly encountered in        schoolage children         Among the health benefits of periodic deworming of schoolchildren are improvements in        iron and hemoglobin status physical growth and fitness and cognition  In        addition there are important externalities including improvements in education and        reduced communitybased transmission of ascaris and trichuris infections  Accordingly        at the th World Health Assembly in  a resolution was passed urging member states to        attain a minimum target of regular deworming of at least  and up to  of all atrisk        schoolage children by                      Developing a New Control Tool The NaASP Hookworm Vaccine        Deworming satisfies a number of United Nations Millennium Development Goals including        those related to poverty reduction child health and education However there are also        several reasons to believe that the schoolbased deworming programs could have less of an        impact on the control of morbidity from hookworm than from other STH and schistosome        infections  As noted above heavyintensity hookworm infections are common among both        adults and children so schoolbased programs would not be expected to have an impact on        hookworm transmission in the community  Schoolbased programs are also not likely to        affect either preschool children or pregnant women despite evidence for the health        benefits from BZAs in both populations  Finally a single dose of mebendazole one        of the two major BZAs has variable efficacy against hookworm  and following        treatment hookworm reinfection to pretreatment levels can occur within  months         This and the observation that the efficacy of mebendazole against hookworm can diminish        with frequent and repeated use has prompted concerns about the possible emergence of BZA        resistance         As a complementary strategy the Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative HHVI is developing        a safe efficacious and costeffective vaccine the         Na ASP Hookworm Vaccine that would provide an additional tool for the        control of hookworm  The HHVI is a nonprofit partnership comprising research        process development vaccine manufacturing and control and preclinical and clinical        testing units at the George Washington University London School of Hygiene and Tropical        Medicine and Oswaldo Cruz Foundation FIOCRUZ and sponsored by the Sabin Vaccine        Institute wwwsabinorg        The HHVI selected the hookworm larval antigen ASP ancylostoma secreted protein        based on studies that  identified the molecule as a protective antigen linked to        earliergeneration irradiated infective larval vaccines   determined a relationship        between human antiASP antibodies and reduced risk of heavy hookworm infection in        populations living in hookwormendemic regions of Brazil and China  J Bethony A        Loukas M J Smout S Brooker S Mendez et al unpublished data and  confirmed        the ability of recombinant ASP to partially protect laboratory animals against larval        hookworm challenges         Process development cGMP manufacture and control and preclinical testing of         Na ASP from         N americanus were completed in  Figure  Pending United        States Food and Drug Administration approval clinical testing of the vaccine will take        place in  The         Na ASP Hookworm Vaccine will be developed almost entirely in the        nonprofit sector Ultimately the vaccine will be indicated for the active immunization of        susceptible individuals against moderate and heavy necator infection Vaccination would        reduce the number of hookworm infective larvae entering the gastrointestinal tract thereby        reducing the number of adult worms and the fecal egg counts in individuals exposed to the        larvae                    Hookworm as a Model        Because immunization would only affect hookworm larvae and not adult hookworms already        residing in the gastrointestinal tract of infected individuals the first dose of the        vaccine would be administered following deworming Therefore use of the vaccine could        build on the infrastructures developed as part of schoolbased programs Given that        hookworm afflicts only the worlds most impoverished a major hurdle for the development of        the         Na ASP Hookworm Vaccine is its small commercial market Innovative        financing mechanisms must be considered to produce this orphan biologic Towards that end        the HHVI has partnered with manufacturers in hookwormendemic middleincome countries that        would commit to industrial scaleup of the         Na ASP Hookworm Vaccine pending proofofprinciple for its efficacy        This approach might help to inform the development of business models for the production        and distribution of orphan biologics for other neglected diseases
