        okay what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling     uh basically theyre just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup   uhhuh  well thats more than we have up here in Massachusetts some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect and they do have bins set up but i live in a a metropolitan area and uh theyre not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that   well here they and uh live in an apartment complex and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets   uhhuh   as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front dont bother to recycle because you know its too far to carry the stuff to the other bins   i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do  something like that because it does take extra effort whether and and i think that and i know Massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh thats the majority of people that i know of anyways where people arent really you know ecoconscious its just the fact that its something they have to do and im not going to throw a bottle away its like throwing a nickel away that type of thing   right they   but uh people need to be more conscious of it   theyre here theyre trying to push through a bill and a lot of people are against it and its going to create a lot more work for the uh the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything   yeah  no it didnt it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans um and and matter of fact i think it took like three tries to for it to go through but and its been pretty successful and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know people would drink have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle so its its been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly its recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing and thats the big thing i think that they they try to promote   right i think here if they uh instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate   yeah thats a good idea yeah there there definitely has to be a motivation factor and i know that at where where i work i work for a defense contractor and theres a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh styrofoam usage because of the uh the process involved in styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that and and theyre very proactive and uh uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh styrofoam stuff so so it it its incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it i think thats thats what they need to do be more proactive like that   uh i know uh i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books uh usually have them come from  you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual trash   yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the paper the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school and what theyll do is theyll recycle it because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that dont break down over a long period of time a guy went to a dump a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty because they dont they dont degrade over such a period of time   well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the   yeah   uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them   yeah   now i think theyve come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out   yeah okay
