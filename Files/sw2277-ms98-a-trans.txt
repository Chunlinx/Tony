        have you had to put anyone in a nursing home   no but my husbands mother was in a nursing home   um   and she was in there she got sick and they put her in a nursing home because you couldnt we couldnt afford a nurse to you know all all day nurse   yeah twenty four hours   yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts   oh   you know thats sixteen hours because one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldnt need one   yeah yeah   you know because she would be sleeping so i would be here then   yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh nursing nursing home wouldnt it   well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see   oh and the nurse at home isnt oh okay i got you   and the nurses arent no see you have to pay that   yeah i didnt know that   and oh yeah if you put nursing home and thats another thing i you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the people dont care most of them dont care some of them do care the work that you know the the nurse aide that what the problem is i think its the nurses aide they dont pay them enough to keep them there and to do the things that they need to do   now well my brother in law was working with uh in one for a little bit and uh he just he couldnt handle the things he had to do   uhhuh   you know uh cleaning up after men uh men and women using the restroom and stuff he he he couldnt handle it   oh yeah its gets bad some of them and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is you know because they have some nursing home that dont have anybody thats not walking you know   yeah   and it just depends on how bad that person is   well seems to me if a person gets into that area they i i dont know it seems like if youre going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it   yeah   uh   you ought to do your job   yeah and um   and if you cant if you cant i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people   yeah i ive heard a lot of bad things about them mistreating people and uh   well   ive even heard of some people being sexually abused   they steal yeah that and they steal   yeah they steal from them   uh oh yeah i used to take uh every week you know i have to threaten it which it doesnt make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten uh people um that work there   i didnt yeah   you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this girl hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them in wheel chairs and i told her uh i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here because they went to the washer we didnt find it i said you all better find it   yeah   and you know bedspread her bedspread she i took her a bedspread because she a comforter because she was always cold   yeah   and so uh you know then  i had to put write the name on the whole bedspread im talking uh like its   in each square   it almost  you know on both sides so that they cant turn it over and put it on somebody elses bed     all over thats thats not right   huhuh   ive ive only known two people in a nursing home and you know it was my grandmother and grandfather on my fathers side and i just heard through my father what was going on and uh   yeah well see this this one i i is more or less first hand you know she just died um we buried her February but she had been in there at least i know for seven years eight years and he didnt want to put her in there but he cant afford it   yeah   and thats another thing you know   yeah something i guess you get forced to do make decisions and   but you dont have it depends on when didnt you you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes   yeah   sometimes you dont and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way youre going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them every time but dont tell the people   what time you going to come in just come in  uh   yeah you have to do one of them you know spontaneous things like maybe three oclock in the afternoon or one oclock in the afternoon and stuff like that because theyre not expecting you   yeah yeah   you know they expect you Saturday like on Saturdays Friday you know Saturdays and Sundays and Friday and stuff but not during the week   yeah   humum it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die thats about what its for and its really not some people dont need to be in there   you know thats what ive heard too you know i heard that they just put them in there because they dont want to mess with them   thats right and i dont think thats right i think they should have a place to some of the people that dont need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them like a retirement home   well yeah ive heard uh some things you know uh i i dont where i heard it from it might have been a movie or something where they made a apartment complex into a what youre saying for people who can take care of themselves but they they uh need a little help in doing it   yeah dont yeah and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them every day you know go by and see what they need   yeah each of them have their own little apartment or little   little place to live you know even just a little room or whatever   yeah well do they share rooms in nursing homes   sometimes yeah it depends on the patient and and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the room and how they done built the hospitals because i know one lady like she had a roommate but the woman across the hall didnt have one   um   get my purse uh but it it it you know it just to me nursing homes are um   bad news   bad news unless you can find a really good one and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones i mean   well ill ill say something i said in the last conversation i hope im never in that position where i have to be put in one uh from all ive heard about it just not and ive heard   i told my husband well is this weird because see what people dont understand is even the people that work in the nursing home they will get old one day   yeah   and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them thats the way i feel yeah   well if it aint uh well you know uh   or maybe that wont not make it that far in life for what they did to somebody but   well yeah i have my beliefs in the hereafter and i believe that uh God will take care of them   thats the whole thats what i think i think God will definitely get uh you know uh theres two people that i know you should not mess uh abuse and thats a child and a someone person thats elderly you shouldnt abuse anybody but but down right   true   them people them two people are the most helpless people you see what im saying   yeah   you know they cant really defend themselves like somebody grown uh say my age you know yeah   or mine yeah i got you there   because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone but they so old   or you can force them to do it if you know   yeah you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they dont know   yeah uh   and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody people always say oh theyre just senile you know huhuh  and that aint right neither   no its not   so it it it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my grandmother was in a nursing home in California before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones   yeah   but now my mom and them had to pay for that too   yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like three and four times more   you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then um you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more   well   if she you know since it was like my my grandmother had thirteen kids so they all you know paid their month which was better  but see my husbands a only child     yeah and then hed have to pay it all   yeah   yeah i know what big families are like and how they can get together if you if theyre really cooperative and wanting the best   if yeah see and then theres another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her her being there if someone if one of her brothers didnt send in their check she would have to pay it   yeah   you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it  you know   yeah well i know my mom from a family of at least sixteen ive lost count uh and my grandmother just died sometime last well about two years ago   umhum umhum   and uh they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the uh hospital costs and stuff and uh you know theres some of my family thats not exactly in the homeless level but you know darn close   yeah yeah   and uh then theres others who is uhhuh lots better off   just pretty oh yeah see thats what thats what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house   and   in California with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it   you know well in California too ive got a friend that lives out there and uh shes got a little two three bedroom house with a garage a double car garage and its costing her a thousand dollars a month   umhum   California is high   yeah and then you know its like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my brother i would be just like set for life   thats what we keep saying   you know but not him hes never happy and i think thats thats why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more   uh well thats   which i probably if i got what i wanted id be okay you know   well thats a good initiative uh i guess if but
