                    Background        The human sodium bicarbonate cotransporters NBCs        along with the inorganic anion exchangers comprise the         SLCA subfamily of proteins a part        of the solute carrier SLC superfamily The coupled        transport of Na and HCO          across the plasma membrane of        epithelial cells is involved in the regulation of        intracellular pH intracompartmental pH and        intercompartmental pH gradients in many organ systems as        suggested by expression of NBCs in the kidney pancreas        heart retina skeletal muscle and other organs            Basolateral HCO          cotransport is necessary for proper        buffering of digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas          NBCs are also responsible for electrogenic        transepithelial bicarbonate cotransport in kidney proximal        tubules           Five human NBC transcripts          SLCASLCA  have been previously        cloned and mapped          Most recently                NBC   and         SLCA   have been cloned We        report the discovery and a genomic analysis of a sixth        member of this family         SLCA  a novel and alternatively        spliced NBClike gene expressed at high levels in normal        adult kidney We also present an         in silico analysis of the genomic        structure of         NBC and evaluate conserved        paralogous clustering of         SLCA genes with the members of the        ankyrin epidermal growth factor EGF and fibroblast        growth factor FGF gene families in the human genome                    Results                  Isolation and genomic structure of SLCA          As part of a positional cloning project we became          interested in a region of q between DS and          DS We annotated all draft and finished genomic          sequence from this region using SeqHelp            Presubmission contig h of bacterial artificial          chromosome EAC clone CTCD now GenBank AC          included four regions of high translated sequence          similarity with known mammalian NBCs GeneFinder Genie          and GRAIL  predicted exons throughout the contig          including but not limited to the regions of NBC          homology We named the gene with the HUGOapproved symbol                    SLCA It is currently represented          by ten kidney clones and one testis clone from the IMAGE          consortium Unigene Hs Two expressed sequence          tag EST clones IMAGE  and  were          sequenced to completion yielding a  base pair bp          cDNA contig The ESTs were later found to cover exons           and BD  and CE  of           SLCA when exons are numbered as          in Figure  The assembled cDNA sequence matched an          NBClike portion of D and additional new sequence          elsewhere on the genomic contig The presumptive gap in          the draft was closed by designing primers cF and cR          from confirmed sequence and sequencing an approximately           kilobase kb PCR fragment from genomic DNA The          resulting bp contig included known sequence from          two pieces of D as well as  bp of new          sequence          Putative exons on the kb h contig were defined          by a consensus of multiplealgorithm exon predictions          NBC homologies and IMAGE clone coverage Primers were          designed from flanking intronic sequences Exons and          adjoining splice sites were amplified by PCR from genomic          DNA Snonymous coding sequence polymorphisms  CT          and  CT and intronic singlenucleotide          polymorphism SNP  AT were identified all D          sequence coordinates refer to positions on GenBank          AC GI no           To extend the known  portion of the genes

SLCA exon sizes vary from  bp          exon  to  bp exon  Intron phase is distributed          quite randomly in the  half of the sequence although          toward the  end of the gene phase o introns become          prevalent The SNP in exon A is immediately adjacent to          an alternatively used  splice site but no correlation          between the presence of exon B in cDNA clones and C or          T at nucleotide  was observed All introns conform          to the GTAG rule                          Cloning the  end of the SLCAtranscript          Two observations suggested to us that none of the          known           SLCA mRNA isoforms is full          length the open reading frames ORFs of all the          isoforms start at the very first or second base at the           end of the clones and the complete inserts of the clones          are   kb whereas the           SLCA transcripts on northern          blots are  and  kb Figure  We therefore          undertook a comprehensive effort to find the  end of           SLCA           The lack of fulllength clones in the Clontech adult          kidney cDNA library was not surprising because the          library was dTprimed and mostly contained inserts of          under  kb in length manufacturers data Therefore          we used PCRbased approaches to determine the sequence of          the  end of the mRNA Nested RACEPCR rapid          amplification of cDNA ends with PCR on Marathon kidney          cDNA Clontech with four different primer combinations          three within known exons and one within a          GeneFinderpredicted exon  of exon  and appropriate          nested adaptor primers produced smears and multiple bands          over several attempts Analysis of the RACE products by          sequencing the gelextracted bands and random TA clones          revealed  mispriming even though the genespecific          RACE primers did not have any homologies to non           SLCA human sequence The          sequenced TA clones most frequently corresponded to          mitochondrial DNA sequences and to the           FBN gene which coincidentally          maps to q centromeric of           SLCA           In addition to RACE on the Marathon cDNA we used the          Advantage  PCR technique Clontech on undiluted          aliquots of the kidney and fetal brain longinsert phage          libraries multiple times with all possible primer          combinations of one vector primer either forward or          reverse and one appropriately oriented genespecific          primer All genespecific RACE primers and all internal          sequencing primers used during the determination of the          complete sequences of the IMAGE clones were tried one by          one With the exception of the three TA clones obtained          with the oiE primer all such experiments resulted in           mispriming This result was identical to that          obtained when both genespecific and randomprimed          reverse transcription followed by RACE with the same          multiple genespecific primers as above were performed          on a nonClontech sample of total RNA freshly extracted          from a kidney biopsy In summary we have been unable to          obtain a fulllength           SLCA transcript with current          commercial RACE and RTPCR reverse transcriptionPCR          protocols                          The adjoining region of SLCAon q          Despite the failure of experimental attempts to          characterize the  end of           SLCA in silico analyses of the          region expected to contain this portion of the gene have          been informative The gene immediately centromeric to          and  bp from           SLCA is           HEGFL which encodes a          heparinbinding member of the EGF family Genomic DNA          sequence between the  end of           HEGFL and exon  of           SLCA provides some clues as to          the structure of the  end of           SLCA A putative promoter on the           SLCA encoding strand was          predicted by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories LBL          neural network promoter prediction algorithm   with          a score of  at bp  of AC This          sequence has been shown to have promoter activity            on the strand opposite to the coding strand of           SLCA As           HEGFL and           SLCA are transcribed in opposite          orientations and have  ends facing each other the          promoter may be bidirectional Four possible exons are          predicted  of           SLCA by GeneFinder However          neither protein homologies nor consensus Kozak sequences          are seen in the region                          SLCAexpression ortholog comparison and protein          sequence analysis          Northern blot analysis reveals that expression of           SLCA is extremely restricted          Figure  Transcripts of  and  kb are seen at          high levels in kidney but not in any other tissues          tested This is consistent with the kidney origin of           of the  public ESTs corresponding to           SLCA The consistently smeary          background observed regardless of the probe and          hybridization stringency may be due to the presence of          low levels of alternatively spliced           SLCA mRNA variants          While this manuscript was undergoing revision the          first mammalian           SLCA ortholog that in the          rabbit was published   The rabbit gene encodes a          sodiumindependent anion exchanger this underscores the          importance of not assigning functions to NBClike genes          in the absence of experimental evidence Similarly to          human           SLCA the rabbit gene is          alternatively spliced Both the RACEverified complete          rabbit cDNA and our incomplete human cDNA are          approximately  kb long In rabbit this is however          consistent with the size of the major transcript on the          northern blots and no transcripts over  kb are seen          In human the known cDNA size is much less than the          kb and kb signals on the northern blots In the          absence of major differences in coding sequence this          strongly suggests rapid evolution of speciesspecific           and untranslated regions UTRs which are longer in          the human gene          Table summarizes the properties of six human NBC and          NBClike genes           NBC and           HNBC were discovered during our           in silico annotation of genomic          sequences           NBC has since been described in          detail             SLCA has the most restricted          expression pattern evidenced by high tissue specificity          and low dbEST representation          The aminoacid sequence of the  amino acid SLCA          inferred from the major splice isoform was subjected to          secondary structure and hydropathy analysis by TMPRED            Consistent with the results for NBC   SLCA          is predicted to be a transmembrane protein with a          relatively long amino acids  cytoplasmic amino          terminus and a shorter also cytoplasmic carboxyl          terminus amino acids  NetPhos v            predicted several serine and threonine phosphorylation          sites The relative lengths of the cytoplasmic domains          and the distribution of phosphorylation sites were          strikingly similar to those observed for NBC   The          predicted transmembrane segments and phosphorylation          sites are indicated in Figure           The predicted SLCA protein aligns both to human          Figure  and rat data not shown NBCs SLCA is most          similar to SLCA  identity and SLCA           followed by NBC  and SLCA  The exact extent          of protein sequence similarity of HNBC to SLCA cannot          be determined since too little HNBC sequence can be          inferred                          SLCAas a part of an ancient multiply duplicated          EGFSLCAANKFGF gene cluster          To identify gene clusters containing NBClike SLCA          genes we consolidated information from human radiation          hybrid RH maps and the GSS and HTGS databases for seven          SLCA NBCs  FGF family members and  EGF family          members   The electronic mapping strategy involved          anchoring genomic sequences that matched each gene to the          GB RH map via RHmapped sequencetagged sites STSs or          genebased markers The possibility that ankyrins might          also be a part of this cluster was suggested by the          presence of a novel ankyrin gene           ANKfc from fetal cochlea less          than  kb distal to           SLCA on q We were able to          determine map positions for all five SLCA all four ANK           of  EGF and  of  FGF family members All cases          where members of at least two of the four families          cluster are shown in Figure           We used SLCA family members to test the hypothesis          that the origin and repeated duplication of the EGFFGF          cluster predated the humanmouse divergence Four of the          seven known SLCA genes were found near either an EGF          gene or an FGF gene or both The genomic location of EGF          and FGF family members on human chromosome q conforms to          the syntenic relationship with mouse chromosome                      Ten human genes belong to the EGF family             HEGFL

Distance approximations          are based on the sum of draft clone lengths and estimated          gap sizes obtained from the Draft Human Genome Browser            Three neuregulin genes            NRG  are also in the EGF family            All these genes have orthologs in the mouse          suggesting that multiple duplications of an ancestral          EGFlike gene predated the mousehuman

   HGL  and           FGF on q approximately  Mb          from           BTC  Mouse genes           Btc and           Fgf are located close to each          other in the region of mouse chromosome  syntenic to          human qq The cluster size in the mouse is unknown          because of the lack of sequence data          As expected a novel NBClike gene   is located at          p proximal to           TGFA The distance between the two          genes is approximately  Mb The protein sequence of          NBC is similar to that of SLCA see Figure  but the          genomic structures of the two genes differ Exon          boundaries are only partly conserved and           NBC includes an intron of  kb          longer than the genomic sequence containing exons  of                    SLCA  Portions of the           NBC mRNA are completely identical          to the expressed regions of two human genes on p           DCTN dynactin a homolog of the           Drosophila pGlued gene and           MTHFD methylene tetrahydrofolate          dehydrogenase Figure  Specifically the UTR of           NBC matches  nucleotides of          coding sequence and  nucleotides of the UTR of           DCTN and the  UTR of           NBC matches  nucleotides of          coding sequence and  nucleotides of the UTR of the          published           MTHFD sequence In addition a           nucleotide overlap of           NBC and           MTHFD ESTs in the antisense          orientation is inferred from annotation of GenBank          AC These ESTs correspond to alternate extended          UTR forms of the two genes which are different from          the UTRs of the published fulllength mRNAs          We used public genomic resources to determine whether          chromosomal locations of genes from any one of the four          families EGF SLCA ANK and FGF can be used to predict          the genomic location of novel members of the remaining          families Ankyrins mapped near several known EGF ligand          andor FGF genes Figure  In particular on chromosome          q           ANK is located between           EGF and           FGF and           EGF is proximal to           FGF this gene ordering is          supported both by the Human BAC Accession Map   and          direct HTGStoGB RH mapping It was therefore not          surprising to discover a novel ankyrin           ANKfc immediately distal to           SLCA and thus distal to the           EGF paralog           HEGFL on q          Searching the HTGS database with human NBC and          NBClike cDNA queries yielded draftphase genomic          sequences AL AC AC similar to some          but identical to none of the five HNBC genes described          above Table  NBChomologous exons from these          sequences were combined with Unigene cluster Hs to          predict yet another novel sodium bicarbonate          cotransporterlike gene           HNBC This gene maps to p          where no EGFFGF cluster is currently known to exist          Similarly           SLCA is at q where no          EGFFGF cluster is yet known          To test our hypothesis that the dispersed paralogous          gene clusters are a product of multiple ancient          duplications we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the          EGF SLCA and FGF genes we believe to fall in the          clusters along with their nonhuman orthologs          Neighborjoining and maximum parsimony methods were used          to construct phylogenetic trees for each of the gene          families Figure ac This enabled us to infer the most          likely history of the cluster duplications Figure          d          Two irregularities in Figure dare interesting from          the standpoint of genomic history of duplicated genes           NRG at q is phylogenetically          closer to the p gene           NRG than to any other EGF gene          yet that relationship makes little sense if the          duplication giving rise to clusters at q and q is          far more ancient than that giving rise to the p and lq          clusters as the EGF and FGF data suggest The location          of           NRG at q is therefore          noteworthy because only single members of the other          families are present there and because           NRG is phylogenetically very          distant from the q EGF gene            HBEGF  making either multigene or          singlegene tandem duplications within q highly          unlikely This product of a very recent duplication          involving the p           NRG gene may have been deposited          at q as a random insertion of a newly duplicated gene          away from its ancestral locus in a process similar to          that which deposited some SLCA genes outside of their          ancestral paralogous clusters In addition the history          of the p cluster is somewhat obscure as the p EGF gene          is closest to the EGF gene at q whereas the p SLCA          gene is closest to the SLCA at q as no SLCA gene is          currently known to exist at q With the exception of          these irregularities the duplication history in Figure          dis very well supported by the gene family trees in          Figure acand the full PHYLIP trees data not          shown                            Discussion                  Alternative splicing of SLCA          The existence of multiple cDNA sequences as a result          of alternative splicing is the most interesting feature          of           SLCA Most           SLCA alternative splicing is          accounted for by the selective inclusion or exclusion of          portions of exons     and  In contrast to          these alternatively spliced portions of the gene the use          of exons   and  appears to be a constant          feature of the various isoforms No splice variation is          observed for these exons in any cDNA clones or dbEST          entries examined with the exception of the fetal brain          clone in which exon  contains extra sequence from the          adjoining intron          All intronexon junctions of           SLCA feature consensus splice          site sequences Therefore alternative splicing of           SLCA is not consistent with the          hypothesis that weak or nonconsensus splice sites lead to          intron retention or alternative splicing Instead          yetundetermined           cis acting intronic sequences may          be responsible The recurrent noncoding           SLCA transcripts may escape the          normal mechanisms of nonsense decay   responsible for          degradation of incorrectly spliced mRNAs with disrupted          ORFs          Of all alternative splicing in humans only  occurs          within coding regions             SLCA may be a member of a class          of genes characterized by highly variant and inefficient          splicing a class first suggested by a comparison of ESTs          to genomic sequences   The high degree of          alternative splicing of           SLCA may be the result of          inefficient spliceosomal processing One possible outcome          of such inefficiency IMAGE clone  is not          included in the  isoforms on Figure  This nonlinearly          spliced clone includes unique exons dissimilar to any          exons of any other           SLCA cDNAs A unique fragment in          the exon  region is followed by a correctly spliced          exon B and a part of exon  which splices backwards          from a unique donor site to a unique partial version of          exon  and continues directly to a unique fragment of          exon  terminating at the common late polyadenylation          signal          The UTR of           SLCA is fragmented into six          alternatively spliced exons of which no more than two          appear to be used per isoform and four harbor          polyadenylation signals within expressed repetitive          elements Two alternate terminal untranslated exons of                    SLCA  exons  and  consist          entirely of repetitive elements except for a          nucleotide spacer in exon  The two polyadenylation          sites within exon  are used at roughly equal          frequencies both in experimentally derived clones and          public EST sequences corresponding to           SLCA Alternative polyadenylation          is observed in fewer than  of human genes based on an          analysis of  human UTRs            The structurally invariant carboxyterminal  amino          acids of           SLCA include the  transmembrane          domains characteristic of sodium bicarbonate          transporters The alternatively spliced aminoterminal          portion of           SLCA contains hydrophilic domains          of unknown function It is possible that alternative          splicing of these domains leads to different spatial or          electrochemical specificity For example in chick          cochlea different transcripts produced by alternative          splicing of the           SLO gene homolog of           Drosophila slowpoke  generate          kinetically distinct calciumactivated potassium channels            It is therefore tempting to speculate that          proteins encoded by the alternative           SLCA transcripts might differ in          stoichiometry or in the minimum voltage potential          threshold required to activate cotransporter          function                          SLCA protein sequence comparison to paralogous          genes          Four large blocks of highly conserved amino acid          sequence characterize all known HNBCs Figure  They          correspond to SLCA amino acid positions             and  At both ends of blocks           and  at the carboxyterminal end of block           and throughout block  SLCA has          significant sequence differences from most or all of the          paralogs NonSLCA proteins in the alignment have          considerably greater homology between themselves in the          equivalent regions than they do with SLCA          The exon  and exon  hypervariably spliced          regions correspond to SLCA amino acid positions           and  respectively It is intriguing that short          aminoterminal portions of both of these regions amino          acids  and amino acids  are located in          areas where the sequences of the paralogs are quite          diverged Extensive alternative splicing in these areas          has not been reported for the other paralogs          Alternately used exon d contains an almost perfect           nucleotide polypyrimidine tract This region consists          exclusively of Cs and Ts except for the A at position           of AC It codes for FFSLLLFLTSFFF a          highly hydrophobic stretch predicted by TMPRED to be          within the sixth transmembrane domain of the protein          Exon D is absent from three           SLCA cDNA isoforms Figure           whose ORFs are not disrupted except for the deletion of          the  amino acids corresponding to this fragment TMPRED          analysis suggests that absence of exon D abrogates the          sixth transmembrane domain but does not affect the           remaining transmembrane segments Consequently isoforms          lacking exon D would be predicted to have an          extracellular carboxyl terminus The biological viability          and function if any of such a protein cannot be known          without biochemical analyses However the extracellular          exposition of the normally hidden carboxyl terminus might          be relevant to autoimmunity                          Dispersed paralogous gene clusters containing          SLCAgenes          Four human SLCA genes are each included in a          conserved gene cluster Figure  On q           SLCA is located between genes          encoding           HEGFL and           FGF Figure  The murine          orthologs of           HEGFL and           FGF are in close proximity on          mouse chromosome  suggesting that an          asyetundescribed mouse ortholog of           SLCA may be located in the same          region This putative mouse ortholog of           SLCA  partly contained in the          BAC clone RGMBACP GenBank AC has           similarity to the human gene over  nucleotides          Almost all exon boundaries are conserved between the          coding portions of the mouse gene and           SLCA isoform I However exon           of human           SLCA does not appear in          mouse          Novel human           SLCA paralogs may be predicted on          the basis of the genomic locations of the EGFFGF          clusters The clusters in Figure that contain the          members of at least two of the other three gene families          may also contain yetuncharacterized SLCA genes Only a          deeper sequence coverage of human EST libraries and draft          genomic sequences will help determine if this hypothesis          is correct Ancient conserved paralogous clusters          involving multiple functionally unrelated genes have been          previously suggested to exist in the human genome              However the existence of some SLCA genes          outside conserved clusters suggests that intracluster          rearrangements may have led to the expulsion of these          genes from the conserved clusters Yet other SLCA          duplication mechanisms may have complemented both the          cluster duplication and the subsequent          rearrangements                          Genomic implications of SLCAsplicing and          structure          The genomic structure of           SLCA raises intriguing questions          What properties are unique to tissuespecific          repeatexpressing alternatively spliced genes Are          introns containing repetitive elements spliced out more          efficiently than introns without repeats as appears to          be the case for           SLCA  What spliceosomal          properties are responsible for frequent unconventional          processing in this case of four exons    and           How did the repetitive elements  of the coding          region become incorporated into the splicing framework of          the gene                    SLCA is a case study in the          complexities of splicing To identify such complexities          automated computational approaches to analyzing the          structures of novel genes will have to incorporate          fulllength sequences of multiple longinsert cDNA          clones It is not known how many riddles similar to           SLCA there will be in the          complete human genome sequence Their very existence          suggests however that individually characterizing and          understanding numerous unconventional genes will be a          major challenge                            Materials and methods                  PCRbased screening of cDNA libraries          PCR with the Advantage  Polymerase Mix was performed          in l
