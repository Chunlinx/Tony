        uh do you have any brilliant inedeas about how to reduce crime     no i really dont they need to do more with uh you know the police forces they need to make sure you have more people out on the street i think you know to try to keep track of whats going on and be harder on criminals when they go to court you know make sure they go to jail and they serve all their term   it seems   but other than that i dont really know what about you   well it it seems like such a catch twenty two you know my first inclination is to say stop being so lenient when people do something rotten you keep them in jail and you make them know that your serious youre very serious  uh but then again uh   right   the taxing situation you know how can we pay to keep all these people in jail thats when you say well dont raise my taxes you know maybe we shouldnt lock up the guy who has too many traffic tickets yeah maybe we shouldnt do this and you know and then you stop start eroding it   right   you know i substitute teach i deal with high school kids and   right oh you do   and i i find that attitudes at home are such i mean the kids will curse right in front of my face and they wont even go oops you know they they just have no regard and im not saying theyre gonna turn into criminals but i think its a general trend toward people just relaxing their standards so much and i think thats why we have more crime because parents and schools are not stopping this when the kids are young   thats true umhum oh   and they just keep pushing   i believe i believe thats true i think you have to do more the teachers as well education but before they get to the high school of course because by then theyre pretty much set i think   yeah well you know   you start way back when   yeah generally you know a kidll do something thats outrageous and theyll say well what are you going to do to me and its almost like the criminal system theres not much i can do to them i cant really do anything to them one fellow said i said how about you do your work and he said well how about i throw these scissors at you and instead of getting uh flustered i said well i wish you would because then i can really punish you i can send you to detention et cetera if you just bad mouth me and generally giving me a hard time theres really nothing i can do   umhum right   and and i think you know minor criminals feel the same way like what are they gonna do   right   and and i think thats the the biggest thing that unless people know that youre serious and youre not gonna tolerate that kind of behavior in anybody i this is just gonna keep going   umhum well i think thats like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people dont theyre not cracking down they let them back out on the street they dont really take away their license they dont really make sure they cant drive anymore so people dont think its any big deal and they just go out and do it again nothings gonna happen to them   well we had a yeah we had a big incident at the local high school a teacher who happened to be a parent and four girls were um in a horrible head on accident a drunk driver hit them um the people who were in the car who got hit two of them died and two of them seriously injured this guy you know crossed a divider he had been arrested twice for drunk driving driving um they didnt lock him up they took his license away but they didnt take away his car key   umhum   you know there he was you know its like you know in the old Arab countries you know you steal they take your hand away i mean this guy can still drive as long as he can get into a car hes driving   right umhum so it doesnt do any good people just do it again same thing with when you have like sexual offenders and you dont make sure they have   you know hes just yeah and i   adequate counseling then they just go out and do it again because you havent really fixed their problem at all   right   so and thats probably the problem too because do you bother counseling these people or you make them go to jail will it really do any good to counsel them or is it just gonna waste taxpayers money   well you know i think counseling is kind of like dieting until you decide you really want it to work you know   right right   it its not gonna work anyway you have to cooperate with that kind of stuff i i its a real scary problem i dont know what the answers are   yeah and the problem is yeah i guess thats why we have the problem nobody seems to know what to do about it but yeah thats true yeah     you know and then they bring up the thing about um whether we should have death penalties uh i guess you know the the top of the the bad guy ladder maybe you know some of those people would be affected but theres lots of crime going on besides murder where   right   you know its still out of hand   im just afraid that if you put back in the death penalty every place that people be um the juries wont want to convict a person because what happens if they are theyre really innocent because once and you kill them theyre gone you cant like fix the problem so       therell be that much you know thered be really really worried about sending them to jail when they really should be in jail theyll be like well i dont know and the people who dont wanna put them you know to death who think thats wrong wont convict them either even if they really believe theyre guilty because theyre really just problem on their part things like that   my husband makes a joke about well an armed society is a polite society if if good guys had guns as well as bad guys then you know maybe that wouldnt be but i said nah you still have survival of the fittest because you know then the bad guys would become better at using the guns you know   right right and if nobody had guns they would just use some other
