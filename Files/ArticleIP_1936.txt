                                 Size Does Matter            If you use the termmicroeconomics in a WordPerfect document the spelling checker will flag itand suggest macroeconomics instead The spelling checker has a point Yousee macroeconomics has gone out of fashion Not only academic economists butalso some of our most influential economic pundits seem to regard it as badmanners to talk about recessions and recoveries and how governments mightalleviate the former and engineer the latter Ordinarily reasonable people nowargue that the business cycle is a trivial matter unworthy of attention whencompared with microeconomic issues like the incentive effects of taxes andregulation Trying to do anything about recessions is bad for growth they sayand even thinking about the business cycle is a bad thing because itdistracts people from what really matters            What isso peculiar about this attitude which seems to become more prevalent eachyear is that we live in a world in which those oldfashioned macroeconomicconcerns are more pressing than they have been for generations Not since thedays of John Maynard Keynes have his questions if not necessarily his answersbeen so relevant So an occasional reminder that the big things do matter thatgetting microeconomic policy right is no help if you stumble into a depressionis welcome from any sourceeven a deficient dictionary            To see what Im talking about consider a recentWashington Post column by Robert Samuelson in which he seems to dismiss allmacroeconomic analysisall attempts to understand the behavior of aggregatessuch as gross domestic product and the price levelas useless even malignWhat weve learned declares Samuelson is that the little picture is thebig picture Economic success he argues is simply a matter of getting theincentives right And he goes on to deride macroeconomics for its illusionthat it could make the whole system run smoothly almost regardless of how theeconomys underlying sectors functioned  Its as if a car could run atbreakneck speed even if the engine was corroded and missing some parts            Onewonders why the usually judicious Samuelson found it necessary to invent thisstraw man Who is supposed to have had that illusion Even when Keynesianmacroeconomists were at their most hubristic none of them claimed thatmacroeconomic finetuning could make an economic jalopy into a Porsche Butthey did claim that even a Porsche wont perform very well if you dont give itenough gasthat using three workers very efficiently is not much help if thefourth is unemployed because consumers dont spend enough And this is not anabstract point Just look at the economic storms ravaging quite a lot oftodays world            For example Japans economy has been shrinkingat an alarming pace the last few quarters Is this because Japanese workershave become lazy or because the countrys factories have fallen into disrepairOr to take a more extreme case has Indonesia become a  percent lessproductive society than it was a year ago Of course not Whatever the ultimatesources of the crisis in Asia the immediate cause of these slumps is acollapse in that good oldfashioned macroeconomic variable aggregatedemand            I dontknow what provoked Samuelsons outburst But if one of our most well informedeconomic journalists has come to disdain macroeconomics this may be because hehas been listening to economists themselves Over the past  yearsmacroeconomicsand especially that part of macroeconomics that concerns itselfwith recessions and depressions in which the economy as a whole is less thanthe sum of its partshas fallen steadily into disfavor within the economicsprofession As late as the mids many textbooks still followed the lead ofPaul no relation to Robert Samuelsons classic  Economics beginning with the macroeconomics of booms and slumps and turning tomicroeconomics only in their second half Nowadays however every textbookyes even the one Im writing relegates macro to the second half Even withinthe macroeconomics half more and more books like the muchhyped new text byHarvards N Gregory Mankiw dwell on safe issues like growth and inflationas long as possible introducing the question of recessions and what to doabout them almost as a footnote            In graduate education the situation has become even moreextreme While most PhD programs continue to require that students take ayear of macroeconomics more and more of that year is devoted to longrunissues less and less to that part of the subject that might tell you who AlanGreenspan is and why he might matter When I gave an honorific lecture at oneprominent department students there told me that their macroeconomics coursedid not even mention money until the last two weeks and never so much assuggested that monetary policy might have anything to do with businesscycles            Thereasons for this aversion to macroeconomics are a little hard to explain to alay person Its not that the business cycle has become less relevantthe USeconomy has lately had a smooth few years but macroeconomics was already inretreat during the anything but tranquil s and s I remember one famousantiKeynesian challenged during an early s conference to explain how hismodel could be reconciled with the savage recession then gripping the UnitedStates snapping Im not interested in the latest residualie the lateststatistical blip Nor did macroeconomics fail the test of empirical relevanceThough it is widely believed that events such as the combination of inflationand unemployment in the s or the noninflationary growth from  to baffled and astounded macroeconomists this turns out to be another of thoseoddly popular antieconomist legendssimilar to the legend that economistsrefused to believe in increasing returns The truth is that stagflation waspredicted as a possibility long before it emerged as a reality and that thedisinflation of the s played out just the way the old textbooks said itshould            The real problem with macroeconomics from aprofessors point of view is the shakiness of its microfoundations Mosteconomic theorizing is based on the assumption that individuals behaverationallythat companies set prices to maximize their profits that workerschoose to accept or reject jobs based on a rational calculation of theirinterests and so on You dont have to believe in the literal truth of thisassumption to recognize how powerful it is as a working hypothesis But whilemacroeconomists generally try to put as much rationality into their models asthey can the kind in which Greenspan does matteralways depend crucially onthe ad hoc assumption of sticky prices In other words they assume that atleast in the short run companies do not immediately reduce their prices whenthey cannot sell all their production and workers do not immediately acceptlower wages even when they have trouble finding jobs This assumptionworks  that is it transforms the otherwise incomprehensible reality ofthe business cycle into something that is not only understandable but to someextent controllable But it makes many economists uncomfortable it is theclassic case of something that works in practice but not in theory            And soeconomists have more and more simply avoided the subject and being humanhave tended to rationalize that avoidance by asserting that the subject isntreally important anyway            The trouble with this evasion is of course thatmacroeconomics is important Paul Samuelson had good reasons forbeginning his textbook with Keynesian analysis He knew that students would notfind microeconomics with its emphasis on efficiency interesting unless theywere first convinced that the economy could achieve more or less fullemployment that it need not relapse into depression He also knew what toomany latterday economists have forgotten Macroeconomics is crucial to thepublic credibility of economics as a whole Analytical modeloriented thinkingcame to dominate American economics mainly because supernerds like Samuelsonhad something useful to say about the Great Depression and their pompouswindy rivals did not By abandoning macroeconomics the profession not onlyleaves the world without guidance it desperately needs it also risks lettingthe fuzzyminded literati reclaim the ground they so deservedly lost  yearsago            Of course the little thingsmatter But the big things matter too and if economists try to pretend thatthey dont one of these days they are going to get stomped on
