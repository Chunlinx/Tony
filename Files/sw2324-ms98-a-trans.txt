            okay   okay um why do you think it um failed do you think we should adopt it   no i dont like the metric system   you dont   i i i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general um background the history of our country has been inches and i dont think theres a big advantage in going to the metric system   umhum   it its gonna disorient it and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they dont understand       um you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is and   yeah   its its not in our national consciousness to do it weve always measured things in the English system   yeah     and you know everything you know our land is in acres our people arent going to understand what an amount of something is   right yeah i agree i agree with you i dont think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system i dont think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people of America   yeah   and also the um  i dont know it seems almost like theres this its a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so well look good to the other nations because i think they thats an area that the other nations especially Europe look down on us like oh were just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who havent really attained it yet       and i feel its just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and its like hey were content with this no its probably not as accurate probably you know intellectually doesnt its not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on  i had six years of college and i dont know the metric system and i dont care to learn it and im not some kind of an idiot i just   i mean its   yeah   and its easy to translate we have a computer for just about everything now and if its necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done   yeah   because im a mechanical engineer and ive had to work when i was designing packages for people i mean i had to to work both systems back and forth and it was not hard   umhum   and you get you can get a CAD CAM system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and itll convert every   measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds   right theres a lot of people like youre educated im educated my husband is but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesnt have any college or i dont know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population   really yeah absolutely   they dont have any college probably much at all and if we cant take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and   oh yeah its just   you know just people that maybe just arent blessed with as as much sharpness and mental mental acuity   or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about it i think its still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools   yeah yeah   and they do i know now because i even when i was in elementary school  years ago they were   umhum   you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements and things like that   right yeah   and and thats acceptable   yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think Americans have so much stress on them right now   because yeah   i mean if you look at the average family its like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas theyre really getting and do all this and its like  i mean come on lets take the pressure off   really yeah you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters   yeah and its just like another thing the American family doesnt need any more pressure just leave them alone let them measure their green bean water in cups and leave them alone   yeah   yeah and it it just doesnt yeah it doesnt make that much difference in the average life in the scientific community and places where its needed   i dont know   you know thats fine and the rest of the world i mean we are uh we if not we may not be the top i dont know if were the top were one of the superpowers of the world   yeah uhhuh thats   it may be arrogant but i mean let them come to us         thats kind of the way i feel about it we can convert   and and if they dont like the way we do it just get off our dont worry about it and i think   yeah it its kind of like expecting expecting everyone to suddenly speak German   right it is because it is another language yeah   you know yeah and and  instead of having the world speak German we found out that we can translate and thats what i think we ought to do with the metric system       thats funny well thats good well i think we kept it at real good   okay     is that all we need to say   yeah i its been nice talking to you   you too i think that was good that was the best one usually i get distracted off the topic you know what i mean   okay   yeah   and well end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania and we were talking about something totally income tax or something and i just     all right   anyway the i appreciate it have a good day   well good talking to you bye bye
