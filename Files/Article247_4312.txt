                                 Why High Interest Rates Are Bad for Stocks                        A couple of notes before the actual substancethank you for refraining fromchucklingof todays column Todays stockmarket action was actually quitefascinating to watch especially once the earlyday plunge was out of the wayUnlike yesterday when stocks fell in unison there was a meaningful divergencebetween stocks today The most obvious example of this was the contrast betweenthe Dows rise and the Nasdaqs fall but the more interesting example was thatby the end of the day most though not all of the tech powerhousesthat isthose with profitshad recovered sharply and were actually up on the daywhile most though again not all of the Internet highfliers in both theeretailer and BB camps were down often sharply As I suggested on Mondaythis kind of divergence is a good and comforting thing since it suggestsinvestors are distinguishing between companies rather than throwing them allinto one big buyorsell pot            The other goodand comfortingthing was that both the New YorkTimes and the Washington Post led with Greenspans reappointmentrather than with the market selloff I realize I wrote about theselloff yesterday instead of Greenspan which might seem to bediscomfiting by my standards but Ive already issued too many hosannas to theGreat Alan for another one to be interesting Until the next one of courseFor that matter the Daily News put the TurnerFonda separation on itsfront page These seemed like nicely measured and somewhat surprisingreactions to what might have been played as a much scarier event than it reallywas            One crucial ingredient in all of todays explanations of the selloff andwe are now entering the putatively substantive part of the column so watchyour heads was of course interestrate concerns Unfortunately itsusually not explained why people who are investing in stocks should be all thatconcerned about interest rates In fact they should beand areconcernedIts just that the reasons for their concern are complicated because interestrates affect stocks in different ways and for that matter because there aredifferent interest rates to be concerned about            The interest rate that most journalists have in mind when they talk aboutinterestrate concerns is not the interest rate that you see at the bottom ofthat bug in the corner of the CNBC screen Thats the interest rate on theyear US bond The rate most journalists are talking about is the federalfunds rate which is the interest rate the Federal Reserve raises or lowers inorder in theory to speed up or slow down the economy by increasing orshrinking the size of the US money supply and indirectly raising or loweringinterest rates on things like car and home loans since banks pass alongchanges in interest rates to their customers It now appears that the Fed willraise interest rates at its February meeting and of late investors have got itin their heads that instead of its typical basispoint  percentagepoint increase the Fed is going to hike rates by  basis points            These interestrate concerns then are concerns that the Feds actions willslow down the economy which in turn will make corporate profits grow lessquickly than otherwise and since investors are paying prices for stocks thatassume very fast profit growth in the future the threat of a slowing economymakes them want to sell            Fair enough But one of the odd things about this most recent selloff isthat with the exception of banks which are always hit hard by interestrateworries the hardesthit companies were those companies whose profit prospectswill be the least hurt by a fedfunds hike If youre a big retailer or analuminum company or even a car company an interestrate hike couldhavethough I stress coulda big impact on your business But if youre Ciscowhich I own or another major supplier of technological infrastructure to bigbusiness youre going to weather anything short of a complete recessionbecause American business shows absolutely no sign of cutting back oninvestment And thats because in this competitive environment it cant            So why would interestrate concerns hit the highpriced tech stocks so hardYou might ascribe it simply to panic which undoubtedly played a part Butthere are also two other reasons which have to do with that other interestrate the one on the year bond That interest rate is effectively theriskfree rate of return for any investment you want to make and as theinterest rate on bonds rises bonds become more attractive and stocks lessattractive This has a practical consequence which is that rising rates leadinstitutionsprimarily at this pointto pull money out of the stock marketand put it into bonds And the opposite is true when rates are going in theother direction            But rising rates also have a theoretical consequence thats even moreimportant If you want to figure the present value of a stockwhich is to sayhow much its worth today given how much free cash flow the company is going togenerate in the futureyou need to discount that cash flow by your requiredannual rate of return If your required rate of return is  percent then thetotal free cash generated by the company in  years needs to be divided by to the th power And a crucial component of that rate of return is theinterest rate on the year bond since you know you can get that without anyrisk at all            If interest rates rise then the present value of the future cash generatedby the companyeven if the amount of that cash is unchanged by the rise ininterest ratesshrinks Even a relatively small rise in interest rates canhave a major effect on that present value if its spread out over  years Andsince the stock prices of the most valuable companies in the world today infact reflect investors confidence that theyre still going to be generatinghuge amounts of cash  years from now rising interest rates can have seriouseffects on current stock prices            In the endalthough youll hear plenty of people tell you that this is anoldfashioned ideaa stocks price is a mechanism for discounting the futureAnd as the discount rate rises its not surprising if stock prices fall Theequation is not automatic or perfect But in the long run itsunavoidable
