                                  The Reverse Domino Theory            During the Cold Warenthusiasts for American military action abroad invoked the domino theory Ifone country was allowed to fall to communism many others would follow In thedebate over Kosovo opponents of American military action including many ofthose former enthusiasts invoke a sort of reverse domino theory If we saveanyone from mass murder or humanitarian disaster well find ourselves doing itagain and again Moral consistency requires us to do nothing in Kosovo becausewe cant intervene every time a thug like Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevicdecides to start slaughtering his own citizens            Thats not the onlyargument against the Kosovo intervention But is it true Would it really be animpossible burden to stop every moral outrage on the level of KosovoIsolationist pundits give the impression that the world outside the UnitedStates is a boiling cauldron of centuriesold ethnic rivalries in which massslaughters are everyday occurrences In fact attempts at genocide are fairlyrare            The term genocide is often invoked rather wildly Russiannewspapers love to talk about the genocide against Russianspeakers in theBaltic states for example while European intellectuals like to accuseHollywood of committing cultural genocide But genocide has a precise anduniversally accepted definition acts committed with intent to destroy inwhole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group accordingto the  Genocide Convention            The United States hasbeen using the term genocide cynically Washington studiously avoided the Gword in describing the killings in Rwanda where it clearly applied Bycontrast State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin has been tossing it aroundliberally in the last few weeks even though human rights groups say theyhavent yet been able to document that genocide is underway in Kosovo            Suppose the United States along with its allies put thehorse before the cart again and committed itself to stopping genocide whereverit occurred How many military actions would that have required in say thepast  years before Kosovo Answer three definites and one maybe Thedefinites are Bosnia Rwanda and Iraq while the maybe is Somalia            In Bosnia genocide wasarguably underway as early as the summer of  but the United States did nottake military action until  In the interim thousands of lightly armedtroops from NATO countries stumbled around Bosnia in their UN blue helmetstrying to feed victims and stay out of harms way This was a gruesome farceand the United States should have acted much earlier with substantialfirepower to overwhelm the Bosnian Serb leadership            Unfortunately the media have tended to explain genocidesas the spontaneous action of one group motivated by insatiable hatred ofanother But thats not how genocides work Yes ethnic hatred runs deep in theBalkans but Milosevic had to deliberately fan it in order to start the warand the genocide like all genocides was planned and executed by a relativelysmall group of extremely evil people            Rwanda is an even moresalient example of this Perhaps because Western journalists knew so littleabout the country their reporting suggested that the HutuTutsi conflict wasso deeply rooted it was unstoppable One hears it endlessly from experts onTV talk shows These people have been killing each other for hundreds ofyears and theres nothing we can do about it Even if you know nothing aboutHutu and Tutsi this argument has no logic The point is that the two ethnicgroups have been living in peace for a long period and something happened todestabilize that peace Thats why its in the news and thats why you youignorant windbag have been invited on television to discuss it            In fact a relatively small group of Hutu planned andexecuted the Rwandan genocide They had to coerce and intimidate many of theirfellow Hutu to go along with themthousands of Hutu were also slaughtered inthe genocide for failing to join in They used the mass media especiallyradio to broadcast their bloody exhortations And they used the silence of theoutside worldespecially France Belgium the United States and the UnitedNationsto justify their actions            Saddam Husseins gassingof the Kurdish population in  falls outside the arbitrary year ruleFrom March to September  the Iraqi army seized every Kurd in a vastprohibited area and carted off nearly  civilians for execution italso used chemical weapons against the Kurdish population The outside worlddid not know the full extent of the killing until reports after the fact Butthose reports established Baghdad as a genocidal regime So when the Kurdscame under Iraqi attack again in  there was good reason to fear thatanother genocide was in the offing although President Bushs real motivationwas defending the stability of Turkey where the Kurds were fleeing            Somalia technically was not a genocide The  faminelacked the central direction of a genocide and its victims were not murderedon the basis of race ethnicity nationality or religion But it was amassive politically inspired slaughter which certainly justified foreignintervention            The fact that I cantresist including Somalia shows the difficulty of maintaining any clear linebetween situations that justify intervention and those that dont No doubtthere would be other occasions that clearly met the standard where interventionwas unrealistic For example no reasonable person would expect the UnitedStates to invade or bomb Turkey to stop genocide against the Kurds            But even a fuzzy and occasionally failed standard would bean improvement on the ad hoc and random decisions we make now A standard forintervention that was universally accepted and regularly if not uniformlyapplied might even reduce the number of occasions when intervention would beneeded If a Milosevic knew with reasonable certainty that ethnic cleansingwould be prevented and punished he might not attempt it            The main point though is that there arentactually all that many Milosevics in the world Of the three and a halfgenocides in the past decade the United States and others actually didintervenealbeit too late or ineptlyin two and a half Iraq Bosnia andSomalia Only in Rwanda did the West stand by and do nothing A cleanerconscience is not an impossibly ambitious goal
