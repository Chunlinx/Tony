        okay what kind of pet do you have Gail     well i dont i have children  i have little children both of my kids are under two so right now we dont have pets but weve had lots of them in the past   oh you have children have you uh what have you had   umhum well we had a dog before we moved here uh and we couldnt bring her with us we came from Colorado and weve had hamsters and fish and birds and   oh well youre going to have lots of pets with your children growing up  well we had a a Schnauzer that we lost this summer and he was fourteen years old and uh   cats uhhuh   weve had two Schnauzers and before that we had all Dachshunds and i think my husband wants another Dachshund and were trying to debate because our children are grown and and uh i dont know whether we really want to be tied down to a pet you know another dog and we do have a very loving cat thats you know kind of our baby   umhum   and uh and we like pets we like them around we have grandchildren that run through and they think we should have a dog and thats because they have a Great Dane  which is huge   um yes definitely well we you know if it um if it were just more peaceful you know with the little ones we would definitely have a pet i just think its nice have around we had a cat though that had kittens so any pet that i get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered   oh yes yes   because uh i did that experience was awful   yes i have never wanted a thats why weve never gotten a female you know in anything and uh uh   umhum   and our male cat you know we had uh neutered right away and course it he doesnt know it and hes still out partying     um   but um you know i do think that maybe well get a female next time and just had her have her spayed you know and uh   well a lot of times now when you buy them from like the SPCA or   yes   and the humane societies or whatever their adoption includes their spaying   yes yes which i think is a good thing it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved and you know   so humum umhum   it uh plus uh you know the safety factor and stuff well we enjoy having pets we uh you know i think theyre a lot of company and and when my mother lived with us uh the cat was really hers and and he was kind of wild our our daughter found her and brought her to us and uh that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap and she was the only one at first that you know could really hold him you know because he was really skittish but it was like he knew   oh umhum   you know and hed sleep with her and so he was a lot of company to her you know and and just love her and hes cats are usually so independent but this one you know he comes up and he crawls up next to my husband now you know uh   yeah   hes you know  right before the dog died we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side and the cat would sleep on my husbands side you know  and when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row       uhhum my husband thats one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us our dog wasnt interested in even coming in our room but our cat would sleep with us and he hated that   uhhuh did he   umhum he just thought that they belong and when hed shed walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that   uhhuh     so i guess its probably probably if we get another animal it probably wouldnt be a cat even though i love cats i think it would probably be a dog and it would definitely be an outdoor animal   uhhuh umhum i think thats one of the reasons our because as i said our our Schnauzer was old       and so he was becoming incontinent and so then i would generally have messes in the house and i think thats one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with you know   umhum oh yeah   and uh and it was new carpeting and you know it just just really you know upset me no end and uh   umhum oh that would Gregs um my husbands grandparents have a dog and they just it needs to be put to sleep but its grandpas dog and he he is really getting too old to take care of it but the dog messes all over the carpet and my daughter is just nine months old   oh   and so then she crawls on the carpet oh the smell i mean its just really awful and thats thats one real drawback but   umhum   you know i guess youll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough   yes you will you will you know we were trying to decide uh you know about putting him to sleep he was just you know he was getting so old and had that other problems too and and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier you know and and again going through that because our our animals are almost like our kids in some ways you know and and you grieve just as much over them when they go   umhum   you know as you would a child and and you know our son and and his wife and our daughter and her husband the grandkids all say get a dog get a dog you know and im saying be quiet be quiet and and i can tell my husband you know deep down he you know he really
