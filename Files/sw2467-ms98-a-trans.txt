        so uh describe your family budget   well ive uh for a lot of years i ive pretty much flied without one and uh just recently uh we we set up a budget and and were trying to stick to it we just bought a new house so weve got everything you know pretty much we know what our uh our fixed expenses are per month and then weve got some ones that are variable that that pretty much stay within a certain range and then uh then theres the ones that you never know anything about and thats the the food budget but that   well yeah and to some extent uh utilities i imagine   yeah well the utilities theyre pretty much uh uh you can pretty much uh figure what theyre going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where theyll average them out for you   uh they have that to some extent here but its not quite as good and   umhum   uh transportation expenses i guess you own a car   yes sir   and you know how much youre going to drive every week   well i used to um i used to know uh fairly close to exactly how many miles i drove because i i was very convenient i lived uh uh nine tenths of a mile from work   huh   so so was uh you know two miles a day  to and from work  so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot but now ive just bought a new house and im a half hour   uh   and so my uh transportation costs have gone up by uh five times   yeah i understand that we we have a real similar situation ours uh quintupled at least uh so there is a real family budget   yeah pretty much um the problem is there never seems to be enough money uh i have three children and uh it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things that they seem to need and uh of course nothing ever goes down i mean uh i remember you know i have five children total i have three left in the house   yeah   and i can remember years ago when uh school would start and id go buy all five kids you know shoes and i could get out of the out of the uh shoe store without spending more than thirty five dollars nowadays thirty five dollars buys about one pair of shoes   if youre lucky   yeah so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last uh i guess about the last ten years   exempt or nonexempt   im exempt   wow must be nice       part of the high price spread uh no uh well we dont we do but we dont have a family budget we have the fixed things that we have to pay   umhum   and we have the things that are extras but it seems that by and large the extras just dont exist   yeah   and well you know the auto budget car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry   umhum   and insurance is insurance bad there   um ive got uh two older cars there both ones a seventy seven and ones a seventy eight   well weve got one eighty nine   and uh my insurance is about uh it was running about four hundred dollars a year but when i moved to the new town i live in because its a different county which has less crime and uh less you know less highways and so its a cheaper place to live as far as the insurance companys concerned so my my i think my insurance dropped about uh sixty dollars a year   wow thats thats not bad four hundred and something a year thats thats   well its actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars so   thats cheaper than we pay   yeah yeah i was down in Texas for two years and i was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance um they   well here in Colorado its even worse because we have uh no fault   yeah   do you have that there   uh in Maryland they uh they have no fault in Maryland also   well no faults rather funny in Colorado because uh it seems that everyone pays all the time   yeah   instead of just the guilty party pays   umhum yeah its kind of its kind of strange here the way things go uh here if you have an accident and no ones injured the police wont even show up   youre kidding   nope they tell you if nobodys injured you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company   God   well if you i dont know how familiar you are with Maryland but uh especially the the center part of Maryland where i ninety five runs through it is really heavily populated   not at all   and theres just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it take another police force just to answer the traffic   they dont even try to keep up with it   no   God so you lived in Texas for a while   not a bit yes sir   huh   i spent uh couple years down there moved down there in eighty seven and moved out in eighty nine   are where you from originally   uh right here in Maryland   huh so you just basically went home when you had a chance   and my family yeah my family uh didnt like Texas and i had a chance to uh transfer up TI bought a company about seven months after i moved to Texas right here in Hunt Valley   uh thats nice   so i got an opportunity to transfer back and i took it   God thats great uh no im a native Texan   yeah umhum   west Texan   yeah   there is a difference   yeah believe me i know there is i lived in Plano and i dont know if youre familiar with Plano but Plano maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas   yeah   everybody else was an import   well im im a west Texan Lubbock Midland Odessa   umhum yes   Amarillo Dumas Panhandle   yeah   a different world from down there   yeah   so uh Colorados been fun but they have a real problem   um   next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile and every time you look at a look at the mountains   yeah   or think about looking at the mountains you got to throw in a dollar       or or so it seems i i may just be paranoid but that state income tax is just eating me alive   yeah yeah they have a state income tax in Maryland but i noticed when i was in the in the in Texas they didnt have a state income tax but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and school taxes and property taxes   yeah yeah property taxes and yeah well Colorado   oh my God ate you alive   inspection you know they have the state income tax   umhum   but then they also have property taxes and they also have sales taxes and they just and they just get you every direction they can   yeah   and i just dont know sir but they it seems like they trying to get you every which way   yeah it sure does um theres uh some good books that ive read um that you might be interested in um Charles D Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night TV and hes got seminars you can go to and they try to hook you into his organization which costs about four hundred bucks   oh yeah   but hes got a couple of books out one of them is called um  Wealth Without Risk   ive heard of the book   yes its a very good book its tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do   legally   what to do with the money that you save   legally cut money on your taxes huh   yes  yes sir legally legally cut money on your taxes and on your uh insurance and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to uh uh you know be wealthier uh he also has a new book out that i purchased right before i moved and havent had a chance to uh crack it open yet um Financial Self Defense i believe is the name of it uh the man uh has a lot of good ideas some of them i already knew about some of them i had already practiced but i suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because uh   and that includes everyone at TI   yes yes im one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety one yes   well even the you know the non exempts technically yet we havent had our salary frozen yet   yet   but when youre only at living wage it doesnt matter   yeah   you know survival is a funny state   yeah i know what you mean i uh when i was in Dallas i was supervisor and i had uh four non exempts um under me   yes   and uh i i was appalled at what the hell they were paying them i just couldnt believe it   did well ive been with the company sixteen years now i was a WF for several years   umhum   it just never never seems to improve it it and it doesnt seem to get much better for the exempts either unless youre twenty eight or above   yeah   its really a shame   well i ive this company that they bought they ended up buying a very high payroll   oh   and uh the you know uh i thought i was making a good wage you know high wage till i came
