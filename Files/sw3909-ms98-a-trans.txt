                 hi this my names Bridgette   Bridgette this is Maureen   hi nice to meet you um do you know what were supposed to talk about   yeah if theres something wrong with the school system   yeah so are you ready then okay   sure   i press one dont i okay ive never done this before so  okay   right oh       you there okay   uhhuh okay so what do you think is wrong with the school system   well you know i was listening to uh Sixty Minutes i think the other night they had Andy Rooney on there  and one of the comments he was making is that um   uhhuh   you know part of the problem is uh parents and um their lack i guess of uh interest in the kids in school and he said do you know basically until we change that uh were not gonna have the kids uh get any smarter because um you know theyre not encouraging their kids to do well in school so     uhhuh   otherwise were not gonna ever achieve a good education system unless we really get the parents involved   yeah i agree with that but thats  coming from because im in college right now and seeing how the school systems are my moms a teacher thats very hard to do in some areas you know its like they sent   umhum yeah   and i know where my mom teaches you know and she teaches in like a lower class part of Plano and where it is is they just send their kids to school and you know they dont care if they do their homework if they dont do their homework whatever   right   so she says its very hard from that aspect i mean shell call the parents and they you know theyre like well you know thats not my responsibility its yours   um   and i know she gets real frustrated being a teacher that she feels like you know that the parents arent willing to do that which is very scary i think   yeah   another another thing i think though is uh i know now because im getting ready to graduate and friends of mine that are getting teaching degrees are um people that arent getting a masters are having an easier time uh getting a job because they can get paid less   oh yeah   and it seems like theyre just compromising good qualified educated teachers just for someone they can pay less and they get they dont get paid much now and i think thats really bad   yeah its kind of a shame that um we dont put emphasis and money where we really should i mean weve never really paid teachers real well   uhhuh   weve never paid um other public servants like the police and such very well it is kind of a shame um   yeah   there are some times i think that uh you know the quality of teachers may be improved upon i think what they did a few years ago was kind of a joke about testing the teachers and all   yeah uhhuh i think it was   um i think that  i think that theyre made some changes you know into um the the kind of courses that should be involved in education curriculum and um trying to improve improve upon them uh somewhat but um theyve never really paid you know real well and and you know people have to  pick a an occupation thats gonna support themselves it cant be all sacrifice and no you know salary  you got to live on something   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   but   i think its hard though because even like the like in high school and stuff you take the standardized tests and stuff and i know people that you know are like dyslexic i mean i know people in college that are like dyslexic   umhum um   that i wonder how they pass through all their school you know all their years of school   yeah   and pass through all the tests that they had to pass through and so forth to get to college because they have the hardest time you know  things like that always make me wonder too i mean they make all these tests but are they really proving anything   umhum yeah true and you know some people are much better test takers than others um   yeah thats definitely true   some people you know um just really clam up when it comes to a test and theyre so nervous about well is there a is this a trick question and instead of being real straight forward and just trying to answer it they   umhum   um give themselves you know worse grade because they were so anxious about it   see yeah   and then other people you know arent that upset about it and they test very well so there has to be different ways of of testing sometimes you know because um that isnt always a real good reflection of if the persons learned it or not   umhum yeah i agree i think theres just so many problems now with  just kids you know younger these days and all the problems they have and all the problems like in general in the world like with gangs and stuff just being brought into the school is making it worse i think thats not even helping at all   yeah you know uh  i i wouldnt wanna be back in school now i think it uh its a real challenge and you know um i think maybe the kids need more um i dont know counseling or or psychologists you know psychologist or just you know talking about how to get along in life if theyre not getting that so much from home   yeah
