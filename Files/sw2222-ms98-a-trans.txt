                so whats your favorite team or do you have a favorite team or   well i uh id have to say my favorite team would be Cincinnati Bengals   Bengals   umhum   yeah uh i was uh i was pulling for the Bengals when they uh lost the Super Bowl   oh that was sad wasnt it     two years ago was it   yeah yeah yeah that was just a couple of years ago   yeah i i pulled for them for the sole reason because i didnt want ers to win       anybody who plays the ers really   yeah well uh its kind of hard to uh to know what to do with some of these teams and theyre either extremely strong or very very weak and uh nothing much in between   yeah yeah thats true uh my favorite team is are is are the Raiders   oh you like the Raiders   yeah i mean ive liked them ever since the season that they won the Super Bowl last i think it was eighty four i think it was   umhum uhhuh   and uh i pretty much like them ever since that and they havent they havent produced since then but   no   but       least ive stuck with them im loyal   uhhuh well that that and thats the important thing i mean whether they win or lose why the fun is is in the supporting them   yeah   and staying with it and hoping that uh you know the next time is a better time around   yeah what other teams uh do you like up there   well um   or do you not watch much football   oh i love football   oh really   oh watch it uh every every game thats on i watch   every Sunday and Monday   yeah and Thursday nights   oh thats right     no there uh well lets see i never use thought about football too much yet   yeah me either its kind of like they they gave me the topic and im like football jeez its been a long time   yeah right uh uh   did you know that theyre playing a game today   yeah thats the World League   yeah   yeah what time is that supposed to be   theyre playing it right now   oh are they   yeah i think its uh ABC thats carrying it its either ABC or NBC one or the other i think im not too sure one of the major stations its uh Barcelona versus New York   oh hum well uh i havent for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer from from the the World League   yeah the temperatures just not right   yeah yeah and uh it just seems like it should only be done in cold weather   yeah   rather than just be played at anytime anytime during the year   we usually dont uh we usually dont have very cold weather down here you know during uh during football season it it gets colder later on in the season   umhum   but it takes a good while for it to get cold   huh   but couple couple Christmases ago we had a a freak storm and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of North Carolina   ooh   and uh what they they called it like a winter hurricane and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain it just brought a lot of snow and basically it rain it it snowed only on the coast but not inland   uhhuh   so the coast was completely we had like ten foot snow drifts which in the coast we barely get an inch of snow a year   oh is that right   yeah and so we you know because being near the water we get less snow than anybody else   yeah   and this time we had a bunch of snow we we i had fun playing in in the snow playing football in the snow and so i mean i i had never done that before and its its so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and it doesnt matter because its snow and yeah     is that right huh i would think uh that if you were real cold and you hit uh hit the ground that it would seem to hurt more   yeah well we had like layers of clothing to keep away the snow   well that helps doesnt it   yeah but the snow also helps you know and it it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didnt really feel it   oh yeah     you just felt the hit of the person but when you hit the ground it was you know just snow it was it was pretty fun but its its a lot better to play it in the cold weather thats true   umhum yeah right right   what kind of weather you having right now   well right now were having nice weather i i probably say in in the upper sixties maybe lower seventies right now   oh my well our weathers suddenly turned cold again uh our weather is so unstable you never know   yeah especially at this time   yes and uh this morning why it was raining and it was quite cold and then it seemed to warm up somewhat and then before uh before i got out of church it cooled off again so much so that i uh stopped at home to change coats because i had to go down to the hospital and uh the coat i had on was just too light in weight   yeah is it very windy up there now   yes very strong winds   yeah we had some pretty strong winds pick up this morning and theyve been up been with us all day well   well been awfully nice talking with you   yeah this is the first time ive talked with someone up north really mostly ive been talking with people in Texas     yeah right right most people seem to be there out there   seems like they have ninety percent of the people calling from Texas   right okay well good talking to you   yeah nice talking to you too bye   uhhuh byebye
