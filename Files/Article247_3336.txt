                                 Its the Empty Materialism Stupid            In bad times outsider candidates run against the economic status quo Ingood times it seems they strain to do exactly the same thing Probably themost distinct theme to emerge thus far among the leading challengers toquasiincumbent Al Gore in the  presidential race is that the materialwealth of America in the s has brought with it a sense of spiritualdiscontent            The official slogan of the George W Bush campaign is Prosperity With aPurpose which W explains by pointing out that prosperity alone is simplematerialism In his armies of compassion address in Indianapolis heelaborated a bit more The invisible hand works many miracles Bush saidBut it cannot touch the human heart            Bill Bradley has been saying essentially the same thing On Meet the PressSunday Tim Russert asked Bradley to identify the biggest problem confrontingAmerican society in the next century Bradley cited two issues race and thelack of meaning There is something thats going on in the country that iswidely felt and that is people searching for some meaning in their life thatis deeper than the material he said I think that that is a profoundreaction to the materialism of our time and to the hollowness of life if youreonly interested in material things            Its hard to disagree with such sentiments but its even harder tounderstand why Bush and Bradley are turning them into focuses of theircampaigns Dont they remember Jimmy Carters malaise speech Dont theyremember Hillary Clintons politics of meaning fiasco Americans tend to beallergic to politicians dabbling in vague spiritual criticism and for goodreason Were electing someone to run the government not minister to thecondition of our souls            You also have to wonder just whose feelings these guys are trying to voiceEven in flush times like these its hard to imagine that a large segment ofthe electorate feels burdened by the spiritual side effects of excessivewealth While presidential candidates spend a good deal of time among peoplewith too much money on their hands theyre called thousand dollarcontributors this is surely not a significant voting block            But perhaps such comments are intended less for those who feel afflicted bythis particular form of ennui than for the larger group capable of resentingthe rich On this reading denouncing the spiritual fallout of excess wealth isa sophisticated variety of economic populism tailored to an audience of peoplewho fully hope to get rich themselves Like greed materialism is a vice thattends to afflict those with more money than oneself The problem isnt moneyIts the values of people who have money Here the multimillionaires Bradleyand Bush may have stumbled upon something rather clever a kind of richcandidates class warfare Shunning shallow materialism is a way to expresscontempt for the upper class while being a member of the upper class            Still the candidates are going to have trouble pulling this off The lastrich president to benefit from class warfare was Franklin Roosevelt FDR coulddo this not just because of his sense of noblesse oblige but because he hadpolicies to propose that would rein in the rich Bush and Bradley dont haveany practical suggestions Instead of taxing and regulating the malefactors ofgreat wealth into submission they merely suggest we feel sorry for them            Al Gore hasnt said anything about empty materialism yet so he still mayhave a chance to differentiate himself If I were he I think Id respond bysaying that excessive prosperity is now a problem for just a fewand that thenext president should see to it that it afflicts as many of us as possible
