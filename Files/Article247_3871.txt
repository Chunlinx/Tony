                                 iFortunate Soni Revisited            It took me about an hour on Monday to figure out that Fortunate Son  the book that accuses GeorgeW Bush of getting arrested for cocaine in  was a crock see Busting Bushs Biographer I say this not to congratulate myself wellnot merely to congratulate myself but to ask why St Martins Press whichannounced yesterday that it was suspending publication of the book wasunable to make a similar determination before shipping  copies to bookstorescopies that it has so far not recalled by the way These peopleevaluate books for a living Why couldnt they smell the huge fish rotting inthe top drawer            The answer is that book editors and especially some of those at StMartins are very skilled at holding their noses People often assume thatbooks are more reliable than newspapers and magazines because they are printedon higher quality paper and bound between hard covers Nothing could be furtherfrom the truth Book publishers have the lowest editorial standards injournalism with the possible exception of the Drudge Report andSalon which after putting the rumor into play in August and hyping the charges in Hatfields book  is now reporting on the scandal as a disinterested thirdpartyobserver            In news journalism editors assume a degree of responsibility for theveracity of what they edit If a newspaper reporter quotes anonymous sourceshis editor will usually want to know their identity so he can reach someconclusion about whether they are trustworthy Many magazines employfactcheckers whose work is premised on the booksaremorereliable fallacyIn book publishing by contrast editors avoid getting involved in issues ofreliability Before the Dallas Morning News exposed him as an attemptedmurderer and he went underground JH Hatfield told me that his editor onlyknew who one of his three alleged anonymous sources was I stipulate that Ihave no idea whether this is true since St Martins employees refused allcomment Nothing in a book is ever factchecked And when the contents of abook are attacked the editor is not obliged to defend them or even to have anopinion on the matter            Thomas L Dunne the editor at St Martins Press under whose imprintFortunate Son appears has taken this position explicitly in the pastIn  various individuals and organizations called upon St Martins not topublish a biography of Joseph Goebbels by the Holocaust revisionist DavidIrving In defending his decision to publish the work which St Martinssubsequently dropped Dunne made it clear that he considered it absurd forpeople to expect him to judge the authors reliability I have been toldDunne wrote in his press release that Mr Irving is at the center of muchcontroversy of late and has been accusedand I do not know if this is true ornotof denying the Holocaust After making it sound like he knew about thebook only from reading about it in the newspaper Dunne went on to assert thatfor an editor to sit in judgment of his own books would be censorship            In place of editorial standards book publishers have legal ones While theymay not care whether what they publish is true or not they do care whetherthey can be sued So lawyers vet books like Fortunate Son for libel Buta good libel lawyer doesnt charge his clients  an hour to serve as afactchecker He concentrates on the risk that a living person might actuallysue his client And in an instance like this one a libel lawyer would say thatthe chance of a lawsuit was next to nil even if he suspected that FortunateSon was fabricated out of whole cloth Why Because nonexistent sourcescant sue and politicians dont sue By filing for libel acandidate or elected official would open himself to an openended process oflegal discovery In this case George W Bush would be a fool to allow thatto happen even if he stood a chance of winning a judgment against St MartinsTo sue would mean that Bush would have to answer endless questions about hispast drug use among other things              The lesson of this shameful episode is clear caveat lector  Andcaveat especially lectors of books published by St Martins Press
