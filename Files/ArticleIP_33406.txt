                         Why Grades DontMatter                        While Steven E Landsburgs  gives interestinginsight into the psychology of grade inflation his economic angle is warped atbest As someone two years out of Dartmouth College I can tell you that neverhave my college grades or those of any friend with whom Ive spoken had theslightest effect on salary Even those friends of mine who interviewed withlarge financial firms while still in college were never accepted or rejected onthe basis of their grades Anderson Consulting and Smith Barney seem much moreinterested in hiring middleofthepack English majors who happen to have goodinterpersonal skills and dedication than math whizzes with  GPAsInterviewing talent and wellroundedness that bugbear of Americanuniversities make the difference            This is not to say that academic achievement isntimportant to employers But it is ludicrous to suggest as Landsburg does inhis Mary and Jane example that employers assign tasks and correspondingsalaries based on grades Although employers often do for better or worsegive respect to which college an employee graduated from grades simply do notenter the picture Moreover employees themselves in their late sthose whowere in the graduates very position a few years agodo most of theinterviewing and hiring especially in these larger companies Wise to whatreally makes a good employee at that age theyre much more likely to hem andhaw about that summer you spent watching the tube instead of taking a goodinternship than they are to have doubts about your D in organic chemistry            Even if grades did havethe link to salaries which Landsburg suggests they do no professor withintegrity would let this enter his mind Speaking of the role of the teacher inhis book What Is Called Thinking Martin Heidegger tells us what anygood teacher from kindergarten on up knows The real teacher lets nothing elsebe learned than learning No not knowledge for its own sake but knowledgefor the sake of the individuals intellectual moral spiritual even physicalgrowth The doctor lawyer or business woman is always more professional forcontinuing to pursue these issues outside of his or her profession This seedcan be sown by good professors regardless of what kind of grades they give Tofollow Landsburgs reasoning would not only be to turn Americas bestuniversities into technical schools it would be to ignore this fundamentalpurpose of higher education             Peter Campion                        Cambridge Mass                           Is the Pope aHeretic                        I have just read Michael McGoughs  It seems tome to really miss the point The real point is that his papacy dramaticallydiverges from that of the past  years and his theology is anathema to agreat deal of theology that has been considered Catholic for  years It isthis divergence from traditional theologys most basic teachings that offendstraditional Catholics so much The insistence on Mass in the vernacular is byfar the least objectionable to me It is the new Mass itself that offendsdeeply against the ageold traditional teachings not the vernacular languagesThere are many too many divergences to mention here They range fromtheological importance of the first magnitude to common practices thattraditionally supported the theology being taught            This pope often violates what was taught for manycenturies as holy tradition without any kind of respect for those of us wholived under the old church It was a mortal sin to worship with nonCatholicsbefore Vatican II Mind you not just something wrong but something that wouldseparate you from God and send you to hell if death came before confessionNow the pope himself attends Lutheran and Jewish services as a participantYou can see why many of us do not see this as progress            If traditionalistssometimes sound bitter it should not be something at which to wonder Frombeing called all sorts of unpleasant names to overt discrimination publichumiliation and ostracism traditional Catholics have every reason to distrustand dislike the Vatican II apparatus And count me among those who do

Lessons for Hollywood that says the reason the movie wasso big was because of the wordofmouth theory and the slow gradual opening Ido not deny that this was the perfect way to sell the movie consideringthe scary witch story behind it however I think James Surowiecki is missingthe whole point Please remember what is going on in the movies today I go tothe movies and see a bunch of blood guts and sex I love blackandwhitemovies because back then people were required to write a story that hadmeaning and hire actors who could act  The writing was so goodthat there was no need to shock the audience with eyecatching filth andstupidity This movie was good because it was believable and because it waspsychological instead of eye candy Think about that for a change
