                    Background        The arterial wall remodels in response to hemodynamic        forces imposed on it by blood pressure and blood flow The        processes of arterial remodeling involve regulation of        vascular cell dynamics and control of matrix synthesis and        degradation     Endothelial cell EC proliferation is        observed in flowinduced arterial dilation    and in        vessel luminal expansion in mesenteric arterial collaterals        in the rat     Smooth muscle cells SMC have also been        shown to proliferate in the vessel dilatation remodeling            In the meantime extracellular matrix ECM is        involved in a variety of remodeling processes                including flowinduced arterial dilation     These        observations indicate that cell proliferation and ECM        accumulation are critically involved in vessel remodeling        Furthermore degenerative or destructive changes in both        cellular and extracellular components of the vessel wall        are also evidenced in many situations involving vessel        dilatation changes The internal elastic lamella of        arteries is shown to form gaps prior to vessel dilatation        in an experimental arteriovenous model in rabbit carotid        artery     Collagenase and matrix metalloproteinases        MMPs have been observed to be upregulated during vessel        dilation either in flowinduced model    or in a        poststenotic dilatation            Several growth factors in particular TGF have been        shown to be involved in vessel wall remodeling with respect        to both cellular proliferation and ECM accumulation               Cell apoptosis has been shown to play a role in        various remodeling processes     including        hypertensioninduced remodeling    and subnormal shear        stress induced endothelial cell apoptosis            Interestingly TGF super family has been related to        apoptosis in vascular cells     However whether        flowinduced arterial dilatation may also associated with        apoptosis and how it might be coordinated with cell        proliferation in a large elastic artery remain unclear The        present study was aimed to assess gene expression of both        TGF and apoptosis related molecules in early response of        the artery to an increase in blood flow in rat abdominal        aorta                    Methods                  Animal model of aortocaval fistula          The aortocaval fistula ACF     was created          between the infrarenal abdominal aorta and the adjacent          vena cava in male SpragueDawley rats weighing  g          All procedures were carried out following the guidelines          set forth in the           Resource Manual for the Care and Use of          Animals in Research and Teaching at Stanford          University  Surgical procedures were carried out          with sterile technique under a surgical microscope Rats          were under general anesthesia with an intraperitoneal          injection of sodium pentobarbital  mgkg Through a          midline abdominal incision the infrarenal abdominal          aorta and the inferior vena cava were visualized The          aortic blood flow was stopped by a microvascular clamp          placed  mm above the iliac bifurcation A sidetoside          ACF was constructed by a needle puncture method using a          guage needle The outer wall of the aorta distal to          the clamp was pierced with the needle which was then          advanced into the vena cava The needle was subsequently          retrieved and the arteriotomy was closed with  silk          suture The clamp was then removed and the vena cava was          evaluated for bright red color an indication of a          successful ACF The abdominal wall was closed with silk          suture The skin was then closed with microsurgical          clips Sham operated rats underwent the same surgical          procedure except that only the aortic wall was pierced          and subsequently closed without ACF construction                          Time course of study          Animals were sacrificed  and  days    and           weeks after surgery n   for each time point Equal          number of sham operated and age matched animals served as          controls Two sets of animals were used One was for          extraction of total tissue RNA and protein and one for          perfusion fixation for histology                          Blood flow measurement and wall shear stress          calculations          Blood flow rate mLmin in the infrarenal aorta was          measured by micro Doppler velocimetry before and          immediately after ACF construction and again at the end          of the experiment Wall shear stress WSS was calculated          using the HagenPoiseuille formula            W     Qr  where            W is WSS in newtons per square meter          Pa  is the blood viscosity  poise Q is blood          flow rate mLs and r is arterial lumen radius          centimeter                              Sampling and perfusion fixation          The infrarenal aorta of  mm long starting  mm          proximal to the fistula was harvested and immediately          frozen in liquid nitrogen for extraction of total RNA and          protein by using Trizol Reagent Life Technologies Inc          Rockville MD For histological study the animals were          perfusion fixed through a catheter in the left ventricle          of the heart with  paraformaldehyde at room temperature          and at a pressure of  mmHg for  minutes This was          performed in an attempt to preserve the physiological          architecture of the vessel wall and to prevent the vessel          from collapsing as described previously     The aorta          was then taken and further fixed in  paraformaldehyde          for two more hours The standard site for sectioning was          at  mm proximal to the fistula orifice which is          equivalent to the middle portion of the samples for total          RNA extraction Paraffin embedded and frozen sections          were prepared as needed                          Ribonuclease protection assay          Relative mRNA levels were assessed using ribonuclease          protection assay RPA to determine gene expression of          growth factors and apoptosis related molecules          Nonradioactive RNA probes were transcribed from          multiprobe template set for rat cytokines rCK and a          set for rat apoptosis factors rAPO Pharmingen San          Diego CA     An in vitro RNA transcription kit          Promega Madison WS was applied with the addition of          biotinUTP for labeling the probes Roche          Indianapolis IN The sensitivity and specificity of the          probes were carefully tested before starting the          experiment Five micrograms of total RNA from each animal          were hybridized with the probes and an RPAIII kit          Ambion Austin TX was used for RPA following the          manufacturers protocols The protected fragments of the          probes were resolved in  denaturing polyacrylamide gel          followed by blotting to a positivelycharged nylon          membrane The resolved probes were detected using          BrightStar kit Ambion and exposed to films The          resulted films were scanned and densitometry was          performed with NIH Image program version  National          Institutes of Health Bethesda MD The relative values          of protected probe fragments were expressed as a ratio of          their densitometry values over those of GAPDH          glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase in the same          lane The mean and SD were calculated for each time          point                          Western blot analysis and          immunohistochemistry          Western blotting analysis was performed for analyses          of TGF and  as well as BclxS All procedures were          published previously      In brief protein samples          of  g in   sodium dodecylsulfate loading buffer were          fractionated by  sodium

    antibodies  conjugated with horseradish          peroxidase for  hour at room temperature The blots were          washed three times in phosphatebuffered saline and the          protein complexes were detected with enhanced          chemiluminescence detection reagents according to the          manufacturers protocol Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc          Piscataway NJ The presented data are the results from          three animals in each of the time points Protein samples          from each animal were fractionated on more than one gel          in duplicate or triplicate          Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin          sections  micron in thickness following previous          protocols     The same antibodies used for western          blotting were used for

apoptosis          detection          Incorporation and detection technique    of          bromodeoxyuridine BrdU was used to assess DNA          synthesis during cell proliferation Three injections of          BrdU Sigma St Louis Mo  mgkg body weight were          administered intraperitoneally to the animals   and           hours before they were humanely killed Immunodetection          of BrdU incorporation was performed on frozen sections          with a detection kit Roche The cell type of          BrdUincorporated cells was assessed histologically In          addition an antibody against actin Enzo Diagnostics          Inc Farmingdale NY was used to confirm SMCs in the          media The number of BrdUlabeled nuclei was counted from          each whole cross section The mean and SD were obtained          from three animals for each time interval and the cell          proliferation rate was expressed as a number of labeled          nuclei per section Terminal deoxynucleotidyl          transferasemediated dUTP nick endlabeling TUNEL          method was used to demonstrate apoptosis in SMCs and          endothelial cells     The TUNEL was performed on          frozen sections An in situ cell death detection kit          Roche was used for TUNEL with modifications Nuclei of          apoptotic cells were thus labeled with fluorescein and          the sections were counterstained with propidium iodide          and observed under laserscanning confocal microscope          BioRad MRC  Hercules CA Negative controls were          included by omitting the labeling buffer Positive          controls were obtained by digestion of the sections with          deoxyribonuclease I for  minutes at room temperature          before the detection procedure Labeled nuclei were          counted per section The mean and SD of each time point          were obtained from three animals for statistical          analysis                          Histology and morphometry          Cross sections from the perfusion fixed specimens were          stained with HE and Masons trichrome staining The          sections were digitized by tracing the contours of the          lumen the internal elastic lamella and the external          elastic lamella The lumen diameter was calculated from          the circumference of the lumen The external diameter was          calculated from the circumference of the external elastic          lamella The average wall thickness was the difference of          the two diameters divided by  Mean and SD were          calculated from  sections of

the infrarenal aorta by more than           folds after surgery Table  Morphometry revealed an          increase in lumen diameters The lumen diameter started          to increase at  week after ACF although this change did          not reach statistical significance At  weeks and          thereafter the lumen diameters were significantly larger          than those of controls which were accompanied with          decreased wall thickness Figure and table                           Expression of cell growth related cytokines          RPA using the multiple probes of rCK revealed an          upregulation of both TGF and TGF gene expression          The relative mRNA levels of them increased with a peak at           days The levels declined after  days and returned to          control levels Figure  left panels Western blot          analysis showed an increase in the protein levels with a          similar trend to mRNA levels for both TGF and           Figure  right panels Moreover TGF protein levels          remained high at  week These changes preceded the          aortic enlargement which happened at  weeks          Immunohistochemistry revealed detection of both TGF          and  after flow increased The increased expression          peaked at  and  days compared to controls The          expression of these growth factors was closely associated          with immunohistochemical staining Figure  The SMC in          the inner and outer zones of the media seemed to be more          involved in the expression of these growth factors                          Expression of apoptosisrelated molecules          RPA with the multipleprobe of rAPO showed that          relative mRNA levels of Bclx short isoform BclxS          known as proapoptotic factors initially decreased at           day  days and  week followed by returning to base line          level after W Figure  There was an increase in          caspase and Bax mRNA levels at W Other factors did          not show significant changes Western blotting analysis          showed a similar trend of mRNA level for BclxS Figure           but statistical outcome did not reach significance          Immunohistochemistry did not show any apparent detection          of these molecules                          Cell proliferation          Cell proliferation was remarkable for both EC and SMC          with EC more significant than SMC Figure  BrdU          incorporated nuclei were observed in the media along the          endothelial line and in the adventitia The incorporation          rate for endothelial cells increased at  week and          thereafter P   vs controls and the          incorporation rate of SMC increased at  weeks P            vs controls Table                           Cell apoptosis          Apoptosis of vascular cells was assessed by TUNEL          method in all animals There was no remarkable difference          in apoptosis rate after ACF creation data not          shown                            Discussion        Vascular wall remodeling in response to hemodynamic        alterations has been known closely related to lesion        development in the arterial wall       Arterial        wall shear stress is proven to be a critical factor in        regulation of vessel diameter Increase in blood flow or        shear stress induces enlargement of the artery               and decrease in shear stress results in reduction of        lumen diameter of the artery              The present study once again demonstrated that increased        blood flow rate induced arterial enlargement in an        aortocaval fistula model in rats More significantly this        model subjects the abdominal aortic aorta to a condition of        an acute increase in blood flow So far most of vessel        remodeling studies are based on peripheral arteries such        as carotid and iliac arteries There are very few models        using larger and elastic arteries like aorta for study of        flowinduced response     The current model provides a        direct access to the investigation of abdominal aorta with        blood flowinduced hemodynamic alteration        The study showed that the adaptive enlargement was        associated with increased gene expression of TGF and         known as tissue remodeling mediators       Gene        expression of TGF and  was upregulated at  and  days        and  week upon increase in blood flow while the        flowinduced aortic enlargement occurred  weeks after ACF        creation Furthermore the expression of these growth        factors mainly associated with endothelial cells and smooth        muscle cells in the inner media These results suggest that        the function of TGF superfamily may be a prerequisite for        the arterial dilatation and that endothelial cells and the        smooth muscle cells may be responsible for the forthgoing        vessel enlargement        TGF expression is closely associated with an increase        in wall shear stress     and with different forms of        fluid shear stress     and its function is modulated        by variety of factors     For example TGF is        secreted in an inactive precursor and requires        furinmediated maturation     TGF in turn induces        expression of furin It has been demonstrated that both        furin and TGF gene expression was upregulated by fluid        shear stress in vascular endothelial cells Thus the        positive feedback may enhance the effect of TGF on        endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells as        demonstrated by Negishi et al     The present study        demonstrated that fluid shear stress induced regulation of        TGF expression in the larger elastic artery Furthermore        TGF upregulation was associated with cell proliferation        which was significant at almost all time points with EC        more remarkable than SMC TGF superfamily of growth        factors is powerful and subtle regulation of its expression        may exert a remarkable action TGF is a potent regulator        of the cell cycle in many cell types including vascular        smooth muscle and endothelial cells and as a result this        growth factor has been postulated to play an important        though largely undefined role in vascular proliferative        processes     So far little is known about the        modulation role of TGF in vessel remodeling It is known        that TGF plays a role in cardiac morphogenesis mammary        gland development and wound healing and that TGF is        involved in finetuned interactions between epithelial and        mesenchymal cells and their products     The exact        role of TGF in vascular remodeling response remains        unclear It is conceivable that after an acute regulation        of cell proliferation and ECM degradation TGF may exert        a fine tune up between cells and ECM for a reconstruction        of the remodeled wall        The mechanical and biochemical mechanisms of flow or        shearregulated arterial dilatation and the vessel        remodeling have been widely studied     Vessel wall        shear stress exerted by blood flow is a regulating        mechanical force on endothelial cells that has important        physiological and pathological cardiovascular consequences        The endothelial monolayer in vivo acts as a signal        transduction interface for mechanical forces in        particular shear stress Mechanisms related to spatial        relationships at the cell surfaces and throughout the cells        in the wall that influence flowmediated endothelial        mechanotransduction involve many cytokines including TGF        superfamily Furthermore flowmediated ion channel        activation and cytoskeletal dynamics are related to        topographic characteristics of the luminal and abluminal        surfaces of living endothelial cells            Arterial dilatation is thought to be endothelial        dependent      Endothelial proliferation during the        flowinduced arterial enlargement has been shown to be a        characteristic event     The vessel enlargement results        in an increase in lumen surface area while endothelial cell        proliferation assures a continuous cell lining        throughout        Our observation indicated that apoptosis was not        remarkable in the early stage of flowinduced dilatation        although apoptosis has been implicated to play a role in        vessel remodeling     There was little change in TUNNEL        analysis after ACF creation However some        apoptosisrelated factors were regulated For example the        mRNA levels of BclxS were initially decreased at  day         days and  week followed by returning to base line level        after  weeks There was an increase in caspase and Bax        mRNA levels at  weeks Follow up western blotting analysis        was unable to determine the expression trends suggesting        that cell apoptosis regulation in vivo may be too subtle to        be detected        Apoptosis related molecules such as BclxS Bax and        casepase are known to be proapoptotic factors and        involved in variety of vessel remodeling processes              The initial arrest in BclxS gene expression may        momentarily depress apoptosis It is conceivable that        during the early stage of the remodeling cell        proliferation is the dominant response and apoptosis may be        somewhat repressed to favor cell survival This is        contested by the little changes in TUNEL detection                    Conclusions        In summary the experiments demonstrate that gene        expression of TGF and  precedes the flow induced        arterial enlargement and is associated with cell        proliferation Expression of apoptosisrelated molecules        such as BclxS Bax and caspase seems to be little        regulated in the early stage of this vessel remodeling        process                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        CX designed the
