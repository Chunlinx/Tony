                                 Gore the Ox            Eversince Al Gore woke up and opened fire on Bill Bradley Gore has vacillatedbetween two lines of attack One is that Bradley is a bigspending liberal Theother is that Bradley is a closet Republican who voted for President Reagansbudget cuts and promoted school vouchers In Wednesday nights debate Gorefinally demonstrated how he plans to unite these two indictments He will tellvoters that Bradleys big spending threatens middleclass entitlements            Goresmessage reflects a cynical lesson of the past six years Defense wins In and  Gore and President Clinton pursued a bold liberal idea mandatinguniversal health insurance Conservatives thwarted them and captured Congressby convincing voters that the plan threatened existing health benefitsparticularly the right of patients to choose their doctors In  and Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole pursued a bold conservative idea reducing the sizeof government to liberate the economy and to let taxpayers keep more of theirmoney Clinton and Gore thwarted them and defeated Dole by convincing votersthat Republican budget cuts threatened Medicare To cynics the lesson of thesewars is that most voters dont care about liberal or conservative principlesWhat they care about is losing the benefits they have            Bradley has proposed to extend health insurance to  percent of Americansthrough subsidies and tax credits Ten minutes into Wednesdays debate alibrarian asked him how much the plan would cost and how he would pay for itBradley said it would cost between  billion and  billion a year andwould be funded either from the surplus or through the enormous savings thatwe can get through the application of technology to the medical system suchas moving things from paper to Internet            When Gore got his next chance to speakin response to a different questionheturned back to the cost issue He said his own health insurance plan whichwould ostensibly cover  percent of the American people and  percent ofall children would cost  billion over  years plus a prescriptiondrug benefit  under Medicare for  billion over  years Citing ananalysis by Emory University Gore said Bradleys plan costs  trillionThat is more than the entire surplus over the next  years We have to lookahead and save some of that surplus for Medicare If we wipe out Medicaid andwipe out the chance to save Medicare by funding Bradleys health insuranceplan we would shred the social safety net and give twothirds of the moneyto those who already have health insurance            Thenext questioner asked about campaign reform but Gore refused to let go of thehealthcare dispute Medicare cannot be an afterthought said Gore The onlyway to fix Medicare fairly is to set aside  to  percent of the surplus todo it now Otherwise youre putting Medicare at risk Sen Bradley said in aninterview that he would speak to this issue later on but if you spend theentire surplus on the first campaign proposal then that does not leave moneythat should be allocated for Medicare A few minutes later Gore steered aquestion about education back to the Bradley health plan If the entiresurplus is spent then there is no money left over for new initiatives oneducation he argued            Fromone perspective Gores attack is conservative Liberals habitually championnew programs and entitlements without explaining what they would costConservatives habitually expose and exaggerate the cost of these programswhich they translate into tax increases On health care Bradley is championingan entitlement while Gore is exposingand according to Bradleyexaggeratingits cost            Fromanother perspective Gores attack is liberal Conservatives habituallychampion smaller government and tax cuts without explaining which programswould be reduced and which beneficiaries would suffer Liberals habituallyexpose and exaggerate the suffering caused by these reductions Gore isntsuggesting that Bradleys health insurance plan will force a tax increase Hessuggesting that in order to fund that plan Bradley will have to cut otherprograms particularly Medicare and education            Theadvantage of this critique is that because it is conservative as well asliberal Gore can use it in the Democratic primary and then build on it in thegeneral election In the primary he can tell liberal voters that Bradleyshealth insurance plan would suck up all the oxygen in the budget therebysuffocating the lefts favorite programs If Gore were to complain thatBradleys plan required a tax increase liberals would shrug and vote forBradley By confronting them with budget cuts instead of tax increasesclaimingthat Bradley would shred the social safety net and stifle new initiatives oneducation in order to give twothirds of the money to those who already havehealth insuranceGore gives them pause            In thegeneral election Gore can hold the same ground against the Republican nomineeHe can tell moderate voters that the GOPs risky tax scheme translation taxcuts would eat up the surplus and force deep cuts inremember thisMedicareMedicaid education and the environment And now that the government is insufficiently good shape to stop borrowing from Social Security Gore can tellvoters that he would protect that trust fund whereas the Republican tax cutswould force the government to raid it again Gore also gets the benefit oftriangulation When the Republican nominee portrays Gore as an arrogantWashington politician who wont give back the tax money you overpaid thegovernment Gore can remind voters that he defended fiscal responsibilityagainst Bradleys reckless spending as well as the GOPs reckless tax cuts            Goresaccuracy can certainly be disputed Bradley has already accused him ofexaggerating the cost of Bradleys healthcare plan Likewise Republicans canaccuse Gore of overestimating the cost of their tax cut and underestimating theprojected budget surplus And reporters can question Gores inference that anycandidate who fails to reserve  percent of the surplus for Medicare isputting the program at risk and wiping out the chance to save it            But as a politicalstrategy Gores position has an unbeaten record Hillary Clinton messed withhealth insurance and went down in flames Newt Gingrich messed with Medicareand went down in flames Democrats offered more spending and lost the HouseRepublicans offered tax cuts and nearly lost it back The only thing stillstanding is the entitlements middleclass voters feared they might lose tovisionaries on the right or the left For six years Bill Clinton has stayedalive by clinging to those entitlements Al Gore could do worse
