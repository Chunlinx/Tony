                                 All in the Same Boat                        Susan Faludis Stiffedargues American men are suffering from a masculinity crisis but it isntwomens fault She conducted a wide range of interviews over the last few yearsacross the grain of American societyshipbuilders magazine editors PromiseKeepers aging Vietnam veterans The crisis of masculinity she describesappears on two fronts One involves utilitarian masculinity which is thepride of self men feel thanks to their skills their commitments to their workand to other men in the course of accomplishing a task The other sort ofmasculinity she calls ornamental and it is just that the ornaments ofcigarsleather chairsPorschesbabes that festoon the pages of Details  Esquire  and theNew York Times Mens Fashions supplement Theutilitarian male is a producer the ornamental male is a consumer            In Faludis view men as producers suffer from thechanges in work that more largely frame todays capitalism This is ashortterm world in which people are constantly changing jobs dealing inintangibles of information and connections rather than making solid things aworld in which the craftsman who nurtures a skill over his lifetime is out ofplace Correspondingly male consumers are being sold fickle and impossibleimages of their sexuality and their social honour fickle because the clothesface creams and similar goods now change like womens hemlines offering nostable sense of self impossible ornaments because the Porsche and the cigar lie in the realm of fantasy for most men struggling to make endsmeet            Put so baldly Faludis argument may seem just anotherversion of Demon Capitalism But she is too good an interviewer to be trappedin that clich When she interviews shipbuilders losing their jobs forinstance she shows how the oldfashioned pride in doing a good job remainseven when the shipbuilders have come to the very end of their employment theircraft pride transcends any whining about being capitalisms victims No moredoes the ornamental male wear his jewelry of self comfortably the buffed pecsand washboard stomachs portrayed in the Times mens section are sources of anxiety rather than pleasure            Perhaps the most spacious dimension of Faludisargument is that she unlike many feminist writers has a real feel for malebonding and for the need of men to feel they can hold their heads up withhonor She doesnt succumb to the simpleminded idea that male honor inevitablyrequires female oppression Again in her interviews with the postVietnamgeneration she reaches out to understand the bonds forged by the violence ofmen at war Above all while she rejects the notion that the crisis ofutilitarian masculinity in the workplace has resulted from the gainsmiddleclass women workers have made in the last generation she also showsthat many women employees have been insensitive to the confusions of self thatthe new economy has bred in men            The very openness and depth of her interviewing posesthe first question I have about Stiffed  Is thisreally a book about maleness or is it a reflection in the lives of men ofsomething more generally applicable to American society female as well asmale Isnt Faludi describing a society in which social honor and selfrespectare largely in short supply or supplied in a fashion that can give no realsatisfaction In interviews Ive done with female nurses and mentalhealthworkers for instance Ive found the same sense of craft and the same feelingthat the shortterm costcutting of the medical business leaves them no room torealize their own inner potential            A second large question Ornamental culture Faluditells us is at its core  a virulent voyeurism with sex being its goldstandard p But the interviews she conducts as with the PromiseKeepers seem to me more about the ornaments of fatherhood and husbandhood aninability of American males to find on the tube or at the movies images of howfathers and husbands ought to deal with the complexities of parenting andlongterm relationships Either the domestic male is portrayed as a goodygoodymoral saint or as a guiltridden prisoner of the intimate realm Sex isnt theissue I think the consumer culture has trivialized adult experiences ofresponsibility flattened out intimacy so that it appears a zone in whichpeople women as well as men are pulled between self development andobligation to others Ozzie and Harriet vsEyes Wide Shut a film that for all its sex triesto show sex is anything but the gold standard for a man the inchoate butstrong impulse to break free is what really drives the male character            Finally as an American living abroad I was struck inreading Faludis interviews how resonant they are with issues of selfworth andselfimage among men here in Britain Its easy for Americans to imagine thatour mobile placeless society doesnt give people much outside themselves withwhich to identify indeed in her interviews Faludi finds many men longing fora mythical time when they knew where they belonged But that longing for a losthome a secure sense of self appears equally in Britainor in Germany Andthis brings us back to the issue of capitalism The disturbances of work andconsumption that Faludi so brilliantly depicts are I think global in scopethey cut across the boundaries of gender and they transcend sexual vanity
