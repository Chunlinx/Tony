                            In  mule deer in a research facility near Fort Collins Colorado in the United        States apparently began to react badly to their captivity At least that was the guess of        researchers working on the natural history and nutrition of the deer which became listless        and showed signs of depressed mood hanging their heads and lowering their ears They lost        appetite and weight Then they diedof emaciation pneumonia and other complicationsor        were euthanized The scientists dubbed it chronic wasting disease CWD and for years they        thought it might be caused by stress nutritional deficiencies or poisoning A decade        later CWD was identified as one of the neurodegenerative diseases called spongiform        encephalopathies the most notorious example of which is bovine spongiform encephalopathy        BSE more commonly known as mad cow disease Nowadays CWD is epidemic in the United        States Although no proof has yet emerged that its transmissible to humans scientific        authorities havent ruled out the possibility of a public health threat The media have        concentrated on this concern and politicians have responded with escalated funding over        the past two years for fundamental research into the many questions surrounding this        mysterious disease        Quite apart from how little is yet known about CWD media interest is reason enough to        step up investigation of it says Mo Salman a veterinary epidemiologist at Colorado State        University in Fort Collins Hes been scientifically involved with BSE since it was first        discovered among cattle in the United Kingdom in  He recalls predicting that lay        interest in BSE would wane after five years Instead the disease was found in the        mids to be capable of killing humans who ate tainted beef I was wrong and it really        changed my way of thinking to differentiate between scientific evidence and the public        perception Salman admits Because CWD is similar to BSE the public perception is that        we need to address this disease to see if it has any link to human health                              CWD is the only spongiform encephalopathy known to naturally infect both            freeranging and captive animals a situation that greatly complicates efforts to            monitor control or eradicate it                                      Increasing Attention        In  the United States Department of Agriculture USDA declared an emergency after        CWD was first diagnosed in deer east of the Mississippi River indicating a potential        nationwide problem This year the USDA is developing a herd certification program to help        prevent the movement of infected animals in the game farming industry This will bolster        monitoring already underway in virtually every state including postmortem examinations of        game killed by hunters and by sharpshooters in mass culling operations        By June  brain tissue from more than  animals had been sampled in North        America and  were found to have tested positive for CWD Thats a small epidemic        compared to the thousands of BSE cases detected in cattle in the United Kingdom but CWD is        thought to be slowspreading and perhaps lurking undiscovered elsewhere So far the United        States and Canada are the only countries in which it has been identified apart from a few        imported cases in the Republic of Korea but surveillance has not been thorough in North        America and is virtually nonexistent in the rest of the world        Considered  fatal once clinical signs develop CWD has struck three species of the        cervid familymule deer whitetailed deer and Rocky Mountain elkwhich roam wild and are        raised on farms for meat and hunting Its the only spongiform encephalopathy known to        naturally infect both freeranging and captive animals a situation that greatly        complicates efforts to monitor control or eradicate it        The economic costs are hard to quantify but a  survey by the United States        Department of Commerces Bureau of Census shows that biggame hunters nationwide spend more        than US billion annually for trips and equipment By far their main target is deer        Wildlife watching of large land mammals principally deer drew  million participants        in  The North American Deer Farmers Association represents owners of  cervid        livestock raised for their meat and for velvet antler a healthfood supplement made from        antlers These animals are valued at more than US million        Over the past two years the federal governments emphasis on CWD has been quite high        compared to other wildlife diseases says USDA staff veterinarian Dan Goeldner In no        small part thats because the disease has cropped up in new places and those are states        that have political clout It has now been found in ten more states beyond what became        known as the endemic region of Colorado and neighboring Wyoming Figure  Last year the        USDA received US million to monitor and manage the disease and Goeldner says the        department expects to get about US million this year                    The Prion Diseases        Those figures dont include scientific research funded by other organizations such as        the US million received by the United States Department of Defense in  to start        up a National Prion Research Program The prion is the proteinlike agent that causes        transmissible spongiform encephalopathies TSEs Its normal function is uncertain but        when it misfolds into an abnormal or infectious form it causes the microscopic holes and        globs of toxic misshapen protein found in the brains of TSE victims Unlike viruses        prions dont contain nucleic acidsonly protein Without DNA or RNA to issue biochemical        commands abnormal prions shouldnt be able to convert normal prions to the infectious        state but thats exactly what they do Box         Prion diseases occur in many species In domestic sheep and goats prion diseases occur        as scrapie which has a virtually worldwide distribution North America and Europe have        also reported rare cases of TSE in ranched mink Humans get kuru CreutzfeldtJacob disease        CJD and GerstmannStrusslerScheinker syndromeall rareand BSE itself manifests in        people as a variant form of CJD Since the United Kingdom outbreak BSE has been discovered        in more than  countries most recently in North America As public fear rose of possible        CWD transmission to humans who eat infected venison the United States Centers for Disease        Control and Prevention CDC released a report last year of its investigation into several        deaths among venison eaters who might have had a TSE The report concluded that none of the        deaths could be attributed to venison but it nevertheless cautioned that animals showing        evidence of CWD should be excluded from the human and animal feed chains Box         CWD is the least understood of all the prion diseases Its origins are unknown and may        well never be discovered The question is largely academic unless one hypothesis is proven        true that it derives from scrapie In that case the knowledge might help in efforts to        control the two diseases through herd and flock management        Researchers are working to determine the minimum incubation time of CWD before clinical        signs appear now roughly estimated at  months in deer and  months in elk Theyre        trying to discover whether CWD strains exist that can affect the length of the disease        process and different regions of the brain or that can infect different species including        humans They are also investigating the period during which the prion is passed on as well        as its modes of transmission They want to know whether disease reservoirs exist in the        bodily fluids of hosts in the environment or both Theyre racing to develop a diagnostic        test that can be performed on live animals enabling identification of the disease before        clinical signs appear which would eliminate the need to kill thousands of apparently        healthy animals in areas where CWD is detected But among the first things they need to        clarify are CWDs distribution across North America and its prevalence                              the disease has cropped up in new places and those are states that            have political clout                                      An Initial Step Improved Surveillance        Before you can start to control CWD you need to understand where it is and how much of        it you have says veterinary pathologist Beth Williams of the University of Wyoming in        Laramie So I think you really need surveillance Research on its pathogenesis and        transmission will help to develop better diagnostic tools which will improve surveillance        adds Williams who first identified the disease as a TSE more than a quartercentury        ago        Colorado States Salman argues that current surveillance is primarily a series of        reactions to reported cases rather than a systematic strategy designed to determine where        and at what prevalence the disease exists and where its absent The estimated prevalence        is about  in elk and  in deer But Salman says We dont have a good idea of areas        in which we are saying we havent found the disease because these areas are not yet in my        estimation negative for the disease Scrapie is a wonderful example of systematic        surveillance but to be fair to the decisionmakers and technical people involved with CWD        surveillance on wildlife species is very difficult        The USDAs Goeldner declares We have the goal and the hope to eradicate the disease        from the farm population But Colorado Department of Wildlife veterinarian and CWD expert        Mike Miller warns Given existing tools it seems unlikely that CWD can be eradicated from        freeranging populations once established        The gold standard of diagnosis is based on examination of the brain for spongiform        lesions and abnormal prion aggregation Suspect animals are decapitated and their bodies        incinerated This is an approach that nobody wants including the people who have to        implement it says wildlife ecologist Michael Samuel principal investigator in the United        States Geological SurveyWisconsin Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit at the University of        Wisconsin in Madison        Nevertheless when three whitetailed deer shot by hunters in the southcentral part of        that state during the fall of  were diagnosed with CWD the state government took swift        action By the spring of  almost  deer had been sacrificed and sampled for the        disease both within and without a  squaremile  squarekilometer region dubbed        the eradication zone There the goal was to remove as many deer as possible whereas the        plan in contiguous outlying areas was to reduce density to about ten deer per square mile        CWD is thought to spread more efficiently in highdensity populations and normal densities        in Wisconsin are  deer per square mile about five times that of Colorado and        Wyoming The main objectives of the Wisconsin culling were to discover where the disease        existed and its prevalence in affected areas In the eradication zone it was         although in the outlying region it was only  Samples elsewhere in the state tested        negative                    In Search of a Live Assay        A key to combating the spread of CWD is to put into widespread use a preclinical        diagnostic test on live animals Miller and colleagues recently developed and validated the        first such assay based on a biopsy of lymphoid tissue where the infectious agent is known        to incubate They showed that tonsillar biopsies taken from live animals can confirm        disease at least  months prior to death and up to  months before the onset of clinical        signs Although the method is a useful screening tool it requires much time and training        Each deer must be anaesthetized and blindfolded placed in a restraint its mouth held open        with a gag the tonsil visualized with a laryngoscope and the biopsy taken with endoscopic        forceps Lymphoid tissue sampling was first used as a preclinical test in sheep scrapie        Many attempts have been made to develop and evaluate tests for live animals but it is        fraught with difficulties declares TSE specialist Danny Matthews of the United Kingdom        Governments Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge He says that a live test for BSE        in cattle is likely to be evaluated shortly by the European Food Safety Authority but        warns of a major problem test samples are collected early in the incubation whereas brain        pathology only arises two to three years later This creates long delays in determining        whether a positive preclinical test result is in fact accurate How can one do an        appropriate evaluation        Matthews notes that blood appears to be a useful medium for testing scrapie in sheep        but current technology cannot deliver a tool applicable across a range of different scrapie        genotypes Like sheep elk and mule deer do have a peripheral pathogenesis which suggests        that the blood test route may have some potential especially if the genotype variability        is more restricted than in sheep                    Transmission Mysteries        Scrapie can be vertically transmitted from mother to offspring either in the womb or        from the transfer of infected germ plasm It also can be transmitted horizontally from any        one animal to another CWD the only other known contagious TSE is thought to be        transmitted solely by asyetundetermined direct or indirect horizontal contact It        probably is not transmitted through infected feed as is the case for BSE        A number of scientists are currently on the trail of suspected CWD disease reservoirs        Saliva is a leading candidate because clinical signs of CWD include excessive thirst        drinking and drooling Work with lab animals suggests that the infectious agent might be        produced in salivary glands and if so it could be transmitted through social        interactions Feces is also a possible reservoir because animals nose in the ground for        feed and urine is yet another candidate because it is involved in the scenting activities        of cervids        Soil could be an environmental reservoir because cervids ingest dirt to supplement        their diets with minerals Bucks also lick soil on which does have urinated to ascertain        their mating status University of Wisconsin soil science professor Joel Pedersen has        discovered that abnormally folded prions stick to the surface of some soil types such as        clay resisting environmental and chemical damage Captive elk contracted CWD when        introduced into paddocks occupied by infected elk more than  months earlier despite        fairly extensive efforts to disinfect the enclosures Pedersen notes He has begun a        fiveyear project to characterize interactions between infectious prions and soil particles        and determine the extent to which infectivity is retained        No matter how CWD is transmitted between cervids the likelihood of human susceptibility        seems low Laboratory evidence has demonstrated a molecular barrier against such        crossspecies infection based on the failure of abnormal cervid prions to efficiently        convert normal human prions to the infectious state Likewise abnormal cervid prions dont        easily convert normal cattle prions suggesting that cattle wont get CWD and pass it on to        humans who eat tainted beef While cattle can contract CWD if inoculated with the        infectious agent longterm studies placing cattle in close proximity to diseased cervids        have resulted in no cases of natural transmission Williams summarizes what all this        suggests Never say never but based on the molecular work the CDCs findings and the        epidemiology we certainly dont have evidence that humans have gotten CWD
