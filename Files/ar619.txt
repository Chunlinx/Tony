                    Introduction        The precise role played by CD T cells in the        pathogenesis and inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis RA        is unclear In the synovial membrane the most common        IFNproducing cell is the CD T cell suggesting that        this population of T cells plays a major role in macrophage        activation and perpetuation of the inflammatory response            CD T cells were recently associated with the        presence of germinal centers in RA synovium            suggesting a role for CD T cells in the formation or        maintenance of those lymphoid structures in the synovium        Further studies indicated that CD T cells exhibit        oligoclonality in the peripheral blood     and synovial        fluid of RA patients     raising the question of        whether this oligoclonality is antigen driven However        recent studies have indicated that large numbers of        virusspecific CD T cells preferentially accumulate in        the synovial fluid of RA patients and that these cells are        also oligoclonal suggesting that nonantigenspecific        homing may be responsible for the observed oligoclonality        of CD T cells in the synovial fluid     Because        chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein and        RANTES regulated upon activation normal Tcell expressed        and secreted are expressed in RA synovial tissue             subsets of CD T cells may be preferentially recruited        into the synovial tissue in a nonantigenspecific manner        If the expression of chemokines is also accompanied by a        perturbation in CD Tcell homeostasis in the periphery        that favors differentiation into cell types that can be        recruited into the synovium then a vicious cycle may be        set up in RA in which there is continuous generation of CD        T cells that can be recruited into the synovium resulting        in chronic inflammation and joint destruction        Recently memory CD T cells were classified into three        distinct populations based on phenotype       a        central memory population which is CDRA CCR CDL        CD IL IFN  and two effector memory populations        namely the CDRA CDL CCR and the terminally        differentiated CDRA CDL CCR populations The two        latter effector memory populations contain perforin        secrete IFN and tumor necrosis factor are cytotoxic        and are capable of rapid effector function after        stimulation              Although a linear model of differentiation has been        suggested for these memory populations ie central memory        T cells CDRA CCR CDL  effector memory T cells        CDRA CDL CCR  effector memory T cells CDRA        CDL CCR      the exact relationship between        these populations is not fully established Indeed        Champagne         et al     suggested that the        differentiation may not be linear at all The central and        effector memory phenotypes of CD and CD T cells in        peripheral blood of RA patients are unknown Determination        of these phenotypes in RA may provide important insights        into Tcell homeostasis and we therefore examined the        distribution of CD and CD T cells into these        subpopulations because such a study may reveal differences        in the differentiation of T cells in RA patients Decreases        in some of the subpopulations in peripheral blood may        indicate that there is a selective migration of these cells        out of the peripheral blood decreased survival of these        cells or blockade in their differentiation Perturbations        in the homeostasis of memory T cells may play an important        role in the pathogenesis of RA by generating effector cells        that can contribute to the synovial inflammation of RA                    Patients and methods                  Patients          Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with RA

population increases with age However        no such correlation was detected in RA and SLE patients        Fig d Finally the frequency of CDRA CDL CD T        cells did not correlate with disease duration or treatment        in either RA or SLE patients data not shown                    Discussion        The present study shows that the differentiation of        peripheral blood CD T cells is skewed in patients with RA        and results in an increase in central memory CDRA CDL        CD T cells with a concomitant decrease in terminally        differentiated effector memory CDRA CDL CD T cells        The increase in central memory CDRA CDL T cells was        also found in the CD Tcell population in RA patients        This skewed differentiation was not observed in healthy        agematched control individuals and in SLE patients        indicating that this perturbation in homeostasis of T cells        is a specific feature of RA        Although the navememory phenotype of T cells has        previously been investigated in RA in numerous studies        using CDRA and CDRO expression as markers of nave and        memory cells respectively that approach has suffered from        the limitation that large numbers of CDRA CD T cells        are actually effector memory cells      The        CDRACDRO oversimplification has also resulted in        rather confusing conclusions regarding Tcell homeostasis        such as defects in primary Tcell homeostasis based on        reduced Tcell receptor excision circle TREC levels in        nave CD T cells defined as CDRO  in RA patients            Our findings suggest that reduced TREC levels in the        CDRO CD Tcell population may not be due to a        reduction in TRECs in nave cells but rather to reduced        TRECs in the CDRA CDRO CDL effector memory CD T        cells It should be noted that previous studies have        reported false nave CDRA populations of CD and CD        T cells in peripheral blood of RA patients            however the nature of these cells the exact phenotype        and the significance was not known at that time        Our finding that peripheral blood CD T cells exhibit        increased central memory phenotype and decreased terminally        differentiated effector memory phenotype suggests that the        peripheral blood homeostasis of CD T cells is perturbed        in RA Perturbations in CD Tcell maturation have been        shown for HIVspecific CD T cells in which there is an        accumulation of preterminally differentiated CDRA CDL        CD T cells      and such a lack of        differentiation may result in functional or homing defects        In RA we found a decrease in terminally differentiated        CDRA CDL CD T cells with a concomitant increase in        the CDRA CDL central memory population If one        accepts the linear model of differentiation     which        we note has been challenged     then our findings        indicate that in RA there may be an accelerated        differentiation of nave cells into central memory CD and        CD T cells This accelerated differentiation may be due        to a nonantigenspecific effect in RA that differentiates        all peripheral T cells irrespective of their specificity        or it may actually reflect an antigenspecific expansion of        T cells potentially driven by autoantigen        The decrease in CDRA CDL effector memory CD T        cells in peripheral blood we found in RA patients may        reflect a decrease in the survival of these cells It        should be noted however that peripheral blood T cells        from RA patients do not exhibit an increase in apoptosis in                in vitro cultures which is in        contrast to synovial membrane T cells      This may        suggest that the skewed phenotype of the CDRA CDL        effector memory CD T cells is more likely due to an        increase in the migration of these cells into sites of        inflammation However a blockade of the differentiation of        central memory CDRA CDL CD T cells into effector        memory CD T cells would also result in an increase in the        central memory population with a concomitant decrease in        the effector T cells as observed in the present study        Studies of the phenotype of CD T cells in the synovial        membrane and fluid may shed light as to whether this skewed        phenotype is also found in these sites or whether there is        an enrichment for CDRA CDL CD T cells indicating        increased recruitment into the inflamed synovium in RA        Inflammation and production of chemokines such as        macrophage inflammatory protein and RANTES     in        the synovium may result in preferential recruitment of such        effector memory CD T cells which are important        contributors to IFN production and subsequent macrophage        activation because terminally differentiated CDRA CDL        CD T cells have been shown to express higher levels of        perforin and may be more potent effector cells     The        question arises of whether the observed skewed        differentiation of CD T cells in RA patients is due to        medication especially steroids As shown in Table          of the RA patients and  of the SLE patients were        receiving steroid treatment However the skewed memory        phenotype was only observed in the RA patients suggesting        that this treatment is not responsible for the differences        in CD and CD Tcell phenotypes        Findings from the present preliminary study show that        peripheral blood CD T cells in RA exhibit a skewed        effector memory phenotype This skewed phenotype was not        found in CD T cells in RA and was not seen in agematched        healthy control individuals or in SLE patients The skewed        phenotype may be a result of accelerated differentiation        and migration into sites of inflammation An understanding        of the mechanisms that are involved in this skewed        differentiation of effector memory CD T cells may prove        valuable in elucidating the pathogenesis of RA                    Conclusion        In peripheral blood of RA patients a skewed homeostasis        of CD T cells was found with an increase in central        memory and a decrease in terminally differentiated effector        memory T cells Fig  This skewed Tcell phenotype was        not found in healthy age and sexmatched control        individuals or in patients with SLE Reduction in        peripheral blood effector memory CD T cells in RA may        indicate an increase in the migration of these cells into        sites of inflammation and therefore may contribute to        ongoing synovial inflammation                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        IFN  interferon IL  interleukin RA  rheumatoid        arthritis RANTES  regulated upon
