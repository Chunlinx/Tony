                                 This Is Your Brain on a Cell Phone                                       Wired News had an unsettling story thismorning A University of Washington researcher has found that cell phonesappear to cause longtermmemory loss in laboratory rats Yes yes I know whatyoure going to askwhat are lab rats doing talking on the phone Actuallyits even weirder than that Dr Henry Lai a research professor inbioengineering in Seattle first put  rats into a tank of water and taughtthem to swim to a platform in the middle of the tank WN reportsHow do you teach  rats to swim You start with teensytiny water wings Iguess Then after the rats knew the route Lai confused them by dumpingpowdered milk into the water making it harder to navigatethe rats had tomake it to the platform by memory rather than by sight Finally after thelongsuffering rodents had learned the route Lai bombarded half the rats withmicrowaves similar to the kind thats emitted from mobile phones Notsurprisingly the poor rats couldnt remember the way to the platform afterthat It got even worse when Lai removed the platform The unbombarded ratsswam to the place where it should be and looked around with concern thecellular rats just swam around randomly like members of the Royal family atthe beach            I could see this one really upsetting the digerati Foryears people have shrugged off suggestions that cell phones could causecertain kinds of tumors I was interviewing an engineer recently who referredto GSM phones as brain fryershe laughed when he said that A link betweencellphone use and brain cancer  big deal Its only death But a suggestionthat cellphone use makes us dumber That could be serious trouble for thecellphone industry            Of course its impossible to say at this point if theresults from Lais experiment will extrapolate to humans Other research willneed to be conducted rats in a tank of juice I guess followed by a vat ofbeer Also Wired says the radio transmissions are slightly differentfrom the type used by cellular phones Still I figured that you as presidentand founder of the Cell Phone Haters Club would want to be aware of thisdevelopment so you can disseminate it how Carrier pigeon to yourmembers
