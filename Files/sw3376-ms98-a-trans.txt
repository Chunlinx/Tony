            is that right   right now what was your name again   okay well well my names Barry where do you golf at   Barry okay well i dont uh much well actually hardly at all i um the only times that ive actually golfed is we we were uh going to a family reunion up in Maine every year and a bunch of the brotherinlaws and whatever else would go out and play like couple times during the week that we were all there um ive done that about three or four times i guess   i see so youre from Maine originally then   no im from uh uh New York   New York   but weve got my family my family my dads familys from Maine   well im originally from Nebraska and really didnt play much golf there until i moved to South Dakota and we lived on the golf course and i took up uh golf at that time and   uhhuh   really enjoyed it and uh then when we moved to Plano i really havent had uh weve lived here a year now and i really havent uh golfed a lot but those times that i have been out i went to the uh   uhhuh   uh Plano Municipal Golf Course and then ive golfed uh couple times uh at Chase Oaks   umhum   and thats very challenging at Chase Oaks uh lot of water   whats it cost to to play at at now   oh if i go to the Municipal Course its uh maybe twenty five dollars for eighteen holes and uh seems to me that when i was at Chase Oaks uh   umhum   well of course i took my son with me so we were close to you know fifty dollars or so   its pretty expensive isnt it   it really is   yeah real expensive actually   but uh i enjoy it probably uh it depends on which day i go uh   umhum   as to which part is most challenging   umhum what do you shoot what do you shoot when you were playing   oh probably uh for nine um i i ive felt pretty good with maybe a forty one forty two around in there   well thats not bad at all i that would make you about eighty or eighty two for for eighteen   thatd be a thatd be a darn good game for me yeah   yeah but thats pretty thats pretty good shooting   yeah im im happy with that   yeah well what do you what do you uh what do you find attractive about playing golf   well i think what i find attractive is when i can go out uh with friends and uh on a nice day just to be out uh and stay     Jerry  hold on a second  Jerry shes about to get my cord   uh oh   baby we got a loose connection on this phone     oh just uh i i guess the thing that i like most about it is getting away from work and uh a although uh if i am jogging or working out or playing golf or whatever its a a time to get away from things but yet sometimes things become more a little more clearer that way too   yeah well i i liked uh we i probably played maybe five or six times but we did that and uh but what i liked about it was i could i could uh i liked being outside um and of course the golf courses uh are are beautiful the one that we played at in Maine was real pretty and you could be with people and yet ooh ooh uh so you had nice you had company and stuff but then significant portions of the time you were off in an area of the course by yourself too which uh it was kind of um  the best of both   yeah yeah   both worlds actually   yeah thats nice im uh you know it it bothers me when uh especially in this particular area there are so many people that play golf that you tend to uh you have a lot of people there and feel hurried and i dont i dont like to feel rushed when im playing golf   umhum whats uh whats what do you do best on the golf course   but oh you know it it really varies from day to day uh if im if im on i uh really can hit uh hit my driver pretty well   is that right   and uh thats thats a new experience for me because for about a year to two years uh i couldnt hit my driver i had such a hook that uh i would just use a three iron all the time and i could hit my three iron just about as far as anybody else could hit a driver so i used that but then i took a few lessons and really uh worked on it and   umhum oh you took lessons   uh yeah we had a golf pro uh and i took maybe two or three lessons basically uh and uh had a golf pro and and uh it was like maybe twenty five dollars for a half an hour   umhum umhum   but uh he really helped a lot   yeah do you own your own clubs i guess you probably do dont you   yep yeah i uh uh got a pair of used clubs for a Christmas present one year and uh so before that id been using uh   is that right   my little sisters uh womens set  and i thought boy the first day i got those uh new clubs id go out and uh really uh knock them dead and uh it takes a while to get used to a new set of clubs   oh yeah hum my uh brother plays a lot like every weekend up in New Jersey   is he pretty good golfer   well you know yeah he shoots well he shoots eighties you know which which i think thats pretty good you know   good we uh probably my the most exciting experience i had playing golf was over in Hawaii we took a vacation and uh my brother and i went out brotherinlaw went out and uh   uh umhum   played in uh
