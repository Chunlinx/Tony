Section GSummary of the Models used for the AnalysisDescription of the Integrated Planning Model IPMAnalytical Framework of IPM EPA uses the Integrated Planning Model IPM to analyze theprojected impact of environmental policies on the electric powersector in the  contiguous states and the District of ColumbiaDeveloped by ICF Resources Incorporated and used to support publicand private sector clients IPM is a multiregional dynamicdeterministic linear programming model of the US electric powersector The model provides forecasts of leastcost capacityexpansion electricity dispatch and emission control strategiesfor meeting energy demand and environmental transmissiondispatch and reliability constraints IPM can be used to evaluatethe cost and emissions impacts of proposed policies to limitemissions of sulfur dioxide SO nitrogen oxides NOx carbondioxide CO and mercury Hg from the electric powersector IPM was a key analytical tool in developing the PresidentsClear Skies proposalIPM Is Well Suited to Model MultiEmission Control Programs Among the factors that make IPM particularly well suited tomodel multiemissions control programs are  its ability tocapture complex interactions among the electric power fuel andenvironmental markets  its detailrich representation ofemission control options encompassing a broad array of retrofittechnologies along with emission reductions through fuel switchingchanges in capacity mix and electricity dispatch strategies and its capability to model a variety of environmental marketmechanisms such as emissions caps allowances trading andbanking IPM is particularly well suited for modeling Clear Skiesbecause the program relies on the operation of an allowance marketthe availability of a broad range of emissions reduction optionsand empowerment of economic actors to achieve emission limitsExtensive documentation of the IPM is available athttpwwwepagovairmarketsepaipmindexhtmlDescription of Air Quality Modeling The results for fine particle concentrations visibilitysulfur deposition and nitrogen deposition are based on theRegional Modeling System for Aerosols and Deposition REMSAD REMSAD is an Eulerian air quality model developed to simulateregionalscale distributions sources formation transport andremoval processes for fine particles and other airborne pollutantsThis analysis used REMSAD version  with meteorological inputspreviously developed for  using the Mesoscale MeteorologicalModel MM The results for ozone concentrations are based on theComprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions CAMx CAMx is an Eulerian air quality model developed to simulatelocal and regionalscale distributions sources formationtransport and removal processes for ozone and other photochemicalpollutants This analysis used CAMx version  with meteorologicalinputs previously developed using the Regional Atmospheric ModelingSystem RAMS for episodes in June July and August  The Integrated Planning Model IPM was used to derive allfuture projections of electricity generation source emissions Emissions inputs for nonelectric generating facilities forREMSAD and CAMx were derived from the  National EmissionsInventory NEI In addition inventories prepared for the HeavyDuty Diesel Engine rulemaking were the basis for future yearemissions projections For the most part the modeling results are analyzed in termsof the change in future year air quality relative to predictionsunder baseline conditions In this way effects of anyuncertainties in emissions forecasts and air quality modeling areminimized Results for projected annual PM and hour ozonenonattainment were determined by rolling back current air qualitylevels This was based on the change in air quality between the Base Year and each future year scenario Since no ozonemodeling was performed for the Western US future ozonenonattainment in the West was determined through an emissionsscaling analysis that used forecast changes in NOx emissions in theWest coupled with the response of ozone to emissions changes asmodeled in the East Maps which display the impacts on PM concentrations anddeposition are reported as a percent reduction A positive percentreduction eg  is a decrease in concentration or depositioncompared to current conditions an improvement a negative percentreduction eg  is an increase in concentration or depositioncompared to current conditions Visibility results are reported as a change in deciviewsPerfect visibility is represented by a deciview of zero so adecrease in deciview is an increase or improvement in visibilityAn increase in deciview is a decrease in visibilityDescription of Benefits Modeling The Criteria Air Pollutant Modeling System CAPMS is used toquantify human health benefits due to the changes in a populationsexposure to fine particulate matter and ozone Using the air quality modeling results the change inpollutant concentration based on modeling for each CAPMS grid cellis determined This is the level at which the population living inthat grid cell is assumed to be exposed Concentrationresponse functions from epidemiological studiesare applied to each grid cell to predict the changes in incidencesof health outcomes eg asthma attacks that would occur with theprojected changes in air quality The grid cells are aggregated to estimate the health impactof the change in air quality across the study region The estimated economic value of an avoided health outcomeeg  per asthma attack day is multiplied by total change inevents to determine the health benefits of air quality improvementsfor the entire region For visibility benefits were calculated based on changes infine particle concentrations presented as deciviews which areprovided by the REMSAD air quality model Individuals place a value on visibility improvements inrecreational areas such as National Parks and wildernessareas The economic value that people place on improved visibilityon a day that they visit a Class I area is applied to the predicteddeciview changes and projected number of park visitors affected toattain recreational visibility monetary benefitsDescription of Freshwater Modeling The Model of Acidification of Groundwater in CatchmentsMAGIC is used to examine changes in surface freshwater chemistryas indicated by changes in acid neutralizing capacity ANC in thewaterbody ANC represents the ability of a lake or stream to neutralizeor buffer acid The condition of a lake or stream improves as thethe ANC increases moving from chronically acidic  episodicallyacidic  not acidic Episodically acidic lakes ANC of  eql have a greatercapacity to neutralize acid deposition than chronically acidicones However these lakes remain susceptible to becomingchronically acidic if acid deposition increases Watershed characteristics eg soils bedrock typegeologic history affect the rate of water chemistry response toacid deposition Direct response lakes or streams manifest changes morequickly whereas delayed response lakes or streams manifestchanges over a longer period of time MAGIC results show the distribution of lakes and streams bypercentage over the three ANC classes Three regions were modeled the Adirondacks the Northeastincluding the Adirondacks and the Southeast Results are reported for current conditions  and in under the Base Case and the Clear Skies ActResults are based on a model called the Model of Acidificationof Groundwater in Catchments MAGIC used by the National AcidPrecipitation Assessment Program NAPAP to estimate the longtermeffects of acidic deposition sulfur on lakes and streams Themodel simulates the size of the pool of exchangeable base cationsin the soil As the fluxes to and from the pool change over timedue to changes in atmospheric deposition the chemical equilibriabetween soil and soil solution shift to give changes in surfacewater chemistry Changes in surface water chemistry arecharacterized by changes in Acid Neutralizing Capacity ANC  theability of a waterbody to neutralize strong acids added fromatmospheric depositionDescription of the Technology Retrofit and Updating ModelUses of the Technology Retrofit and Updating Model At this time IPM does not model price elasticity of demandand the effect of multiple allowance allocation mechanisms Tostudy the effect of these variables on electricity prices andmarkets ICF developed a macrodriven spreadsheet program termedthe technology retrofit and updating model The model is used to discern trends in marginal costs andretrofits the approximate magnitudes of those trends and thereasons for those trendsModeling Approach The technology retrofit and updating model consists of a setof approximately six hundred sample generating units with varyingcharacteristics The mix of generation types and sizes was chosento mirror in general terms the nationwide mix of capacities Eachunit is assumed to choose emission control retrofit options fuelsand generation levels so as to maximize its own net profit inresponse to fuel prices emission allowance prices and prices ofelectricity for various demand segments Prices of fuels can beadjusted in the model in response to demand prices of electricityby demand segment is set in the model so as to meet demand andallowance prices can be adjusted to cause the industry to meetgiven caps To simulate the effects of demand elasticity the quantity ofelectricity demanded in each segment can be set as a function ofelectricity prices using an elasticity value that is entered as aninput to the model Finally to simulate the effects of allowanceupdating the value of reallocated allowances can be calculated andsubtracted from each units cost of generation  thereby inducingeach unit to change its profitmaximizing level of generation inresponse to a given set of fuel allowance and electricity pricesReadjusting the allowance prices to meet the same emission capsthen generates results showing the costs of meeting given caps withand without updating An important limitation of this model is that it does notsimulate changes over time in the demand for electricity pricestechnology or other factors considered within IPM Instead it isrun as though every year is the same as every other year and istherefore static in its outlook In addition it does not recognizethe distinctions among electricity demand regions and thetransmission constraints that can keep them separate Thus onlyone price of electricity is determined for each demand segment forthe entire set of sample plantsDescription of the Retail Electricity Price ModelPrimary Attributes of the Model The Model provides a forecast of average retail electricityprices from  to  for  regions and the contiguous USand considers areas of the country that  will have competitivepricing of power generation and  are likely to price retailpower based on a costofservice basis Combines IPM and EIA information with data from the NationalRegulatory Research Institute and Center for Advanced EnergyMarkets regarding the restructuring of the power industry Main Case is EPAs forecast of likely deregulationconsidering areas of the country that should price generationservices for retail customers competitively and those that mostlikely to use costofservice pricing principles The Model readily analyzes alternative multipollutant andbase case scenarios modeled with IPM alternative assumptions onderegulation and future savingscosts and the implications ofdifferent allowance allocation approaches The strongestapplication of the Calculator occurs from examining the relativeprice differences between two or more scenariosThe Limitations of the Model Include The Model combines IPM and EIA cost elements that use similar but not identical  assumptions on capital recovery andaggregate cost data in a similar  but not identical  regionalmanner that needs adjustment The Model assumes public and private companies seek the samereturn and have the same tax treatment which overstates prices inareas where there are large amounts of public power The Model focuses on major costs It assumes forcostofservice areas where most of power sales are likely tooccur that allowance allocations will not alter pricing ofelectricity Uses EIAs limited but best available data in some areaseg rate base with stranded assets The Model cannot address the uncertainty of deregulationcreated by Californias experience  where competition mayincrease or decrease in the future With the phasing in ofcompetition and limited experience the full benefits and costs ofderegulation still remain unknown
