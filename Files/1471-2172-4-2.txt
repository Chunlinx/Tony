                    Background        Type  diabetes mellitus TDM is a T cellmediated        autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic        infiltration of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans with        subsequent destruction of the insulinproducing beta cells            Nonobese diabetic NOD female mice a murine        model for TDM spontaneously develop diabetes by         weeksofage with infiltrating cells appearing around the        pancreatic islets as early as at  weeksofage                   TDM susceptibility in the NOD mouse is linked to IA        g the murine MHC class II gene that encodes a histidine        at position  and a serine at position  in the  chain        in place of the more frequent proline  and aspartic acid             The development of diabetes is prevented in        NODPD mice which are NOD mice with IA g that carry a         chain transgene with sitespecific mutations that restore        proline and aspartic acid at positions  and         respectively     Furthermore because of the two amino        acid changes in the additional transgenic MHC class II        allele  chain in NODPD mice NODPD mice recognize three        additional peptide epitopes in the glutamic acid        decarboxylase  GAD autoantigen            Among betacell autoantigens GAD is an important        initial target of the immune response that results in        betacell destruction and diabetes in both humans and NOD        mice        While both humoral and cellular        responses to GAD occur as early as  weeks of age in NOD        mice     there is considerable evidence that        betacellspecific T         H  cells are the effectors of TDM        whereas T         H  cells appear to have a protective        role     Accordingly a shift of the autoimmune        response from T         H  to T         H  predominance has represented a        promising strategy for prevention of diabetes and other T         H mediated autoimmune diseases        For example administration of GAD to young NOD mice        has been shown to prevent insulitis and diabetes             apparently via induction of CD regulatory T cells with a        T         H  phenotype     Similarly        treatment with immunodominant peptides of myelin can        prevent or reverse experimental autoimmune        encephalomyelitis EAE a T         H associated inducible autoimmune        disorder that is widely used as a model for human multiple        sclerosis              Unfortunately recent work indicates that the        application of strategies to shift autoimmune responses        from T         H  to T         H  predominance is not without risk        Thus some of us recently showed that administration of two        self peptides that can induce EAE myelin proteolipid        protein peptide  to  PLP or myelin        oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide  MOG can        result in severe anaphylactic reactions     This        result clearly indicated that severe allergic reactions to        self peptides can occur in mice that have been         induced to express pathology ie        EAE related to autoimmunity to these peptides However        it was initially unclear whether anaphylactic reactivity        also could be elicited to self peptides that have been        implicated in the development of a         spontaneous autoimmune disorder        In the present study we show that antipeptide        autoantibodies and fatal anaphylactic reactions can be        elicited by immunodominant GAD peptides in NOD mice that        have been injected with these peptides intraperitoneally in        incomplete Freunds adjuvant IFA as part of an attempt        to induce tolerance and prevent the spontaneous        development of TDM Moreover while this manuscript was in        review Liu and colleagues reported that antipeptide        autoantibodies and fatal anaphylaxis can be induced in NOD        mice that have been immunized with insulin B chain peptides        B or B     However in the Liu         et al study the peptides were        administered subcutaneously in saline without adjuvant As        reviewed in Liu         et al     several lines of        evidence indicate that amino acids  of the insulin B        chain also represent a major target of antiislet        autoimmunity in TDM Taken together with the findings        reported herein this work indicates that anaphylactic        reactions can be elicited in mice that have been immunized        with pancreatic isletassociated selfpeptides that also        represent significant targets of autoimmunity in TDM                    Results                  Anaphylactic responses to GAD and PD          peptides          In an attempt to induce a T           H  shift      to  week old          female NOD mice IA g were immunized by  weekly ip          injections of the immunodominant G peptides GAD           or of the additional GAD          peptides identified in NODPD mice IA NODPD GAD          KR in IFA     As noted in the          background section PD peptides are not immunodominant in          NOD mice Indeed we originally included the PDimmunized          group because PD peptides are the immunodominant epitopes          that are presented in transgenic NODPD mice that do           not get diabetes               Because of their unknown and potentially even          protective role in the diabetesresistant NODPD strain          we felt that it was important to assess whether through          a peptide therapy regimen PD peptides might be able to          protect against diabetes by shifting T           H  to T           H  responses in NOD mice As our          study unfolded and we found that G peptide therapy          induced anaphylactic reactivity in NOD mice we felt that          it was important to evaluate whether PD peptides might          also induce allergic responses in the NOD strain          As demonstrated in our study immunization of NOD mice          with PD peptides can induce both a specific IgG response          and also anaphylactic reactivity On the other hand as          might be predicted PD peptides induced a less robust          IgG response Figure  and also a lower incidence and          severity of anaphylaxis see Table and Figure  when          injected into NOD mice than did G peptides In an          attempt to induce anaphylactic reactivity to peptides          known to induce T           H  responses associated with allergic          reactions NOD mice were immunized using the same          protocol with hen egg lysozyme and ovalbumin peptides          HEL  OVA        As a negative          control NOD mice received  weekly injections of saline          emulsified in IFA Four weeks after the last of the           ip injections of peptidesIFA or salineIFA mice          injected with peptidesIFA were challenged ip with the          same peptides used for the immunizations dissolved in          saline whereas mice that had been injected with          salineIFA were challenged with saline alone By the day          of challenge  of all mice had developed diabetes          with the exception of the mice in the saline group                    All of the mice challenged with G peptides developed          severe anaphylactic shock   with the          majority of them dying within  minutes after the          injection   Table  In addition to the          classical signs of anaphylaxis such as reddening of the          skin prostration and respiratory impairment the mice          underwent a dramatic drop in body temperature Fig           which confirmed the presence of anaphylactic shock          Moreover the death rate from anaphylaxis was          substantially higher than in any other group in which          anaphylaxis occurred Table           On the other hand the clinical and physiological          features of anaphylaxis elicited by the G peptides were          similar to those observed in age and gendermatched NOD          mice undergoing IgEmediated passive systemic anaphylaxis          Fig  Although the death rate was significantly          higher in the G challenged NOD group            compared to the IgEsensitized DNPHSA challenged group          none P    by Fishers exact test Table           those mice in either group that developed anaphylaxis          exhibited quite similar drops in body temperature Fig          B Similarly while the group of mice that was          challenged with G peptides exhibited a higher incidence          of anaphylactic responses than did the group challenged          with HELOVA peptides Table  the temperature changes          Fig B and death rates Table  in mice that did          develop a reaction were quite similar          None of the nave agegendermatched NOD mice these          mice received no injection prior to challenge that were          challenged with G peptides showed any signs of          anaphylaxis  P   by Fishers exact test          for comparison vs G immunized G challenged mice          Table  Fig  This result indicates that priming of          these mice with G peptides is required for the          elicitation of the allergic response          Of the mice immunized with the PD peptides that are          not immunodominant in NOD mice   developed          anaphylactic shock at the time of challenge with PD          peptides Table  Thus the incidence of anaphylactic          shock in mice immunized and challenged with PD peptides          was significantly lower than that in mice immunized and          challenged with immunodominant G peptides P   by          Fishers exact test Moreover of those PDimmunized          PDchallenged mice that did exhibit an anaphylactic          reaction the drop in temperature was less sustained than          that in those mice in the other groups that exhibited          anaphylaxis Fig B and only  of these mice died           Table  In accord with these results immunization of          the NOD mice with PD peptides produced a less robust          specific IgG antibody response than did immunization          with the immunodominant G peptides see below As          expected none of the mice immunized with salineIFA          alone developed anaphylaxis upon ip challenge with          saline Table  Fig           Notably in the mice immunized with G PD or HELOVA          emulsified in IFA anaphylactic responses were also          provoked by the third ip immunization with peptides           in the G group  for PD  for HELOVA          However these anaphylactic responses were less severe          than those induced by subsequent peptide challenge of the          same mice with a less dramatic drop in body temperature          data not shown and no deaths Finally although the          numbers of mice that had developed diabetes by the day of          peptide challenge in each of the immunized groups was          small  there were no statistically significant          differences in the incidence of anaphylactic reactions in          these mice vs mice that were normoglycemic at the time          of peptide challenge                          IgG IgGa and IgE responses          Antibody responses were analyzed by ELISA in serum          obtained  to  days before the  week challenge with          peptides or saline Mice immunized with the G peptides          had high IgG titers against the G peptides with levels          of IgG being significantly higher than those of IgGa P            by MannWhitney U test tailed Figure A          AntiG IgG antibodies generally were not detectable in          the other groups PD or HELOVA immunized or IFA          alone or in the noninjected nave mice The two          exceptions were a single nonimmunized mouse with antiG          IgG antibodies at a serum concentration of  gml          and one mouse immunized with HELOVA with antiG IgGa          antibodies at a serum concentration of  ngml          Antipeptide IgG and IgGa antibodies also were detected          in PD Figure B and HELOVA Figure C immunized          mice although the magnitude of the antibody responses to          these peptides especially the IgG response were          substantially less than those to the G peptides          Total IgE concentrations were slightly but          significantly higher in the peptideimmunized groups          G PD or HELOVA compared to those in mice injected          with IFA and saline alone Figure  However the serum          concentrations of total IgE were very similar in the mice          that had been immunized with G PD or HELOVA peptides          Figure                             Discussion        This study clearly demonstrates that ip immunization        of NOD mice with preparations of GAD self peptides in IFA        can cause a marked shift towards a T         H  like response as reflected by high        levels of IgG Similarly Liu         et al recently demonstrated that        strong IgG responses can be induced in NOD mice that have        been immunized subcutaneously with insulin B chain peptides        administered in physiological saline     However both        studies showed that anaphylaxis can be induced in such mice        upon subsequent rechallenge with preparations of the        peptides used for immunization     Moreover the        anaphylactic reactions in mice that had been immunized and        challenged with G peptides were severe with reductions in        body temperature that were very similar to those observed        in mice exhibiting IgEdependent passive systemic        anaphylaxis and with a very high fatality rate  mice        or  Anaphylaxis also developed in some NOD mice that        had been immunized and challenged with preparations of PD        peptides that are not immunodominant in NOD mice        although both the drop in body temperature and the death        rate in these mice were significantly less than those        observed in the mice immunized and challenged with G        peptides        There were both similarities and differences between our        findings in the NOD mouse model of TDM and those in the        EAE model     Expression of EAE requires specific        immunization with self peptides eg PLP  or        MOG and these peptides generally are administered in        complete Freunds adjuvant CFA By contrast TDM        develops spontaneously in NOD mice On the other hand        induction of anaphylactic reactivity in NOD mice appeared        to require immunization of the mice with GAD peptides in        this model in IFA as nave NOD mice challenged with G        peptides exhibited no detectible reactions and none of        them died Table  Thus in both the EAE model    and        the NOD TDM model this study and that of Liu         et al      some form of        artificial immunization with a self peptide preparation        appears to be required for the development of anaphylactic        reactivity to self This of course is not a surprising        result Indeed it is challenging to conceive of any        possible selective advantage that would be conferred by a        propensity to develop under natural conditions        potentially fatal allergic reactions to components of self        It remains to be determined whether self peptide        immunization protocols that induce anaphylactic reactivity        do so simply because of the manner in which they present        large amounts of self peptides to the immune system or        because of other factors such as the presence in the        peptide preparations of aggregates or other components        beside self peptide monomers        Whatever the underlying reasons for the development of        anaphylactic reactivity to these self peptide preparations        in both the EAE and the NOD TDM models anaphylactic        reactions occurred in mice that had developed strong IgG        responses to the relevant self peptides with only modest        changes in total IgE levels In humans antigenspecific        anaphylactic reactivity is thought to be mediated solely        or primarily by IgE antibodies whereas it has long been        known that either IgE or IgG antibodies can mediate        anaphylaxis in mice reviewed in     and            However it has been reported that IgGdependent        anaphylaxis in the mouse is associated with substantially        less histological evidence of mast cell degranulation than        is observed in IgEdependent anaphylaxis in that species            In neither of the models of autoimmunity that we        have studied ie EAE TDM in NOD mice was anaphylaxis        associated with histological evidence of substantial mast        cell degranulation    data not shown Taken together        these findings suggest that IgG antibodies contribute        importantly to the development of anaphylaxis in both of        these models On the other hand we can not rule out some        role for IgE antibodies in these reactions        Indeed Liu         et al     found that in NOD        mice that had been immunized with peptide B treatment        with both anti FcRIIRIII and antiIgE monoclonal        antibodies was required to prevent anaphylaxis upon        challenge with the peptide Interestingly however Liu         et al     did not detect IgE        antibodies to B or B in the serum of their NOD        mice By contrast mice that had been immunized with B        peptide at  or  gdose exhibited a robust and        dosedependent IgG antibody response to the peptide            Thus in both B peptideassociated anaphylaxis Liu         et al      and GAD        peptideassociated anaphylaxis our study antipeptide        IgG antibodies contribute to the response However IgE        antibodies also appear to contribute to anaphylaxis to        B peptides     and may also be involved in our        model        One point not yet clarified by the comparison of the        present results those of Liu         et al      and those of Pedotti                et al    is whether the        influence of thymic expression of the self peptide on the        propensity to develop anaphylactic reactivity differs in        the EAE and NOD TDM models In the study by Pedotti et al            it was noted that the two self peptides that        induced anaphylactic reactivity MOG  and PLP        are not expressed in the thymus whereas the two peptides        tested that did not induce anaphylactic reactivity PLP         p  and MBPA         C  are expressed at that site        However both GAD and GAD mRNA can be detected in the        thymic medullary epithelial cells in mice     Thus        despite thymic expression of GAD and GAD at the level        of mRNA NOD mice spontaneously develop autoreactivity to        these islet and brain expressed proteins and        rechallenge of mice that have been immunized with peptides        from GAD results in severe anaphylactic reactions On the        other hand expression of GAD or GAD protein in the        thymus has not yet been reported Similarly as reviewed in        Liu         et al      although several        lines of evidence indicate that insulin is present in the        thymus of mice and humans it is possible that the specific        insulin peptides that induced anaphylaxis in their study        are not ordinarily present in that site As a result it        has not yet been demonstrated that anaphylactic reactions        can develop to self peptides that are expressed in the        thymus        It should be emphasized that NOD mice have a partial        defect in thymic negative selection      a defect in        FcRIIB that can negatively regulate anaphylactic        reactions      and perhaps other genetic        polymorphisms that may result in immunological        hyperresponsiveness The same is likely to be true in at        least some patients with type  diabetes and in patients        in the prediabetic phase Therefore because of the risk        of induction of anaphylactic sensitization extreme caution        needs to be used in developing any type of antigenspecific        immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention or treatment        of TDM This caution probably should be extended to all        attempts to shift immune responses to self or foreign        antigens from a T         H  to a T         H  response Indeed in a recent phase        II clinical trial  of MS patients given an altered        peptide ligand APL of a myelin basic protein epitope        developed immediate hypersensitivity reactions after        multiple injections of the APL     Thus it would        appear that great care must be taken when injecting        preparations of putative tolerogens in attempts to        suppress T         H mediated autoimmune diseases                    Methods                  Mice          Female NODLtJ mice The Jackson Laboratory Bar
