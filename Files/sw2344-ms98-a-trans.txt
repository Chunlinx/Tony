        hi   hello hi   my names Ken   hi Ken my names Diane   and um youre in Texas right   yes im in San Antonio   everybodys in Texas God okay       im in Rochester New York everybody else but one has been in Texas   oh   okay well i guess we should get on with this um did you get the message about what it was right yeah okay go great let me just hit the button   okay yes       okay um do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us   i think theyll always represent a threat whether whether or not theres an active cold war or not uh its its a a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities and uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think its always a threat   yeah thats interesting i dont i i suspect theyre not our biggest threat anymore   probably not no   i suspect its probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein   right   whos our biggest threat but um i wonder if theyre i wonder how much of a threat they are i agree with you that that theyll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that theres just its just so big and theres just so much military machine there   umhum and its and its recognized that the two great powers are us and them and and the two great powers are always pitted against each other   right but i wonder how much longer theyre going to be a them   i dont know  they theyre going downhill pretty steady   huh thats yeah uh   but i i agree right now theyre not i dont believe theyre a large threat right now i think theres always some threat   yeah oh i agree i mean if we were to if if something were to happen im sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be but   yeah actually i feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are are are uh wanting things that we have that theyre not allowed i mean just some basic freedoms and and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that hes been trying to push   yeah actually i noticed that i mean this this this most recent scam of his where he said where he just decided that instead of having uh instead of having i cant i cant think of the word now um if theyre having demonstrations for in in favor of Boris Yeltsin he decided well ill just cancel all demonstrations altogether   umhum   so i i i think that he he hes actually he i think is becoming very dangerous   yeah   because hes making those people angry at him and hes also i think hes also making um the military angry at him i mean ive heard stories now where the   yeah   where the um the military is running around and theyre sort of getting restless and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know when the Baltic States when they just go in there   yeah   to beat people up   see im concerned that that since hes banned demonstrations altogether that hes going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square and hes going to wipe out no telling how many of his   umhum   own countrymen uh right in the middle of Red Square and uh its going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring   thats interesting i i wonder i dont know if hes he he seems the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldnt be that dumb  i dont know though   i dont know i mean and it it might be something that he wouldnt be able to control   thats that thats thats something that really true that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before i think thats thats certainly true i mean his military may just go out and say well we just Gorbachev said you cant do it and were just not going to let you do it you know so   umhum yeah   yeah that thats real scary actually i mean i i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but   yeah   it could be real dangerous   yeah weve got our own worries at the moment so   yeah right we dont need to worry about them   i guess as long as as uh theyre fighting each other we dont have to worry about them wasting their time with us   yes but wouldnt it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else   well sure that but thats a thats an impossibility i think   yes   given the the uh differences in the world and people are just too different   well i dont i dont know i think that underlying underlying underlying were all pretty probably not as as different as everybody thinks   but unfortunately people people arent that insightful   right well thats thats certainly true i just   they just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do so therefore hes wrong and hes bad and we have to wipe wipe him out   thats true i was i was discussing with someone before um this uh someone before actually one of these calls   umhum   as a matter of fact about um another topic but it came up under these um this this this poem Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten or something   uhhuh   youve read that one before   no i havent read it ive heard all about it though   that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to the idea that um basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten and and in kindergarten we learned to share and we learned to um play with each other we learned to take nap you know and to take naps and and whenever wed start a fight wed all apologize and hug each other   yeah   you know and that would be all if we could just do the same thing sort of with with with everybody else i suspect wed wed be fine   yes but people grow up and they forget   yeah unfortunately because because i often i often sort of wonder how having never been to the Soviet Union um how different the people there really are you know how how much everyone always thought of them as you know sort of the   thats one of the places i would most like to go not right now of course but at at some point i would like to to go to Moscow and and   yeah   to just to see all these things that you can can see on television now and can read about that ten years ago we didnt have this kind of information i mean we didnt know   right   what things were like so   i would i would love to go there i mean like again again not now but at some point to go see what what this is like i mean this this is am azing because this is this is an this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us like you said before as well so itd be interesting to watch   yeah i and i the the people i just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they cant they they i mean they they cant do any they cant change it they try and they theres nothing that they can do   yeah thats thats and and the ones they even feel somewhat worse for even um the ones in like the Baltic States   umhum   where they dont have a strong leader that you know at least at least Russia has some sort of strong leader i mean they have Yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help Russia   yeah   but um i mean the Baltic States i think are just sort of trapped i mean they were taken over couple of you know not too long ago   yeah   and then just sort of told well youre here now youre part of our country and you be this way uh i i think its a sad state of affairs but   its its probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the im trying to think of the name of the the  something like that in Northern Iraq   oh yeah the yeah   who are actually who are actually countrymen of of i mean some of them were split off into Israel i believe and some of them are in Turkey when actually   umhum   they they dont theyre their own people and their own beliefs and their own culture system and they were split up into three different countries   right umhum   and and theyre very dissatisfied and theyre theyre causing wars right now and   yeah that yeah and that   and i dont think its that different from what the Baltic States are are going through   um um um uh actually it sounds very i mean very similar theyre sort of being they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey we want our piece   yeah   and they have other problems they have Shiite Muslims to deal with   uhhuh   as well as Saddam Hussein i i mean i think their big problem up there is you know unfortunately not only are they there theres more than one group fighting for the same place where they all want you know whereas the Baltics are saying well we want our own we just want this little tiny piece of land   yeah yeah the the one that i think one of the women women that i work for is married to an Iranian and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the the countries over there and within five or six countries there are   umhum   probably ten cultures of people and and thats they dont all have their own country and and some of them are mad about it   yes yes umhum um actually uh my wife is Syrian um so i i also i know some of the history and so forth   oh   and and actually the real funny thing is that im im im Jewish were sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves   oh huh uhhuh   so we i i know that and ive been to Israel and i know and i sort of toured the area and i know that it really is very lots of different cultures in one place i mean and and its the same thing i its its almost the same thing out out in the Soviet Union right now there you know there are   umhum   you cant take a whole bunch of people who just arent the same people and dont want to be together and put them together forcibly   yeah yeah   i mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here but they wanted to do it   umhum   so i could put the   yeah and i i dont think the people here two hundred years ago were that different i really dont   thats thats certainly true   i mean they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs   right um i wonder i wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union dont have ideas very different from that so at least   they they they might the the Baltic States might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here   thats possible   to to escape
