                                 Crime and Truth            Akhil Reed Amar a professorof law at Yale is the acknowledged dean of the socalled truth school ofcriminaljustice reform This school which is growing in influence amongacademics judges and legislators maintains that the object of criminaltrials must be the truth To reach this goal its advocates argue the barriersthat stand in the way of convicting the truly guilty should be lowered Thiscan be done by reinterpreting the relevant sections of the Constitution inaccordance with their original historical meaning Among the barriers targetedby the truth school are the Fourth Amendments exclusionary rulewhich forbidsthe introduction into trial of evidence obtained in violation of thatamendmentand the Fifth Amendments prohibition on eliciting the truth fromcriminal defendants by compelling them to testify            On an abstract level Amarsargument is hard to disagree with Who can be against the truth The problem isin the details In this provocative and often brilliant book Amar shows uswhat his Truth School would look like It is a beautiful blueprint but theplans would not pass a safety inspection in the real world of cops robbersprosecutors defense attorneys and judges            Amaroffers several radical recommendations Besides his proposals to abolishvirtually all exclusionary rules and require criminal defendants to testifyagainst themselves in pretrial depositions he would limit search warrants tothe point of virtual disuse and with them the requirement of probable causeHe would instead substitute a blanket rule decreeing that all searches that arenot unreasonablean issue to be decided on an ad hoc basis byjuriessatisfy the Fourth Amendment standard            In fairness Amar would attribute these views not tohimself but to the framers of our Bill of Rights Historians differ howeveras to the original meaning of the Fourth and Fifth amendments Not only can thedevil cite scripture but special pleaders can find in the opentextured wordsand often ambiguous history of these hastily drafted amendments almost anythingthey want to claim is the right or left approach It is unlikely that Amarsprescription for a wholesale reinterpretation of established doctrine will soonprevail Nonetheless his writings are too influential to be ignored even ifthe provocative issues he raises are more usefully and honestly argued on thelevel of the policies they point to than on the level of what the Constitutiondictates            What arethe policy implications of Amars proposals to change our currentinterpretations of the Fourth and Fifth amendments to bring them more in linewith the search for truth These proposals should be evaluated on two basesWill they in fact produce more truth And if so will they undercut othervalues more important than truth            On the first question Amar tries to have itboth ways He rightfully criticizes the current exclusionary rule for notserving as an effective to police misconduct His better way is to letcitizens sue the government for making mistakes in its quest for evidence Butif this kind of tort remedy were to work effectively it would of necessitydeter some searches that are today conducted by errant cops who do not fear theoccasional exclusion of illegally obtained evidence The upshot might be fewerquestionable searches less evidence and hence less truth Amar gives noreason to believe his way will be more selective in searching for true ratherthan false evidence It may prove to be a more effective deterrent tounreasonable searches but unless reasonableness is tautologically defined toinclude only searches that turn up evidence of guilt the more effective thedeterrent the less truth it is likely to uncover            Amaradvocates that all criminal defendants be compelled to give pretrialdepositions but his book is vague about whether these depositions wouldsubstitute for or supplement police interrogation In a recent public debatewith this reviewer however Amar stated clearly that he would accept thetradeoff and give up police interrogation for compelled pretrial depositionsSuch a tradeoff would diminish considerably the ability of the police to getat the truth since jailhouse interrogation in the absence of a lawyer is morelikely to break a guilty defendant than a courtroom deposition conducted withthe assistance of counsel is That is why I believe that few policeofficersor prosecutorswould accept a blanket prohibition on policeinterrogation in exchange for compelled pretrial depositions They might acceptit for whitecollar cases since whitecollar defendants almost never submit topolice interrogations But street criminal defendants do and many waivetheir Miranda rights and confess or provide leads Thus Amars better way ofgetting confessions might also produce less truth than the current approachdoes            On the question of whether the proposals of the truthschool will denigrate other values more important than truth we have a longhistory from which to learn If truth were the only goal of the criminal trialthat goal would not be difficult to reach First we would reintroduce thetechniques of the Inquisition the Star Chamber and the Stalinist secretpolice They knew how to get at the truth without any interference from civillibertarians seeking to burden their singleminded pursuits with such asprivacy bodily integrity fairness and civility Throughout our historythose who have sought the Holy Grail of truth have shown impatience withprocess The first victim in the search for truth has too often beenliberty            Second if our only goal wereto maximize truth we would lower the burden of proof in criminal cases frombeyond a reasonable doubt to a preponderance of the evidence Why wouldanyone seeking more truth prefer  guilty go free to one innocent wrongly convicted Indeed under our present rule a jury is told that if itbelieves that a defendant probably did it it must acquit him becauseprobably is not enough A system that sought a greater quantity of truthwould instruct the fact finder to accept a disputed fact if it were more likelythan not that the fact was true            Third wewould never allocate fact finding to  randomly selected individuals whosemajor qualification is that they know nothing about the matter in dispute Norwould we allocate it to judges who are also not scientific experts We wouldhave relevant professionalsscientists accountants engineers forensicspecialistsdecide all criminal cases We would employ the methodologies ofscience not democracy to arrive at justice            The point is that we all agreecertainly Amarwho loves juries and supports a high burden of proof agreesthat ourdemocratic system of fact finding is already a compromise between the searchfor truth and the search for fairness The real question is how to strike anappropriate balance among the often conflicting values of truth on the one handand considerations such as privacy and equality on the other            It is precisely on thisdifficult issue that Amar is at his weakest His absence of handson experiencewith our current criminaljustice systemhis lack of feel for how it actuallyworksputs him at a perceptible disadvantage when seeking to strike thisexquisitely delicate balance Nonetheless his book is a valuable contributionto the debate because it gives those with experience an abstractarchitectural plan against which to evaluate todays imperfect reality ofcriminal justice
