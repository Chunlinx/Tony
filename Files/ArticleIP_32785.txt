                                 The Politics of EMTalkEM            Whatdoes it take to win an election First you must establish name identificationviability and a vision Then you must lower the medias expectations rebutcharges of pandering and profligacy and fend off attacks on your characterWhat does it take to launch a magazine successfully As Talk Editor TinaBrown demonstrated this week the answer is pretty much the same thing                           Name identification Having served in two highprofile offices over thepast  years  Vanity Fair and The New Yorker  Brown was wellpositioned for a run at Talk  She scored an early publicity coup bygetting Hillary Clinton to appear in the magazine at its debut But Brown alsobenefited from a gaffe by her opponent New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani whoresponded to Clintons appearance by banishing Talk s launch party froma cityowned site His attack on Brown made the front pages of the New Yorktabloids giving Talk a free media hit                           Pandering Many editors like politicians broaden their audience byappealing to the publics lowest instinctsand like politicians are accusedof pandering The rap on Brown is that shes vapid and shallow and hermagazine is fluff and froth A parody Web site calls Talk ChatterBanter Emotion Solipsism Pretense As often happens in campaigns Brownsuffered an embarrassing defection last month when writer Walter Kirn quit andtold the press he had been saddled with celebrity profile assignments            Browns surrogates have replied that a good editor like a good politicianmust toss a bit of red meat to the crowd now and then to sustain her popularityand her movement But Brown like Dan Quayle has lent credence to hercaricature She has told the press that her editorial knack lies in beingeasily bored and that the problem with celebrity hype is that its dullFaced with the charge that shes lowbrow Brown has espoused a highlowformula under which Talk will endeavor according to one staffer tobalance the higherbrow stuff and the trashier stuff Browns critics havealso circulated her quote that magazines should be places where people canpicnic intellectually These comments create an impression of flippancy andflipflopping which bolsters the argument that Brown lacks conviction                           Vision The best way to deflect charges of pandering and flipflopping isto articulate an essential message or vision Brown constantly boasts thatTalk has a point of view But when called upon to define it shespeaks of a look a tone and an atmosphere Talk  she told theWall Street Journal  is about expressingwithout encumbrance of anykinda vision in a sense of the times that we are in She comes offsounding like President Bush whose ruminations on the vision thing convincedeveryone that he recognized the importance of having a vision but didnt quiteknow what the word meant Instead Brown speaks often of her passion anddesire for good writing Message I care                           Character Some of Browns opponents have gone negative calling herruthless and tyrannical She seems unsure whether to stay on messageThedogs bark and the caravan moves on she told Londons SundayTelegraph or to make negative campaigning an issue While her surrogatesdecry the long knives arrayed against her Brown accuses her rivals of bloodsport At times she plays to the center projecting kindness and toleranceI dont understand this fear thing Im not vindictive At other times sheplays to her base wearing her enemies scorn as a badge of honor Ive fireda lot of people and killed a lot of copy I dont make friends that wayLike any smart politician Brown spins the attacks on her as evidence of herformidability As New York Post columnist Liz Smith puts it What is itabout her that scares the rest of the press            Brownalso has a Clintonian streak that threatens to escalate pandering into acharacter issue Bill Clinton pitches himself as the man who feels your painBrown pitches Talk as the magazine of intimacy starting with itscover story The Intimate Hillary in which the first lady divulges herfeelings about her husbands infidelities The consensus among politicalpundits is that whether Brown used Mrs Clinton vice versa or both the wholething was calculated rather than intimate Browns assertions that the pieceplumbs the depth of the Clintons shared passions and spiritual intensityadd to the impression that shes more interested in advertising intimacy thanin achieving it                           Fiscal responsibility The old rap on Brown was that she spent wastefullyand ran up big deficits at The                New Yorker  Browns spin is thatshe cut the deficit When I arrived it was losing money and when I left itwas losing less money But the old rap has been overtaken by a new rapthatBrown is fielding a B team of writers because shes no longer paying toprates Meanwhile the hardtimes ethic of fiscal austerity has given way to agoodtimes ethic of invest and grow which frowns on frugality Brownssuccessor at The New Yorker  David Remnick is criticized for beingweak on the buzz factor sheepish about courting fashion designers andaddicted to earnest seriousness A colleague likens Remnicks avoidance oflimousine service to President Carters despised modesty                           Expectations An editor like a candidate must limit expectations so thatshe can impress everyone by exceeding them Brown has done so A week ago thehype about Talk had spent itself Expectation is so high that herenemies are already predicting the biggest letdown since Eyes WideShut  crowed the Telegraph  New Yorks Daily News saidcritics were predicting a gigantic fizzle But by the time the magazine cameout the backlash too had spent itself According to Time  thecorrect attitude prior to Talk s debut was to be sick of it alreadywithout having seen it But Brown has created something that shouts README            And being readultimately is the name of the game The magazine market is less like a generalelection in which the candidate with the higher negative rating always losesthan like a crowded primary in which the fight for attention is crucial andits worth alienating some people in order to attract others The more Brown isattacked the better she does When Giuliani vetoed Talk s party siteand told the press it was unimportant and irrelevant all he did was makethe magazine important and relevant The Journal put the pointsuccinctly to Brown Is any publicity good publicity She answered Peopleare rarely indifferent to the magazines Ive put out Sometimes they hate itbut they are engaged In other words yes
