                    Background        One of the first observable changes at a developing        neuromuscular synapse is the aggregation of nicotinic        acetylcholine receptors AChRs in the postsynaptic        membrane This aggregation can be detected within several        hours of stimulation by a nerve terminal or by alternative        stimuli and is crucial to the function of the mature        synapse in that it ensures both speed and reliability of        signal transduction Extensive studies in varied        experimental systems have identified specific        intracellular        and extracellular                components which appear to be involved in the        formation and maturation of AChR aggregates        In addition to a contacting nerve terminal receptor        aggregation can be induced by several experimental stimuli        including agrin       electric fields                polystyrene beads      culture substratum             and high calcium or neuraminidase               Among these agrin is the only one for which a strong        argument of physiological relevance can be advanced        Published accounts have demonstrated that the neuromuscular        junction does not develop in agrin deficient mutant mice            in strong support of the agrin hypothesis                   More recently a member of the laminin family laminin        has been shown to induce AChR aggregation Interestingly        this induction appears to be independent of the        mechanisms by which agrin acts based on an additive dose        response relationship the lack of requirement for MuSK        and the lack of tyrosinephosphorylation of receptors        during aggregation       Note that in this context        independent simply means that there is at least some        difference in the two sequences of events besides the        signaling event and from the dose response data that the        two sequences do not share a rate limiting step The        existence of independent pathways is important because many        studies over the past decades have implicitly assumed that        receptor aggregation whether spontaneous or induced by        various stimuli constitutes a single phenomenon carried        out by a common mechanism        To further address the extent to which commonality of        mechanism exists in differentially induced receptor        aggregates we have compared the ultrastructural        arrangement of receptors within spontaneous and agrin or        laminin induced aggregates We previously demonstrated        that agrin induced receptor aggregates are aligned on a        hexagonal grid of ca    nm spacing              We show now that laminin induced receptor aggregates do        not exhibit this regularity in ultrastructure while        spontaneous receptor aggregates display heterogeneous        characteristics with some aggregates showing regular        spacing while others do not                    Results        Laminin clearly induces AChR aggregation over and        above that found spontaneously in control cells Figure         Using software designed to quantify aggregate number size        and position similar to that reported previously            we have determined that there are significant increases in        both number and size of receptor aggregates following        treatment with laminin eg aggregates per cell            vs    for control Student T p              This finding parallels reports in mouse muscle cells             but is in contrast to one report from         Xenopus            At the level of scanning electron microscopy membrane        regions rich in AChRs whether spontaneous or induced by        agrin or laminin show receptor distributions which appear        decidedly nonrandom Figure  That is numerous        nanoaggregates  very dense nanometer scale particle        clusters  are seen which give an appearance markedly        different from what is seen for example in plots of        points selected at random This heterogeneous        nanoaggregate rich visual impression is confirmed by        quantitative analysis of the nearest neighbor distances        Figure  In both laminin induced and control AChR        aggregates there are far more small  nm distances        found than would be expected in truly random distributions        Figure Aand B dashed curve see Materials and methods        for theoretical distribution This means that many        receptors are closer to each other than predicted by a        random distribution exactly as would be expected by the        formation of nanoaggregates The same theoretical random        particle distribution function can be better fit to the        data by artificially increasing the density many fold        solid curves These are still statistically inconsistent        with the data of Figure  Aand B in part because the        predictive equation assumes a sharp cutoff at the hindrance        distance Materials and methods while the data clearly        show a more gradually decreasing probability as a somewhat        smaller hindrance distance is approached        With respect to structure within aggregates the arrows        in these figures indicate the positions at which agrin        induced receptor aggregates were found to peak which        indicated that receptors were arranged in a hexagonal array        with a spacing of approximately  nm      It can        be seen that these peaks are not present in laminin        induced aggregates A but may be weakly present in the        spontaneous receptor aggregates B To examine whether        these small peaks in the  nm range are significant        the distributions were fit to quadratics and tested        statistically against them This is not to suggest a        quadratic form for the distribution but rather to test        whether that region of a distribution is consistent with a        smoothly decreasing function It was determined that        laminin induced aggregate structure is in fact consistent        with this but that spontaneous aggregate structure is not        Figure  legend Thus it appears that at least some of        the peaks seen in spontaneous aggregate nearest neighbor        distances are significant        To probe further into aggregate structure software was        designed to detect nanoaggregates Materials and methods        Figure shows a plot of a scanning electron micrograph        montage revealing the overall ultrastructural arrangement        of AChRs The colors illustrate the aggregate detection        algorithm and confirm that its function is consistent with        what the human eye detects as nanoaggregates Two        representative nanoaggregates are shown in Figure  which        also illustrates the measurements applied to them These        are size number of gold particles density and two        measures of spherical vs oblong shape the normalized        areaperimeter ratio and the diameter ratio Materials and        methods Table shows the mean and standard error of these        measures applied to laminin induced spontaneous and agrin        induced receptor aggregates No significant differences are        seen in any of these measures between laminin induced and        spontaneous aggregates However compared to either of        these agrin induced aggregates are significantly larger        and         less dense in terms of gold particle        distribution Student T p   Although it is at        first glance counterintuitive this decrease in particle        density agrin induced aggregates is best interpreted as        an         increase in receptor density see        Discussion Table shows the correlation between these        measures when all three experimental treatments are pooled        n          There appears to be a modest negative correlation        between size and density This means that larger aggregates        tend to have a lower density of gold particles in        agreement with the finding that agrin induced        nanoaggregates are both larger and less dense than those of        laminin induced or spontaneous nanoaggregates Although        there may be a small negative correlation between density        and the areaperimeter ratio this would at best account for        only  of the variation seen in these measurements and        seems to be contraindicated by the much smaller        correlation between density and the diameter ratio This        latter ratio and the areaperimeter ratio are highly        correlated confirming that they measure approximately the        same shape attribute along the lineartocircular dimension        Materials and methods        The apparently weak regular structure seen in        spontaneous receptor aggregates suggests two possibilities        First it could be that these nanoaggregates are        homogeneous with respect to structure and they all display        an underlying hexagonal structure which is partially masked        by misplaced receptors within these aggregates At the        other extreme it could be that there are two populations        of spontaneous nanoaggregates one of which shows        significant hexagonal structure while the other does not        Despite the similarities in the means and variances of the         measures for laminin induced and spontaneous        nanoaggregates an examination of the underlying frequency        histograms revealed one suggestive difference in this        regard Figure shows the frequency histograms for density        in laminin induced A and spontaneous B nanoaggregates        The former appears to be a simple skewed distribution but        the latter appears to be bimodal thereby suggesting that        there may indeed be two underlying populations        Because of this and the difference in particle density        seen in agrin induced nanoaggregates we examined the        nearest neighbor distances distribution for the two        populations  one above and one below the density median        Figure  In Figure Ait is seen that the high density        fraction of spontaneous nanoaggregates shows very little in        the way of regular structure On the other hand Figure        Bshows an improved match of the low density fraction to        the predicted peaks arrows which represent a hexagonal        array of  nm spacing In fact this low density        population is not significantly different from the modeled        distribution based on the geometry and spacing assumptions        previously presented Figure  legend             Moreover this difference in density and orderliness cannot        be attributed to subtle experimental variations from        preparation to preparation of  control images containing        more than one nanoaggregate  contained nanoaggregates        both above and below the median density see Discussion        Thus the latter hypothesis presented above appears to be        the valid one spontaneous receptor aggregates are        heterogeneous with some showing well ordered structure and        others none at all                    Discussion        This work was undertaken with the expectation that the        ultrastructure of AChR aggregates  whether spontaneous or        induced by laminin  would either be ordered like those        of agrin induced aggregates or unordered As often        transpires the experimental results lead in a direction        that is both more complicated and more interesting In        interpreting our results it is useful to keep clearly in        mind the different spatial scales of observation        Accordingly we have used the term nanoaggregates to        denote phenomena at the nanometer scale of resolution as        distinguished from the commonly used microaggregates        which indicates aggregation observations at the micron        scale        Laminin clearly induces microaggregation of receptors        after  hours in our culture system Figure  This        finding conflicts with a recent report based on a similar        approach     although the differences in the system        may be significant In the cited work embryonic         Xenopus myocytes were cultured onto a        rat tail collagen substrates which promotes cell adhesion        and a flattening out of the cells and incubated at a        laminin concentration of up to  nM The authors report        that control unstimulated cultures under these conditions        typically display  AChR megaclusters   m on        the ventral surface In our system the myocytes are plated        onto clean glass coverslips typically do not flatten out        on the substrate and display only small microaggregates        if any in controls eg Figure B Thus the induction of        receptor aggregates by laminin may be either        statistically or physiologically masked by the presence of        preexisting large aggregates in the earlier work        Alternatively it may be that their culture system would        have shown receptor aggregation at the laminin        concentration used in the present study  nm        Receptor aggregates spontaneous or induced by        laminin are clearly not randomly distributed on a        nanometer scale Instead and like agrin induced        aggregates they form discrete nanoaggregates Figures          in a manner termed heterogeneous aggregation              The alternative completely consistent with all        light microscopic evidence would be a spatially uniform        and random distribution of receptors which are simply at a        higher density than in membrane not displaying aggregation        on the micron scale homogeneous aggregation        Notwithstanding this global nonrandom distribution of        receptors laminin induced receptor aggregates do not show        evidence of the ordered structure previously found in agrin        induced receptor aggregates Figure  Rather than a        nearest neighbor distance profile showing preferred        distances consistent with a hexagonal spacing of receptors        the nearest neighbor distances within laminin induced        aggregates are consistent with an unstructured        distribution This difference in ultrastructure parallels        recent reports suggesting that agrin and laminin induce        receptor aggregates via different mechanisms              and confirms our working hypothesis that detailed analysis        of aggregate ultrastructure can provide important clues to        aggregation mechanisms        With regard to spontaneous receptor aggregation our        findings indicate that the weak display of structure        results not from uniformly weak nanoaggregate ordering but        from two classes of aggregates Those characterized by a        lower density of gold particle label have an        ultrastructural arrangement like that of agrin induced        receptor aggregates hexagonal array  nm spacing        while those displaying a higher density are relatively        unstructured and are in this respect like the        nanoaggregates induced by laminin Figure         Could the presence or absence of orderly nanoaggregate        structure be accounted for by subtle differences in culture        or fixation technique from experiment to experiment or        over time If this were true we would have expected similar        outcomes from laminin induced and spontaneous aggregates        which were not observed Moreover this hypothesis predicts        that in the case of our spontaneous aggregate experiments        low and high density nanoaggregates would be found on        mutually exclusive sets of slides Instead we found that        individual slides and indeed individual cell images        displayed both low and high density nanoaggregates        Therefore we conclude that differences in structure cannot        be attributed to unintended variations in treatment and        are instead due to real differences in the physiological        events resulting in aggregation        At first glance it may seem surprising that it is the         lower density nanoaggregates  as        measured by gold particle density  which present a more        ordered ultrastructural arrangement For that matter since        the ordered nanoaggregates are packed at nearly the maximal        possible density     how can other nanoaggregates have        a significantly higher density Table  The resolution of        this apparent paradox resides in the distinction between        differences in gold particle density which are observed        and the underlying receptor density which must be        inferred As previously reported the labeling paradigm        used here precludes the labeling of adjacent receptors in        hexagonally arranged nanoaggregates     This means        that gold particle density can actually be increased in        lower receptor density unordered aggregates Figure  In        fact the maximum possible increase in receptor density from        a  nm hexagonal array assuming a receptor diameter of         nm is about   significantly less than that seen        for the gold particle density differences in Table  Thus        the only interpretation that can be given to our findings        is that the receptor density within nanoaggregates is        actually higher in those induced by agrin than those        induced by laminin Furthermore it is the higher receptor        density lower particle density spontaneous aggregates        which like agrin induced aggregates show a regularly        ordered structure        As discussed previously there is growing evidence for at        least two mechanistic pathways of AChR aggregation One of        these is characteristic of agrin which involves the        phosphorylation of MuSK and the receptor as well as the        colocalization of Dystroglycan and in our studies        produces a regularly ordered structure The second is        exemplified by the stimulus of laminin which does not        involve receptor or MuSK phosphorylation or Dystroglycan        colocalization       and does not result in an        ordered structure within nanoaggregates We will denote the        former as the agrin pathway without caveat as agrin has        clearly been shown to play an important physiological role        in receptor aggregation and synapse formation         in vivo The latter we will term the        laminin pathway for convenience but with an understanding        that the term may be misleading as the physiological role        for laminin has not been established In particular it has        not been determined whether the role of laminin is        instructive or simply permissive with respect to receptor        aggregation        Into the agrin pathway we can add neuraminidase and        elevated calcium based on the biochemical criteria            and competition studies suggest that electric fields also        induce receptor aggregation via the agrin pathway             Other stimuli may later be added to either the agrin or        laminin pathway and one prediction from the present work        is that classification based on biochemical mechanism and        ultrastructural arrangement will be found to be mutually        consistent        This brings us to a consideration of the dichotomous        nature of spontaneous aggregates with respect to structure        and presumably with respect to the mechanism of aggregate        formation What is to be made of the existence of these two        classes of nanoaggregates The most likely interpretation        is that low level aggregation occurs spontaneously laminin        pathway and that in a fraction of these events the        maturation of nanoaggregates then transpires resulting in        ordered structure agrin pathway The size of this        fraction is presumed to be smaller than that actually        detected because the established aggregates are expected to        have a longer lifetime in the plasma membrane An        alternative interpretation holds that spontaneous receptor        aggregation proceeds along the agrin pathway producing        ordered aggregate structure and that absent some        confirming signal these decay into unstructured aggregates        which are then detected as part of the population If the        biochemical and structural data do indeed coincide this        would also involve the removal of colocalized        Dystroglycan and the dephosphorylation of MuSK in the        nanoaggregates environment In point of fact the unordered        aggregates detected in our experiments could result from        both immature and senescent aggregates although the latter        would be expected to have very short lifetimes and        therefore be difficult to detect        Finally our present work leads us to speculate pending        further results that the present classification of        aggregation pathways may also map onto more functional        concepts such as preliminary induction the laminin        pathway and maturation and stabilization the agrin        pathway see also     This tentative classification        is based principally on the observation that agrin in the        absence of laminin gives rise to structured receptor        nanoaggregates so that it seems in a sense to be a        complete stimulus while laminin appears to take        receptors only part of the way toward mature and stabile        receptor aggregates based on structure and additional        criteria already discussed Others have hypothesized        alternatively that laminin plays a role in aggregate        stabilization based largely on the difference in mechanism        and on the longer response time for laminin as opposed to        agrin     These opposing possibilities are equally        speculative and their sorting out will require further        experimental examination                    Conclusions         Receptor rich cell membranes show nonrandom        distributions of receptors whether they are spontaneous or        stimulated via agrin or laminin This confirms the visual        impression that receptors are organized into very dense        nanoaggregates which are too small to be resolved at the        level of light microscopy         Despite the forgoing similarity the ultrastructural        arrangement of receptors within nanoaggregates depends on        their genesis Agrin induced receptor aggregates lie on a        hexagonal array with a spacing of ca  nm while        laminin induced microaggregates display an irregular or        unstructured configuration         Spontaneous nanoaggregates taken as a whole are        found to be intermediate in degree of order evidencing        more ordered structure than laminin induced aggregates        but less than agrin induced aggregates Further analysis        shows that this is the result of two populations of        nanoaggregates in unstimulated cells a a population with        high receptor density and orderly structure and b a        population with lower receptor density and disorderly        structure         Differences in the ultrastructural arrangement of        acetylcholine receptors within aggregates parallel the        different geneses of aggregation and provide important        clues respecting the mechanisms of aggregation                    Materials and Methods

into a nanometer scale The          estimated error from digitization and marking was less          than  nm          The coordinates were used to generate frequency          histograms of nearest neighbor distancessee                These were compared to data reported previously for          agrin induced receptor aggregates and to simulations          found to account for these earlier observations as well          as the predicted probability density function for          randomly distributed particles                    where  is the density D is the nearest neighbor          distance and h is the spatial hindrance the closest two          particles can approach          The analysis was also used to identify nanoaggregates          defined as a set of  or more particles which can be          connected by chords   nm Four measurements were          performed and compared with respect to nanoaggregates          size density areaperimeter ratio and diameter ratio          Aggregate size is defined as the number of gold particles          present Aggregate density is the number of gold          particles not receptors per m  This calculation          requires a definition of the perimeter  a boundary lying          somewhere between the points included in the          nanoaggregates and those excluded A margin of  nm from          included receptors was arbitrarily chosensee Figure           Because of the necessarily arbitrary rendering of the          perimeter the density measurements and the          areaperimeter ratio described below are useful only for          comparisons within experiments described here The next          two measurements were designed to characterize the shape          of nanoaggregates in a dimension indicating more linear          tending to  or more circular tending to They were          both employed in the thought that they depend on          different assumptions about geometry and might show          different results The normalized areaperimeter ratio          was calculated from the perimeter P and its encompassed          area A by the equation                    The diameter ratio was calculated as the diameter of a          circle which could just contain the number of particles          at the measured density rearranged to minimize the          perimeter divided by the diameter of the smallest          circle centered at the center of mass which just          contains the particles in their actual configuration          This is calculated as                    where A is the observed area and d           max is the maximal diameter of the          aggregate Both of these measures return a value of           for perfectly spherical aggregates and approach  as          the aggregates become increasingly linear          The significance of the differences between          distributions was determined by the Pearson  statistic          Because of inherent redundancies in nearest neighbor          distributions the data and simulations were reduced          prior to comparison see Appendix
