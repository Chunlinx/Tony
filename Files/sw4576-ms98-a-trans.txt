        okay i um       to let you know what i feel about drug testing uh i have my qualms about having the government or anyone else for that matter testing randomly everybody across the board for various drugs however i am not against   right   testing those people who are in critical uh jobs for example airline pilots subway drivers you know people who are responsible for other peoples safety   right for uh for uh uh a larger number than just their own personal safety     correct i just think that its   yeah   uh unnecessary and really the medical testing facilities that are available now have been shown to have problems in the past as far as reliability is concerned   huh   and uh we have had situations here where people were accused of um uh utilizing drugs and uh it turned out they were on some other medication which was giving false positives   right right and the same goes with uh you can eat poppy bagels poppy seeds   umhum   and theyll come up as a as a positive for drugs as well       which is i you know id id just heard that uh just recently and i thought that was interesting       uh   uh do you more or less follow on the same lines as i do or   yeah i i do i um i have a little problem with somebody testing uh for drugs just in general as an invasion of privacy uh but i do agree with you or regarding people that deal uh with groups of other people that their lives should be they should feel a little more safe and there should be more of a safeguard you know air traffic controllers airline pilots uh anybody that deal with the public in a uh       i dont know what uh a fashion  that their lives are in their  in in their hands   yeah i i know that they were up here in New York um uh ive noticed what they have been trying to do the governor here isnt thrilled with the idea and we have uh   uhhuh   various government officials here who basically dont feel that is a good idea for along the same lines but theyre continuously clashing with the federal government which because of its antidrug war   right   um figures well since were not really accomplishing much of anything internationally lets make big headlines by going out and being for mandatory drug testing and   within the community   yeah and and that way well well nail those nine to five worker users without really solving the problem       of trying to really do something and through education and that   yeah   yeah they the federal government seems to be a lot more aggressive about this um   thats   than uh anything else its interesting that you find out with all these little scandals going on now such as in the house with the post office cocaine scandal   right yep   you know all that um   well did you hear about the uh what was happening in the Boston area uh for i guess for about the past five theyve been testing babies for AIDS   uh oh really   but not releasing the information     yeah i   they were just testing to find out how prevalent it is uh in what demographic and segments of the population but they werent telling anybody if they did it when when the results came up positive or negative they werent telling anybody   hum well their sure they were probably afraid of being sued   well im sure and also bringing light to the fact that they werent getting parental permission for it     yeah   they were just doing this test   yeah its one of these slippery slope issues where once you start by allowing this kind of randomized drug testing its the same thing with the lie detectors   yep   and uh the physiological test  tests that go on um really i think you know we are seeing more and more of privacy taken away       um courtesy of the federal government as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know every possible thing about their employees   yep   and uh at times its hypocritical as well because those in positions of leadership that want these things certainly dont want them applied to themselves   right exactly they want to they want to be just above in that regard       uh   yeah i i i dont know how much youve had experience as far as in the newspapers coming across people who have gotten into trouble with the drug stuff here in in Rochester Rochester   no   in western New York there hasnt been a terrible lot but we of course hear about the subway drivers in New York City   yep   who slammed into someone and of course you know the airline pilots are rumored you know there are already rumors of rampant alcoholism now cocaine usage   uh well theres always theres a standard joke about the Northwestern pilots     oh yeah wasnt that that thing in  Minneapolis or something when they were supposedly smashed out of their minds and then flew or they had their light   yeah
