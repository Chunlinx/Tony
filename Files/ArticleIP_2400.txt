                                 Teenage Midol Junkies            A yearold Queens NYboy is charged with sexual harassment and suspended from the second grade forkissing a female classmate within a week his picture is on the front page ofthe New                York                Times  A similar incident involving ayearold schoolboy in North Carolina becomes a national scandal Commentatorscluck delightedly over the latest little victims offeministswhohavegonetoofar We are deep into the McCarthyite phase ofthe campaign against sexual harassment John Leo opines in US News World Report                        Meanwhile the story of two girls suspended from junior high school fortrafficking in Midol the wellknown overthecounter pain pill for women hasbeen slower to build and has crested at a lower level of media frenzy Thesuspension occurred Sept a week before the notorious episode inQueensbut didnt gain real national attention until the past day or so Whythe difference The story about the boys plays into easy alarums aboutpolitical correctness The story about the girls plays against anunacknowledged form of political correctness antidrug hysteria The excessesof sexualharassment regulations are popular targets for defenders of commonsense because feminism remains a target for pundits on the rightand theconcept of harassment remains controversial The idiocies of drug policies arewidely tolerated or often celebrated            Even Bob Dole would probably not consider Midol a gatewaydrug The experiences of eighth graders Erica Taylor and Kimberly Smartt oughtto subject hysteria about drugs to a little reality testing Their descent intodrug abuse began Sept  when Kimberly suffering from menstrual cramps and aslight fever took a packet of Midol from the school nurses office withoutpermission She shared the pills with her classmate Erica The girls made themistake of exchanging notes during this transaction that were later discoveredby school officials Both were charged with possession under a zerotolerancedrug policy that does not distinguish between legal and illegal prescriptionand nonprescription drugs Erica was given a day suspension of which sheserved nine days before agreeing to attend a drugscreening and educationprogram School officials dropped a recommendation for her expulsion Kimberlythe supplier was expelled from school for  days She got no opportunity tomitigate her sentence            Schoolofficials were unrepentant defending their policy as a part of an effort tomaintain safe drugfree schoolsuntil Kimberly sued But Kimberly is notchallenging the schools antidrug regulations She is charging racialdiscrimination Kimberly is black and Erica is white Because her case is nowabout race and not drugs Kimberly is back in school            It seems unlikely however that this case willincite the same challenges to zerotolerance drug policies that were directedtoward sexualharassment regulations after the cases of the kissingyearolds Kimberly Smartt will probably not be defended as a victim ofMcCarthyism Indeed her mother told the Dayton Daily News that shecould understand a suspension for dealing in Midol it was the expulsion thatseemed too harsh            Yetantidrug crusaders routinely lie to children about drug use just aspoliticians lie about their own past experiences The campaign againstmarijuana is particularly disingenuous Drugawareness programs teach kids thatit is addictive and will lead them down the path to heroin and cocainedependencies while many parents who inhaled regularly throughout their collegeyears remain uncomfortably silent Meanwhile the testimony of politicians likeSusan Molinari who confess their youthful experimentation with marijuanacontradicts rhetoric about its addictive qualities For Molinari and millionslike her pot was just a gateway to Republicanism Some  million Americansand probably a majority of citizens between  and  have smoked marijuana atleast once according to drugpolicy critic Ethan Nadelmann director of theLindesmith Center            Penal laws regulating the possession and distribution ofmarijuana are as difficult to justify as school policies expelling eighthgraders for distributing Midol For a first offense such as growing marijuanaat home you may be sentenced to five years in prison under federal lawFederal drug laws in general are excessively harsh as the press occasionallyobserves In  the New                York                Times ran a story about ahapless yearold serving  years in federal prison for agreeing to help anundercover agent find someone selling LSD at a Grateful Dead concert            In factthe gross inequities and disastrous inefficiencies of imposing long mandatoryminimum sentences on nonviolent lowlevel drug offenders are acknowledged byvirtually everyone familiar with the criminal justice system who isnt runningfor office Ninety percent of federal judges Republican and Democraticconsider mandatory minimums for drug offenses a bad idea At the very leastantidrug laws misuse prison space About  percent of all federal prisonersare serving time for drugrelated offenses some involving simple possession ofmarijuana or cocaine            Considering federal and state laws against druguse the actions of a few overzealous school officials intent on keeping theirhallways free of caffeine and acetaminophen the ingredients of Midol providecomic relief Although it is serious business to them the case against EricaTaylor and Kimberly Smartt is the light side of the war on drugs which hasbeen one of the biggest publicpolicy disasters of the past  years Insteadof decreasing drug use it has increased the violence connected with illicitdrug trafficking greatly exacerbating the problem of gun violence The blackmarket in drugs creates a need for weapons and probably the cash with which topurchase them While we snicker at rules banning Midol from junior highschools we ignore the damage wrought by laws prohibiting selectively demonizeddrugsnotably marijuana heroin and cocaine while allowing use of tobaccoalcohol and Prozac            This is not an argument forthe legalization or decriminalization of drugs it is a plea for dispassionateconsideration of the respective costs and benefits We dont have rational drugpolicies in the streets or public schools because we dont have rationaldiscussions about drug use It is popularly considered a moral failing not apractical or medical problem for some people The war against drugs is not awar against crime its a crusade against vice Former Surgeon General JoycelynElders discovered as much when she suggested that we might study the effects oflegalization which was a bit like her other absurdly controversial suggestionthat masturbation was normal Dr Elders might have gleaned from the reactionto her remarks that no one in Congress has ever masturbated or used drugs MostAmericans will have a tough time living up to its standards
