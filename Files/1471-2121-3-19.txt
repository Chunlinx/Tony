                    Background        Most animal cells are constantly rearranging their        cellular structures to optimally perform their functions or        to respond appropriately to the changing environment that        surrounds them Using a simple protein building block        that has the ability to selfassociate to form massive        structural arrays is a common theme used in creating a        dynamic cytoskeleton Temporal and spatial regulation of        this selfassembly and its associated disassembly process        is critical for correct function For a model system we        have focused on the dynamics of myosin II thick filaments        in         D discoideum  This protein forms a        selfassembled highly regulated bidirectional array of        molecules that together with actin filaments are capable of        producing force for cellular rearrangements All evidence        suggests that unless this molecule is assembled into its        appropriate thick filament array it cannot function to        produce force        Eukaryotic cells during cell division construct        contractile rings that are mainly composed of an        actinbased cytoskeleton Myosin II a key component of        this actinbased cytoskeleton has been shown to be        essential for cytokinesis of         D discoideum cells in suspension as        well as for efficient chemotaxis and morphogenetic changes        in shape during development       All of these roles        require myosin II to be in the form of thick filaments The        question of how myosin II thick filament assembly is        regulated within living cells however remains mostly        unanswered The amoeba         D discoideum has a number of        advantages as a model system to study in vivo regulation of        myosin II thick filament assembly         D discoideum has only one endogenous        copy of the myosin II heavy chain gene and null strains of        myosin II are available      Cytokinesis in         D discoideum is also morphologically        very similar to that of animal cells            In         D discoideum  myosin II molecules        are constantly relocating into multiple locations for        participating in various processes Dynamic exchange occurs        between a cytosolic soluble pool and assembled filaments        that are enriched in the cortical cytoskeleton The        halflife of myosin between these pools has been measured        to be   sec indicating the importance of dynamic        assembly control in the localization of the protein            When a cell migrates myosin II accumulates in the        posterior of the cell During cell division myosin II        accumulates in the cleavage furrow in the early stages of        cytokinesis To accomplish its cellular tasks myosin II        assembles into bipolar thick filaments and pull together        oppositely oriented actin filaments to produce contractile        forces Mutant forms of myosin II that do not assemble into        bipolar thick filaments in vitro fail to rescue myosin null        phenotypes nor do they localize to the furrow during        cytokinesis      Although myosin II is not essential        for cell division on a surface it is critical for normal        timely cell separation and for symmetric placement of the        division furrow     GFPmyosin II is transported to the        furrow of dividing cells growing on surfaces even though it        is not essential for cytokinesis under these        conditions        The assembly of myosin II monomers into filaments is        regulated by phosphorylation of its heavy chains at three        threonine residues at the Cterminus of the tail             Dephosphorylation of these threonines is a prerequisite of        filament assembly as confirmed by the phenotypes of a        xAsp mutant in which the three threonines are replaced by        three aspartate residues mimicking the phosphorylated        state     In vitro the xAsp myosin II is severely        impaired for filament assembly and in vivo xAsp myosin II        fails to assemble or localize to the cortical cytoskeleton        Cells expressing this myosin thus recapitulate the defects        of myosin II null cells including failure to develop        normally and failure to divide in suspension In contrast        cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable myosin II construct        xAla myosin cells display severe myosin overassembly        into the cytoskeleton     and excessive myosin        localization to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis            The xAla myosin cells also display severe defects in        chemotactic cell migration demonstrating the importance of        proper myosin II assembly dynamics in this process                   Myosin II heavy chain kinase MHCK activity in this        system capable of disassembling myosin II filaments in        vitro was originally reported with partially enriched        kinase fractions     The enzyme MHCKA was        subsequently purified to homogeneity and shown to be        capable of driving myosin II filament disassembly in vitro        via myosin II heavy chain phosphorylation      A        MHCKA cDNA was cloned via expression cloning and peptide        sequence derived from the native enzyme     This        enzyme is now recognized as the founding member of a highly        novel family of protein kinases unrelated to conventional        protein kinases with members present in         D discoideum and throughout the        animal kingdom Homologybased cloning and genomic        approaches led to the identification of two closely related                D discoideum enzymes MHCKB           and MHCKC GenBank accession AAC and            Several enzymes present in mammalian systems are now        recognized as having the same conserved catalytic domain        including the eEF kinases       and TRPPLIK a        bifunctional protein with kinase and ion channel activities            Biochemical analysis with MHCKB has confirmed        that this enzyme phosphorylates         D discoideum myosin II in vitro             Analysis reported here confirms that MHCKC also        readily phosphorylates         D discoideum myosin II in vitro        supporting a possible direct role for this enzyme in myosin        II localization control in vivo        Although substantial biochemical analysis has been        performed with this family of         D discoideum MHCKs there is        relatively little information on the cellular distribution        of the endogenous MHCKs in vivo Previously Steimle and        colleagues    reported that in interphase cells during        chemotaxis random migration and endocyticphagocytic        events MHCKA is recruited preferentially to anterior        Factin rich protrusions With the discovery of two        additional myosin II heavy chain kinases MHCKB and        MHCKC we report here in live migrating and cytokinetic        cells a systematic in vivo examination of these three MHCKs        labeled with GFP        This analysis reveals striking differences in        localization between these three enzymes During        cytokinesis MHCKA displays weak enrichment at the cell        poles while MHCKB displays a mostly diffuse localization        In contrast MHCKC displays strong localization to the        cleavage furrow only during the late stages of cell        division These results suggest that         D discoideum cells use a family of        related MHCKs to modulate myosin II filament assembly each        with distinct roles                    Results                  MHCK domain organization and MHCK C biochemical          activity          The enzymes MHCKA and MHCKB have established roles          in the control of           D discoideum myosin filament          assembly both in vitro and in vivo       and          Egelhoff T T unpublished studies These enzymes          have a conserved domain organization that includes a          highly novel protein kinase catalytic domain unrelated to          conventional kinases and a carboxylterminal WD repeat          domain that targets these enzymes to myosin II filaments          Figure  Genomic sequence corresponding to the related          enzyme MHCKC was deposited in GenBank by Loomis and          colleagues accession number AAC MHCKC differs          from MHCKA and MHCKB in that it lacks any significant          aminoterminal domain upstream of the catalytic domain          conserved catalytic domain residues are present within          approximately  residues of the methionine start codon          of MHCKC Figure  Of this set of enzymes MHCKC is          also unique in that it contains a large central domain of          approximately  kDa that consists of highly repetitive          stretches rich in serine asparagine proline and          glutamine However the strong similarity of MHCKC to          MHCKA and MHCKB in the conserved catalytic domain and          the carboxylterminal WD repeat domain suggested that it          might represent a third myosin heavy chain kinase in this          organism          To test this possibility at the biochemical level we          engineered and expressed an epitopetagged construct that          contains an aminoterminal FLAG epitope fused to codon           of MHCKC FLAGMHCKC was purified using a combination          of ammonium sulfate fractionation and FLAGpeptide          affinity chromatography Purified FLAGMHCKC was          subjected to SDSPAGE Western blot analysis with          antiMHCKC polyclonal antibodies Figure A and with          antiFLAG monoclonal antibodies not shown and          Coomassie staining Figure A confirmed the purification          of the expressed protein migrating at the correct size          for MHCKC The FLAGMHCKC protein consistently suffered          proteolytic cleavage during purification In initial          lysates the major immunoreactive species migrated at            kDa but during purification a major clipped species          formed with a size of   kDa Figure A This species          reacted with both antiMHCKC antisera and with antiFLAG          epitope antibodies not shown indicating this fragment          to be an aminoterminal domain of MHCKC Addition of          protease inhibitors during purification reduced but did          not eliminate formation of this clipped MHCKC          Purified FLAGMHCKC readily phosphorylated native           D discoideum myosin II on the          myosin heavy chain MHC in vitro Figure Band C No          incorporation was detected on autoradiographs at the          mobility of myosin light chains supporting the model          that MHCKC like MHCKA modulates filament assembly and          not myosin motor activity data not shown To determine          whether phosphorylation by MHCKC affected myosin II          assembly properties samples of purified           D discoideum myosin II were          incubated with MHCKC in the presence and absence of ATP          Samples were then subjected to centrifugation to sediment          myosin II filaments and the proportion of myosin II in          the pellet in each sample was quantified using SDSPAGE          and Coomassie blue staining as a measure of filament          assembly Figure A Incubation of myosin II with MHCKC          in the absence of ATP resulted in assembly levels typical          for purified           Dictyostelium myosin with  of          the myosin sedimenting in the current set of assays          Figure B Incubation of myosin II with MHCKC in the          presence of ATP resulted in substantial filament          disassembly with only  of the myosin II sedimenting          following phosphorylation These results confirm that          MHCKC can phosphorylate myosin II and that this          phosphorylation is capable of driving filament          disassembly in vitro          Myosin II phosphorylation experiments revealed two          additional features of MHCKC biochemical behavior          First FLAGMHCKC autophosphorylates during the course          of in vitro phosphorylation reactions Figure B          Second the activity of FLAGMHCKC appears to be very          low in the initial stages of in vitro phosphorylation          reactions but then rises after approximately  minutes          Figure C These attributes are reminiscent of the          behavior of MHCKA which upon purification exists in an          unphosphorylated low activity state In vitro          autophosphorylation of MHCKA was found to increase the V                    max of the enzyme fold     To          test for similar autophosphorylation regulation of          MHCKC we tested the activity of FLAGMHCKC with and          without an initial autophosphorylation step towards the          peptide substrate MH a residue peptide          corresponding to one of the mapped MHC phosphorylation          target sites for MHCK A in the myosin tail If          FLAGMHCKC was not subjected to a          preautophosphorylation step P incorporation into the          peptide displayed a similar lag phase as observed for          myosin II phosphorylation Figure Aand B open          symbols If FLAGMHCKC was pretreated with MgATP for           min at room temperature the lag phase for peptide          phosphorylation was eliminated figure Aand B closed          symbols These results support the model that          autophosphorylation activates MHCKC Another feature          reported earlier for MHCKA activation is that myosin II          itself stimulates autophosphorylation     To test          whether MHCKC autophosphorylation is accelerated in the          presence of myosin II the stoichiometry of FLAGMHCKC          autophosphorylation was evaluated in the presence and          absence of myosin II filaments Under the assay          conditions here myosin II did not significantly          stimulate the rate of FLAGMHCKC autophosphorylation          Figure C This result suggests that MHCKC may be          regulated in vivo by mechanisms distinct from those that          regulate the activity of MHCKA                          MHCKs have different subcellular localizations in          interphase cells          To gain insights into the relative cellular roles and          localization of MHCKA MHCKB and MHCKC we have          evaluated the behavior of GFP fusions corresponding to          each of these enzymes Distribution of GFPlabelled MHCKs          GFPMHCKA B and C was examined in live AX cells          containing an endogenous mhcA gene These GFPMHCK          expressing cells were able to sporulate and grow in          suspension indicating that at the expression level of          these clonal cell lines the expression of GFPMHCKs in          the AX cells does not detectably change myosin II          expression or function The fluorescence distributions of          these cells were compared with cells expressing          GFPmyosin II obtained by transforming myosin null cells          with a plasmid that carries GFPmhcAcontaining plasmid          p Materials and Methods designated as GFPmyosin II          cells hereafter          The localization pattern of the GFPMHCKs in the          presence of myosin II was first compared to the          distribution of GFPmyosin II cells in interphase Fig           Many cells of each transformation were examined n            and examples of the distribution of GFPMHCKA          Fig A top GFPMHCKB Fig B top and          GFPMHCKC Fig C top are shown GFPmyosin II          distributed in the cytoplasm and enriched in a cortical          layer in interphase as has been described earlier             is shown in Fig Mtop GFPlabelled MHCKA and B          distributed in the cytoplasm and appeared to be excluded          from the area that corresponded to nucleus In contrast          to GFPMyosin II GFPlabelled MHCKA and B did not          concentrate in the cell cortex Fig M top Pixel          intensities on a line drawn through the center of the          cells allow a more quantitative comparison of the          enrichment of GFPMHCKs A cortical distribution shows a          distinctively increased accumulation of GFP fluorescent          intensity at the cell edges displaying two peaks          flanking the cell crosssection as seen in the case of          the GFPmyosin II cells Fig M middle Out of the          three MHCKs only GFPMHCKC appeared to be concentrated          in the cell cortex Fig C top and had the          fluorescent profiles containing the two flanking peaks          Figure C middle GFPMHCKC also appears to be          excluded from the nucleus similar to that seen in cells          expressing GFPmyosin II          In freemoving cells GFPMHCKA was frequently          transiently enriched in the protruding edge Fig A          bottom and hence results in rather noticeable          pseudopods at the anterior region compared with that in          the GFPmyosin II cells A timelapse movie in Quicktime          format illustrating this behavior is available as an          additional file see additional file  GFPMHCKB          however displayed no indication of transient enrichment          in any part of the cells while moving instead it          distributes homogeneously within cells Fig B          bottom The cells expressing GFPMHCKB appeared to have          smooth cell edges because the fluorescence did not label          the dynamic pseudopods at the leading edge of the cell          compared with that in GFPMHCKA cells In contrast to          MHCKA and MHCKB distribution GFPMHCKC was frequently          enriched in the posterior cortex of the moving cells          Fig C bottom as seen also for GFPmyosin II Fig          D bottom GFPMHCKC occasionally displayed transient          enrichment in pseudopodial extensions as well data not          shown                          Dynamic localization of GFPmyosin II and          GFPMHCKC in the cortex of living D          discoideumcells          As shown above in interphase GFPmyosin II and          GFPMHCKC expressed in the presence of myosin II both          concentrate in the cell cortex The actinrich cortex is          estimated to be approximately  m thick in           D discoideum cells              similar to the thickness in other eukaryotic cells              This dimension makes total internal reflection          fluorescence TIRF microscopy an attractive tool to          examine cortical GFPlabelled proteins at the          cellsurface contacts Total internal reflection occurs          when light travelling in a medium with high refractive          index encounters a medium with low refractive index          beyond the critical angle determined by the ratio of the          two refractive indices according to the Snells law              In our experiments the coverslip and the cells          represent the media with high and low refractive indices          respectively Under this condition there is still an          exponentiallydecayed evanescent wave penetrating into          the           D discoideum cells The typical          depth of the evanescent wave is in the range of           nm away from the coverslip which is suitable for          exciting cortical GFPproteins in living           D discoideum cells          As examined by in vitro electron microscopy          negatively stained purified wildtype myosin II molecules          formed bipolar thick filaments  m in length              Filament structures of similar size have also been          observed via immunofluorescent microscopic observation of          fixed cells     Examination of live GFPmyosin II          expressing cells with a TIRF microscope Fig A shows          an accumulation of fluorescent rodlike shapes with an          estimated length to be approximately  m standard          deviation   n   This dimension is consistent          with myosin II thick filaments measured from the in vitro          electron microscopy photographs     Using TIRF          microscopy these structures putative filaments are not          apparent in GFPxAsp myosin II cells in which the three          potential Thr phosphorylation targets have been replaced          with Asp residues data not shown As this MHC mutation          inhibits filament assembly     the inability of          GFPxASP myosin to form such structures suggests that          these TIRFresolved structures are discrete myosin II          filaments Our TIRF analysis furthermore indicated that a          few of the GFPmyosin II thick filaments move          dynamically Some filaments moved a long distance across          the field with a velocity up to approximately  msec          before stopping Other filaments seemed to be confined to          a small region and eventually disappeared          GFPMHCKC expressing cells in the presence of myosin          II display punctate aggregates of fluorescence with          the longer dimension approximately  m standard          deviation   n   Fig B The shorter          dimension is about  m similar to what was          observed in myosin II thick filaments The GFPMHCKC          fluorescent aggregates showed dynamic motility similar to          that of GFPmyosin II aggregates These structures could          not be detected when GFPMHCKC was expressed in myosin          II null cells data not shown suggesting that the          formation of the GFPMHCKC punctate aggregates is myosin          IIdependent                          Differential localization of GFPMHCKs during          cytokinesis          At the early stage of cytokinesis GFPmyosin II          reorganizes and is concentrated into the region that          flanks the furrow located at the equatorial region of the          dividing cells Fig M top As the two daughter cells          continue to separate denoted the late stage of          cytokinesis GFPmyosin II persists in this zone which          becomes the posterior region of each of the two forming          daughter cells Fig M bottom GFPmyosin II on the          other hand was not enriched in the polar region and          therefore the polar regions displayed a smooth contour in          fluorescent images as described earlier              Neither GFPMHCKA Fig A or B Fig B was          observed to be concentrated in the furrow region during          any stage of cytokinesis nor did they localize to the          posterior region of the two daughter cells at the late          stage of cytokinesis Instead GFPMHCKA was enriched in          the protrusions extending from the poles of the dividing          cells which resulted in a more prominent appearance of          the ruffling polar pseudopods throughout the cytokinesis          process GFPMHCKB however stayed homogeneously          cytoplasmic during cytokinesis without any sign of          enrichment in any region It was excluded from the polar          protrusions as seen by the smooth contour of the poles          Fig B Interestingly as the cells progressed from          the early to late stages of cytokinesis GFPMHCKB          appeared to be excluded from the furrow Fig B as          compared to the appearance of GFPMHCKA or          GFPMHCKC          The localization pattern of GFPMHCKC was different          from the other two kinases Fig C At the early stage          of cytokinesis GFPMHCKC generally displayed a          cytosolic distribution with some uniform cortical          enrichment but showed no sign of furrow concentration          However at the late stage of cytokinesis as soon as the          two daughter cells begin to separate from each other          GFPMHCKC became detectable at the newly formed          posterior regions of the two daughter cells The spatial          localization of GFPMHCKC is similar to that observed          for GFPmyosin II at the late stage of cytokinesis Fig          Band M In summary these three GFPMHCKs have          distributions that are temporally and spatially          different as summarized in the sketches shown in Figure          bottom          To further illustrate the differential temporal          localization images of two cells expressing GFPMHCKC          are compared to a cell expressing GFPmyosin II from the          interphase I Figure  to the fully divided daughter          cells D Figure  During interphase all

and C cells depended on the          existence of myosin II we expressed these kinases in          myosin II null cells and compared the localization          patterns GFPMHCKA and B showed identical localization          in both interphase and cytokinesis cells regardless of          the presence of myosin II in the cells data not shown          GFPMHCKC however failed to localize to the cortex in          interphase cells Fig C M null top and the two          characteristic peaks were missing in the linescan During          free movement in the absence of myosin II GFPMHCKC was          not

separation GFPMHCKC was          never localized to the constricting furrow or to the          forming posterior region of the two daughter cells Fig          C M null bottom                            Discussion        The results reported here provide biochemical and        cellular evidence indicating that         D discoideum contains a related        family of MHC kinase isoforms that display distinct modes        of regulation in vitro and distinct localization dynamics        in vivo during contractile events particularly during        cytokinesis Although MHCKA has been extensively        characterized at the biochemical level               only limited biochemical analysis has been performed with        bacteriallyexpressed subdomains of MHCKB and MHCKC              The current biochemical results provide strong        support for the hypothesis that MHCKC acts as a MHC kinase        in vivo Further studies with second messenger compounds        may help to identify upstream physiological mechanisms that        regulate MHCKC autophosphorylationactivation        Using epifluorescence microscopy we observe strikingly        different patterns of dynamic localization for MHCKA B        and C during polarized migration and cytokinesis The        dynamics of MHCKC localization are particularly        intriguing with global or posterior cortical enrichment        observed during interphase with a dramatic accumulation in        the furrow during late cytokinesis The apparent absence of        MHCKC from the furrow in earlymid cytokinesis when        myosin II is clearly accumulating suggests that specific        regulatory mechanisms may exist to recruit this enzyme to        the furrow during late cytokinesis        Colocalization of a MHCK with its apparent substrate        does not imply that the kinase in vivo is actively        phosphorylating its substrate The dynamic localization of        a kinase is only one way to regulate its activity In fact        the MHCKs are very likely to be highly regulated enzymes        previous studies have documented the in vitro regulation of        MHCK A by autophosphorylation myosin filaments and acidic        phospholipids     and data presented here documents        that MHCK C can also be regulated via autophosphorylation        Further studies are needed to confirm similar regulation in        vivo and to better define the upstream regulatory        pathways With these caveats the distinct localization        patterns for MHCKA B and C reported here provide        valuable clues as to which spatial and temporal myosin II        population may be acted upon by each enzyme        The dynamics of the three MHCKs also display striking        differences in their dependence on myosin II When the GFP        fusions are imaged in myosin II null cells both MHCKA and        MHCKB display dynamics indistinguishable from their        behaviour in cells wild type for myosin II In contrast        loss of cortical and furrow localization is seen for        GFPMHCKC in the absence of myosin II This result        suggests that MHCKC localization in these settings may be        achieved via direct association with myosin II filaments        Our TIRF studies further support this model suggesting        that MHCKC may physically associate with myosin II        filaments GFPMHCKC under the TIRF microscope displayed        short particles with a longer dimension approximately half        of the length of myosin II thick filaments The bare zone        of purified wildtype myosin II thick filaments was        estimated previously to be in the range of  m            Based upon these results we suggest that GFPMHCKC        may colocalize with myosin II thick filaments by binding at        the bare zone        Comparison of the localization pattern between        GFPmyosin II and GFPMHCKs provides us a map of where        these three MHCKs localize at different stages in the        vegetative cells as well as how these MHCKs coordinated to        ensure proper regulation of myosin II thick filament        Figure depicts our current working model for the dynamics        of the three MHCKs during interphase A early cytokinesis        B and late cytokinesis C Localization of MHCKA and        MHCKB does not require myosin II With or without myosin        II both MHCKA and MHCKB are excluded from the cell        cortex in interphase and neither MHCKA nor MHCKB        colocalize with regions of highest myosin II concentration        in moving cells Fig A We suggest that the enrichment        of MHCKA to polar ruffles of dividing cells may represent        a mechanism by which         D discoideum cells locally        disassemble myosin II filaments to facilitate the polarized        recruitment of filaments to the forming contractile        ringfurrow zone This model is consistent with the recent        report that MHCKA displays enrichment into anterior        Factinrich protrusions of polarized cells during        chemotaxis and into phagocytic and macropinocytotic        extensions     The polar localization of MHCKA would        be consistent with the longstanding polar relaxation        model for cytoskeletal reorganization during cytokinesis            MHCKA may represent a factor that contributes to        polar relaxation in this system via polar disassembly of        myosin II filaments The cytosolic localization of MHCKB        suggests that this enzyme may contribute to a continuous        and uniform turnover of myosin II filaments throughout the        cell although it is possible that MHCKB plays more        specific roles in functions yet to be identified        We suggest that MHCKC is recruited to the contractile        ring during late cytokinesis to facilitate the orderly        removal of excess myosin II from the ring as the furrow        ingresses It is particularly intriguing that MHCKC        colocalizes with myosin II in the furrow only at the        culmination of cytokinesis where turnover and mobilization        of thick filaments might be most appropriate At this time        the cell cycle contraction force requirements are predicted        to fall    and the cells geometrical changes would        require myosin II thick filaments to disassemble Although        it is clear throughout the animal kingdom and in protozoa        that the mass of myosin II in the division furrow decreases        steadily with furrow ingression no mechanism has been        identified in any other system that can explain this        regulated disassembly Dynamic changes in MHC        phosphorylation levels within the contractile ring have        been reported in dividing sea urchin embryos            suggesting that MHC phosphorylation as a mechanism        regulating furrow myosin II disassembly may occur in other        systems besides         D discoideum  We suggest that        MHCKC participates in this regulated myosin II filament        disassembly in         D discoideum  and that this        function may be regulated at both the cellular and        biochemical level                    Conclusions        We suggest that differential localization of MHCKs        occurs in D discoideum cells for the purpose of regulating        myosin II filament assembly levels in the context of        specific cellular contractile events such as lamellipodium        extension and cytokinetic furrowing The late appearance of        MHCKC during furrowing suggests a cellular mechanism        regulating its localization and our biochemical data        suggest that MHCKC phosphorylation levels may represent a        mechanism for the finetuning of the activity of MHCKC in        the cleavage furrow during cell division This level of        regulation could be mediated via second messenger control        of autophosphorylation or via direct MHCKC        phosphorylation by other kinases Further studies are in        progress to test these models                    Materials and Methods                  Plasmid construction          The GFP fusions to MHCK A MHCK B and MHCK C were          constructed by placing GFP at the aminoterminus of each          kinase coding region with GFP fused to codon  of each          kinase open reading frame All fusions were made in the          GFP expression vector pTXGFP     The construct for          MHCK A has been described previously     Protein          sequences for MHCK A MHCK B and MHCK C correspond to          GenBank entries A AAB and AAC          respectively Cloning of the cDNA encoding MHCKC has          been described                              FLAGMHCKC purification and phosphorylation          assays          A FLAG epitope was fused to the aminoterminus of          MHCKC at codon  using the vector pTXFLAG     The          resulting plasmid pTXMKC was transformed into the          cell line Ax and clonal cell lines were selected with          G  gml in HL medium To facilitate FLAGMHCKC          protein purification AxpTXMKC cell lines were then          subjected to incremental increases in G selection          level over approximately  weeks to a final selection          level of  gml As reported previously for expression          of MHCKA     this selection process resulted in          cell lines with increased expression level of          FLAGMHCKC severalfold higher than the initial          expression level In previous work when this method was          applied to MHCKAexpressing cell lines the elevated          expression of MHCKA resulted in myosin II          hyperphosphorylation and myosin II filament disassembly          and corresponding loss of ability of cells to grow in          suspension     We observed the same effect in the          current studies in attempting to force high expression of          FLAGMHCKC The pTXMKC plasmid was therefore          transfected into xALA myosin II cells which are          resistant to myosin filament hyperphosphorylation and          disassembly due to elimination of phosphorylation target          sites in the myosin tail     The resultant          xALApTXMKC cells could be propagated in suspension          culture even after selection for elevated expression in           gml G          For purification of FLAGMHCKC  liters of          xALApTXMKC cells were propagated in suspension          culture in HL medium to approximately    cellsml          All subsequent steps were performed at  Cells were

adjusted to  mM          NaCl to dissociate MHCKC from binding to particulate          material then subjected to centrifugation at            g for  min The resulting cleared supernatant was          brought to  saturation with powdered ammonium sulfate          and incubated with stirring for  min The ammonium          sulfate precipitate containing the FLAGMHCKC protein          was collected by centrifugation and resuspended with          gentle douncing in  ml TBS containing  mM EDTA TBSE          and X PIC and PIC This sample was mixed with  ml of          antiFLAG epitope monoclonal

concentrated by dialysis against          powdered polyethylene glycol Aquacide Calbiochem then          dialyzed into  glycerol  mM Tris pH   mM KCl           mM EDTA  mM DTT This purified FLAGMHCK C

performed in  mM          TES pH   mM MgCl             and  mM ATP with PATP          included at  Cimol final concentration Peptide          phosphorylation assays were done with the peptide MH as          substrate at  M This residue peptide corresponds          to the phosphorylation target site at position  of          MHC This peptide and the filterbinding assay used to          measure its phosphorylation have been described          previously     All peptide phosphorylation studies          were performed under conditions in which no more than           of the substrate was consumed
