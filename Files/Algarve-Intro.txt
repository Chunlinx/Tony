the ALGARVE andITS PeopleFor much of the world the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite the region has little in common with the rest of the country The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one It has no cosmopolitan cities like Lisbon and Porto which are farther north Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns medieval castles and grand palaces The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments hotels and meticulously manicured golf coursesAnd beaches Think Algarve and the mind pictures long glorious stretches of golden sands secluded coves framed by odd ochrecolored rock formations and deep green waters With about  km  miles of coastline Portugals southern province is one of Europes premier beach destinations The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feelIts consistent climate is the best in Portugal and one of the kindest in the world more than  days of sunshine a yearmore than almost any other international resort area The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter and in late January and February white almond blossoms blanket the fields In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable and regardless beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive awayMagnificent yearround weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations Superb golf facilities aboundseveral with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the oceanand horseback riding tennis biggame fishing sailing and windsurfing are immensely popularSports beaches and hospitable weathernot to mention easily organized package vacationsare surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety But its not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations hereThe coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east West is where youll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks Near Cabo de So Vicente and Sagres the extreme western point the terrain is surprisingly barren and the facilities decidedly lowkey The ocean can also be forbiddingly coldTourist resorts clutter the entire middle of the coast from Lagos to Faro with a spectrum of homes away from homemonster highrises to lowrider villasspilling across the rolling hills and lining the beaches Resorts like Portimo Albufeira and Vilamoura would appear to have little room left to grow yet tourist facilities seem to mate with each other and reproduce overnight Much of the unstoppable growth is crass and frighteningly commercial and the crowds in summer unbearableThe eastern third of the Algarve is a more sedate marriage of coast and ocean with warm waters and hot sands stretching past the wetlands of Ria Formosa to the Spanish border The Algarves most picturesque town Tavira is along this section of the coastAway from the coast the terrain slopes through pines mimosa eucalyptus and heather to an altitude of nearly  m  ft Vacationers wishing to escape the maddening beach crowds can run for the hills especially the tantalizing Serra de MonchiqueThe regions exotic name is derived from the ArabicAlGharb meaning country of the west The westernmost territory of Europe was highly prized by North African Moors who occupied it from the eighth to the th centuries Their half millennium here left indelible traces seen today in whitewashed houses hilltop castles and colorful ceramic tilesFollowing the Reconquest of Iberia by Christians the Algarve led Portugal to glory and fortune Prince Henry the Navigator established his legendary Navigation School along Portugals southern coast financing expeditions with royalties from the Algarve fishing industry and intrepid explorers set out in caravels from Lagos and Sagres In the th and th centuries they ushered in an Age of Discovery rounding Africas Cape of Good Hope and eventually reaching India and the Pacific Others found their way to the Americas and Brazil Opening world trade routes across the globe they established Portugal as a maritime superpower Spices gold and diamonds flowed across the seas to LisbonPortugal soon lapsed into decline though tattered by wars and constitutional crises and for two centuries or more the Algarve remained isolated from the rest of Europe Even though the coast received many illustrious visitors from Roman times through the Middle Ages and up to the Edwardian period when travelers came to luxuriate in Monchiques spa waters the Algarves elite vacation status is a relatively recent phenomenon The first resort on the coast Praia da Rocha was only discovered in the s and the real buildup didnt kick into overdrive until the beginning of the sSpains Costa del Sol developed earlier and more rapidly and some would say more disastrously Yet the lessons of rampant illadvised development across the border were not heeded Only recently has environmental and aesthetic consciousness at least mandated that newer developments be limited to lowrisesYetquite remarkably in the face of the ongoing tourism onslaughtparts of the Algarve retain their oldfashioned charm The main road along the coast EN is lined with ceramic shops and stifled with summertime traffic but the agricultural countryside to the north is a different world Flowering orchards and gentle grain fields replace hotels apartments and snack bars A slow rural lifestyle perseveres against the rush of modern lifeFor centuries fishing has been the Algarves lifeblood Small fishing villages preserve their simple and unaffected ways seemingly oblivious to the tourist hordes Scrappy crews of small handpainted boats troll the waters just offshore and trawlers fish deep in the Atlantic for big shoals of bacalhau cod so beloved by the PortugueseA visit to the local fish market is a revealing window into Algarvian life Negotiations are serious but friendly The same scenario is played out a thousand times a day at markets all across the region every town has a market day at least once a month Farmers bring their livestock to trade and artisans and itinerant vendors sell their waresNot a large area the Algarve is relatively easy to get around whether by train or car an effort that is much more relaxing outside of the main summer season The distances between megaresorts and unspoiled villages are surprisingly smallBesides beaches the Algarves major attractions are towns that lived through centuries of adventure triumph and disaster Faro Tavira and Lagos are towns with a strong Moorish influence and quiet mountain towns like Silves Alte and Salir are reminders of the days before golf courses and hotel chainsDespite the regions ancient roots few historic monuments survive from before  when the Algarve was rocked by a monumental earthquake that took thousands of lives and leveled buildings as far north as Lisbon Still youll find vestiges of a vibrant past including evocative castle ruins and churches with extraordinary displays of Portuguese glazed tiles Even the humblest village has a classic white church a sleepy plaza shaded by vivid purple jacaranda and if you time it right the drama of the local marketThe Portuguese are famously hospitable if reserved And they remain tolerant and helpful even though they know that their lovely coast is no longer just theirs
