        dining out seems to be a uh uh something we do off and on through our lives i guess as economics and as kids come and go and uh situations change uh we used to do   right umhum   quite a bit of dining out before the children and then as they came along and uh additional expenses sitting came into every dinner out um that that halted a lot of it as well as just the the uh oh i guess the lifestyle changes a little bit slows down a little bit and   right   now even the atmosphere that that we would seek uh when we go out is often more quiet and uh   umhum   a little bit more uh subdued uh not smoke filled or or bar uh dance floor type yeah so   yeah funny how that happens after kids right   that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then theres theres some economic concern but usually its if if its going to be a night out its going to be a a decent meal and and uh fortunately for us theres not a whole lot of places in the immediate area thats totally really expensive you have to go a ways to get to a really   umhum   high dollar uh hundred and fifty dollar dinner type deal which theyre forty to fifty miles away and theyre theyre all around but theyre just a ways so we can do a good um   yeah yes   twenty twenty five dollar night out and have a decent steak and it comes out okay   right   uh we look for i guess uh service uh you know im not im not in eating at McDonalds long enough the fastest the speed of it doesnt bother me you know im not looking for fast food at that night so the fact that it took them twenty thirty minutes to get it there thats thats okay im       thats twenty minutes away from the kids or however long you know youre out for the evening or it doesnt really matter that they not get it there right away but um   right thats right right   have a little chime little hard time finding a place thatll cook the steak just right i have to remember how to ask for it for this given restaurant to get it just the way i like it without too much pink in there and uh get it cooked good   i imagine uh in in Texas there would be uh a lot of steak restaurants is that right   yeah there seem to be quite a few quite a few   yes umhum and now on this area of course here in Maryland youre close to the Chesapeake there seems to there is some there are some steak restaurants but they lean more towards seafood here   umhum steak and lobster type   uh you probably have seafood a lot also   yeah they do oddly enough even being near near the gulf uh they tend to advertise the the main the whole east coast uh seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i dont know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever youre going to do to it you know like   oh is that right right well do you have crabs and lobster in that area thats   yeah yeah yeah crab and lobster and and uh   yeah thats thats hum thats funny that they would   yeah they withdraw from that i guess you know you can ship stuff anywhere pretty much and uh   right right right and you probably have crawfish would you have crawfish   uh probably im not a big fan of that so i wouldnt wouldnt be paying much attention to it um   yeah yeah well a lot of what you said uh sounds similar to us i remember that uh before before we had children we have two boys that are like nine and six and actually the oldest one is just starting to learn to behave in a restaurant so before we had kids we would definitely dine out more frequently probably several times a week and it didnt have to be necessarily anything fancy but it was more uh a matter of before children say we were both working we didnt feel like cooking we just went out and now you know as you said once youve children thats not always an option uh i worked off and on um you know because they were little and and and also you know once youre home and you have them um places that you went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual um sometimes its not worth it to go through the trouble of digging the sitters and everything just to go and so what i have found now that um   right   when we do go out uh as you said you out on the town now when we go out its its you want it to be more special   umhum   you dont want to just uh necessarily run out for you know a one hour and come back i noticed with us its more when we do go out then we do try to make it something nice maybe a dinner theater or nice restaurant with friends um sometimes lunches when we can do that thats okay too but um it definitely you know it definitely changes is changed we maybe eat in somewhat nicer places now but thats because when we do go   right   theres so theres like a special quality to that because it is a few hours away from the kids   right   and um but not as often we dont do it as often um and what im finding now is theyre finally getting to the age where were venturing into going again with them and of course when you take them though youre going to go to something like a McDonalds level or maybe a little bit of a family style restaurant   uhhuh   uh but in this area there there are quite a few decent restaurants that are not too expensive and uh i i i tend to agree with you too we look for more um uh quiet type more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids youre youre not as interested in going to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and theres a lot of uh noise   right   yelling and uh you know you look for different things and that crowd seems to change and you know youre not as much part of it um and you dont there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing uh you dont necessarily have to go downtown DC to to find decent restaurants and uh theres a lot that are moderately priced also whether youre in the suburbs or go downtown so theres theres quite a selection in this area   theres a uh one place that really not sure if the marketing concept is is carried throughout its chain but in this particular town um i live about two suburbs north of Dallas actually and in this particular town were about two miles from this uh   umhum   this steak house that has a oh i dont know a motif to the entire uh shopping center its the anchor for this entire strip shopping center i guess and theyll the entire place is   uhhuh   um has covered walkways all around to all the little shops that are theyre not theyre not even individual shops in some cases some cases are just kind of you they they put it all out in a little store shed out on to an area and then they put it all away at night um then there are theres one two whole rows actually of   umhum   of just what we would call a stall of flat concrete place with little posts and theyre all marked off with little lines and so if you want to rent this little spot though the farmers bring their stuff down and have a farmers market type   oh i see   so we went to this steak house once uh well several times but the most particular time that we were away from the kids and and had a a good length of time and it was on a Friday night and we knew the place would be really busy but we we got there about uh six or six thirty and put our names on the list of of the waiting list and then we walked around the uh the place that has there were still some farmers there at the time there was a lot of hand uh craft type stuff being sold uh there was a blacksmith and hes showing off his little traits and things that he could sell as well as uh   yeah thats nice   uh the hallways between the places that were of of business the hallways were decorated with uh old pictures and history of the of the town as it were   umhum   we killed about a an hour or so doing that because it was about an hour and a half wait to get into the restaurant and uh then about thirty minutes worth of a meal or so thirty or forty five minutes there and then   wow   uh came back out and walked around a little bit more and went home so it its quite an interesting uh deal they dont even take reservations because theyre so booked like that that uh   wow jeez well if im here also theres been such a growth in in housing uh not in the last year but before that it was just i dont know if youve been in this area in the last few years but its just been incredible and and has its gone crazy i mean where we are was basically a farm ten years ago and its houses are stacked and what has happened really is that um some of the commercial um uh places have not caught up with the population here and so we do have a problem of the the half decent restaurants when you go on a Friday or Saturday night youre looking for quite a long wait   hum   and um not all of them do take reservations either so so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time um you know to go out uh you cant figure on going out and being back in two hours you know um the other thing thats changing here is because of the um the age set here uh a lot mostly people in theyre id say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that uh we havent done it because i dont think it will work well with us having two boys but um some of the more expensive restaurants now i understand are catering um to children and making half price menus for them whereas before um they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in and theyre doing this basically because theyre so many working parents in this area and that they were losing the business because once all these younger people were having children they werent going to the restaurants   right
