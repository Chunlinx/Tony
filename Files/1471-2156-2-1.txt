                    Background        Glaucoma is a prevalent group of retinal and optic nerve        neuropathies that currently renders approximately         million people worldwide at risk for developing significant        vision loss including blindness   Glaucoma involves        the death of retinal ganglion cells RGCs and their axons        and is characterized by atrophic excavation of the optic        nerve     Glaucoma is usually associated with high        intraocular pressure IOP resulting from an increased        resistance to drainage of aqueous humor Not all people        with high IOP develop glaucoma   however suggesting        that other factors such as genetic susceptibility to        pressureinduced damage interact with IOP to cause damage        The occurrence of glaucomatous damage in individuals        without high IOP and the benefit of lowering IOP in some of        these individuals further suggest multiple factors        determine an individuals susceptibility to        pressureinduced damage   The nature of the factors        participating in glaucomatous events particularly those        influencing disease progression and modifying disease        severity in different individuals remain largely unknown        Increased understanding of factors contributing to glaucoma        will suggest new therapeutic strategies and will likely        lead to improved clinical management        Glaucomatous phenotypes have been observed in a number        of mammalian species including mice     Mice can        be clinically and histologically analyzed throughout the        course of a disease and their genes can be altered to study        the molecular framework underlying pathology   As a        consequence mouse models are useful for identifying and        characterizing the effects of causative genes necessary for        glaucoma development and for characterizing the genes and        molecular pathways that participate in or modify disease        progression   A collection of glaucomatous mouse        strains with phenotypic differences would facilitate        research to understand the complexity of glaucoma As part        of our efforts to understand glaucoma we are screening for        and characterizing glaucoma in aged mice of various        strains We are particularly interested in documenting        differences in glaucoma phenotypes between strains of mice        that share the same causative genes This information will        provide an experimental basis for identifying genes and        mechanisms that modify the progression or severity of        glaucoma Here we report differences in genetic        susceptibility to glaucomaassociated phenotypes between        two related inbred strains of mice AKXDTy AKXD and        DBAJ D        D mice develop glaucoma involving a harmful increase of        IOP followed by RGC loss and optic nerve damage   The        increase in IOP is associated with an iris disease        involving iris pigment dispersion IPD iris stromal        atrophy ISA and the formation of synechiae that block        aqueous humor drainage The iris pigment dispersion and        iris stromal atrophy phenotypes are caused by distinct        recessive alleles at the         ipd and         isa loci respectively   The IPD        phenotype in D mice is similar to human pigment dispersion        syndrome a condition that often leads to pigmentary        glaucoma    and involves degeneration of the iris        pigment epithelium    Causative genes for pigment        dispersion remain to be identified    The gene        responsible for the ISA phenotype is tightly linked to the        tyrosinase related protein  gene          Tyrp    which also regulates        coat color D mice have a mutant allele of this gene          Tyrp b and a brown coat color          In previously studied genetic backgrounds        homozygosity for D alleles of both         isa and         ipd results in iris atrophy that        severely affects both the iris stroma and iris pigment        epithelium leading to a severely atrophic and largely        transparent iris in old mice           AKXD is a recombinant inbred strain derived by        inbreeding offspring from an intercross between mice of the        D and AKRJ strains   AKXD mice therefore have a        genetic background that is a mix of the D glaucomatous        and AKRJ normal eyes with no obvious disease genomes        Due to extensive inbreeding all AKXD mice are        genetically identical except for the sex chromosome        difference between males and females This genetic        uniformity is important for the analysis of complex        diseases because it allows repeated and therefore accurate        assessment of phenotypes associated with the AKXD mix of        D and AKRJ genomes AKXD mice inherited the glaucoma        causing         ipd and         isa alleles from strain D This is        evident by their brown coat color and the inheritance of D        derived microsatellite markers flanking these loci               To further assess the phenotypic        consequences of         ipd and         isa and whether their effect is        modified in the AKXD genetic background we performed a        detailed characterization of the ocular phenotype in AKXD        mice        As demonstrated here AKXD mice develop an age related        glaucoma involving increased IOP and optic nerve damage        and they are a useful tool for glaucoma research The        AKXD disease has a number of similarities to that        observed in D mice Importantly however two major        differences exist between the disease in AKXD and D mice        housed in the same environment First AKXD mice do not        develop the IPD phenotype The absence of the IPD phenotype        is surprising considering AKXDs inheritance of the D        chromosomal region containing the         ipd gene and likely results from        genetic differences between these strains Understanding        these differences will be important for understanding        pigment dispersion a common cause of human glaucoma        Second although D and AKXD strains demonstrate similar        magnitudes of IOP AKXD mice develop more severe and more        extensive retinal damage and are more prone to optic nerve        head excavation than D mice This suggests that compared        to D mice AKXD mice have an increased genetic        susceptibility to pressureinduced damage Identifying the        genes that differ between AKXD and D mice and that        modify the progression and severity of pressureinduced        retinal cell death will be important for understanding        mechanisms killing cells in glaucoma and may ultimately        lead to improved patient care                    Results                  AKXD develop ISA but not IPD          Consistent with the inheritance of           isa from strain D the iris stroma          of AKXD mice atrophied with age Figure  The first          signs of ISA were small focal peripheral          transillumination defects at  to  months of age Iris          stromal atrophy was histologically evident in most eyes          by  months ISA became progressively more severe          profoundly affecting all eyes by  months Table           Figure           AKXD mice contain D derived alleles for markers           Mtv and           DNds which are located          approximately  cM proximal and  cM distal to           ipd  respectively              Additionally AKXDTy mice contain D derived          microsatellite markers for           DMit            DMit  and           DMit which subdivide this region          and are tightly linked to           ipd data not shown Despite          inheritance of the           ipd chromosomal segment from strain          D both histological and clinical analysis of AKXD          irides and anterior chambers failed to detect the          presence of IPD at all ages examined IPD is          characterized by deterioration of the iris pigment          epithelium with accumulation of dispersed pigment and          pigment filled cells in the anterior chamber and on the          front of the iris and lens   Figure e No pigment          dispersion or accumulation was observed in AKXD eyes          Figure abc and the iris pigment epithelium remained          remarkably intact considering the severe iris stromal          atrophy Figure h The overall condition of the iris in          old AKXD versus old D mice also indicated the lack of          the IPD phenotype in AKXD D mice succumb to both ISA          and IPD and develop iris atrophy that progresses to the          point of transparency over most of the iris Figure f          The irides of AKXD eyes maintain substantially greater          tissue integrity and pigmentation compare Figure c to          fand h to i                          Anterior synechiae and increased IOP in          AKXD          The ISA phenotype in D mice involves deterioration of          the iris stroma and release of cellular debris into the          anterior chamber This leads to the formation of          adhesions anterior synechiae that block aqueous humor          access to its drainage pathways including the trabecular          meshwork and Schlemms canal in the iridocorneal angle             AKXD mice similarly develop iris stromal          atrophy anterior synechiae and IOP elevation Figure           In AKXD the synechiae were first evident at           months and were extensive in most eyes by  to           months of age Table           To assess the functional relationship between these          morphological abnormalities and aqueous drainage we          determined the IOPs of AKXD mice at various ages          Figure  IOP increased significantly with age          P and pressure elevation followed a time course          consistent with obstruction of aqueous humor drainage by          extensive anterior synechiae formation Although there          were no obvious histologic differences between males and          females gender had a significant effect on the timing of          IOP elevation P Among females the mean IOP          increased from    mmHg at  to  months when          synechiae were absent or mild to a peak value of             mmHg at  months when synechiae were often          moderate or severe The IOP of males showed an increase          from    mmHg at  to  months to a peak of             mmHg at  months The magnitudes of IOP          elevation were similar to those in D mice            Vitreous glutamate levels increase when IOP is          elevated in various species and this increase is          associated with RGC death     As an initial          effort to assess glutamate levels in AKXD mice          vitreous was collected from mice of different ages and          subjected to amino acid analysis In this study we          analyzed two pools of samples from  month old mice and          two pools of samples from  month old mice Pooling was          necessary due to the small volume of vitreous collected          and each pool consisted of  to  eyes see Materials and          methods In this study vitreous glutamate levels were             M in  month old mice when IOP is generally          normal and    M in  month old mice when IOP          is often elevated                          AKXD develop glaucomatous neuropathy          AKXD mice develop several glaucomatous          abnormalities All retinas had a normal appearance until           months when mild loss of retinal ganglion cells was          observed in some mice Table  All mice over  months          of age had severe ganglion cell loss both peripherally          and close to the optic nerve Figure  Table           Atrophic excavation of the optic nerve head was evident          histologically and by clinical fundus examination in old          but not in young mice Figure  Table  Fundus          examination was not possible in many old mice due to          corneal opacities and cataracts          To further examine the progression of optic nerve          damage optic nerve cross sections from male and female          mice of differing ages were analyzed Figure  Optic          nerve damage was detected closely following the period of          increased IOP Moderate or severe optic nerve damage was          first observed in some  month old mice  of  and          occurred in almost all  month old mice  of           Interestingly optic nerve damage occurred earlier in          females than in males Damage was detectable in female          but not male nerves at  months By  months all          female nerves were severely affected whereas          approximately half of the male nerves were mildly or          moderately affected P Chisquare Figure d                          Retinal and optic nerve damage is more severe in          AKXD than D          Retinal damage in AKXD eyes was more severe than in          D eyes Figure  Table  and Ref   In AKXD          mice IOP elevation was first noted in a few mice at           months and mild RGC depletion defined here as loss of          cells in the RGC layer was initially observed at           months By  months RGC loss was severe in all AKXD          eyes By contrast D mice exhibit a slower and milder          retinal disease following increased IOP compare Figure          bcf In D mice IOP elevation was first observed in          some mice at  months Mice at  or  months had no          more than a moderate loss of RGCs and only  of  mice          older than  months had severe RGC loss Paralleling RGC          loss optic nerve head excavation or cupping was also          more severe and more frequent P   Chisquare          in AKXD than D mice Optic nerve excavation was          histologically evident in  of  AKXD mice that were           months or older and was typically severe Table           The severe atrophy extended to a level outside of the          inner nuclear layer INL and often outside the choroid          Figure e Optic nerve excavation occurred in only           of  D mice that were  months or older The          excavation in these mice never extended deeper than the          INL and was never rated severe Clinical fundus          examinations agreed with histological findings showing          obvious severe optic nerve damage in successfully          analyzed old AKXD eyes but not in D eyes          In addition to the typical glaucomatous changes          mentioned above an obvious loss of cells in the INL          occurred in almost all AKXD mice  months old and          older Table  Figure c In some AKXD mice older          than  months the disease progressed to affect the          entire retina with substantial loss of both INL cells and          photoreceptors This is in contrast to the phenotype in          D mice in which INL cell loss sometimes occurred but          extensive damage throughout the retina was never observed          Fig f                            Discussion                  An AKRJ modifiers likely suppresses IPD in          AKXD          A significant difference between D and AKXD mice is          the lack of an overt IPD phenotype in AKXD despite          inheritance of the           ipd allele from D In AKXD          there is no obvious pigment dispersion the iris pigment          epithelium remains remarkably intact and the irides of          old mice remain pigmented Evidence that the           ipd containing chromosomal region          in AKXD is derived from D includes inheritance of D          alleles of microsatellite markers spanning an          approximately  cM chromosomal region surrounding the           ipd locus delimited by the markers                    Mtv and           DNds     Though          unlikely the possibility of an undetected          recombinational rearrangement within this region that          placed an AKRJ allele of the gene that causes IPD on the          AKXD chromosome cannot be ruled out The presence in          AKXD of the D allele of           DMit  which maps to the same          position as           ipd  cM argues against such          a rearrangement    Other explanations for the          absence of an IPD phenotype in AKXD include          inheritance of an AKRJ modifier genes that suppresses          the IPD phenotype a spontaneous reversion of the           ipd mutation in AKXD mice or the          spontaneous occurrence and fixation of the           ipd mutation in strain D after the          derivation of the AKXD strain Inheritance of an AKRJ          modifier seems the most likely explanation but          elucidation of the molecular nature of the           ipd mutation or the mapping of a          modifier genes is necessary to distinguish among the          possibilities                          IOP elevation occurs earlier in females          Female AKXD mice exhibit increased IOP earlier than          males Nerve damage was also first observed in females          Our clinical and histological studies identified no          obvious gender differences in anterior segment pathology          that account for this It must be remembered however          that our histological analysis accounts for a small          portion of the eye and so differences in the prevalence          or severity of anterior synechiae may have been missed          Further experiments including more detailed analysis of          the aqueous drainage system are necessary to understand          why IOP elevation occurs earlier in females than males          Interestingly D females also exhibit increased IOP          prior to males   Sexspecific differences in human          glaucoma susceptibility have been reported in some but          not all human studies       In general          sexspecific differences in human glaucoma may be          difficult to identify or interpret because of genetic          differences and uncontrolled environmental factors          between patients that may alter the phenotype Since they          are inbred and environment can be highly controlled          AKXD mice provide an experimental resource for          examining the biological significance of gender for          susceptibility to events that elevate IOP                          AKXD and D have different susceptibilities to          pressureinduced damage          Overall the progression of optic nerve and retinal          disease in AKXD mice supports a pressureinduced          etiology Optic nerve and retinal damage were only          observed at ages after high IOP was detected Following          the period of increased IOP the retinas and optic nerves          of aged AKXD mice undergo substantially greater damage          than those of D mice The damage also occurs more          rapidly after IOP elevation is first detected in AKXD          compared to D Strikingly all old AKXD mice have          severe retinal ganglion cell loss typically associated          with severe optic nerve excavation whereas few old D          mice have severe RGC loss and optic nerve excavation is          rarely if ever severe defined here as extending to a          level out side of the inner nuclear layer Additionally          following initial RGC loss most AKXD eyes exhibit          thinning of the inner nuclear layer and some mice older          than  months show severe depletion of all retinal          layers Such severe and extensive retinal damage never          occurs in strain D The RGC layer is primarily affected          in most old D mice with the occurrence of mild inner          nuclear layer cell loss and possibly very mild          photoreceptor loss in only some mice In our studies the          occurrence of outer retinal damage was only observed in          old AKXD eyes with late stage disease typically          several months after signs of glaucoma were evident and          was a late consequence of disease progression Although          RGCs are generally accepted to be the major cell type          affected in human glaucoma and to our knowledge INL and          photoreceptor cell loss similar to that in AKXD has not          been reported there is evidence for INL and          photoreceptor cell involvement in some human and monkey          cases                 Both AKXD and D have similar magnitudes and          durations of increased IOP with the duration appearing          to last a little longer in the more mildly affected D          strain The IOP distribution of D females is          significantly elevated from  to  months of age and          AKXD females from  to  months Although the          duration of IOP elevation in AKXD males is not yet          characterized female AKXD mice are affected more          severely than D mice of either sex Thus the duration          and magnitude of IOP elevation does not seem to underlie          the more severe damage in AKXD The greater severity          and speed of damage following IOP elevation in AKXD          compared to D mice housed in the same environment          therefore suggests that AKXD is more susceptible to          pressureinduced cell death Future experiments involving          D and AKXD may allow identification of geness that          modulate susceptibility to pressureinduced damage and          that may be relevant for human glaucoma Identification          of genes that modify pressureinduced cell death and          characterization of the mechanisms by which they act will          broaden the knowledge base from which informed decisions          regarding patient counseling screening and treatment          are made                          Systems that may alter susceptibility to          pressureinduced damage          Known characteristics of the AKRJ and D strains          offer few clues to AKXDs increased susceptibility to          pressureinduced damage and all explanatory attempts are          speculative The propensity for handlinginduced hyphema          and subconjunctival hemorrhage that we observe see Table           in AKXD may indicate vascular abnormalities with          relatively weak blood vessels and capillary beds          Weakened capillaries may not function optimally in the          face of elevated IOP resulting in some degree of retinal          ischemia that exacerbates retinal cell death Retinal          ischemia is known to affect cell viability in the INL and          photoreceptor layers   Ischemia would likely invoke          glutamate induced neurotoxicity             Equally plausible is the possibility of differing          neurotoxic responses to glutamate or differences in the          ability of AKXD and D mice to buffer glutamate levels          in the face of high IOP Acting through          NmethylDaspartate receptors glutamate is believed to          be a potent initiator of RGC neurotoxicity   and as          described here the vitreous of at least some AKXD mice          contains elevated glutamate concentrations when IOP is          elevated Studies with human eyes have previously          reported an increase in vitreous glutamate levels from          approximately  M in nonglaucomatous eyes to  M in          glaucomatous eyes   Also chronic elevation of rat          vitreous glutamate levels from approximately  M to           M has previously been shown to be toxic to RGCs             The higher vitreous glutamate concentrations we          observed in  month old    M compared to           month old    M AKXD mice would therefore          be expected to damage the retina Although these findings          are promising and implicate glutamate in retinal          neurotoxicity in AKXD mice further experiments are          needed to completely characterize vitreous glutamate          levels and their relationship to IOP and glaucoma in this          strain          Molecules involved in glutamate metabolism signaling          or buffering are interesting candidates to alter          susceptibility to retinal cell death An intriguing          possibility is that AKXD and D mice have differing          responses to plateletactivating factor PAF PAF is a          biologically active phospholipid mediator PAF acts by          binding to a unique G protein coupled transmembrane          receptor PTAFR that is broadly expressed in the eye            Relevant activities of PAF include promoting ocular          hypertension and enhancing neural glutamate release              Interestingly AKRJ airways have a strain          specific hyperresponsive reaction to intravenously          injected PAF   A hyperresponsiveness of AKXD          ocular tissues to PAF or increased activity of the PTAFR          receptor mediated signaling pathway could therefore          contribute to the pronounced retinal damage through          potentiating glutamate neurotoxicity                            Conclusions        We have documented the development of a disease        involving iris stromal atrophy and glaucoma in aged AKXD        mice These results add to our understanding of the natural        history of glaucoma in mice and provide a new animal model        for studying glaucoma involving increased IOP Furthermore        careful phenotypic comparisons between the AKXD and D        strains suggests that the AKXD genome contains genetic        modifiers that suppress pigment dispersion and increase        susceptibility to pressureinduced retinal damage These        results provide a basis for future research to identify        glaucoma modifier genes and to dissect the molecular        mechanisms by which they act                    Materials and methods                  Animal husbandry          All experiments were performed in compliance with the          Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology          Statement for Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision          Research Mice were housed in cages containing white pine          bedding and covered with polyester filters The          environment was kept at C with a h lighth dark          cycle Mice were fed NIH  fat chow           ad libitum  and their water was          acidified to pH  All mouse strains used for this          study were routinely screened for select pathogens by The          Jackson Laboratorys routine surveillance program see          httpwwwjaxorg for specific pathogens The mouse          strains used in this study were DBAJ D AKXDTy          AKXD and CBLJ B Cohorts of D and AKXD          mice were housed in the same room and examined using          identical protocols The majority of AKXD mice were          aged and analyzed at the same time as groups of D mice          reported in a previous study   Some AKXD mice were          subsequently analyzed and so additional D mice were aged          and analyzed at the same time The disease          characteristics of the additional D mice was the same as          previously described                            Clinical examinations          The anterior chambers of male and female AKXD mice           months of age were examined with a slitlamp          biomicroscope HaagStreit Mason OH Observed clinical          phenotypes were recorded at the time of examination and          rated as normal mild moderate or severe based on the          following criteria Iris stromal atrophy ISA involves a          loss of complex iris structure due to loss of iris          stroma It was ranked as mild minor loss of iris          complexity moderate notable lack of iris complexity          and focal thinning of iris or severe iris lacking          complex morphology and is thin frequently with focal          full thickness holes Transillumination TRAN refers to          light passed through the pupil and reflected off the back          of the eye and through depigmented regions of the iris          TRAN was ranked as peripheral transillumination limited          to peripheral iris mild individual specks of          transillumination across iris moderate individual          specks and focal areas of mass transillumination or          severe majority of iris transilluminates easily          frequently through holes Dispersed pigment DP refers          to clinically visible accumulations of pigment or pigment          laden cells on anterior segment surfaces most frequently          observed on the lens or iris Dispersed pigment is part          of the iris pigment dispersion phenotype IPD that is          caused by the D           ipd allele Fundus examination was          performed with pupils dilated by a drop of  atropine          sulfate and an indirect ophthalmoscope American Optical          Rochester NY with a  or diopter lens Our method          of fundus photography has been previously reported                                     Ocular histologic processing          Enucleated eyes from AKXD mice  months old were          fixed for plastic sectioning  paraformaldehyde and           glutaraldehyde in either  M phosphate buffer pH           or  M cacodylate buffer pH  or for paraffin          sectioning  formaldehyde  M acetic acid           ethanol as previously described    Serial          sagittal sections passing through the optic nerve were          collected stained with hematoxylin and eosin and          analyzed for pathologic changes To control for variation          with position various phenotypes were only assessed at          specific ocular locations in high quality sections            Thus the number of eyes successfully analyzed differs          with the phenotype assessed Optic nerve cupping was only          judged from sections containing central optic nerve          Optic nerve atrophy retinal ganglion cell death and          inner nuclear layer cell loss were detectable in central          sections and sections containing optic nerve that were          slightly off center Ocular lesions were rated as normal          mild moderate or severe using previously published          criteria   Since cell counts were not performed          inner nuclear layer cell loss was only rated as affected          when obvious cell loss was evident typically at least           to  cell layers missing One D eye examined          histologically was excluded from the study because of the          complicating presence of a large corneal ulcer          accompanied by severe intraocular inflammation this eye          had a very severe retinal phenotype and severe optic          nerve damage                          Optic nerve histologic processing          Samples were processed as previously described            After initial fixation for  hours optic nerves were          carefully dissected postfixed with  osmium tetroxide          and subsequently processed by standard procedures A few          nerves were recovered from eyes previously embedded in          Historesin Leica Heidelberg Germany Cross sections          were cut at a thickness of  m stained with          Toluidine Blue O and analyzed for pathologic changes          Using this technique the axoplasm of degenerating axons          appears dark   The number of females F and males          M analyzed at each age in months were F n          M n F n M n F n M          n The extent of nerve damage was independently rated          by  investigators MGA RSS SWMJ who were unaware of          the animals age and of each others classification of the          tissue A single rating for each sample was then          determined by consensus although commonly the          determination was unanimous Based on nerve morphology          damage was rated using a broad scale consisting of mild          moderate and severe categories Nerves estimated to          contain  dark staining axons per section and limited          or no gliosis were rated as mild Normal nerves with no          damage were included in this category Nerves estimated          to contain greater than  dark staining axons per          section but still maintaining a significant portion of          live axons were rated as moderate Nerves rated as severe          contained numerous damaged axons throughout the nerve          had grossly disrupted nerve morphology and sometimes          contained few if any healthy axons Gliosis was present          in some moderately and severely damaged nerves                          Intraocular pressure measurement          IOPs were measured using a microneedle system as          previously described    The IOPs of B mice are          consistent over time and so these animals were          interspersed with experimental mice to ensure that          calibration had not drifted and that the system was          functioning optimally The number of AKXD females F          and males M successfully analyzed at each age were          F n M n F n M n          F n M n F n M n          All measurements were taken during the lighton phase of          the recording room IOP values are given as mean           standard error of the mean Reported P values are from          multifactorial analysis of variance                          Measurement of glutamate levels          Aged mice were euthanized and eyes removed Vitreous          was collected by inserting a pulled glass microcapillary          needle inserted approximately midway between the limbus          and optic nerve and gently pressed posteriorly into the          vitreous at an angle avoiding the lens and retina This          technique cleanly collected the more liquified vitreous          Pilot experiments demonstrated that it is extremely          difficult to harvest the more gelatinous vitreous that is          intricately associated with the retina without retinal          contamination Vitreous was collected under a dissecting          microscope and any samples containing blood or other          visible debris were discarded Collected vitreous was          immediately transferred to dry ice and stored at C          until processed Depending on the amount of vitreous          collected per eye samples from  eyes were pooled to          obtain a total volume of  l of vitreous Sample          pools for female F and male M mice were collected          from mice  and  months old the number of eyes          contributing to each sample pool was F n M n          F n M n Each sample pool was diluted to a          final volume of  l with cold Beckman LiS buffer           H            O  lithium citrate           thiodiglycol  hydrogen chloride  benzoic acid          pH  transferred to an Amicon  microconcentrator          Amicon Inc Beverly MA and centrifuged at             g for  minutes at C The          concentrator was rinsed with  l of LiS buffer and          centrifuged for  minutes The combined filtrates were          brought to a total volume of  l with the same          buffer          The filtrates were divided into two and analyzed in          duplicate on a Beckman  Amino Acid Analyzer fitted          with a  cm lithium column and the Beckman System Gold          data collection and analysis system Beckman Instruments          Inc Palo Alto CA Values for each filtrate were          determined from the mean of the duplicate analyses and          adjusted for the original volume of vitreous in each          pool The separation of glutamate and glutamine was          achieved using Beckmans LiA buffer  H            O  lithium citrate  lithium          chloride  hydrogen chloride pH  Standard          curves validating the method and ensuring accuracy over          the experimental range of concentrations measured were          generated using  samples containing known quantities of          glutamate  pmoles and glutamine           pmoles Values for glutamate levels at each age are          reported as mean of the female and male sample pools           the standard error of the mean
