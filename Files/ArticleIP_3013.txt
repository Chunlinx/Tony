                                 Future Shock            John Updike is at bottom areligious novelist but when you try to identify what exactly his bottommostreligious beliefs may be the whole murky lot of them playfully slitherawaywhich gives his writing a touch of theological suspense Typically heconjures a Lutheran or Presbyterian setting for his novels and his enthusiasmfor those particular creeds induces him at moments of crisis in one plot afteranother to plunk his guilty male culprit of a hero Updikes heroes are almostalways guilty males down on a hardwood pew and to subject him to a vigorousSunday sermon on biblical themes            His newnovel Toward the End of Time  takes place in a futuristic Massachusettsin which nuclear war has leveled half of civilization strange new metallicanimals are threatening to gobble mankind government has collapsed and agangsterish network of uniformed thugs called chillingly FedEx isestablishing a government network of its own Yet even in this most bizarre ofUpdikes novels the guilty hero eventually finds himself sitting primly in apew listening to a lady minister declaim on Mary Magdalene and her womanlytears What do these Sunday sermons amount to though Life is drab in Updikesnovels and sins are vast and the Christian pieties that come tumbling downfrom the pulpit never seem adequate to the case And so Updike in his fervorgoes on a search for God to thus label the object of his desires directly bymeans of an intimate unblinking examination of the world in front of his ownnose            He becomes a maniac of miniature observation Atomicparticles dance in his eyesight The world shimmers at him and after a whileencouraged by what he sees he shimmers back ecstatic He is something veryclose to a mystic in that respecta transcendentalist in the old New Englandliterary tradition agog at the indescribable radiance of the lawn at his feetor at the white brilliance of the refrigerator door or at the everdazzlingdust motes floating through the sunbeams He is Emersonexcept that like alunatic in an asylum he has spent a lifetime in the mistaken belief that he isHawthorne                           Towardthe End of Time might seem different from his other novels because of thescifi trappings which do get rather fantastic Updikes hero Ben ayearold retired financial manager is suddenly transposed across the agesto ancient Egypt then to the time of Jesus then to medieval Ireland Hebegins an affair with a young call girl who on some other plane of existencemay be a deer and then a new affair with a girl so young as still to be achild Strange astronomical weirdnesses roam across the postnuclear sky Itsall very puzzling and the urgent hope that Updike will explain these manymysteries keeps you faithfully turning the pages            Arguably he does offer an explanation by meansof a theory about how time can branch off in different directions and performdifferent operations like a computer program Alternatively you could regardsome of those strange doings as the addled fantasies of the aging suburbanhero whose journal of a year filled with rants against his wife andpornographic musings and notations about his deteriorating health constitutesthe novel But either way once you get past the scifi extravaganzasToward the End of Time tells a story exactly like that in any number ofUpdikes novelsof a man unhappy in marriage blue with remorse and unable tofigure out what to do except by attending closely to the radiant surface ofthe visible reality in front of him            And so Updikes Ben observesthe passage of seasonslife bursting into blossom in early spring forinstance            There are suddenlychildren wild on the streets clogging the doorway to the convenience storeraucously scraping their skateboards and roller blades along the sidewalksflaunting their pasty winter skins in shorts and baggy untucked Tshirts Wherehave they been all winter these children They are spontaneously repulsivelyhatched like the flies that now buzz and bump on the inside of the kitchenwindows drunk on warmth Driving out to Route  I see a weeping cherrytree no less spectacular for being familiar making its annual splash ofpurplepink  and even along the driveway my poor little spindly pear treeshave devised a few blossoms at one of which I saw a sleepy bee bumbling myfirst bee On Route  for no practical reason there is a thickening oftrafficanother spring phenomenon garaged cars released            In Toward the End of Time these descriptions neverquite rise to ecstatic levels though Ben remembers how as a child the pulpmagazines Amazing and Astounding  with their remote radiantexploding facts used to relieve the pressure of everyday bleakness for himBut facts seem to have lost that power Bens dutiful recording of minisculenew shifts in foliage slips ever deeper into sadness At the beginning of theyear he finds or imagines a tiny shred of secondrate love with his callgirldeer and later on finds or imagines an even tinier shred of apreposterous lessthanlove with his childgirlfriend But by the end hecannot imagine being loved by any human being at all and comforts himself withthe pathetic idea that perhaps the fungus growing on the lateautumn soggyground is offering him in some spongy vegetable manner of its own theacceptance he craves At times curled beneath its soft beige gills of thallicmatter a kind of breath hints of love And it becomes poignantly clear thatUpdikes hero is beginning to die not just because his physical self isdeteriorating but because he has a soul which is shrinking            Its not a great novelUpdike scatters too many leafy scifi fantasies across his pages and never doesget around to raking them up again which is disappointing I dont entirelybelieve those scifi notions anyway The cast of characters is a little thinBut Updike even in this book is a great writer the greatest we have in hisparticular areas of strengthin the control of visual details in his rhythmicintensity in the colors and shapes that come pouring syncopatedly from hismischievous pen I fear that too many people will throw up their hands inexasperation at Updikes way of appealing for love by presenting his heroes asever more odious or cantankerous and too many other people will celebrate thebook mostly for its secondary virtuesits astronomical wonders sailing throughthe futuristic sky the humanchomping metal animals a few political jokesBut there is a primary virtue to this book subtler than its other traits andthis primary virtue is to be ever so quietly heartbreaking
