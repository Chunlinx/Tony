                                 The Myth of the Foot Home Run            On June  fans atSeattles Kingdome witnessed one of the most dramatic pitcherhitterconfrontations since Walter Johnson faced Babe Ruth On the mound theMariners Big Unit  Randy Johnson the tallest man ever to play in themajors and the most proficient strikeout pitcher in history At the plateOaklands Mark McGwire the best and strongest homerun hitter since Ruth            AlthoughJohnson whiffed McGwire twice on the way to a recordbreaking total of strikeouts McGwire hit what was estimated as the longest home run in at leasta decade He got all of a mph fastball and launched it at  mph in thegeneral direction of Canada            On the radio Mariner announcer Dave Niehaus marveled Ahigh fly ball belted and I mean belted  deep to left field into theupper deck My oh my what a shot by Mark McGwire That is probably thelongest home run ever hit here  It will be interesting to see how far thatball will be guesstimated  We have often wondered if McGwire got ahold of aRandy Johnson fastball how far he could hit it and I think we just sawit            Shortlyafter Niehaus gave the estimated distance  feetunbelievable absolutelyunbelievable The longest home run ever hit here in Seattle  the longesthome run I think I have ever seen hit Not only that it seems to be thelongest ball hit since  when the distance of majorleague home runs wasfirst estimated on a wide scale Sports pages and broadcasters across thecountry are still heralding McGwires homer as one of the great feats inslugging history            But theres a catch The feet figureannounced by the Mariners about  seconds after the ball landed was anoverstatement worthy of PT Barnum According to three physicists who haveworked independently and have written extensively on the science of baseballthe human limit for hitting a baseball at sea level under normal temperaturesand with no wind is somewhere between  feet and  feet            Curiousthat anyone could hit a ball  feet in an indoor park near sea level Icalled the Mariners to see how they devised such a spectacular number The teamrepeatedly refused to explain how they arrived at the figure or to allow me tospeak to whoever made the estimate Mariners PR Director Dave Aust stressesthat the figure is a guesstimate We dont really believe in the processAust says distancing the team from the McGwire number            That process has evolved over time In  IBMestablished the Tale of the Tape program devising a system by which homerundistances could be estimated Sponsorship of the Major League Baseballlicensedprogram was assumed by telecom giant MCI in  and redubbed the MCI Home RunProgram The programs Web site lists the  longest home runs of the year andprovides a searchable database of the home runs of the previous two years            We do notmeasure the home runs says MCI spokesman Cal Jackson The distances areestimated by the individual clubs and then provided to MCI We act as awarehouse for the numbers that Major League Baseball sends us            Unsatisfied with the feet number I did myown figuring I consulted the  Kingdome blueprints a more recentlasersurvey diagram of the stadium and the Seattle Times game storyand visited the park twice Here are the facts McGwires homer landed in theeighth row of the left side of section  in the second deck feetmeasured horizontally from home plate and  feet above the playingfield            How muchfurther could the ball have gone Based on a review of the trajectory charts inThe Physics of Baseball and Keep Your Eye on the Ball The Scienceand Folklore of Baseball  conversations with University of Puget Soundphysicist Andrew Rex and correspondence with aerospace engineer and baseballresearcher Roger Hawks I determined that the McGwire home run would havetraveled about  feet A mighty home run yes but still  feet short of thelength claimed            Rex and Hawks agree that any home run hit that far mustapproximate the maximumdistance trajectorythat is it can only be a highfly or a normal fly not a line drive McGwires homer was a high fly asNiehaus attested and as was confirmed by his broadcast partner Rick Rizzs whomarveled at the balls hang time According to the Major League Baseballsystem a high fly will descend at an angle whose cotangent is  Intrigonometryfordummies terms what that means is that for every foot the ballwould have continued to drop vertically it would have traveled another feet horizontally Heres the math  feet   feet x    feet            McGwiresfooter isnt the only questionable long ball of the season The MCI Website claims six footers in  five by McGwire and one by ColoradoRockies star Andres Galarraga hit in Miami Galarragas home run originallyannounced as  feet then revised at the park to  feet is listed at feet by MCI By my calculations it probably went about  feet And yetanother reason to doubt the  numbers Apparently the IBMMCI programrecorded no footers from  to             Dont get me wrongall the homers listed onthe MCI topten list were remarkable shots And Im not arguing thatfooters are impossible A few have been hit but all were aided byaltitude the elements or both The bestknown of these Mickey Mantlesmythical foot blast on a windy day at Washingtons Griffith Stadiumprobably traveled about  feet according to The Physics of Baseballauthor Robert K Adair            The MCI Web site spells outthe intended method of measuring these home runs Distances are measured usinga grid system matched to each ballparks unique parameters and configurationEach home run is estimated based on how far it would have traveled from homeplate on a horizontal line had it not been obstructed by something seatsfence roof foul pole other stadium parts etc            If every team workedaccording to the MCI plan each stadium would be accurately diagramed with afinegrained grid related to its seating sections level by level This wouldtell the estimator how far the ball was from home plate when it landed in theseats bullpen or other stadium area and how high it was above field levelwhen it landed In todays stadiums very few home runs touch the groundbefore hitting something higher first            Workingwith the distance and height the estimator would assess the ballstrajectorywas it a liner a normal fly a high flyand use a formula todetermine the ultimate distance the ball would have traveled Click for theformula            In theory this is not a bad system but in practice itsnot always fully observed Some teams work from arcs rather than grids makingthe estimators jobs more difficult Some teams measure only to the point ofimpact rather than to the likely fieldlevel landing point The Rockies donthave height data and must estimate that dimension The Red Sox cant see whereballs hit beyond The Monster into the street land If McGwire had hit hishome run in Baltimore for example it would have been measured at about feet under the Orioles pointofimpact house rules Such departures make thevarious majorleague homerun distances inconsistent and usually make themless accurate as well            MajorLeague spokesman Patrick Courtney acknowledges that there have been questionsabout the MCI program and says that the measurement issue will be discussed atleague PR meetings next month so everyone will be on the same page for nextyear            Lets hope so Baseball a game of inches andmeticulous recordkeeping deserves accurate and consistent data and theseawful numbers have already tainted one set of record books Click for thestory The pity is that the homerunmeasurement program as conceived by IBMin  was never uniformly implemented Now is the time for scientists toreview and refine the system and for Major League Baseball to ensure complianceand train the estimators            After a period ofadjustment during which many long home runs will seem puny well slowlyreacclimate ourselves to reality Weaned off the inflated estimates numbersthat add  feet to big home runs well finally appreciate the majesty of afooter
