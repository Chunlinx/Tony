                okay   okay and you want to talk about this weather wow i wanna talk about how mild it was at Christmas time   yeah its something else yeah how about that huh   well that was uh totally unbelievable for the first time in a long time i left plants outside and they didnt freeze  so that was pretty good um yeah     yes yeah thats true uh the i think it was last year around this time it was when we had the really really hardened cold snap   yeah   i had a pipe break on me so it flooded the house and everything   oh you did oh thats terrible   so i was trying to be prepared this time around   well whatd you do to prepare for that   uh well it was an outside pipe so now this time i made sure i wrapped them up real good umhum   i see oh you did oh good for you uhhuh   i dont wanna go through that again   no i um that happened to a friend of ours actually they have a condominium and um they they went out to the grocery store and were out for oh a couple of hours   umhum umhum   and when they came home the the pipe had broken and their their ground floor was flooded so uh it its its a major horror when when that kind of thing occurs   ah umhum yeah well with us we were out of town over the Christmas holiday and our neighbor called us to say hey you guys did you leave the water running   oh   oh oh no uhhuh   yeah they saw the the water coming out from under the door   oh my goodness isnt that terrible thing yeah     yeah so we cut our vacation short but  i guess it wasnt too bad uh we ended up getting all new carpet downstairs and part of the upstairs so   oh umhum yeah oh oh my goodness well   it wasnt it wasnt a real pleasant but uh you know looking back it it was a good deal because we did need new carpet   umhum umhum well you know sometimes in a funny kind of way life treats us like that that something we wouldnt normally do when were placed in the circumstance we go ahead and do it and then uh things are kind of better afterwards and it it ultimately gives you an uplift i i i guess you have to look at it like that anyway or you might get depressed  and God forbid  but anyway   yeah exactly umhum   thats true   but uh we had visitors from New York im really not from this area you must detect that im really originally from the New York area and we had visitors uh both from New York and from California at Christmas time   umhum umhum oh   and um usually it is uh somewhat cold i mean cold enough to put on a winter coat or at least heavy sweaters and it was so mild here that uh they had to of course   sure sure     poke several funny jokes at us down here with this funny weather and you know whatever uh but uh i think they were very uh pleasantly happy because one person has um     umhum     uh arthritis kind of stuff and um   umhum   when it gets very cold they all crink up you know  and uh we didnt have any of that kind of problem this year so we were uh very grateful for that kind of thing   umhum umhum thats great yeah  so you had the kind of weather that uh it was nice to go out at night on   thats right umhum yeah uhhuh of course in California they have such a steadily more moderate climate that the temperatures even in the areas around San Francisco we used to live   yeah thats great umhum   down in that Bay area the temperatures never got excessively cold if it got down around thirty two just about   umhum umhum   uh then the people would start panicking over the artichoke uh crops and uh avocados and of course down south the   hum oh i see umhum   the orange groves and things like that you know the weather really does have a lot of effect upon so many things and um when they grow those oranges down in the southlands they have these   right yeah   braziers out in the field and they go around putting fires on if the temperatures gets down around thirty two or thirty and just levels off there so that   umhum hum wow   they can regulate it by means of those like man made not too difficult um uh ways to to save the crops   umhum yeah   but we all know what happens if those crops freeze uh we pay for it  yeah   right right  thats right you know uh you you usually dont think of that uh you know being i guess being in a urban area if it gets cold you know   yeah umhum uhhuh   you you well lets think about water freezing and pipes breaking but down there they got all those crops to worry about   right of course uhhuh oh oh yes oh its its really well that happened here in Texas with the grapefruits that year a couple of years ago     yeah yeah right i remember that   and the grapefruit crop was very uh very scarce uh so uh you know all of these major things the poor farmers but um   thats right right yeah   anyway well just uh hope that uh were not in for too many big freezes now but i know one big one will come       and in it always does and uh i really dont mind those uh few uh snow flurries and those few days when theres a bit of snow   it always happens huh   always happens huh sure id say theres pretty quite pretty
