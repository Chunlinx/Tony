                    Introduction        A key component regulating neuronal migration is the        appropriate spatiotemporal expression of extracellular        matrix ECM molecules which contribute to the highway        along which neurons travel Proteins such as serine        proteases and their inhibitors could alter the quality of        this highway and thus play critical roles in migratory        processes     Members of the serine protease inhibitor        superfamily or serpins act by binding to and permanently        inactivating their target proteases One member of this        family protease nexin PN was first described by        Monard         et al     Though initially        characterized for its ability to stimulate neurite        outgrowth        PN also modulates neuronal        migration as exemplified by Lindner         et al     Their studies        demonstrate that PN slows granule cell movement from the        external to internal layers in postnatal mouse cerebellar        slice cultures        Interestingly this inhibition of migration by protease        inhibitors may be balanced by the stimulation of migration        via proteases For example         in vitro addition of plasmin a        serine protease accelerates the migration of neuroblastoma        cells through a matrigel base by a factor of five            The subsequent addition of aprotinin a plasmin inhibitor        decreases the migratory population to the same degree             Furthermore Seeds         et al    demonstrated a        retardation of granule cell migration in tissue plasminogen        activator tPA knockout mice These data support the        hypothesis that a balance exists between serine proteases        and their inhibitors such that changes in this balance        delay or promote neuronal migration The present study was        initiated to test this hypothesis         in vivo by examining neuronal        migration of chick gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH        neurons during embryogenesis The site of origin of these        cells in the olfactory placode as well as the time course        and migratory route along the olfactory nerve ON and into        the forebrain are well documented               Previous work in the laboratory has shown that olfactory        axons emerge from the olfactory epithelium at stage  and        are first joined by glia    and GnRH neurons    at        stage         In order to test whether proteolysis or its inhibition        affect GnRH cellular migration we performed experiments at        two critical developmental time points In both of these a        protease or its inhibitor was applied by placing        proteincoated beads at the olfactory placode The first        experiments tested whether application of either of these        agents over the period of stage  to stage  affected the        initial exit of GnRH neurons from the OE andor their rate        of migration along the ON and into the CNS The second        experiments tested whether GnRH neurons exited the OE        irrespective of the effects of proteolysis on the        maturation of the olfactory nerve In this case        proteinsoaked beads were applied prior to GnRH exit stage         and the effects were tested at succeeding stages up to        and including their normal exit time stages            In the latter experiments the effects of proteolysis        and its inhibition on the development of the olfactory        nerve itself were tested using axonal glial and neuronal        outgrowth markers These are the first experiments to        demonstrate the critical roles of proteolysis and its        inhibition on the regulation of GnRH cellular        migration                    Results                  PN and trypsin modulate GnRH neuronal migration          in vivo during embryogenesis          All embryos analyzed were stage  at the time of bead          implantation and stage  at the time of fixation In          control embryos n   receiving a PB coated bead GnRH          neurons in each compartment were counted on the side          ipsilateral and contralateral to the bead There was no          effect of the bead on GnRH neuronal distribution Table           or total number Table  Sections counterstained          with cresyl violet revealed no morphological          abnormalities of the epithelium caused by insertion of          the bead Figure           In PN treated embryos the distribution of GnRH          neurons within the olfactory epithelium nerve and brain          on the side contralateral to the bead and that of          controls were not significantly different indicating that          the contralateral side in experimental embryos served as          an internal control Therefore statistical analysis was          performed comparing values within embryos ie GnRH          neuronal distribution ipsilateral to the bead was          compared to that contralateral to the bead          Significantly more neurons remained within the epithelium          P   and fewer had crossed into the brain P            see Table  on the PN treated side The          effects of PN on GnRH neuronal distribution cannot be          attributed to changes in total cell number as there was          no difference in this parameter between groups Table                    Other serine protease inhibitors tested included          soybean trypsin inhibitor and Type IV chicken          ovoinhibitor data not shown These protease inhibitors          demonstrated a range of effects on the distribution of          GnRH neurons across the three compartments Both          concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor tested           mgml n   and  mgml n   had no significant          effect on the distribution of GnRH neurons Application          of type IV chicken ovoinhibitor led to a decrease in the          percent of GnRH neurons remaining in the OE P            and a larger percent within the telencephalon P                     PN has four known target proteases urokinase          plasminogen activator uPA tissue type plasminogen          activator tPA thrombin and trypsin     Evidence          exists for a role of both trypsin     and uPA              in migratory processes Therefore both were tested          in our system All comparisons made were of the treated          side ipsilateral to the bead and the untreated side          contralateral to the bead          Trypsin resulted in fewer GnRH neurons within the          epithelium P   and along the olfactory nerve          P   and more within the brain P            see Table  There was no significant difference in the          total number of GnRH neurons Table  compared to          control The effect of trypsin is specific since in          embryos receiving a uPA bead there was no effect of the          protease on the distribution of GnRH neurons data not          shown                          GnRH neuronal migration is cell autonomous but          modulated by composition of the ECM          As PN can stimulate neurite outgrowth                we tested its effects on outgrowth and maturation of the          olfactory nerve Maturation of the nerve was followed by          immunoreactivity to axonal glial and neuronal markers          summarized in Table  All embryos analyzed were stage           at the time of bead implantation and stages  at          the time of fixation          Unilateral insertion of PB coated beads into the          olfactory placode of stage  embryos did not disrupt the          development of either axonal or glial components of the          olfactory nerve between stages  Table  The time          of axonal outgrowth and sequential acquisition of axonal          and glial markers were identical to that observed          previously     The porous nature of the bead was          compatible with axonal elongation through the mesenchyme          towards the developing telencephalic vesicle In fact          immunoreactive axons were found coursing through the bead          Figure  Likewise there was no alteration in the          timing of GnRH neuronal migration out of the epithelium          At stage  GnRH neurons were found within the olfactory          epithelium and along the olfactory nerve Table  a          distribution appropriate for this stage          Implantation of PN beads did not stimulate premature          olfactory nerve axogenesis As in controls very few          MAPb immunoreactive neurites were present at stage           Table  However PN application did accelerate the          biochemical differentiation of the axons For instance          under normal conditions olfactory axons acquire          immunoreactivity to NCAM at stage  In PN treated          embryos NCAM immunoreactivity was instead present at          stage  The sequence of appearance of all markers          however remained identical to controls As the length of          each developmental stage varies     it is difficult          to determine precisely the amount of time by which          biochemical development of the axons is accelerated On          average however biochemical differentiation is advanced          by  hours Just as PN did not alter the timing of          axogenesis it also had no effect on the timing of glial          entry into the nerve stage  Under these conditions          that is accelerated biochemical differentiation of          olfactory axons GnRH neuronal distribution was not          altered GnRH neurons were found within the epithelium          and along the nerve and most importantly none had          crossed into the brain          Implantation of trypsin coated beads at stage  had          no effect on either the timing of nerve development          axonal or glial or the biochemical differentiation of          the axons The distribution of GnRH neurons however was          altered Table  Under normal conditions large numbers          of GnRH neurons are within the telencephalon by          approximately stage  In the presence of trypsin          however GnRH neurons crossed the nervebrain junction at          stage  representing a significant acceleration of this          event Even more significantly these cells had continued          along their normal migratory path into the presumptive          septal and preoptic areas their normal target sites          Application of uPA beads at stage  had no effect on          axonogenesis or the nerves biochemical differentiation          or glial ensheathment The distribution of GnRH neurons          was likewise not altered data not shown                          PN and trypsin expression along the GnRH          migratory route          Endogenous trypsin immunoreactivity was present in the          vast majority of cells within the head of the chick          during the time period studied stage  These cells          included those within the olfactory epithelium and          throughout the mesenchyme as well as axonal tracts within          the developing face including the olfactory nerve          figure  panel A To ensure that the immunoreactivity          we see in chick is specific trypsin protein was          preadsorbed with the antitrypsin antibody This complex          was then used to immunostain chick sections stages           No immunoreactivity was evident suggesting that          the staining pattern seen in the chick using the          antitrypsin antibody was specific figure  panel B          Unlike trypsin no immunoreactive uPA was present within          regions of the olfactory system or the developing          telencephalic vesicle during this time frame data not          shown          Antibodies that recognize chick PN are not available          and thus this protease inhibitor was localized using          mouse embryonic tissue at developmental times          corresponding to the chick stages  Double confocal          immunofluoresence of mouse tissue embryonic day  El           demonstrated that MAPb immunoreactive axons of the          vomeronasal nerve VNN the highway for GnRH neurons in          the mouse     express PN protein Figure  but          not trypsin data not shown Importantly PN          immunoreactivity was not limited to MAPb immunoreactive          axons but was also present within the basal laminae of          the vomeronasal organ VNO as well as within the          adjacent mesenchyme Figure  In both El  and adult          mouse brains PN immunoreactivity within the olfactory          bulb was diffuse but appeared to be more concentrated          within the glomerular layer data not shown S          positive glia of the VNN express trypsin Figure           within the cell bodies and along major processes the          diffuse staining suggested it was also in the matrix of          the VNN Figure  B It is clear that PN protein was          not present in the same structures as those          immunoreactive for trypsin Figure  or GnRH data not          shown                            Discussion        This is the first report in which the         in vivo application of a serine        protease or its inhibitor have been demonstrated to affect        embryonic neuronal migration Our data demonstrate stage        specific effects of PN and trypsin on the distribution of        chick GnRH neurons along their migratory route without an        alteration of their total population        Stage specific introduction of these proteins was via        unilateral insertion into either the olfactory epithelium        or placode of protein coated Affigel Blue beads The use        of these beads is an established method widely utilized to        deliver exogenous proteins during development For example        in their study of limb development Fallon         et al    demonstrated depletion        of iodinated FGF protein from Affigel Blue beads indicating        protein does indeed diffuse out of the bead In fact the        authors demonstrated that approximately half the iodinated        protein diffused off the bead within the first  hours and         diffused by approximately  hours These data indicate        that protein is present and diffusing into the surrounding        area up to  hours following implantation of the bead Our        experiments were carried out within this window of time        there are  hours between stage  to  and  hours        between stage  and  In addition subsequent studies        examining the roles of BMP FGFs and Shh have also        utilized Affigel Blue beads to exogenously introduce        various protein components      The results of these        studies have been consistent with the known temporal and        spatial distributions of these proteins        Modification of the extracellular milieu via local        shifts in the proteaseinhibitor balance may regulate        neuronal migration This hypothesis is supported by our        findings on stage  embryos In these experiments        inhibition of endogenous trypsinlike activity by PN        resulted in fewer GnRH neurons exiting the olfactory        epithelium and a corresponding decrease in the number        entering the brain Conversely increasing trypsin        availability promoted neuronal crossing of these two        boundary zones We hypothesize that the serine        proteaseinhibitor pair act by altering the ECM through        which GnRH neurons migrate Matrix involvement in migration        is supported by the identification of matrix components        throughout the GnRH migratory route At the epithelium        GnRH neurons cross the basal laminae to initiate their        migratory phase     The olfactory nerve expresses        several matrix molecules heparan and keratan sulfate        proteoglycans     laminin     phosphocan            lectinbinding domains     Any or all of these may        serve as substrates for proteolysis The three domains the        olfactory epithelium olfactory nerve and the brain        represent regulatory road blocks to the GnRH cell By        inhibiting local proteolysis PN produces a nonconducive        environment at these points Likewise promotion of local        proteolysis by trypsin results in a permissive migratory        environment        Though modification of the ECM composition may indeed        explain the data another explanation may lie in the        activationinhibition of protease activated receptors        PARs These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive        but rather may work in concert to regulate neuronal        migration PARS are Gcoupled receptors activated by        proteolytic cleavage of their exodomains This cleavage        exposes an amino acid sequence which then serves as a        tethered ligand activating transmembrane signaling Four        PARS have been identified PAR  PARS  and  are        activated by thrombin while PAR is activated by trypsin            Activation of PARS may alter ECM composition For        example Hattori         et al    demonstrated that        thrombin activation of PAR led to deposition of        Pselectin a leukocyte adhesion molecule on the surfaces        of endothelial cells This change in matrix composition        allows for leukocyte attachment and subsequent infiltration        of the endothelium PARS are expressed in the developing        rat CNS    as well as in the embryonic chick            Though we did not localize PAR expression in our model        system it remains a possibility that their activation or        inhibition may modulate the ECM composition and thus GnRH        neuronal migration        The fact that mammalian PN alters neuronal migration        in an avian species suggests the presence of endogenous        serine protease activity in the region Such a protease        with trypsinlike immunoreactivity was detected by        immunocytochemistry To biochemically characterize this        endogenous activity nonneurally derived trypsin        inhibitors were tested At the concentrations tested        soybean trypsin inhibitor had no effect on GnRH migration        These results could be due to differences in binding        affinity between soybean trypsin inhibitor and PN for the        endogenous trypsinlike molecule The inhibition of        trypsinlike proteases by different inhibitors including        PN and soybean trypsin inhibitor varies widely and a        lack of an effect is not uncommon eg         Contrary to the effect seen with PN type IV chick        ovoinhibitor accelerated neuronal migration with fewer GnRH        neurons in the epithelium and correspondingly more within        the brain At least two mechanisms can explain this result        First type IV chick ovoinhibitor may not be acting as an        inhibitor in our system as it has been demonstrated to be        ineffective in other systems       Alternatively        if it is serving as a protease inhibitor it may inactivate        a molecule different from that affected by PN and in        doing so generate an environment permissive for neuronal        migration        Both nonneuronally derived trypsin inhibitors tested        yielded results different from that of PN suggesting they        possess different protease specificities affinities or        functions Regardless of their mechanisms of action these        data support the hypothesis that changes in enzymatic        activities can influence neuronal migration        In contrast to PN trypsin leads to a permissive        environment during this developmental period stages         resulting in a global acceleration of GnRH neuronal        migration out of the olfactory epithelium and into the        brain Trypsin cleaves peptide bonds at the carboxyl side        of either arginine or lysine residues This rather        nonspecific cleavage suggests trypsin may alter many        different components of the ECM which themselves vary in        each compartment Interestingly in the chick trypsin        immunoreactivity was present throughout the head as well as        in the olfactory nerve This ubiquitous distribution        suggests that the specificity of the proteaseinhibitor        system may be imparted by an avian equivalent of PN        We found no effect on GnRH neuronal distribution in        uPAtreated embryos and no uPA immunoreactivity This        result is not surprising in light of a study by Del Bigio         et al    in which the expression        pattern of uPA was analyzed in the postnatal mouse Based        on its spatiotemporal expression pattern the authors        concluded that uPA may function in processes of        synaptogenesis and remodeling rather than in cell        migration In addition our data indicate that simply        coating beads with any serine protease is not sufficient to        influence migration Thus not only is our experimental        approach unbiased but the antagonistic relationship of        PN and trypsin on GnRH neuronal migration is        specific        A PN specific antibody that cross reacts with chick        tissue is not available thus we were unable to follow its        expression in the chick Although avian and mammalian        serpins are members of the same superfamily they are        evolutionarily distinct     This divergence likely        accounts for the species specificity of the PN antibody        To determine whether PN is expressed by the olfactory        system during the time of active GnRH neuronal migration        we examined its expression in the embryonic mouse where its        mRNA is known to be expressed     At E PN protein        is present within MAPb immunoreactive axons of the        vomeronasal nerve the migratory path used by GnRH neurons        in mammals PN immunoreactivity was also present within        the basal laminae of the vomeronasal organ a barrier        crossed by GnRH neurons when they initiate their migration        This staining pattern along with our data on PNs effect        on migration strengthens our hypothesis that this serine        protease inhibitor plays a role in neuronal migration In        addition expression of other serine protease inhibitors        has been described in other migrating neurons For example        Krueger         et al    demonstrated increased        expression of neuroserpin within migrating granule cells of        the cerebellum in the post natal mouse        In the mouse trypsin immunoreactivity is present within        S  immunoreactive glia which ensheath axons of the        vomeronasal nerve As with PN it is also present in the        extracellular matrix where it is likely that the        proteaseinhibitor pair function to regulate at least in        part the environment through which GnRH neurons        migrate        Due to its ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth we        asked whether PN could alter the timing of formation of        the olfactory nerve and if so what effect this might have        on GnRH neuronal migration For these experiments bead        implantation into the olfactory placode was performed at        stage  just prior to olfactory nerve axonogenesis PN        did not accelerate neurite outgrowth but did accelerate        detectable levels of biochemical differentiation markers of        the olfactory nerve These data suggest that the olfactory        neurons can respond to PN directly or to changes in the        local environment caused by PN        The distribution of GnRH neurons was not altered by PN        at stages  in spite of the accelerated maturation of        the olfactory nerve Likewise PN did not alter the        timing of the nerves ensheathment by glia This suggests        that glial migration is independent of any matrix changes        induced by PN The fact that GnRH neurons and the glial        ensheathing cells exit at the same time stage  may be        coincidental or may be due to an interaction between these        two populations Alternatively the timing of exit of GnRH        neurons and glia may be cellautonomous events        Implantation of a trypsin bead at stage  had no effect        on the biochemical maturation of the olfactory nerve nor on        the timing of glial or GnRH neuronal migration At this        early stage at least some of the barriers to GnRH neuronal        exit from the epithelium are in place     Therefore        the lack of an effect on migration by trypsin suggests that        the initiation of migration is an inherent property of the        GnRH neuron and glial cell At stage  however trypsin        did significantly alter the distribution of GnRH neurons        such that a large population was already in the brain        These neurons not only entered the brain early but also        traveled caudalward within the brain along their normal        arching trajectory        Taken together these data suggest that in the presence        of either trypsin or PN at stage  GnRH neurons exit        the olfactory epithelium at stage  as in controls        Therefore the ability to initiate migration resides within        the neuron itself such that alterations of ECM composition        during this time stage  are irrelevant to the timing        of this initial event The finding that the neurons enter        the CNS early in trypsintreated embryos suggests that        continued movement may be a cell autonomous event with        trypsininduced proteolysis generating a permissive        environment Finally these data demonstrate that the GnRH        neurons ability to transit across the glia limitans and        through the brain to its target sites is independent of        additional maturation of the neuron itself the olfactory        nerve or the brain        Our data support a role of proteases and their        inhibitors in neuronal migration The complex interactions        between a neuron and its environment are likely not        regulated by proteolysis alone The characteristic directed        migratory pattern taken by the GnRH neuron and the        cohesiveness of the population suggests a more complex        system is in place to ensure their appropriate        translocation into the brain In fact Kramer and Wray           have identified a novel gene nasal embryonic LHRH GnRH        factor or NELF which is expressed by GnRH neurons during        their migratory phase and olfactory sensory neurons as they        initiate axonogenesis Antisense depletion of NELF led to a        decrease in both olfactory axonal outgrowth and the number        of GnRH neurons exiting the epithelium The authors suggest        that NEFL may function as a migratory factor It seems        likely therefore that several components interact to        orchestrate the proper migration of neurons
