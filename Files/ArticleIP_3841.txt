                                                            posted Wednesday Oct                                       FactAbuse                        The Hey Wait a Minutecolumn by Douglas J Besharov and Jacob W Dembosky Child Abuse Threat orMenace seriously misrepresents the methodology findings andconclusions of the recently released Third National Incidence Study of ChildAbuse and Neglect NIS As the NIS project director and the supervisorresponsible for implementing the NIS definitions we want to set the recordstraight We address only some of the misinformation here            In light of Besharovscriticisms it is noteworthy that he participated in the Conference of Expertsconvened in late  by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect theNIS sponsor specifically to refine the NIS design Together with the restof the conferees Besharov recommended no changes in the NIS methodology anddefinitions Now five years later Besharov opines that the NIS methodologyand definitions are flawed The NIS findings may run counter to his positionbut it is important for Besharov and Dembosky and for readers of Slate to getthe facts straight            First when Besharov andDembosky characterized the  million additional children who joined the ranksof the maltreated between  and  they summed up the NIS estimates ininappropriate ways to draw their conclusions In doing so theyoverstated the percent of children who were harmed only byemotional or educational maltreatment actually  percent not the  percentthey indicated and they understated the percent of new children whowere harmed by physical abuse sexual abuse or physical neglect actually percent not the  percent they implied Besharov and Dembosky also glossedover how these percentages translate into numbers of children The  percentjust mentioned refers to over onehalf million additional children whowere harmed by physical abuse sexual abuse or physical neglect in overand above the number who were harmed by these forms of mistreatment in  Anestimated  children were harmed by these forms of maltreatment in Also in discounting the rise in incidence found in the NIS Besharovand Dembosky contend that fatalities arising from child abuse have heldroughly steady between  and  But this is contradicted by the numbersthey themselves cite which show that fatalities have risen by                percent during this period from  to             Second Besharov and Demboskymisrepresented the NIS methodology for classifying the severity of injury orharm We wish we could ascribe this to misunderstanding but we clarified thisissue for them before their articles publication and they published theirmisinformation anyway In fact the classification of a child as seriouslyinjuredharmed is relatively objective in that it does not rely on a blanketjudgment by a respondent The criteria for defining serious harm or injury arestandardized they are applied to the described injury itself not to therespondents judgment about that injury and they have been consistent acrossthe three incidence studies So the recent quadrupling of the number ofseriously injured children cannot be ascribed to some vague form ofdefinitional creep            Third Besharov andDemboskys claim that increased sensitivity accounts for the rise in the numberof seriously injured children does not make sense in the context of thepatterns of NIS findings which do provide evidence of progressively heightenedsensitivity for more subtle maltreatment cues Respondents sensitivity tomoderate injuries increased between the NIS in  and the NIS in but did not change after that Between the NIS and the NIS respondentsshowed increased awareness of endangerment ie maltreatment events that didnot yet cause harm Note that the significant increases found in the NISwere discontinuous across the outcome spectrum occurring in only twocategories serious injuryharm and endangerment both of which essentiallyquadrupled since the NIS in  If Besharov and Dembosky want to discountboth increments by appealing to the same process enhanced sensitivity thenthey need to explain  why this process applied discontinuously in the NISand did not affect the intervening category of moderate injury or harm and how the NIS respondents managed to overlook threefourths of the children whohad been seriously injured while at the same time evidencing greatersensitivity in identifying moderately injured children Seriously injuredvictims of maltreatment are relatively unlikely to escape detection by thestudy methodology so the rise in incidence in this category cannot beplausibly explained as due to heightened awareness Considering all theevidence the most reasonable interpretation is that there has been a realincrease in the incidence of seriously injured children More than onehalfmillion children were seriously injured by abuse or neglect in             Fourth Besharov and Demboskytake issue with the documented drop of  percent in the rate of ChildProtective Services investigations by pointing out that the set ofuninvestigated cases includes educational neglect and emotional maltreatmentBut a careful reading of their discussion reveals that they do not address thedrop per se Instead their entire discussion emphasizes their take on therelative inappropriateness of CPS investigations for emotional and educationalmaltreatment However educational neglect and emotional maltreatment havealways been included in the incidence studies and eliminating them from thepicture would not eradicate the significant drop in the overall rate of CPSinvestigations from the NIS to the NIS In fact the percentages ofchildren whose maltreatment was investigated decreased significantly in allcategories except educational neglectfrom  percent to  percentamong physically abused children from  percent to  percent among sexuallyabused children from  percent to  percent among physically neglectedchildren and from  percent to  percent among children seriously injured byany maltreatment            Finally contrary to whatBesharov and Dembosky convey the NIS report does not blithely call formore reporting Nor did we claim recklessly that too few cases areinvestigated Instead we concluded that the NIS findings emphasize theneed for better targeting whether by reporters in referring children to CPSby CPS screening practices in connection with reports or by both                           AndreaJ Sedlak PhD                                       associatedirector of the Human Services Research Area at

Replies                        It is difficult to respondto Sedlak and Broadhursts letter First I have great respect for their pastwork and appreciate the constraints they faced in this projectas governmentcontractors in an underfunded study Second words like misrepresented andmisinformation are in the world of policy analysis fighting words Thirdtheir study is complicated and numbers can be thrown back and forth until theeyes of the average reader glaze over Most important my complaint is not somuch with the study as with the interpretation of its findingsand especiallywith the spin given to it by political appointees in the Department of Healthand Human Services            Hence I will deal with thepersonal attacks in their letter and then go on to my larger policyandethicalconcerns about their response            In their letter Sedlak andBroadhurst correctly point out that I participated in a  Conference ofExperts that discussed the studys methodology In fact as director of theNational Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in the mids I helped designthe study in the first placelong before either Sedlak or Broadhurst wereinvolved So I know well the strengthsand weaknessesof the studysapproach to the difficult task of counting illegal behaviors toward childrenthat largely occur behind closed doors            They claim that after the meeting I recommended no changes in the incidence studys methodologyand definitions But they conveniently leave out two important facts Firstat that meeting I pointed out that the methodological changes that wereplanned for the study all would have the effect of raising the count ofabused and neglected children  In fact Sedlak and her colleagues describedin a report to HHS how they planned to finetune the study to ensure thatcategories of key participants who were most likely to encounter suspectedmaltreatment cases in the  incidence study are given higher probabilityof being included in the new study In other words they proposed to changethe studys methodology so that more reports would be made to Westat Second Idid urge that the studys conclusions be modifiedsix months before it wasreleased to the public On Dec   Secretary Shalala issued a pressrelease stating that the number of abused and neglected children rose sharplyfrom  million in  to  million in  I tried to get a copy of thereport but was informed that no one outside the government would be given acopy until it was complete In other words Shalala issued her press releasebased on an uncompleted report            Like others I tried to getmore information about the study from Westat but was rebuffed In fact Sedlaksent me a memorandum stating that the continued contacts from your office onthe matter give the appearance of efforts to place me and my staff in acompromising position in relation to our client NCCAN Please ensure that yourstaff refrain from further contacts of this nature            Concerned I wrote toSecretary Shalala in March stating The Westat findings may be extremelysignificant but there is reason to doubt that they reflect an actual increasein abuse and neglect I went on to explain what the problems seemed to be andto offer my assistance in interpreting the studys results            In a bureaucraticnonresponse a political appointee replied by enclosing a defense of the studyprepared by Sedlak and stating I believe that the enclosed memo concerningthe study adequately addresses your concerns            I mention this historyrather than dueling with Sedlak and Broadhursts statistics because I thinkthat it exemplifies their selective presentation of information            The last time Sedlakconducted an incidence study it had to be revised and reissued almost threeyears later because technical problems in the analysis inflated the estimatednumber of abused and neglected children by  percent            This time around theproblem seems to be more severe The plain fact is that no attempt was made toconduct the kind of secondlevel analysis that would have explored whether theincreases were real The data that they cite in their letter to contradict usby the way were not presented in the original report and in any event aretoo incomplete for these purposes I realize that one reason this essentialwork was not performed was that the government was unwilling to pay for it Butthat is no excuse for announcing that child abuse and neglect nearly doubledwithout also cautioning the reader about the studys limitations I hope thatbefore three years pass a revised report that does so will be issued            Moreover I doubt that thepeople at HHS seriously believe that child abuse doubled in seven years If ithad America would be in the midst of a childabuse crisis Decisive andperhaps radical action would be required not the puny list of previouslyplanned and budgeted activities that Shalala described in her press release Ademonstration program in Illinois  million in prevention grants million to maternal and childhealth programs past initiatives to fund familypreservation programs and to oppose childwelfare block grants and anunprecedented level of technical assistance to the states again though notan increase            But the real reason I writeis because of the broader problem created by exaggerating social ills Cynicsmight chalk up this latest report as yet another wellmeaning effort to buildsupport for childabuse programs After all goes the thinking if the Americanpeople believe that child maltreatment is a big problem they might be willingto spend more money on treatment and prevention programs Richard Gelles alongtime leader in the field and author of The Book of David How PreservingFamilies Can Cost Childrens Lives  says that he used to go along withpast exaggerations but has come to appreciate the harm that they havedone            Exaggerating the severity ofcases is what columnist Charles Krauthammer has called defining deviancy upThe more it seems that such serious maltreatment is common the less likely areagencies to respond firmly To put it bluntly society can consider a toughresponse to  serious cases a yearbut  is an entirely differentmatter politically and programmatically            I haveworked in this field for almost  yearsfirst as a young prosecutor in NewYork City later as the director of the HHS National Center on Child Abuse andNeglect and more recently as a trainer and consultantand I know that childabuse and child neglect are profound national problems But time after time Ihave seen how such overstatements have made the problem seem too big to handleor have distorted policymaking I am afraid that Shalalas remarks will do thesame                           JusticeIs a Bearded Lady
