                                 Hollywood Stars            Ransom a movie that opens Nov  cost  million to makeNearly a third of that  million went to its star Mel Gibson Gibsonworked for three months earning almost  million a day For six weeks onthe set of the next Batman movie Arnold Schwarzenegger has been paid million or  a dayplus if the film succeeds he will get another million or so from merchandising revenue Nobuyuki Idei the new presidentof Sonywhose major films last year featured expensive stars and eitherflopped or broke evenhas declared that his first priority for Hollywood is toliberate it from the tyranny of stars  Why do stars get paid so muchmoney Are they driving Hollywood out of business            Theupward creep of stars salaries and producers complaints thatit was wrecking the movies have both been going on since the film industrybegan In  aspiring film mogul Carl Laemmle wooed actress FlorenceLawrence away from Biograph where DW Griffith was a director with higherwages and a promise to make her a star Until then there were no movie starsFeature films carried no acting credits and producers forbade movie magazinesto print cast lists The reason was precisely the fear that actors andactresses known to the public by name would exploit that recognition to demandhigher wages They did especially during the late s and the s when aleading lady like Mary Pickford could command the thenastronomical sum of a week plus an annual bonus of             During the studio era of the s and s talentcosts were kept artificially low by a code negotiated between producersand actors at the depth of the Depression as part of FDRs National RecoveryAct The NRA was later ruled unconstitutional but the Hollywood Codesurvived The code gave the five major and three minor studios draconian powerover stars These included a sevenyear exclusive right to their services theright to cancel their contracts every six months the stars had no such rightin return the right to dock them for turning down a role in any movie of thestudios choice the right to predetermine salary increases and so on            In an antitrust suit brought by the federal government forced the studiosto give up ownership of movie theaters Without a guaranteed outlet for theirproduct the studios no longer could afford to keep stars on permanentretainer At that point stars seized control of their own careers andthe talent agent became a major Hollywood player The agents triumphwas not complete however until the late s and early s after all thestudios had been bought by larger mostly international corporations andcolorless corporate executives replaced the largerthanlife moguls of thestudio era Michael Ovitz and a few other agents were able to use theirclients star power to demand a package dealstar plus screenplay or someother element of productionwhich the studio was forced to accept in totoOvitzs Creative Artists Agency became the single most powerful institution inHollywood            Ovitz left agentry last year to become No  toMichael Eisner at Disney and Ovitzs No  Ron Meyer also has left CAAleading some Hollywood savants to declare the agency era over Meanwhilethough the triumph of the agent and the package deal is perhaps the mainreason that stars salaries are as high as they are But it is also true thatthe demand for stars services is also at an alltime high Even televisionprogramming this season is dominated by movie stars Ted Danson MarySteenburgen Michael J Fox Rosie ODonnell Several television executivestold Variety recently that they would not produce any new shows unlessthey could sign top film stars to them            Hollywoodstars are benefiting from the larger economic trend of growing inequality Notonly is the gap between executives and janitors growing so is the gap amongexecutives In the case of stars the main reason is marketing  Studioshave found no better way to bring in audiences than through the lure of popularstars who often command followings in specific age groups and can thereforehelp target a film to teenagers middleaged women etc And securing viewersis an increasingly difficult task Audiences are shrinking partly as a resultof competition from videocassettes cable and pay TV the Internet and otherforms of new technology Films stay in theaters for less time than ever beforetherefore more films have to be made and therefore more money has to bespent distinguishing one film from another The cost of marketing a movie is up percent since  according to the Motion Picture Association of Americato an average of  million Advertising movies before they open iscrucial but tricky since each film is essentially a brandnew product with noidentity in the marketplace other than its stars Wordofmouth takes too longto kick in and hurts more films than it helps and no one knows the names ofdirectors anymore except perhaps for Steven Spielbergs As a result thevalue of stars fame has increased            Adding to the demand for stars with recognizable names isthe foreign market  Sales overseas now account for half or more of afilms gross Waterworld  for example was considered a flop in theUnited States because it only grossed  million on a  million budgetWorldwide though it grossed  million The                Cable Guy forwhich star Jim Carrey was paid  million out of a  million budget is alsoexpected to turn a profit abroad But selling a blockbuster overseas requiresthe services of Alist talent foreign audiences are even less willing thanAmerican ones to accept secondtier stars            Hollywoodexecutives are attempting to reduce stars influence  This springDisney announced that it would cut its production by half Several studiosfollowed suit Studios will also try to substitute for expensive star vehiclesmore animated films and explosive specialeffects movies such as Twisterand Independence Day the biggest boxoffice successes last year withgrosses of more than  million apiece            Meanwhile following the lead of ClintEastwood Robert Redford Ron Howard and Jodie Foster more and more actorsare using their cachet to become directors and producers often of smallerartier movies that might not otherwise attract either funding or an audienceMel Gibson won an Academy Award for directing last years Braveheart  asdid three actors Christine Lahti Griffin Dunne and Jeff Goldblum fordirecting short films This year the actorsturneddirectors or producers orwriters included Tom Hanks  That Thing You Do  Steve Buscemi Trees Lounge  and Al Pacino  Looking for                Richard             It is not the first timethat actors have tried to seize the reins of productionthat was in  whenMary Pickford Charles Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks joined forces withWilliam S Hart and DW Griffith to form United Artists  a distributioncompany meant to compete with the larger film companies which were churningout formula films and treating most actors and actresses as hired hands UnitedArtists however was plagued by inept management and a lack of resources andnever became a power player This time actors and actresses have Hollywoodover a barrel and they may just succeed in becoming the next generation ofauteurs
