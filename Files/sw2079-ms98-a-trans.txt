        okay ill let you start first okay   okay we um im presently living in a house uh first time uh we had the house built and so this is our our fifth year in it i guess and uh um it was a really excitement to uh   to go out and select a house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses and um as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in Dallas Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home and theyre good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart so i would um not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in uh because theyre overpriced um but theyre a cheap house if you cant afford something good you know theyre good for that and um you can call it a home because its a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it how about in your case   well in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact hes in electronics but he knew the only way wed ever have a new home is if he would build it so it took him about two and a half years but uh he built us a house its uh we have thirty two hundred square feet and its a brick house and pricewise it wasnt great because he did it all hisself you know so that way he could we could kind of control in control it   umhum   and um we live in kind of a small town   umhum   and i mean its nothing fancy you know its its a house its nice and its real pretty and were all comfortable in it   well thats great thats great thats uh ive heard i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh who had a house built  matter of fact another guys building one now hes been doing it for three years and the citys a little upset with him but i understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that and uh   oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else   nothing wrong with that uh ill vouch for that   you know   um   so but uh of course my husband did everything except my brothers a trim carpenter and he came in you know and did the inside for us and that helped and and uh yes and uh we had to hire course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know he did everything else   that was a big savings well thats great well have you been in it long   weve been in it six years   oh really well have you do you have any plans to uh maybe um expand or move onward   no no well well uh our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before when they get a lot older we dont need such a large house that well sell it but he will not build a second one himself  because he says agewise hell never be able to handle that again yes yes   i see well first ones always a bear were having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us and uh that can basically be be be put on any lot in any state any country you know so thats kind of the   um   we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and hes charging about a buck a square foot to design it and hes registered certified and registered so at least we know were its not gonna fall in or something if its built but uh i have heard   uhhuh yeah oh   that your approach is is is right you can actually go out and sub it if even if you dont wanna get hands on you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things and and thats kind of the plan i have so um uh everyone i talk to uh ive   uhhuh yes   i file in my little book and do other things with it uh thats great thats great   but uh like i said otherwise you know a the the expense but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we hadnt did it ourself   sure i can imagine   yeah i mean its not a Eldorado house or anything like that but you know its ours   if your happy with it thats all that counts   thats right thats right   thats only only uh you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else   apparently apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high  isnt it it really is   ooh and thats uh thats uh a a encouraging sign if you ever wanna resell it i guess   because i im always shocked at about you know what theyve got have it appraised at i think oh my goodness   a lot of money i bet well thats great  well  yeah i guess that about does it   okay and it was nice talking to you okay byebye   nice talking with you too bye
