            hello   im Bridgette   Michael here   nice to meet you   nice to meet you where are you   im in Lubbock Texas   Lubbock im in Biloxi Mississippi   oh really oh my gosh   yeah  not too far away   i know well are you ready for me to push one okay   yeah i guess so     okay so what kind of cars do you like   well um i i like i dont like real big cars i like fairly sporty smaller cars and uh i have a Toyota Celica right now   uhhuh uhhuh   and um it uh the the question they asked us was what would we buy next thats sort of what i have in mind for the next car that i buy is another Celica     uhhuh   um   what year is it   its an eighty seven   okay is it because thats what i have too   oh you have a Celica oh really what what year is yours   uhhuh i love it  i have a eighty nine   eighty nine yeah   yeah its a Celica convertible and i love it  Toyota makes great cars   yeah oh i do too i do too yeah i think so too thats is the second Toyota that ive had   really   yeah and um  weve had it since its new and uh thats what i i plan on getting another one you know whenever the time comes     do you yeah my fiance and i weve talked about it even and he has a um a BMW and they are so  expensive to just keep up and stuff   uhhuh uhhuh   oh yeah yeah i know   that we were both like you know if were gonna get a new car itd probably i would say it would be a Toyota too   uhhuh umhum   for sure   what i would really like would be a uh Supra but just cant just cant afford that thats just a little out out of my range   uhhuh yeah i know those are nice  i think the next car that well look into will be more of a  i dont know i think is it Toyota Runner   yeah   um ive heard of it im not sure what its it is   is that what theyre called something like like a or like a um what are they called the one that  the one that Ford makes     um   the new ones do you know what im talking about   so a sort of sporty car   no theyre kind of more like a truck like a Bronco   oh okay um  oh other than the Bronco im not sure i dont know what it is uh they have a new one other than the Bronco youre talking about huh   type of   yeah yeah   no i dont know what it is i havent even really looked at the vehicles much lately   yeah i havent either but i i would think it would most likely be Toyota   oh yeah i think i probably will too because ive had good luck with it never had hardly any problems   uhhuh yeah me neither   you know and the one i had before was the same way   really   yeah we had a  a uh Tercel before this an eight two Tercel   uhhuh umhum   and that thing never gave us any problems   really   we had a wreck with it and uh  the only problems we had was because of the wreck you know front end alignment problems and stuff like that     uhhuh   but um uh i will i will say this uh the the Celica that i own now i have replaced the clutch in it   really   yeah and that was last year but um i think so i think you just wear them out because we live you know our areas fairly congested and a lot of traffic so its   but thats understandable yeah   you know we use the clutch a lot  i do youre stopping and going a lot you know   yeah uhhuh i would definitely have to say Toyota though thats the best car ive had   oh yeah yeah and uh i dont im im you know i dont worry about getting a Japanese car you know everybodys talking about buying American and everything and   its the best built yeah i know   uh i just like the Japanese cars i think i think theyre better made   i know uh i feel like i know i do too i feel like if if like Ford or someone could make one that competed with you know i would buy it i would   thats right yeah yeah if they could make one as cheap you know too i i got i think the American cars they have the Japanese beat when it comes to big cars of course   yeah yeah yeah   but uh when it comes to little uh sporty cars or that that kind of a car i i dont think there theres any competition really i think the Japanese have them beat   yeah i think theres so much more economicable too just like with gas and everything i mean i can go forever on a tank of gas   oh yeah sure i do too umhum well i can too im um   its like   i fill up maybe well i fill up about once every week and a half id guess id say   yeah   you know and uh i do a lot of driving right now im in school and everything so   uhhuh   um been doing a lot of extra driving but its you know its not bad not at all   go a far way on that tank of gas  i know   well thats right thats right well uh is yours the Celica that you have is it a um  an ST or a GT or what   its a GT   GT mine is an ST   what is that   uh its little lower model than the GT   is it   yeah they had the ST the GT and the GTS you know and the the ST is the uh cheaper  version of all three of them   umhum really my mom has a a GTS   uhhuh uhhuh   she has a eighty nine GTS Celica   yeah thats got a little  little power more powerful engine and a lot more uh little more options on it so   yeah yeah she i know she has this big powerful engine on she doesnt drive i mean she doesnt drive over forty   yeah oh yeah well thats the way mothers are   i know and the fu nny thing is because she bought it and i dont think the guy really i dont think she realized everything with the insurance and stuff on
