                    Background        Arabidopsis seedlings display distinct morphologies when        grown in the dark compared to the light Lightgrown        seedlings develop photomorphogenically characterized by        short hypocotyls and open green cotyledons In contrast        darkgrown seedlings undergo skotomorphogenesis or        etiolation typified by elongated hypocotols and closed        cotyledons     COP was first identified through        genetic screens as a negative regulator of light regulated        development in Arabidopsis     Arabidopsis         cop mutant seedlings are        constitutively photomorphogenic even when grown in the        dark and the severe         cop mutants cause lethality in the        late seedling stage indicating that COP is essential for        plant development      Arabidopsis COP Arabidopsis        thaliana COP AtCOP is essential for the        proteasomedependent degradation of two transcription        factors HY and HYH      These two homologous        bZIPtype transcription factors directly interact with        AtCOP and are capable of binding to lightresponsive        promoters to activate the transcription of many target        genes      Genome wide microarray analysis shows that        AtCOP regulates most if not all of the lightresponsive        genes under various light conditions             substantiating the notion that AtCOP functions as a        crucial developmental switch through targeting key        transcription factors for degradation thereby controlling        the lightresponsive gene expression and photomorphogenic        development        AtCOP contains three conserved structural domains a        RING finger at the amino terminus a coiledcoil domain in        the middle and a carboxylterminal WD repeat domain             Each of the three conserved domains has been shown        to mediate proteinprotein interactions       The        subcellular localization of AtCOP is regulated by light in        a tissue specific manner      The hypocotyl cell        nuclei contain high levels of COP in the dark and reduced        levels in the light suggesting that the nucleocytoplasmic        partitioning of AtCOP is adjusted by a lightresponsive        mechanism      The activity of AtCOP is at least in        part regulated by its subcellular localization as the        degradation of HY is dependent upon the nuclear        accumulation of AtCOP in the dark     AtCOP was        demonstrated to carry a single bipartite nuclear        localization signal located between the coiledcoil domain        and the WD domain amino acid  and a cytoplasmic        localization signal which was mapped to a region partially        overlapping with the RING finger and the coiledcoil domain        amino acid      Strikingly AtCOP protein        forms characteristic nuclear speckles when transiently        expressed in onion epidermal cells or stably expressed in        transgenic Arabidopsis      The functional role of        these speckles is currently unknown however a subnuclear        localization signal consisting of  residues amino acid         is required for their formation            A partial cDNA clone homologous to AtCOP has been        previously identified in mammals containing all three        conserved proteinprotein interaction domains            Remarkably when expressed in plant cells the mammalian        COPreporter fusion protein exhibited a lightregulated        nuclear localization pattern similar to AtCOP            Although mammalian COP failed to rescue the Arabidopsis         cop mutants overexpression of the        aminoterminal half of mammalian COP in Arabidopsis caused        a dominantnegative phenotype resembling the effect of        overexpressing the corresponding fragment of AtCOP                    To understand the function of COP in animals we        conducted an initial molecular characterization of        mammalian COP homologues We report here the cloning of        the fulllength mouse and human         COP cDNAs Mus musculus         COP          MmCOP  Homo sapiens         COP          HsCOP  and the comparison of COP        homologues from both animals and plants in terms of both        protein sequences and genomic structures Moreover we show        that mammalian COP is associated with ubiquitinated        proteins in vivo and itself a substrate of ubiquitination        Finally examination of the subcellular localization        patterns of the mammalian COP reveals a unique type of        nuclear import signal and a classic nuclear export signal        which might be important for regulation of the mammalian        COP activity                    Results                  Characterization of fulllength cDNAs of mouse and          human COPs          The previously reported partial           MmCOP mRNA GenBank accession          number AF encodes a protein product that          corresponds to the fulllength AtCOP but without the          ATG start codon at its  end     Homology search          against the updated public EST database with the  end          sequence of the available partial           MmCOP cDNA allowed the          identification of human and mouse EST clones containing a          predicted starting codon and a partial  UTR and the          subsequent construction of fulllength           MmCOP and           HsCOP cDNAs see Experimental          procedures for details The presence of stop codons just          upstream of the predicted start codons and their          comparable sizes with mRNA on northern blots data not          shown suggest that they contain fulllength coding          capacity The fulllength           MmCOP and           HsCOP cDNAs GenBank accession          numbers AF and AF encode polypeptides of           and  amino acids respectively and share           identity Fig Aand data not shown Compared to AtCOP          the predicted fulllength MmCOP and HsCOP proteins          contain unique Nterminal glycineserine rich extensions          of about  amino acids Fig A          The mammalian COP is expressed in many different          tissues and organs in both embryos and adults based on          the available EST information Mammalian           COP EST clones have been found in          aorta Bcell bladder brain breast cervix colon          germ cell headneck heart kidney liver lung          myotube nerve ovary parathyroid placenta prostate          single cell zygote spleen testis Tcell tonsil          unfertilized egg uterus and whole embryo from human          mouse and rat Northern blot analysis with selected          tissue types confirmed this ubiquitous expression pattern          data not shown                          Genomic structures of animal COPs and the          evolutionary implication          Using the predicted           HsCOP cDNA sequence BLAST          searches against the draft human genome database revealed          significant hits on chromosomes    and  Because          only the homologous sequences on chromosome  match           with the           HsCOP cDNA we conclude that the          functional human           COP gene designated           HsCOP  is located on chromosome          q Fig B and the homologous sequences from          chromosome   and  probably represent           COP pseudogenes as they all seem          to encode truncated proteins The corresponding sequenced          BAC clones on this chromosomal location GenBank          accession numbers AL AL AL and          AL can be assembled together with the reference of                    HsCOP cDNA sequences Fig B The                    HsCOP gene contains  exons and          the transcribed region is about  kb in length GenBank          accession number TPA BK Fig B We were also          able to identify the fulllength genomic sequence of          mosquito           COP Anopheles gambiae           COP            AgCOP  and partial genomic          sequences of           MmCOP and fugu           COP Fugu rubripes           COP            FrCOP  The genomic structures of          the vertebrate           COP genes appear to be generally          conserved among themselves but different from mosquito          and plant           COP genes data not shown          BLAST searches also have identified           COP homologues from many other          animal species including zebrafish frog chicken rat          cow dog horse and pig However we have so far failed          to find           COP homologues in Drosophila C          elegans or yeast whose whole genome sequences are          available It is interesting that           COP is not found in Drosophila but          in mosquito          Sequence comparison reveals that the three structural          motifs present in Arabidopsis COP including the RING          finger the coiled coil and the WD domains exist in          COP proteins from all other species The glycineserine          rich Nterminal sequence appears to be unique to          vertebrate COPs as it is missing in mosquito and plant          COP proteins However it should be pointed out that the          amino acids in this region are not well conserved and          their functional role in vertebrates is unclear          To reveal their evolutionary relationship we          generated a phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid          sequences of the Nterminal RING finger containing          fragments all corresponding to the first  amino acids          of HsCOP from representative COP homologues as only          partial COP sequences are available in the public          database for some species Similar phylogenetic trees          were generated with or without the vertebrate specific          Nterminal extensions and a tree with the extension          included in the analysis is shown in Fig C As expected          plant and animal COPs form distinct clades and the          homologies between COPs from different species are in          general consistency with evolutionary distances of these          species Fig C                          The association of mammalian COP with          ubiquitinated proteins in vivo          A number of RING finger proteins have recently been          shown to act as E ubiquitin ligases     WD          domains have also been frequently found in E complexes          as substrate recruiting domains        Despite          compelling evidence from Arabidopsis implying that COP          may mediate protein degradation      no direct          evidence of COP participating in ubiquitination has been          reported          As an initial step to study a possible role of          mammalian COP in ubiquitination we transiently          expressed FLAGtagged COP FLAGCOP in human cell line           together with HAtagged ubiquitin HAUb followed          by immunoprecipitation with antiFLAG antibodies          Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with          antiHA antibodies detected multiple distinct bands and          smear only when FLAGCOP and HAUb were coexpressed          indicating that at least a subset of COP associated          proteins are ubiquitinated in human cells Fig A          To further investigate whether COP itself undergoes          ubiquitination a Histagged ubiquitin expression          construct HisUb was cotransfected into the  cells          with FLAGCOP followed by His purification under          denaturing condition in  M Urea Under this condition          only those proteins covalently linked to HisUb would be          copurified Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with          antiFLAG antibodies detected a higher molecular weight          smear only upon coexpression of FLAGCOP and HisUb          therefore confirming that COP is indeed a ubiquitination          substrate Fig B Similar data were obtained when a          deletion construct FLAGN contains an intact RING          finger domain was used see late in Fig A Though          FLAGN was not as heavily ubiquitinated as the          fulllength FLAGCOP it clearly showed a ladder          pattern in which the size difference between neighboring          bands of the ladder was consistent with the unit          molecular weight of HisUb Fig B Therefore          mammalian COP not only associates with ubiquitinated          proteins in vivo but also itself a substrate for          multiubiquitination                          The mammalian COP protein is localized to both the          nucleus and the cytoplasm          The subcellular localization of AtCOP is regulated by          light     a feature that is critical for its          function      Interestingly the localization of          mammalian COP protein expressed in plant cells can also          be regulated by light     implicating a similar          mechanism may operate for the nucleocytoplasmic          partitioning of COP in mammalian cells          To investigate this possibility we first set out to          examine the subcellular localization of endogenous COP          in cultured mammalian cells Polyclonal antibodies          against a Nterminal fragment of MmCOP amino acid           were generated in rabbits and affinity purified          Endogenous COP is not detectable by immunofluorescence          with our antiCOP antibodies probably due to a very low          expression level Instead we took a subcellular          fractionation approach to study the localization pattern          of endogenous COP protein The purified antiCOP          antibodies detected a unique band of about  kDa from          HeLa whole cell lysates compared to the preimmune serum          Fig A This kDa band should represent the          endogenous COP based on the observations that antiCOP          antibodies harvested from two other rabbits detect the          same molecular weight band Fig A and RNAi against COP          can specifically reduce the level of this band our          unpublished data After subcellular fractionation with          HeLa cells each fraction underwent immunoprecipitation          and subsequent immunoblotting with antiCOP antibodies          As shown in Fig B the endogenous COP is localized          predominantly in the nucleus but small amount may also          be present in the cytosol Within the nucleus COP is          present in both the nucleoplasm NP and the nuclear          envelope NE fractions although COP is more enriched          in the nucleoplasm Fig B Identical samples from all          fractions were also probed with antibodies against other          control proteins Fig B As expected Lamin A and C          components of nuclear lamina were found predominantly in          the NE fraction Fig B This fraction was also highly          enriched in nuclear pore complexes as evidenced by the          enrichment of Nup Nup was detectable in smaller          amounts in the cytosol and NP fractions as well Fig B          consistent with its cellular distribution described          previously     On the other hand Hsp was found          predominantly in the cytosol fraction while Hsp was          found both in the cytosol and the NP fractions Fig B          Two subunits of the COP signalosome CSN and CSN were          located both in the cytosol and the NP fractions but not          in the NE fractions Fig B These controls thus          validated our fractionation results on COP subcellular          distribution          As another line of experiments we generated          expression constructs containing Nterminal GFP and          FLAGtagged MmCOP and HsCOP As shown in Fig C the          subcellular localization pattern of GFPCOP varies when          expressed in COS cells In general their localization          patterns can be categorized into three types In Type I          cells GFPCOP is expressed mostly in the cytoplasm          with some enrichment around the nucleus Fig C Type I          In Type II cells GFPCOP is expressed in both the          cytoplasm and the nucleus and also on the NE Fig C          Type II In the third type GFPCOP protein is          expressed mostly in the nucleus both in the NP and on          the NE Fig C Type III All three types of          localization patterns are well represented among the          transfected cells their relative proportions vary in          each experiment but do not seem to correlate with the          expression level of GFPCOP Similar results were          obtained when other cell lines including HeLa NIHT          and CHO cell lines were used or immunofluorescence          studies were carried out with FLAGCOP instead of          GFPCOP data not shown                          The fulllength mammalian COP protein can localize          to the nuclear envelope          To test if COP is tightly bound to the NE we          extracted cells with  Triton X before fixation          This treatment was shown to remove nonNE bound proteins          from both the cytoplasm and the nucleus     Indeed          after Triton extraction GFPCOP protein was completely          eliminated from the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm Fig          C Triton Only NEbound GFPCOP protein was          retained as characterized by a distinct RINGlike          pattern around the nucleus On the other hand GFP          control was completely removed from the cells by the same          treatment data not shown indicating that the retaining          of GFPCOP on the NE is mediated by COP and not by the          GFP tag Similarly FLAGCOP is also remained on the NE          after Triton extraction data not shown The different          localization patterns in different populations of cells          imply that mammalian COP may partition among the NP NE          and cytoplasm compartments                          Human COP is part of protein complexes of over           kDa          Because HsCOP is enriched in the nucleoplasm fraction          Fig B we used this fraction from HeLa cells for a gel          filtration analysis to examine possible forms of HsCOP          in human cells Endogenous HsCOP was found to accumulate          primarily in large complexes of over  kDa whereas no          monomeric or dimeric form of HsCOP was detected Fig           This finding is distinct from the observation for AtCOP          which exists mainly as a homodimer     In addition          the HsCOP complexes differ from the HsCOP signalosome          complexes in size as suggested by the different peak          fractions Fig  Finally transiently expressed FLAG or          GFP tagged HsCOP or MmCOP cofractionates with          endogenous COP data not shown suggesting the          behaviors of these fusion proteins most likely represent          the endogenous function of COP protein                          Both the nuclear and the cytoplasmic localization          signals of the mammalian COP are present in the          Nterminal region          As a first step to locate the signals responsible for          the subcellular localization of mammalian COP we made a          series of deletion constructs of GFPMmCOP Fig A As          shown in figure Aand B GFPN amino acid           which deleted the vertebrate specific Nterminal          extension also exhibited three general localization          patterns in transfected cells mostly cytoplasmic in          both compartments or mostly nuclear similar to          fulllength GFPCOP Fig C However GFPN does not          display NE localization pattern indicating that the          first  amino acid of glycineserine rich region may be          responsible for targeting MmCOP to the NE Fig Aand          B Similarly AtCOP does not contain this region and          is not located to NE              Unlike GFPN GFPRING amino acid  was          only found in the cytoplasm in all the cells examined          Fig Aand B suggesting that the NLS of MmCOP is          probably located within amino acid  to  of MmCOP          GFPN amino acid  contains the RING finger          the coiledcoil domain and the region corresponding to          the AtCOP NLS    and is localized exclusively in the          nucleus forming distinctive nuclear speckles Fig Aand          B GFPN amino acid  which contains the          RING finger and the coiledcoil domain but not the          sequence corresponding to the NLS in AtCOP is also          solely localized in the nucleus Fig Aand B However          unlike GFPN GFPN does not form speckles Fig          B These results show that the region from amino acid           to  is not necessary for nuclear localization but          contains a signal for speckle formation It is worth          noting that deletion constructs of AtCOP covering the          corresponding region were found localized predominantly          in the cytoplasm distinct from the mouse GFPN fusion          proteins              In contrast to GFPN and GFPN GFPN amino          acid  which contains an intact RING finger and a          partial coiledcoil domain is localized entirely in the          cytoplasm Fig Aand B Similar observations were made          when other cell lines were used HeLa NIHT and CHO          cells or by using FLAGtagged construct series instead          of GFP fusions data not shown Taken together both the          major nuclear and cytoplasmic localization signals seem          to reside in the Nterminal region of MmCOP most likely          between amino acid  and                           Identification of a classic leucinerich nuclear          export signal in mammalian COP          Because both GFPN and GFPRING are localized          exclusively in the cytoplasm the cytoplasmic          localization signal is probably located within the          overlapping region of these two constructs amino acid           Interestingly a sequence            L AN           V N           L M           L E           LL  amino acids  to  located          within the Nterminal region of the coiledcoil domain          matches classic leucinerich nuclear export signals          NES such as those from Rex and PKI Fig A               In order to test if this sequence is a           bona fide NES we made mutations at          two conserved leucine residues LA and LA in the          GFPN construct Fig A The mutant protein GFPN          NESmut in contrast to wildtype GFPN is entirely          nuclear localized Fig B Furthermore treatment of          wildtype GFPN with CRMexportin specific inhibitor          Leptomycin B LMB also causes the protein to be          localized exclusively in the nucleus Fig B These          results confirmed the identified sequence            L AN           V N           L M           L E           LL  within the coiledcoil domain of          mammalian COP as a likely CRMexportin specific NES          Notably the corresponding site in AtCOP is within the          mapped cytoplasmic localization sequence              Moreover the NLS must also be located within amino acids           to  of MmCOP since NESmutated or LMBtreated          N is nuclear localized Fig B                          Identification of amino acid clusters critical for          mammalian COP nuclear import and speckle          formation          Nuclear importlocalization signals NLS are usually          composed of one or two clusters of positively charged          amino acids To map the nuclear import signal in          mammalian COP we first identified three clusters of          positively charged amino acids within the amino acid           for mutagenesis Furthermore we also chose to          mutate a forth positively charged amino acid cluster at          amino acid  to  which corresponds to the          Arabidopsis COP NLS     Since GFPN exhibited          clear and consistent nuclear localized pattern with          speckles most resembling the fulllength MmCOP nuclear          localization pattern it was used as the starting point          for the sitedirected mutagenesis studies Fig A          Unlike wildtype GFPN GFPN          NLSmutRSKN and GFPN          NLSmutKTRSKT are totally localized to the          cytoplasm still forming speckles Fig B GFPN          NLSmutKNKNRS is still localized to nucleus          speckles similar to wildtype GFPN Fig B          Comparable results were attained when the same mutations          were introduced into GFPN fusion protein data not          shown Mutations of the fourth site RSKT within          GFPN GFPN NLSmut do not change the nuclear          localization of GFPN but abolish the speckles Fig          B Consistent with this GFPN which does not          contain site  does not form nuclear speckles Fig Band          B These results demonstrate both sites  and  are          required for nuclear import while site  is important          for targeting N to the nuclear speckles However we          do not know the functional significance of the nuclear          speckles at this time Further we do not know whether          the cytoplasmic speckles formed by GFPN NLSmutand          GFPN NLSmutare in any way related to the nuclear          speckles of wildtype GFPN                          A novel RING finger bridged bipartite nuclear          localization signal is responsible for mammalian COP          nuclear localization          In a typical bipartite NLS the distance between the          two clusters of positively charged amino acids is usually          around  amino acids However the distance between site           and site  in GFPN is more than  amino acids          apart separated by the RING finger domain Fig A To          determine whether the RING finger plays a role in          mediating nuclear import we mutated two key zincbinding          cysteine residues at the RING finger domain of GFPN          CACA N RINGmut to destroy the RING finger          structure Fig A Indeed these mutations abolish the          nuclear localization of GFPN Fig B The mutated          proteins are located in cytoplasmic speckles similar to          the N NLSmutand N NLSmutFig B          The RING fingers are characterized by four conserved          cysteinecysteine or cysteinehistidine pairs which bind          to two zinc molecules       Fig C In          particular cysteine pair  and pair  bind to one zinc          while cysteinehistidine pair  and cysteine pair  bind          to the other zinc thereby forming a unique crossbrace          structure      Fig C Cysteinehistidine pair           and cysteine pair  are separated by two amino acids          Although the sequences other than the zinc binding sites          are not well conserved the overall three dimensional          structures of all the characterized RING fingers are          overwhelmingly similar due to the conserved spacing          between cysteinehistidine pair  and cysteine pair  and          the tight zinc binding ability                   One common feature is that the RING finger structure          brings the flanking N and Cpeptides close together So          possibly the role of COP RING finger in nuclear import          is to function as structural scaffold by bringing the two          clusters of positively charged amino acids site  and          site  within the right spatial proximity to fit into          the binding sites of the nuclear import machinery as          illustrated by Fig C          To test this hypothesis we deleted the RING finger in          GFPN  and physically put the site  and          site  within a distance of  amino acids Figure A          This mutant protein GFPN RING maintained the same          localization pattern as wildtype GFPN protein Fig          B Therefore mammalian COP appears to contain a novel          nuclear import signal composed of two clusters of          positively charged amino acids bridged by a RING          finger                            Discussion                  Evidence for a role of COP in protein          ubiquitination in vivo          Because of its role in mediating the degradation of          HY HYH and possibly other transcription factors in          Arabidopsis     and the presence of a RING finger          domain and a WD domain AtCOP has been proposed to          function as a RINGfinger type ubiquitination E ligase          by recruiting E through its RINGfinger domain and          binding to the substrates through the WD repeats               This hypothesis is also supported by the findings          about other negative regulators of plant          photomorphogenesis COP which has been shown to          interact with AtCOP in yeast twohybrid experiment          encodes a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E variant              The COP signalosome an eightsubunit complex          homologous to the lid subcomplex of the  S proteasome              directly associates with SCF E complex and          promotes deneddylation of the cullin subunit of SCF in          both plant and animal cells        The exact          relationship between COP and the COP signalosome          remains obscure it is known however that in          Arabidopsis the COP signalosome is required for COP to          accumulate in the nucleus in the dark     Although          COP most likely plays a role in regulating protein          degradation attempts in reconstituting ubiquitination of          HY by AtCOP have been unsuccessful Instead CIP an          AtCOP interacting RINGH finger protein is found to          ubiquitinate HY in vitro      Therefore it is          possible that COP may recruit other RING finger          proteins such as CIP to mediate the ubiquitination of          specific substrates The existence of mammalian COP in          large complex forms is consistent with this possibility          In this study we have demonstrated the mammalian COP is          associated with ubiquitinated proteins and itself a          substrate for ubiquitination in vivo However we have          failed to reconstitute the ubiquitination activity of          mammalian COP in vitro Purification of the mammalian          COP complex may hold a key to understand how COP          mediates protein ubiquitination and degradation in the          cells                          Molecular basis for mammalian COP subcellular          localization and its possible regulation          Endogenous mammalian COP is found in the cytosol NP          and NE fractions in our subcellular fractionation study          with majority of the protein in the NP fraction Fig A          In our fluorescence localization studies with multiple          mammalian cell lines transiently overexpressed COP is          prevalent in the cytoplasm but also on the NE and within          the nucleus Fig B This discrepancy is probably due to          the overexpression of mammalian COP in the latter          system It is worth noting that endogenous COP appears          to be expressed at very low levels in all of the          mammalian cells we have tested          Through systematic mutagenesis studies we have been          able to locate both the NLS and the NES to the Nterminal          region of the mammalian COP protein Fig and Fig           Deletion constructs GFPN GFPN and GFPN all          contain both the NLS and the NES but their subcellular          localization patterns are strikingly different GFPN          and GFPN are localized exclusively to the nucleus          while GFPN is localized entirely to the cytoplasm          Fig  However treatment with LMB completely shifts          GFPN from the cytoplasm to the nucleus implying          GFPN may shuttle between the nucleus and the          cytoplasm consistent with the existence of both the NES          and the NLS in GFPN Fig and Fig  The different          domain compositions of GFP GFPN and GFPN may          explain the distinct localization patterns of these          mutant proteins NES is located within the coiledcoil          domain Fig  so it is plausible that the intact          coiledcoil structure in GFPN or GFPN masks the          NES possibly through interactions with other proteins          On the other hand the truncated coiledcoil domain in          GFPN is unable to shield the NES from binding to          CRMexportin Since GFPN is primarily localized to          the cytoplasm the NES is likely dominant over the NLS in          mammalian COP protein It is tempting to speculate that          under certain conditions the mammalian COP NES is          shielded within the coiledcoil structure and COP          protein is imported into the nucleus through the RING          finger bridged NLS under other conditions probably          through a conformation change of the coiledcoil domain          the NES is exposed overwriting the NLS and transporting          mammalian COP back into the cytoplasm However we          cannot rule out the possibility that a second set of          unidentified NLS between amino acid  may be          responsible for the nuclear localization of GFPN and          GFPN          This study reveals a novel type of nuclear          localization signal within the mammalian COP Nterminal          region consisting of a two clusters of positively          charged amino acids bridged by a RING finger domain Fig           Both clusters of positively charged amino acids are          required and can function as a classic bipartite NLS when          placed within the right distance Fig  Disrupting the          structure of the RING finger abolishes nuclear import          but removing the entire RING finger restores nuclear          import Fig           A RING finger sandwiched between a bipartite NLS could          provide additional regulatory mechanisms for nuclear          import In order to be transported into the nucleus it          is necessary for a protein to bind to the nuclear import          machinery such as importin  through its NLS Our          studies suggest the mammalian COP RING finger acts as a          structural scaffold by placing the two clusters of          positive residues within the right spatial proximity for          binding to the nuclear import machinery Since the RING          finger is a proteinprotein interaction domain          interaction of the mammalian COP RING finger with          another protein may under certain conditions trigger a          conformational change of the surrounding peptides          altering the proximity between the two positive residue          clusters of the NLS to disrupt binding to the nuclear          import machinery Alternatively recruitment of another          protein to the mammalian COP RING finger may sterically          hinder access of its NLS to the nuclear import          machinery                          RING finger  ubiquitination andor subcellular          localization          Within the past few years the RING finger motif has          emerged as a core structure feature for many ubiquitin          ligases Es     In most cases RING fingers          function as E recruiting domains and by directly          interacting with Es bring Es in the vicinity of          ubiquitination substrates which bind to other parts of          the RING finger proteins or other subunits of the RING          finger protein containing complexes Although most          evidence suggests that RING fingers may not directly          participate in the enzymatic transferring of ubiquitin          from Es to the substrates intact RING structures are          essential for this function In addition to the key roles          in E ligase activity RING finger domains have also been          shown to be important for regulating subcellular          localization of Es andor their substrates in a number          of cases        Studies have shown the MDM          RING finger domain is required to promote nuclear export          of p and this activity of MDM RING finger seems to be          coupled with its ability to promote ubiquitination of p                RbxROC the small RING finger subunit          of the SCF E complexes promotes the nuclear          accumulation of Cul another subunit of the SCF          complexes     These studies have suggested a          correlation between the ubiquitination activities of RING          fingers and their roles in regulating subcellular          localization of the E ligases which they are part          of          Our results suggest that mammalian COP might play a          role in ubiquitination Fig  If COP is indeed an E          its RING finger is likely to be indispensable for this          function considering the numerous examples of other RING          fingers On the other hand we have also demonstrated          that the RING finger is required for the nuclear          localization of mammalian COP Fig  Thus COP RING          finger could also play dual roles in ubiquitination as          well as nuclear import                          Distinction in subcellular localization signals          between higher plant and mammalian COP proteins          Comparison of the subcellular localization signals          uncovers clear distinctions between AtCOP and MmCOP In          AtCOP the sequence responsible for the cytoplasmic          localization is mapped to the region bordering both the          RING finger and the coiledcoil domain composed of           amino acids      Fig  In MmCOP we have          identified a single amino acid classic leucinerich          NES within the corresponding region Fig  even though          we have not eliminated the possible involvement of other          sequences The mammalian COP also has a unique          Nterminal extension that seems to involve in localizing          the protein into the nuclear envelope Fig  We have          defined MmCOP NLS as a RING finger mediated bipartite          NLS variant which is composed of  amino acids          surrounding the RING finger domain Fig  In contrast          the AtCOP NLS has been identified as a classic bipartite          nuclear localization signal consisting of  amino acids          in the intermediate region of coiledcoil domain and the          WD domain      Fig  Interestingly in MmCOP          the site matching the AtCOP NLS is found to be important          for targeting the nuclear localized MmCOP deletion          construct N to speckles rather than mediating nuclear          import Fig  On the other hand the site responsible          for speckle formation is mapped within the cytoplasmic          localization signal in AtCOP      Fig  One          explanation for these discrepancies between AtCOP and          MmCOP is that during the course of evolution the animal          and the plant COP proteins have adopted different          regulatory mechanisms and probably different          physiological and developmental functions However the          protein sequences of the three major proteinprotein          interactive domains RING Coiled coil WD repeats          are highly conserved possibly due to conserved          biochemical activity of COP in all organisms Another          possibility is that different cell types may use          completely different subcellular targeting signals It is          plausible that in some other mammalian cell types          subcellular targeting signals similar to Arabidopsis may          be used This speculation would be consistent with the          fact that the subcellular localization of AtCOP is          regulated by light only in certain types of plant cells              Furthermore the protein fragments responsible for          regulating subcellular localization of AtCOP are quite          conserved in MmCOP which may explain why the mammalian          COP when expressed in onion epidermal cells can be          regulated by light in a similar manner as AtCOP              However the same nuclear translocation signal of AtCOP          has been used in all plant cell types examined               which argue against the later hypothesis                            Conclusions        In this study we cloned the fulllength mouse and human                COP cDNAs Furthermore we        demonstrated that mammalian COP is associated with        ubiquitinated proteins in vivo and itself a substrate of        ubiquitination Finally through subcellular localization        studies we identified a unique type of nuclear import        signal and a classic nuclear export signal within the        Nterminal region of mammalian COP which might be        important for regulation of the mammalian COP        activity                    Methods                  DNA constructs          To obtain the fulllength           MmCOP cDNA an EST clone GenBank          accession number AI

into the same          sites of pBlueScript II KS  The resulting construct          was further digested with NotI and PstI and combined with          a NotIPstI fragment containing the remaining cterminal          portion of a previously described           MmCOP cDNA clone GenBank          accession number AF     resulting in          pKSCOP To generate pEGFPCOP pKSCOP was digested
