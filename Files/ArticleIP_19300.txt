                                                                              SlateGoes Free                        Almost a year ago                  Slate                began charging a subscription fee for access to most of ourcontents and services Effective today all current editorial content will befree Email deliveries our weekly printout edition The Fray and TheCompost the                   Slate                archive will still be available tosubscribers only and we will be adding new subscriber benefits Currentsubscribers will get a special offer for continuing under the new arrangementIf youre not satisfied with it we will happily refund the balance of yoursubscription Well happily is an exaggeration But we do appreciate thefolks whove put their  on the line and we dont want anyone to feelcheated or abused by this new subscription policy                           FREQUENTLY ASKEDQUESTIONS                                       Q New subscription policy my Aunt SallyWho are you trying to kid Youre obviously backing down                        A No no you seetheres always been a mix of free and paid stuff  were justchanging the mix  OK OK sure Were backing down                           Q Why                        A In a nutshell it nowlooks as if its going to be easier to sell ads but harder to sellsubscriptions than we thought a year ago Ten to  people visit our free areasevery month for each one paying subscriber Thats counting a reader just onceno matter how often he or she visits Its painful to think of turning away somany                   Slate                readers from so much of our contentnot to mentionthe potential readers who dont come in the first place The spreadsheetwizards figure that ad revenue from the increased traffic will more thancompensate for the lost subscriptions                           Q Well duh Everybody said youcant charge for content on the Internet Information wants to be free Unlessits about sex or stocks But oh no you knew better Youd show the worldYoud charge for news digests for political analysis for culturaldiscussions for poetry fr Chrissake Dont you feel likejerks                        A Not really OK maybea bit But look This is terra incognita We never claimed to have found theone true path We tried one thing now were trying something else and wellkeep trying until we figure it out Although we are owned by a rich companybecoming financially selfsustaining remains a crucial goal And its not as ifanyone else has figured it out either Let him or her with a Webzine thatsbreaking even cast the first stone And going to break even next yeardoesnt count Every moneylosing magazine in history is going to break evennext year                           Q But clearly at least in hindsight yougot something wrong What was it                        Clearly yes It may just have been that we were tooearly There is too much free stuff out there the process of paying andaccessing what you paid for is too clumsy and unfamiliar and so on Some ofthis may change But we also may have missed a couple of more fundamentaltruths about the Web One concerns readers and one concerns advertisers            Web readers surf  They go quickly from siteto site If they really like a particular site they may visit it often butthey are unlikely to devote a continuous halfhour or more to any one site theway you might read a traditional paper magazine in one sitting This appears tobe in the nature of the Web and not something that is likely to change And itmakes paying for access to any particular site a bigger practical andpsychological hurdle            Web advertisers meanwhile dont seem to place anyspecial value on reaching paying subscribers That was a bit surprising sincetraditional magazine advertisers usually require paying subscribersEven profitable magazines often spend more money finding and signing upsubscribers than those subscribers will ever pay But if they just gave themagazine away advertisers would lose interest            Why doesnt this apply onthe Web Probably because Web advertisers pay on the basis of ads served Ifyou buy an ad in a print magazine with a  circulation you have no wayof knowing how many of those readers actually saw your ad But if they paid forthe magazine you at least have some assurance that they picked it up On theWeb that assurance is unnecessary If you buy  ad impressions on                  Slate                you know that your ad has been put on someones computerscreen  times This is a great selling point for Web advertising but itradically changes the economics of charging for subscriptions                           Q Isnt this change a sign that youregetting desperate that Microsoft is losing interest that youre about tofold that the end is nigh strange and dreadful diseases are about to ravagethe population the stock market is going to tank Linda Tripp will get her ownTV talk show and so on                        A For heavens sakeyou made the same sort of dire predictions when we started charging forcontent a year ago We have had nothing but support from the company both ingeneral and for every stage of our ongoing experiment One benefit of makingour current content free is that                   Slate                will be able toparticipate more fully in the new Microsoft portal site msncom                           Q Do you promise this is the last bigchange in Slate that youll put us through                        A Absolutely not Thisis an adventure Thanks for joining us on it                           Q One final question What does Bill haveto say about this                        A Its true we approached the CEO with sometrepidation and his initial reaction was not encouraging He turned to hisguard dogs and said Neukom Herbold Kill But then he said Wait Whatwill happen to that Emily Yoffe who writes the column about the tabloidsShell get many new readers we explained And Dear Prudence andEdelsteins movie reviews and all those email backandforths Ditto dittoditto we replied            OK he said turning to his caninephysiotherapist Ballmer call off the dogs Give them some print magazine toeat instead They just love the Economist
