                    Introduction        Although juvenile rheumatoid arthritis JRA is the most        common cause of disability in children its etiology is        unknown Immune dysregulation appears to play a key        pathogenic role as circulating autoantibodies are common        in patients with certain JRA clinical subtypes                  Two recent studies have shown a highly significant        association between earlyonset pauciarticular JRA and        circulating antibodies to the kDa nuclear protein DEK             Although circulating DEK antibodies have        subsequently been found in children and adults with other        autoimmune diseases      these two studies did        reveal that children with JRA are significantly more likely        to have antiDEK antibodies than are children without        rheumatic disease Children with pauciarticularonset JRA        were also significantly more likely to have antiDEK        antibodies than were children with polyarticularonset or        systemiconset JRA or other rheumatic diseases Among        children with pauciarticular JRA DEK autoantibodies were        significantly more common in those with JRAassociated        uveitis than in those without eye disease      DEK        reactivity was also found to be strongly associated with        onset of any JRA subtype before age  years            DEK is a nuclear protein that is not structurally        related to any known family of proteins             Although it may also participate in DNA replication and RNA        processing      we have identified DEK as a        DNAbinding protein that recognizes the TGrich peri         ets pets regulatory element in the        human immunodeficiency virus type  HIV enhancer            The pets site is important in mediating HIV enhancer        stimulation in activated T cells and monocytes              suggesting that DEK may play an immunomodulatory role as        it participates in transcriptional activation through this        and related sites        Observed sequence similarity between the DEKbinding        site in HIV and the highly conserved Ybox regulatory        element in MHC class II gene promoters pointed to the Y box        as one possible related site NFY binding to the MHC class        II gene Y box anchors a complex assembly of nuclear        proteins that occupies several regulatory elements over a        great distance       In the         DQA promoter Y box a reverse CCAAT        motif with a partially overlapping TGrich sequence shares        sequence identity with the HIV DEKbinding site at  of         positions Fig  In the         DQA allele which is highly        associated with predisposition to autoimmune disease                the Y box contains a singlenucleotide        polymorphism that reduces sequence identity to  of         positions We hypothesized that DEK could bind in a        sequencespecific manner to the Ybox motifs in the        promoter regions of several class II MHC genes and that        gene and allelespecific Ybox polymorphisms could affect        DEK binding activity In this study we examine the        characteristics of DEK binding to the Ybox sequences of         DQA DQA DRA DQB  and         DRB  We also confirm participation        of DEK with NFY in the         DQA Ybox binding complex and        localize specific DEK binding within this sequence As the        Ybox promoter element is crucial to the regulation of MHC        class II gene expression sequencespecific binding to this        motif indicates a potential role for DEK in modulating        normal and abnormal immune response                    Materials and methods                  Cell culture and preparation of nuclear

                    Results                  Ybox binding activity in nuclear extracts is gene          and allelespecific          The similarity of the           DQA Ybox sequence to the          HIV DEKbinding site see Fig  first led us to          investigate whether DEK in nuclear extracts binds to MHC          class II Ybox regulatory elements           in vitro  With a doublestranded          oligonucleotide probe containing the           HLADQA Ybox sequence EMSAs          revealed similar binding activity in nuclear extracts          from B lymphoid Namalwa T lymphoid Jurkat CEM          monocytoid U and HeLa cell lines Fig  and in          nuclear extracts from SKW  B lymphoid KG T          lymphoid and HL monocytoid cell lines not shown          Electrophoretic patterns with a probe corresponding to          the           DQA Ybox sequence which          diverges from the           DQA Ybox sequence by a          single base pair within the highly conserved reverse          CCAAT sequence appear to vary with the cell type and          binding appears weaker than with the           DQA probe see Fig           Competition EMSAs demonstrated sequencespecificity of          the           DQA Ybox binding activity          Fig a Unlabeled           DQA oligonucleotides          successfully competed for strong binding activity seen in          nuclear extracts from the Namalwa B cell line Fig a          lanes  and  whereas unlabeled           DQA Ybox sequence competed          less well Fig a lanes  and  There was no          competition when the Ybox reverse CCAAT motif was          mutated at all five positions Fig a lanes  and           nor with the unrelated HIV B sequence lane  DEK          has been shown to bind to the HIV pets site              but oligonucleotides containing this sequence also failed          to compete significantly lane  suggesting that          factors other than DEK play a role in determining the          specificity of this complex In particular NFY is the          predominant nuclear factor binding to the Y box              and the HIV pets site does not contain the reverse          CCAAT sequence required for NFY binding          The consensus            HLADRA  Ybox sequence differs          from the           HLADQA Y box by a single          nucleotide immediately  of the reverse CCAAT pentamer          this singlenucleotide polymorphism significantly changes          the electrophoretic pattern Fig b in comparison with          that seen with the           HLADQA probe           HLADQA oligonucleotide also          competes poorly with the consensus Ybox probe for          binding Fig b lanes  Divergence of the           HLADQA Ybox sequence at one          position within the required NFY binding site reduces          its ability to compete with the           DRA Ybox probe Fig b lanes           as much as does mutation of all five nucleotides          within the CCAAT sequence Fig b lanes                           Both DEK and NFY participate in the HLADQAYbox          binding complex          Participation of both DEK and NFY in the           DQA Ybox binding complex was          confirmed by using hightiter antiDEK antiserum gift of          W Szer     and monoclonal antibody to the NFYA          subunit of the Ybox binding factor gift of JPY Ting          to further retard the mobility of the           DQA Ybox binding complex          supershifting Fig  lanes  Preincubation of          Namalwa cell nuclear extracts with antibodies to NFYA          also retards the binding complex Fig  lane           leaving a residual band arrow which can be attributed          to distinct DEK binding activity Preincubation with both          antibodies results in further retardation of the binding          complex to form a doublet Fig  lane  The same          electrophoretic patterns were seen after preincubation of          nuclear extracts from the CEM T lymphocytoid cell line          with antiDEK and antiNFYA antibodies data not          shown                          Recombinant DEK protein binds in a          sequencespecific manner to the DQAY box but not to the          DRAconsensus Y box          Having established that DEK and NFY in nuclear          extracts participate in the           HLADQA binding complex we          used recombinant fulllength DEK rDEK to determine          whether it alone can bind to Ybox motifs and to examine          how gene and allelespecific sequence polymorphisms          alter its binding The           HLADQA Ybox sequence does          bind rDEK specifically with unlabeled probe sequence          competing successfully for binding Fig a lanes           In contrast despite its identity at  of  positions          unlabeled consensus            DRA  Ybox sequence Fig a          lanes  competes very poorly against the           HLADQA Ybox probe           DQA Ybox sequence Fig a          lanes  competes only slightly less well than does           DQA  indicating that a          change in the residue at position  does not prevent rDEK          binding Mutation of the reverse CCAAT sequence however          eliminates effective competition for binding to the           DQA Ybox sequence Fig a          lanes  Taken together these results indicate that          substitution of adenine at position  in the           DQA Y box for guanine in the          consensus Ybox sequence significantly strengthens DEK          binding as do bases at positions  and  in the reverse          CCAAT sequence          Further characterization of rDEK binding to the          polymorphic           DQA Ybox sequence and to the          consensus            HLADRA  Ybox sequence          establishes a relative hierarchy of DEK binding activity          Fig b With the           DQA probe unlabelled           DQA sequence Fig b lane           competed less well than did unlabelled probe DRA Y          box sequence Fig b lane  and CCAAT mutant sequence          not shown did not compete for binding Inability of the                    HLADRA Ybox sequence to compete          with the           DQA probe again indicates the          relative importance of the adenine residue immediately           to the reverse CCAAT for DEK binding With the           DRA Ybox sequence as probe Fig          b lanes  the unlabelled probe sequence competes          less well than do any of the other Ybox sequences          suggesting that rDEK alone binds to this sequence          nonspecifically and with low affinity                          Quantitative assessment of rDEK binding to related          DQand DR Ybox sequences          Quantification of the apparent dissociation constant          K           dapp  for rDEK binding to related          class II MHC Ybox motifs validates the relative          hierarchy of DEK binding activity described above and          further emphasizes the contribution of genespecific          Ybox polymorphisms to DEK binding activity As shown in          Table  DEK binds more strongly to Ybox sequences in          either           DQA allele than it does to any of          the other           DR  or           DQ related Ybox sequences It          binds least well to the           DRA consensus Ybox motif with a          K           dapp that is approximately five          times that for the           DQA sequences The K           dapp for DEK binding to           DQB is approximately four times          that for the           DQA sequences whereas the K           dapp for DEK binding to the           DRB Ybox sequences especially the                    DRB alleles associated with the DR          haplotype are intermediate between the two extremes          Once again the AtoG substitution at position  in the          Y box appears to strengthen DEK binding to the           DQA Y box in comparison with the           DRA Y box allelic variation in the          nucleotide at position  in the Ybox sequence as in           DQA and in the DRassociated                    DRB Ybox sequence may also          mediate subtle differences in DEK binding to otherwise          identical sites Genespecific sequence polymorphisms          outside the Y box per se could also explain why          dissociation constants differ where Ybox sequences are          identical as in the           DQB and           DRB consensus motifs                          Localization of DEK binding within the Y box          DNase I footprinting with recombinant protein further          defined the physical interaction between DEK and the           HLADQA Ybox element Fig           Using the noncoding strand as probe consistent          protection is seen over the G at position  which is          polymorphic in the           DQA allele AforG          substitution and in the DRB alleles associated with the          DR haplotype CforG substitution Consistent          protection is also seen at position  adjacent to the          AforG substitution that diverges from the Ybox          consensus sequence although there is no protection of          the divergent base itself at position  DNase I          protection by recombinant DEK extends over the length of          the Ybox sequence including bases within the NFY          binding site reverse CCAAT sequence again suggesting          that the two proteins may interact                            Discussion        All antigenpresenting cells upregulate MHC class II        transcription in response to immune stimulation We have        previously shown that activation of promyeloid cells causes        dephosphorylation of DEK and diminished DEK binding to the        HIV long terminal repeat       In this study we        show that rDEK can bind to the         DQA Y box and that DEK in nuclear        extracts participates in the         DQA Ybox binding complex         in vitro  Thus we propose a model        in which intracellular signaling modulates the ability of        DEK to bind DNA causing alteration of MHC class II        transcription Transient transfection experiments in        cultured cell lines have not proved useful in examining        this model for DEK is highly expressed in most cells of        hematopoietic lineage and further overexpression has        resulted in apparently nonspecific downregulation of        transcriptional activity as might be predicted from            For this reason we are currently pursuing other        experimental approaches        The         DQA promoter region QAP         in which a singlebasepair polymorphism in the Y box        significantly diminishes transcriptional activity            is a component of the socalled susceptibility haplotype        for autoimmune disease The         DQA allele is strongly        associated with earlyonset pauciarticular JRA in Northern        European populations     and with increased risk for        juvenile dermatomyositis    and Sjgrens syndrome with        high autoantibody production      In our proposed        model aberrant class II MHC regulation could result from        altered DEK binding andor interaction with NFY and        aberrant class II expression may alter or enhance        reactivity against DEKderived or other self peptides The        Cterminal region of DEK which contains the putative        DNAbinding domain appears to be most antigenic           and K Sitwala and DM Markovitz unpublished observations        raising the possibility that altered DNA binding may expose        other masked epitopes Development of antibodies to DEK        could even be a primary event in the pathogenesis of JRA        with disruption of nuclear events due to penetration of        antiDEK antibodies into living cells     It remains        to be determined whether antiDEK antibodies are directly        involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease or if        they result from generally enhanced immunoreactivity                    Conclusion        Three specific findings in this report support a        potential role for DEK as a transcriptional modulator of        MHC class II expression One is that DEK binds to the         HLADQA Y box in a sequencespecific        manner Another is that NFY and DEK both participate in        the HLADQA Ybox binding complex which coordinates        DQ protein expression Finally DEK binds differentially to        specific Ybox sequences found in         HLADQA and          alleles and         HLADRA  consistent with        observations of         DQA genespecific cellsurface        expression    and allelespecific promoter activity            The specificity of rDEK binding to these and other        related Ybox sequences including         HLADQB and         HLADRB alleles associated with the        DR haplotype may correlate with a predisposition to        autoimmune disease seen with certain HLA haplotypes                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        bp  base pairs EMSA
