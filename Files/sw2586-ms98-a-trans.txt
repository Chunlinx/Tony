           so do you fish   oh yeah my dad has a lake cabin and so we go there for the small lake uh just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area it takes us about three hours to get there and we go and we fish and we catch a bunch of junk  nothing nothing to talk about for the most part but its fun   uh from a boat or from shore   from the dock from shore   oh thats nice uh mostly catfish or   oh mostly we catch carp if were doing good we catch a catfish or two once in a while and you know we go ahead and eat those but weve never caught enough to really have what youd call a fish fry what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh you know put it in a bag and freeze it and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when theres just a couple people instead of a whole crowd usually theres a pretty good crowd there so we dont ever catch enough to eat carp is usually pretty much fun because ive caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line and that thats a pretty good fight so thats a lot of fun   yeah a real light line real light rig well that sounds like fun   yeah they fight hard   fish in Colorado so different than that mostly trout   yeah   in the mountains   yeah and in the rivers and stuff   yeah yeah mountain streams and rivers   are they good to eat   uh yeah very yeah there isnt much there you know   oh you mean size wise theyre not very big   um by and large no but but theyre big fun   yeah well ive been is that mostly uh fly fishing when youre doing that or are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber   what i i im a fly fisherman   yeah   yeah i i cast a ways im not highly proficient but its fun   ive never even tried that my if i dont have a reel with a button on it i tend to get so much backlash its not worth the trouble   well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then youre not casting a weight on the end of the line   uhhuh   youre casting the weight of the line   with the little thing on the end yeah i thought it had a weight   yeah well the fly on the end weighs nothing it weighs less than the line   oh   so what you do is you strip off oh four five six little rolls coils of line into your hand   uhhuh   and you whip the line   hum   as you whip it over your head or side to side   uhhuh   you slowly feed out more and more   hum so youre fishing downstream so it will carry some   well no no you fish upstream   oh you fish upstream   right and then you let it carry it downstream   uhhuh   and then you reel it in and you do it again   you hope that they think its a bug and   yeah exactly jump at it   and eat it yeah   uh from what im seeing and hearing and all the the big pattern thats really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern   thats a fish   no no it it looks like a grub yeah okay whenever you yeah a lure a fly   oh its a its a lure i see   whenever you have a something that looks like something else   uhhuh   and its a fly you call it a pattern   oh   all right uh you know theres bumble bee patterns   uhhuh   theres excuse me uh theres bumble patterns theres mosquito patterns theres wasp patterns theres grub patterns uh   um did someone just come up with this design and and youre going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it   uh you can buy them uh ive got some and   uhhuh   they seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall   oh its just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year huh   yeah yeah you know how that changes   um   the phase of the moon and   i guess so we tend to use just bait and a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait   yeah yeah i i yeah im from west Texas   oh are you where are you from oh im from Midland   yeah Lubbock oh another west Texan   i went to college at Tech so youve been out to Buffalo Gap fishing   yeah yeah   yeah ive been up there   it   i didnt catch anything but ive been up there   it its kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day   yeah its fun its lazy take a picnic lunch i used to do that with my dad every once in a while wed go out on a Saturday and just spend the day before it got too hot   yeah its well there you fish mornings and evenings   yeah  yeah we do most of our fishing at night   and nights yeah   just from the heat of it all thats one advantage youve certainly got on us   it at times gets incredibly hot here   it does ive only been up there once in the summer well no ive been up there twice in the summer but both times it was really pleasant in fact it snowed on us in in gosh when was that we were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of June it was just before July fourth   June oh   and it was twenty eight twenty nine degrees we were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags not knowing any better  and here it went and it froze and it snowed on us we did not know what to do about it   yeah fishing is not just just dragging fish out of the water its its a total experience you know getting out in nature and   yeah   hearing the crickets and listening to the birds and seeing the squirrels and camping out and eating out of doors and   uhhuh do you yeah do you have to do you wear waders when you fish   uh i probably ought to i just freeze   oh goodness it must be a little bit cold   yeah yeah well you know ankle deep or standing on the bank and slipping it out there   thats cold water around there   slipping it out there   um   you know i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it out there and   do you have any oh i see   you know how it is the waters kind of   yeah and you get you get a little more carried away with it and you move a little closer   and then youre in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and the next thing you know your knees are wet   yeah do you have any kids that you take fishing   uh got a stepdaughter shes real sweet and uh   uhhuh   at times she enjoys it at times not and   yeah   a fuzzy little dog   i have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old and the little one of course is could care less the uh three and a half year old has just gotten to the point we got him a little pole last year and just put uh   ah yeah yeah   his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up  that was what he considered fishing  this year hes gotten to where he can we we were at a friends uh stock pond we were out at their farm and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we walked we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish and he started trying to cast it   yeah yeah   so he he was kind of getting there but hes   yeah you guys sure want to be out of range   hes at a dangerous point right now he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction its going to go in   it takes time yeah last year we had a oh just a wonderful trip up to Trappers Lake oh it was cold and rain the whole time and   yeah   we still had a good time out of the deal   yeah well thats good   uh and Colorado is a beautiful place to live   oh yeah my husband would like to live there but i dont know all of our family is here so   well and youve got to have youve got to work for a living to   well yeah but TI is up there so  that part of it would probably work out   what division yall in   im sorry what   what division are yall in   were both uh i was uh military but hes division three it goes back and forth Division well maybe division one right now hes in computers   oh   so and hes in school and everything else i have some friends who work up there   well the only thing up here is division one oh yeah   Kathy and Kevin Guy   okay yeah   yeah and they like to fish theyve been inviting us to come up there in the summer her dad has a cabin and they go fishing up there   oh fishings fishing is fun up here its not   so that would be neat to try it some time   it seems like the success ratio the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there but it is fun you know it   yeah long as you have a good time thats the main point so   the the experience is is better up here i think you know it seems more relaxing theres more to look at   uhhuh definitely more to look at   and and theres something about listening to water run thats relaxing to the soul   yeah   you know if youre if youre just sitting on a nice hot lake   yeah the only thing youve got to watch is when that creek comes up we camped next to one one time when we were there a couple of summers ago and we figured we were up a long way off and then it rained that night and we thought well wonder how far off we are and we got up the next day and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away and its like oh well maybe we ought to move just a touch so that was kind of funny     yeah it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden   yeah i just love the way it looks i could almost just watch the water we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there i mean it was one time we were there and i guess it was late May so it was really your spring almost you know at even though it was it was really summer down here and and the i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt and the creek was just wild just running   uhhuh   and and all the white water and noise and the it was just beautiful   yeah it it gets foamy foamy almost and you know its just pure and pristine   uhhuh yeah   and the froth and
