                                 Analyze This                        Dear Judith            Jesus H Christ How many thoughts can you squeeze into a single email            I want to tell you a story One day in late  I was hanging around theWestchester federal courthouse waiting for another of John A Gottisinterminable pretrial hearings to begin when I bumped into Gottis friendAngelo Ruggiero Jr Fat Angie I think they call him Fat Angie is the son ofAngelo QuackQuack Ruggerio who got his nickname because he talked too muchinto government wires Ruggerio the Son is a nice guy not too smart maybebut nice and we made small talk about his Filas            There was in fact not much I needed to know from Angelo But I did haveone question Why did he and his buddyboy John eat so often at Cracker BarrelThis was one of the amazing true facts I uncovered about Junior Gotti some mobreporters uncover complex union kickback scams I expose the secret dininghabits of pathetic goombahs What I asked Angelo was this Why would anItalianAmerican heir to the greatest cuisine on the planet stoop to eatchickenfried steak at a redneck restaurant chain Angelo looked at meshrugged his shoulders and said I dont know I mean how much Italian foodcan you eat            Your emailand the cultural elites obsession with the TheSopranos reminds me of Angies profound comment What I mean is how muchCultureboxstyle commentary about The Sopranos can the public eat            I know what youre thinking Youre thinking Hey I got your Cultureboxright here you fuckin mook you            I also know Im as guilty as anyone of overhyping The Sopranos  Ijust recently wrote that The Sopranos is the best TV show ever            So please dont think for a second that I dont want to hear your theoriesI have always counted on you for all of that hermeneutics and semiotics anddianetics and other really dope Lingua Franca shit Its just that Ifear that too much in the way of highend yammering about The Sopranosand its profound meaning will cause a backlash against the show Expectationsare just too ridiculously high ie the comparison to Alexander Nevsky in theTimes  etc I think the producers would have been smart tointentionally lower expectations over the past six months by leaking storiesabout massive attacks of writers block on the set And David Chase theseries creator should have killed off Livia Soprano not that I dont loveNancy Marchand when he had the chance But more on that later            Whoa I think I just hinted at my opinion of the new season No way Imshowing you mine until you show me yours            Let me address your pet theories I agree with most everything youve saidor at least everything you said that I understood except that I wouldntcharacterize any part of Goodfellas as a jaunty laughfest            I think youve got one thing exactly right The Sopranos works sowell precisely because it is understated because it is the opposite of theoperatic Godfather  Together The Godfather and TheSopranos make up some kind of whole but heres the fundamental differencebetween them Every mobster Ive ever met imagines himself a player in TheGodfather  I interviewed Sammy Gravano a few weeks ago and he said as muchThe Godfather invested the lives of mobsters who are in fact seedy andboring characters with honor and drama            But I havent talked to a single mobster who would take Tony Sopranos lifeover Michael Corleones Were only one season into The Sopranos  soits a bit too early to say if this particular manifestation of mob art isinfluencing mob life but I think its fair to say that no one in actualorganized crime would ever want to be hooked up with Tony Sopranos crew            In a way I think Ive just answered the interesting question youve posednamely how realistic is The Sopranos  Very Id say Not being anactual mobster to my everlasting regret my assessment might be worth bupkusas the hysterical Silvio Dante would say but The Sopranos accuratelycaptures the desperation of todays mobsters The smarter wise guys know thatthey are the tracksuitwearing equivalents of one of those prehistoric tribesliving in the Orinoco River Basin just waiting for extinction            I was talking to David Chase a couple of weeks ago am I just the mostinsufferable mobrelated namedropper or what and we got to talking abouthis use of humor What Chase evidently realized and what Coppola didntClemenza aside is that reallife mobsters can be quite funnyselfconsciouslyfunnyin a non slapsticky non Analyze This  sort of way Knowing thismakes The Sopranos seem real to me Todays mobsters too are fluent inpsychobabble and in the language of selfimprovement and Chase of coursecaptures this beautifully I will disagree with you on one thing at the outsetthe writing on The Sopranos is better than the acting not that theresanything really wrong with the acting            By the way can we also talk about how badly Analyze This sucked            Im going to sign off for the moment but first I wanted to tell you I thinkyou ought to have a mob moniker at least for the week How about JudithLittle Herring Shulevitz            Also a question for your consideration Do you think mob movies are deadThe genres tired obviously but is The Sopranos a sign of newlife            Also tell me what you think of the new season already Inquiring minds wantto know            Jeff Fuckin Mook Goldberg
