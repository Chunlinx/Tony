        okay i guess were ready to go uh what are your favorite types of restaurants   okay we enjoy uh various types of restaurants uh theres some excellent Italian restaurants here theres some good Cajun cooking of course theres always steak   and barbecue right   and barbecue right   uh do you eat out quite frequently   oh not as  much as we used to but uh still at least about once a week   really and wheres the last place that you went to eat   lets see we ate at Louisiana Purchase up in Plano just recently we had a craving for catfish and uh they have some good catfish there   uhhuh   and uh we enjoy theres an Italian restaurant over in Garland also called Taste of Italy i dont know if youve tried any of those theres about four of them around town   uhhuh no i havent   but its good home style Italian cooking its not the fancy veal and things that you get at some of the other Italian restaurants   umhum   they make excellent spaghetti sauce and little garlic rolls and things like that   oh   and i also recently we had Jacolya out at Addison cajun cooking   okay uh what areas do you usually eat in do you find   north Dallas and Richardson and Plano area we live out near Richardson Square Mall   oh okay   so it generally in that north side of town   do you ever get down to Deep Elm or Greenville or McKinney   yes theres an excellent uh i guess its Tai its one of the Southeast Asian type restaurants down in Deep Elm uh West Wind or   ive heard of that ive heard several people say that so it must really be i think its part Vietnamese or something   yeah yes i believe so i am really not sure exactly what style it is but its very very good now right in the edge of North Dallas there at uh Skillman just north of LBJ theres another Vietnamese type restaurant called Yolis Y O L I S   umhum okay   which uh serves some excellent food too in that in that style of food   so what would   its not a fancy place ive eaten their lunch primarily   uhhuh  um so what is your favorite restaurant in Dallas   oh thats hard to say but the ones that we like most are out of business now but   unfortunately everyone else didnt like them quite as well right     um right but Papillon is one we go back to quite frequently for uh continental style cooking   we havent tried that one i uh we belong to the Passbook uh Club   oh right umhum   and so we tend to use their coupons whenever possible and i know thats in there and id like to get over there   i think you would enjoy it its a tad on the expensive side uh probably run uh with dinner and uh some drinks about twenty five thirty dollars a person   well when you have a half price coupon its not quite so bad then   it helps quite a bit right yes we have used some of the coupons also at some of the places but uh       that is i think one of our favorite our our most most favorite restaurant was LaLouve which was here on uh in north just off of Central Expressway in north Dallas but thats been gone several years now   umhum uh well its just a shame all the restaurants that you know open and close you seems you go to one and find one thats your favorite and the next thing you know its gone   its gone right its   well i heard that there are more restaurants per capita in Dallas than there are in New York   that doesnt surprise me   i know its theyre everywhere people eat out in Dallas like i have never seen   yeah well we weve enjoyed it the thereve been some excellent restaurants here through the years and of course some go up some go down and uh it just depends on the chef in some cases of course   yes have you been to the new Sonny Bryans down in uh uh West the West End   no i havent uh havent been to that one   well i have not been to the old one for that matter but i thought that since theres a new one opening perhaps itd be easier to get into   yeah yeah well again the the old Sonny Bryans up there by uh what is it by uh Methodist Hospital   is it like over on Lemmon or something okay   up on Inwood uh yeah that one is not really its its its a its a barbecue stand really its not really a restaurant   well thats what i understand you sit at school tables or out on the hood of your car and umhum   thats right they make some really good barbecue there   well thats fine for the summer but i dont think id be too interested in the winter   right but uh i used to live work over on just off of Stemmons and wed go over there about once a week for barbecue for lunch   uhhuh   but uh theres uh oh theres a lots of good restaurants here i think the really hard thing is you want fresh seafood of course uh were a little bit away from the coast not as far as Kansas but   umhum well im from Saint Louis so believe me it was harder to get in Saint Louis than it is here   youre right yeah yeah but uh for seafood just all around good eating seafood Vincents has some really good seafood   you know i go by that place all the time over on Midway   yeah well theres several theres one in Plano one on Midway theres one over by Love Field i think   all right   there are three or four of them here in town and weve gone to the one over on Midway and also to the one up in Plano matter of fact lets see we were there New Years Eve at the one on Plano   umhum       well have to try that sometime because uh   yeah i think youd really enjoy it   well we went to or i i went to Ralph and Kacoos for lunch one day and ive heard good and bad about that The Guide always reviews it very poorly   uhhuh yeah   but what i had and then uh the two guys i went to lunch with they both let me taste what they had and it was delicious   yeah we had dinner there we have a group of friends we go out once a month with and we had dinner at Ralph and Kacoos last fall i think   umhum   and we were there and it was excellent the night that we were there   well you know how these restaurant reviewers are   oh yeah   i think their tastes are jaded   it depends on whether they got  the meal or not   yeah right       well i guess we probably have talked about our five minutes worth   i think we have i certainly enjoyed talking with you     well and ive also written down the Taste of Italy well have to try that sometime   uh youll have to try it dont expect anything fancy   thats all right with me   its home style food its not expensive and uh get the dinner salad with the olives on it   okay and do they have good lasagna   so yes my wife swears by the lasagna   okay okay okay okay because thats my husbands favorite   yeah they have excellent lasagna and if you get like spaghetti with uh get with the Italian sausage it taste like home made Italian sausage youd get in Chicago   okay great   yeah   thanks for the tip  byebye   thank you byebye
