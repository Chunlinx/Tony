                                 Triumph of the Middlebrow                        This book comes with a triumphant blaring of publishers trumpets and onesupposes that it is a signal sort of triumph for black studies or Africanastudies take your pick of names The field has arrived to such an extent thata publisher thinks that it can make money significant money publishing such awork Assignments in black studies have filtered down to the highschooljuniorhigh and even elementaryschool level and remember the blackliturgical occasions we now have on the calendar that beg for specialschoolchild reports of one sort or another the King holiday Black HistoryMonth Black Music Month Kwanzaa Malcolm Xs birthday Juneteenth and whilenot every school does all of this most schools must do some of this Andthis of course has nothing to do with the occasional racial killing or majorprotest that took place or may be taking place somewhere that require a reportand discussion in a currentevents or socialstudies class Moreover blackscannot be left out of Womens History Month or Veterans Day or for the trulydaring Gay Appreciation Month So a book like Africana is bound to geta great deal of use to be sold to virtually every school public anduniversity library in the country as well as to a number of churches to saynothing of the private homes that will have a copy right next to theBritannica  In some more Afrocentric black homes it may replace theBritannica entirely that Eurocentric collection of lies althoughBritannica has become as multicultural as everyone else these daysThose of us who have labored in the field of black studies politicallyincorrectly such as the present author or very much politically correctly likea good many very good scholars are heartened by this commercial ventureIndeed it would be disheartening as well as entirely untrue if one were tothink that this book was published as an act of philanthropy as something thatought to be done It is so tiresome as a black person to be the recipient ofcharity all the time to be the object of the moral imperative            It is good to know that partly through the energetic offices of Henry LouisGates black studies can as it were pay its way these days and not bedependent for its existence on a kind of political and cultural moralism on thepart of whites and a kind of fetishlike piety on the part of blacks It can bealas a business of an entirely good sort or needful sort justifying itself inthe marketplace But I would think that most blackstudies scholars are onlypartly heartened by this for this rather triumphalist book and Gates isimportant in black studies in part for the promotion of a triumphalist viewof black history and black cultureglobally speakingwhich is why he is hatedby Afrocentrists who take a somewhat different view of the longterm meaning ofthe coming of the white man is nothing less than the middlebrow arrival ofblack studies in American culture Encyclopedias after all are middlebrowbourgeois books that tend in the end not to promote intellectual inquiry onthe part of the people who use them but rather to stifle it Children tend tocopy verbatim from such books without ever reading what they are copyingAdults with far too much deference for the printed word tend to consult sucha book in much the way they consult the dictionary or the Bible or in the waybaseball fanatics consult the official record books as the final arbiter asthat which settles all arguments Why for goodness sake would anyoneactually read a book like this Knowledge in the instance of the definitivereference book becomes entombed and sanctified very much serving theantiintellectual ends of the middlebrow who want not to encounter knowledgeand to wrestle with it but to store it as an authority on the bookshelf            But I suppose it is something of a triumph which the publication of thisbook is meant to acknowledge that black studies has achieved middlebrow statusin the United States that bourgeois people both white and black feel bad ifthey dont know something about the history and culture of Africandescendedpeople in much the same way they feel bad inadequate if they dont knowsomething about opera or a bit about Impressionist painting or if they havenever seen a film by D W Griffith or Fritz Lang How terrible at a party todiscover that one has never seen The Grand Illusion one of the alltimegreat filmsor that one has not read alas a Toni Morrison novel or one doesnot own a Wynton Marsalis album The truly knowing coves own albums byThelonious Monk and John Coltrane no less and do reports for their book clubson the blues What most thinking people in black studies find dangerous aboutthe middlebrow apotheosis of the field is that it usually leads to theenshrinement of what Jacques Barzun calls thoughtclichs halftruths ornontruths that are accepted as the truth because someone said so in somereference book like Africana  Thoughtclichs are like narcotics peoplelove them because they relieve them of the very thing they do not wish to do inany case that is think think hard and think critically and against thegrain of their own beliefs or psychological needs or neurotic fantasyprojections Thoughtclichs confirm ones stupidity and ones laziness Withall the goodwill in the world a book like Africana cannot help butproduce thoughtclichs it is indeed why most people will consult such awork to find them and be comforted by them No intellectual or scholar cantherefore be fully at ease with a work of this sort no matter his or herideological stripe Such a book as Africana simply washes thepractitioners in the field in a sea of ambivalence with a sense of lost faithas we all stand before it a bit as Matthew Arnold stood before Dover Beach            Now Gates and Appiah published a multicultural dictionary about a year agoand Gates and Nellie McKay published the Norton Anthology of AfricanAmerican Literature shortly before that With Africana  where Gatesand Appiah rather sentimentally and opportunistically see themselves as thedescendants of Du Bois whose unfilled dream was to produce such a book Gatesseems to have cornered the market on black reference books that shape the canonof black studies that define the field and its major players Building a canonis very important to Gates and it is without question an importantpedagogical pursuit A field must have order and it must have pioneers andheroes It is also a power pursuit He who defines the field controls it in amanner of speaking Some are jealous that Gates wants this sort of powerOthers find it unseemly I think Gates is wasting his considerable talents inthe pursuit of it but that is another issue for another type of review It isamazing that Gates has done this volume so successfully and so quickly that hehas flooded the market with firstrate black reference books in such shortorder It took him and Appiah only four years to produce Africana  Evenwith modern technology that is an astonishing feat so astonishing that somewill dismiss the book I have heard some comments of this sort even before thebook was published as some halfbaked enterprise That would be a mistake forthis is an incredibly polished work This is a beautiful book one of the moststriking reference works I have ever seen Gates and Appiah must be quite thefield marshals to have hustled together this army of academics and to havegotten the work from them on time or nearly so They deserve much credit forthis Most academics would have felt lucky to have finished this enterprise in years            That Du Boiswho exists in the field of black studies these days as ratherthe black equivalent of Einstein theorist Dr Johnson wordsmith Emersonhumanist and Kant moral philosopher separately and together as itwereis evoked by the editors in their introduction provides this volume witha pedigree that I suppose they thought it needed making Gates and Appiah ourintellectual knights who have given us the Holy Grail The editors called thequest for producing a black encyclopedia a Holy Grail More triumphalisthistory The introduction offers a good and useful account of Du Bois attemptto produce an Africana encyclopedia the professional jealousy heencountered the racism that sometimes thwarted his efforts It should be readby all who purchase the book            But the history of the publication of this book is only incompletely told bythe editors After  when black studies was established on the whitecollege campus a number of reference books about the black experience werepublished and continue to be published The editors make no attempt to placetheir book within that particular context a more accurate historical contextfor understanding the appearance of this book as it was made possible not byDu Bois dream in any respect but by the rise of multiculturalism and blackstudies as intellectual industries in the United States after  Theincreasing professionalization of black studies made this book possible morescholars in the field both black and white being produced since  morescholarship being produced This book was also made possible by the rise ofprofessionalism among AfricanAmericans since the s and the rise of a blackmiddle class that has demanded more artifacts and objects more educationabout its experience more institutionalization of it in other words and moreorthodoxy about its significance that are all meant to reinforce its sense ofidentity its psychological wellbeing its sense of race mission allimportant reasons for the existence of black studies but all clearlyantiintellectual In other words the forces that brought this book intoexistence had little enough to do with Du Boisalthough evoking him is ofcritical importance to the books audience as a kind of typology about thestruggle of black people to gain selfknowledge a story that black peoplenever tire of reciting even today with a plethora of black bookshops andpublishers grinding out books on black subjects or with a black point of viewwith everincreasing regularityand a great deal to do with the shift that hastaken place within the black population of the United States in the last years and the dramatic change in its status This book is the product of both astrong movement toward the intellectualization of black experience among anelite and the antiintellectualization of black experience by the public atlarge earnest and respectful of black experience as it has now generallybecome and those who cater to the publics access to intellectual material byrounding off the rough edges and making it thoroughly antiintellectual bydesigning and evoking certain emotional markers about struggle andresistance            I shall begin my next entry with a discussion of a set of entries inAfricana  those dealing with aspects of Philadelphia my hometown and aresponse to David Nicholsons impressions of the book
