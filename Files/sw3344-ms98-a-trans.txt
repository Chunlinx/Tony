        well let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair weve got going on     i think that its time that we concentrate more on whats going on within our own borders than whats going on in the Middle East   i have to agree with you there i uh i think that uh for once we should we shouldnt even be at at these Mideast talks because with the exception of our hostages we really dont have to much of a uh a real interest we shouldnt have too much of a real interest in deciding whos land it is just let these people fight it out   i agree   you know weve got so many domestic problems and and what does it cost to keep these people over there you know   absolutely   oh so how about the uh the Soviet Union what do you thinks gonna happen there the break ups   i think thats great im im glad to see that but i again i dont want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a uh well uh not a whole lot under any circumstances because i i dont know im a im a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something its worth more to them than if you give it to them and so im im not much in favor of it but im glad to see us advising them that doesnt seem to cost a whole lot of money so   umhum thats right thats right   but im ready to have a uh President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda even if it doesnt work at least he is somebody who who is working on that problem and i i havent seen that in the last eleven years so they dont seem to have a clue   well lets see  Reagan obviously wasnt too concerned with the domestic side of of of uh his political affairs uh and i think Bushs kind of followed suit um international is important but i mean weve got a budget deficit that just wont go away unless it gets seriously addressed uh you know and then theres the homeless issue and and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without uh hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think and we wouldnt have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that were spending   oh i agree i just i i think we got once we started economic aid over seas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the  the world bank and as far as aid is concerned and i think theres a a limit and weve passed it a long time ago   right i agree weve been writing off way too many bad debts uh country bad debts   yeah thats another thing i dont understand is is is things like selling technology and uh even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt   exactly   that doesnt to me that just doesnt make any sense as as much in debt as we are   i know it   i just i i dont know i think its definitely time for a change but i dont see anybody i dont understand too why we have to have Democrats and Republicans and its its either one way or the other theres   right   it seems seems to be were turning into a black and white society you either do it this way or you do it that way and theres no in between   thats right youre either liberal or youre conservative   and that just uh it obviously isnt working   well i think uh it it wouldnt hurt and i know the Independent Partys been trying for years to get a a a real force in in the uh in Congress but uh youre right theres just too many issues that come up that uh our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because its a Democratic issue or its a Republican issue and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel   oh yeah   i think uh we might have a a lot better a lot more efficient running government and and a lot better laws passed   oh i agree with you well of course you know we have the national embarrassment in our state Jessie Helms       and uh as soon as as we can get of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he he just lines up people against him so       its not too its not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions hes uh usually on the the ninety eight to two side hes the one of the two that votes   hes one hes one of the two huh   yeah hes       very ineffective i think   well lets see uh Senators are in for six years right and uh when did you guys vote him into office   right oh unfortunately nineteen ninety   oh youre stuck   yeah were stuck with him for a       a little while longer but uh unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great so i i hate
