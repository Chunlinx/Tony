        been on the line for awhile i almost forgot what the topic was     okay um based     uh but i know what it is  uh let me see i i i i im kind of i dont know you know im im kind of in the middle i i think its a great idea   oh okay good uhhuh   but when it comes to me its like almost an insult you know so its  i ive come from the teaching field   right so do i   so so its just like i dont know i i guess i guess id have to go with uh i i id be for it   uhhuh   you know but uh you know i i i dont know its just kind of a kind of a delicate subject i guess but i i i would i would probably go for for going ahead and doing it you know if its got to be done for everyone   right i think if its got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody   right   you know when they answer the company i think itll make it a lot easier and theyd run into less problems   right yeah   because uh i dont know i come from the teaching field too and it sort of uh  its a pro and a con type i dont know where to stand on it   yeah   im more or less if they told me i had to well then fine but if you know if they made me then id probably if i had my druthers id probably say well no  you know just this   yeah yeah  you kind of goes into your privacy and   right   you know but i guess if they you know you know theres uh i i guess theres some companies that arent  that are doing it and it it seems to be working out so   uhhuh yeah i think its its what theyre basically trying to do i dont know up here in Massachusetts anyhow what theyre basically trying to do is uh oh gosh uh any people who had drug tested positively getting them into a drug program or rehab program   yeah right   and uh anybody who uh gee is you know did doesnt accept the rehab program then theyre more or less getting laid off   see thats hard   i i think thats really hard to because you know you never know i dont know its it thats a its really weird issue im sort of on the fence about it   yeah yeah   but i you know that thats whats theyre coming across as is some of the companies anyhow oh we can get you into a drug program but then you wear that stigma you know   yeah yeah   where uh like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i dont have any problems you know or something like that yeah   yeah and then i kind of hear it goes into like uh this is just something ive heard that it kind of goes into like uh just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold that it kind of affects that too   right anything with an a you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or yeah somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in you know an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test   oh i didnt know that um   i know im an epileptic so id probably test positive and   yeah see things like that so   and then id have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system you know   yeah   and a lot of times those are the things i dont like to disclose to an employer because then they dont want to have anything to do with you  you know its very personal   right right uhhuh   i wouldnt want to have it disclosed because then id always wonder if they fired me you know why did you fire me   see thats yeah thats where i kind of get into cause its just kind of gets into your personal life you know and   uhhuh   its like whats whats kind of next   yeah it it hits me as the Orwell thing Big brother is watching   the what   Orwell   huh   and you know his book Big brother is watching   oh   you know youre being controlled  that type of deal and i shy i dont really you know i dont know   yeah   seems awful strange id hate to have to  if i had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didnt id probably take the company who didnt   right yeah   because i feel thered be more trust in the employees   right   but i can understand why they need it with all the you know train accidents and everything else   so do you think theyll kind of push into the teaching field eventually i kind of think they will   uh i think they will too because uh you know its just going to follow   yeah   i dont know i we havent had any of it in our school system so uh you know hopefully we wont   yeah   we havent either oh yeah but i i i just kind of think its heading that way though you know its just  because its just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff and i just   right   i just kind of think its going to eventually head that way   well and eventually its going to be not only the teachers you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny its going to be the teachers   yeah right   and if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids   right   and then theyve you know caught everybody more   yeah
