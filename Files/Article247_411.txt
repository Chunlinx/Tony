                                 Call Guys            All three majors working the weekend agree on todays lead the decision byJanet Reno to begin the investigative process that could result in appointingan independent counsel to investigate President Clintons  electionfundraising activities This news comes on the heels of Renos decision twoweeks ago to take the same look at Al Gore            The Washington Post says the decision is based on newinformation developed by federal investigators that Clinton may have madecampaign fund solicitation calls from the White House and reports that theWhite House response is twopronged Clinton says he doesnt remember makingsuch calls and there is no clear legal precedent to show that they would beillegal anyway            The New York Timescalls the Reno decision a potential turning point in that until now theinvestigation buffeting the administration had swirled around the Oval Officebut had not touched Clinton personally            The new evidence apparently includes solicitation call sheets that wereprepared for Clinton for calls to fat cats who indisputably gave money to theDNC Whats in dispute is whether Clinton actually made the calls The NYTrefers to a call sheet for beer baron August Busch IV The WP optsinstead for ones for a Maryland businessman and for Frank Zappas widow GailThe natural assumption that all the papers had access to the same call sheetsleads to a homework assignment Does the WP or Newsweek or anyPost company television station carry Busch product ads            Only the Los Angeles Times makes the observation that puts thisdevelopment in the proper context Clinton has already been under the scrutinyof a special prosecutor for three years Remember Whitewater            Clinton wasnt informed until Saturdayhe was in California on his way to a million fundraiser which meant that the story was kept out of Fridayheadlines and newscasts But whats the gain Its dominating the Sundaypapers which in turn set the agenda for the Sunday political talk showsTheres just no escaping the news cycle anymore            The NYT runs a frontpage explanatory piece on last weeks Teamsterguilty pleas Worth doing because the case could well lead to deeper troublefor the DNC Unfortunately the piece doesnt excel at explanation True ithas the understandable problem of trying to be clear about describing schemesthat were designed to be murky but it doesnt help that the story doesnt evenbegin to explain until the th paragraph why the Teamster fundraising dealsin question were illegal and even then none too clearly Isnt the relevantlaw that the union cant donate money to either candidate and hence cantcreate schemes that do that while appearing to be donations from somebody elseAnd shouldnt the Times just say so            The WP runs a piece about the decline in the accuracy of directoryassistance information saying that the trend arises from increased competitionand hence decreased cooperation between local phone companies and ATTThey used to freely share numbers but now they charge each other through thenose The result is that ATT and many regional phone companies are nowattempting to compile their own data bases from other sources like credit cardfiles DMV records etcwith decidedly mixed results            The NYT s Editorial Notebook item about Chelsea Clintons arrivalat Stanford makes a good point If the Clintons are so concerned that the mediarespect Chelseas privacy at school then perhaps they should have let Chelseaarrive on her own attended perhaps by a handful of Secret Service agentsrather than arriving in a Presidential motorcade and trailed by hundreds ofreporters and cameramen
