controversysurrounding it but I cant remember what My friend is seeing a nutritionistwho has him following the basic premise of the Zone I am curious as well asconfused Any info Prudie would be gratefully appreciated                                       AndreaNewYork                        DearAnd            Prudie is not a fan ofdiets She prefers lowfat foods and smaller portions The trouble with dietsis that they are demanding boring and most often do not offer lastingresults The trick is to retrain oneself in terms of how one eats and to reacha new set point in ones weight            For a fast start Prudiedoes approve of diets however trendy and spas where the right foods arechosen for you This is just to permit shedding a few initial pounds to providemotivation and hope along with the feeling that one is able to achievesuccess            Prudieknows people who swear by the Zone and others who swear at it The realproblem with any prescribed diet is lack of balance and the fact that feelingdeprived leads to chocolate cake Perhaps a reliable approach is the one thelate Jacqueline Onassis is said to have used She ate whatever she feltlikeand left half of it on the plate            Prudie trimly                                             DearPrudie                                                      I have an irritation nota problem but I thought perhaps you could offer me a palliative                                       What isbehind people telling you they are going to the best doctor sometimesthe best doctor in the world in such and such a field I know there are manyfine physicians around but this seems to me to be a form of bragging How dothese people decide that their doctor is the best These pronouncements onsubjective issues annoy me no end I have yet to hear someone say they aregoing to a doctor who is kind of mediocre                                       Thank youBarbara inPhoenix                        DearBar            Prudie is in your campthough she has made her peace with this manifestation of human nature Peoplejust need to feel that their care is top of the line            WheneverPrudie hears such a declaration she basically zones out and the remark hasthe same weight as I just had the best cheese Danish            Prudie medicinally                                             DearPrudie                                                      I read your response tothe writer who wondered how he should introduce his grandmothers beau I havefound a good term for women to use gentleman caller Its very handy in theearly stages of dating because its wonderfully vaguenot to mention that itprovides an opportunity to poke fun at oneself and modern datingrituals                                       Ifthings move in a more serious direction the gentleman can be upgraded to myfella in casual conversation or for introductions my James or whateverthe appropriate name is This allows others to join in the fun by referring tothe gentleman as Soandsos James Of course while this form of addressdoes away with the confusion created by the term my friend I think youdagree that one should put off using the possessive endearment until it is trulycalled for or it will come across as treacly baby talk                                       WrylyKateWrath                        DearWry            Gentleman caller is notonly wonderfully vague but very Tennessee Williams Of course you knewthat            Prudieheartily approves of your suggestions for the relationship upgradenomenclature She is sure you have been helpful to countless people over struggling with proper designation for the beloved and is grateful for theassist            Prudie nominally                           DearPrudence                                       Why does the NationalAbortion and Reproductive Rights Action League get to drop an initial from itsacronym Why do writers and editors call it NARAL instead ofNARRAL                                       Wouldit be OK to follow this trend and refer to NOW as NO or OW Could the ABA bejust AA Are government agencies allowed to drop letters The DOJ would soundso much more hip as the Deejay And even Microsoft would project more powerand mystery if it went by M rather than the prissy feminine MS                                       X                        Dear X            It soundsas though you have time on your hands You might want to consider volunteeringat a homeless shelter            Prudie busily
