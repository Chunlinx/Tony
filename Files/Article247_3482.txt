                                 Will There Be Trouble With Harry                        Dear Polly            According to a clipping from the Daily Telegraph passed along by oureditor a gifted sorceress in her own right there are now British editions ofthe Harry Potter books designed especially for adult consumers The content isthe same of course but the grownup version cost about two pounds more thanthe kids version and I presume looks more sober and serious Twentyfivethousand have been sold I thought this was funny but then again when I wasreading these books in public places in preparation for our chat I would makesure to have a notebook and pencil and even my laptop handy to make clear tothe utterly indifferent world that I was working  which probably made melook even sillier            I take your point about kids and preaching though I think that they tend totolerate the moral if the story is good enough But then again they may learntheir morals in part from the stories they hear I do suspect you imply thatyou do too that the boomer parents who so gleefully forcefeed their kidslessonheavy humorless politically correct books seize upon the Potter novelsbecause theyre so blessedly free of didacticism Of course there are subtlewarnings against prejudice and snobbery as embodied by the odious Malfoyclan and affirmations of the virtues of honesty and friendship But there isalso ample recognition of the fact that its sometimes necessary to break therules talk back to your teachers or fling a fistful of mud at someone whopisses you off This flexible realistic moral sense coexists with reassurancesthat the important moral categories are in the end stable Good and evilexist in this world and their struggle for dominance is what makes it goaround            I agree that the books get better and better and that as you proceed fromone to the next the series acquires more richness and density of detail One ofthe neatest tricks Rowling pulls off is to make the narrative move backward andforeward at the same time Part of the drama of each installment involvesHarrys finding out something new about his parents deaths and about theworld of Hogwarts in their time Hogwarts seems to be the center of the wizardworld Not only is every wizard presumably a graduateunless we learn about arival academy in a later volumebut a surprising number of the best pupilsseem to return as teachers And there is a lovely mirroring of past andpresentan almost typological reflection between yesterday and today Harrysrivalry with Malfoy is foreshadowed by his fathers rivalry with Snape who isstill around to torment the son of his tormentor And the themes of loyaltyfriendship and betrayal that Harry uncovers in the story of his parentsdemise a story about which we still have much to learn cast their shadow onhis friendships with Hermione and Ron The petty tensions between them thatbegin to unfold in Prisoner of Azkaban may be the harbinger of somethingmore catastrophic in future books            I wondered as you did about Percy the Prefect Rons older brother whobecomes Head Boy in Azkaban  In Chamber of Secrets he beganbehaving oddly and it seemed as though he might be harboring thoughts of theDark Side And I think I hope he still may be headed there the greatcorrupting sin in this moral universe seems to be ambition which Percy clearlypossesses But so might Harry Lord Voldemort whose name is never uttered bywizards with less temerity than Harry and Dumbledore is like Darth Vader orMiltons Satan a classic rebel angel undone by his lust for power And he maydecide at some point that its better to coopt the blessed Harry than toannihilate him Dumbledores benevolent but strict theology involving theoperations of free will in a supernaturally determined world is classicallyMiltonianan odd note of Protestantism in this decidedly pagan cosmos It isalways the favorites who turn evil in this kind of story It seems to me thatHarrys final confrontation with the dark forces will have to involve hisovercoming the temptation to join them There is an inkling of this possibilityearly on when the sorting hat which places new students in their residentialhouses tries to entice Harry to join Slytherin where baddies like Snape andMalfoy hang out Harry is promised greatness if he chooses their company buthe opts for goodness and joins Gryffindor his fathers house instead            Still I suspect hell face this dilemma again before long After all Harryis not only a yearold celebrity and a favorite with the Hogwarts facultySnape excepted hes a gifted athlete on the Quidditch pitch how to explainIts the wizard pastime something like three games of lacrosse playedsimultaneously on broomsticks with magic balls and a natural leader amonghis peers His decency has for now held his pride in check but this mightshould I daresay change I dont think the series can continue to be asinteresting if the menaces he faces continue to be strictly external Thedeeper darkness is within Before long Harrys terror and revulsion atVoldemort and what he represents may be overcome by curiosity and hisveneration of his martyred parents may be colored with doubt even anger Thefact that each book so far allows him a greater measure of fallibilityandthat some characters seem to slip and slide in the twilight zone between benignand malevolent wizardrysuggests that Rowling may be aware of thesepossibilities In any case I trust her to keep us enchanted            And lets not forget that Harry has at the end of Prisoner ofAzkaban  just turned  We have four books to go and the stirrings ofpuberty cant be far off What is wizard adolescence like Adolescence of anykind is risky territory for the young adult book writer perhaps especiallyin the United States at the present time How will Rowlings handle the darkmagic of sexuality Hogwarts is coed after all and theres also the proudtradition of English boarding school
