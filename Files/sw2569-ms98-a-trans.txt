        well do you like to do your yard work   yeah this is actually a duplex that were in so and its rented   uhhuh uhhuh   were looking into buying a house but um the landlord is supposed to do the yard work although he doesnt do it any frequency every once in a while he comes around so in the meantime we have our own lawn mower and we probably do it a little more than him   uhhuh   but we dont do a whole lot since its a rental property weve added a few things like around the patio and ive tried to get a few shrubs to grow around here but since its you know rental we havent spent a whole lot of time and effort in trying to do landscaping we just kind of maintain whats here and mow the grass and trim and that kind of stuff when its needed   oh great what kind of lawn do you have   you mean the type of grass um   yeah   what kind of a grass we have  oh Saint Augustine yeah its Bermuda in the back its the kind that has those you know grows sideways yeah that stuff   oh it grows in runners right right i just love that in the middle of the summer when that gets real thick thats so nice to walk on isnt it   well the problem has been in the winter of um   yeah two winters ago   eight nine yeah a lot of it got zapped and its its slow coming back like our landlord didnt really replant any last year a lot of front lawn look looks pretty bad   yeah yeah yeah   and he didnt redo anything so its its coming back a little bit now this year   well you know you know mine did and it was late at this time last year i held out no hope for it but i watered and fertilized the hell out of it and i by July and August it was as strong and thick as it had ever been   oh really   and uh and of course this year it never really died out that much i mean this year here it is only April and its looking good yeah we had we had a mild winter we you know everybody in my neighborhood hires their yard work done and i think i think the fun of owning a house is doing the yard work   it was very mild mild winter yeah   and i mean i thought so ive owned a house for um twenty five of the of the thirty two years that ive been here in Dallas and i just enjoy it so much and uh and and particularly the lawn i love it dark i love to see it get a deep dark green     uhhuh   i love to uh i i love to mow it i dont like weeding the flower beds around the house and my sons supposed to do that but pretty every once and a while they get ahead of him  so i end up doing that for him and and my wife sometimes takes care of the flowers   uh   and so between us we got all our own little things to do   yeah   and we got we got two girls off in college they dont do anything but uh i uh and i love to be out in the summertime i love to be out when the sun is really nice and hot and just go out there and sweat a bit mowing the lawn   um     i just love it in fact i uh mow my lawn but theres a gigantic vacant field in back of us uh that belongs to Richland College   uhhuh   and everybody that we have that backs up to it mows about uh oh maybe ten or fifteen or twenty yards into the vacant lot to keep weeds from growing and coming over and seeding in your yard   uhhuh   so so we all even get more uh get more lawn to mow that way but uh its fun   do you back up to it on the south side or the east side   uh i am on the east side of Richland in fact so Richlands on my west side when i look out my back door to see the sun set i look across the Richland field   oh oh okay   okay and   because we had one of our uh a person similar similar stature to uh Gahouli from the legal department Mel Sharp he lives around in that area too he lives on Whiteman Place i think   okay i i live on Wharton Drive   okay   and Wharton intersects uh uh it dead ends into Chimney Hill   yeah yeah okay   and then it it dead ends just dead ends up here where i live  it runs uh it runs north and south from Chimney Hill north   okay um   uh anyway i love to do that and the other thing that i love is that i am a distance runner by hobby   oh   and some nights ill come home from work like i did last night and with rain in the forecast and the lawn was getting pretty high i said i got to mow the lawn but i want to go out and run now which do i do first       and im sitting around thinking well if i go out and run now because i messed around until almost seven uh six thirty or so if i go out and run now im going to get back and im going to be mowing the lawn and its going to get dark and im going to have to guess where where the line is to mow       so if i mow now then ill go out and run afterwards and what the mowing does it limbers you up so that you go out and have a good run i finished up right at about dark and then i went out and ran four and a half miles and it was great just because the mowing it i i dont i didnt i dont have to do any stretching before running if ive been pushing the lawn mower around for an hour for an hour and ten minutes or so   uh     so thats just you know i just i i i just really enjoy it and i hate to here see people gripe and moan about doing uh yard work what about trees do you have any trees around   we got a couple of big trees out front um i guess right along our street there used to be one of the um lines i guess there was fields here many many years ago cotton fields or something and   uhhuh you bet and i remember that   yeah well we have a lot of trees that that go across our front yards that are very old that must have been like where the line was in between the fields so we have couple of huge trees out front thats pretty nice no trees really in the back   yeah where the fence was or something yeah yeah how how how long have you live there Maureen   almost two years   oh do you have children oh okay   no not yet weve only been married two years   oh okay okay because youve got a a excellent elementary school over there uh our middle daughter went over there one year while ours was being built here and uh Richland Park is just a super neat school   oh oh   and they got a lot of neat programs the uh uh how often do you when when the when the uh growing seasons good how often do you have to mow your lawn   uh nearly every week   yeah yeah i got i got so carried away with water and fertilizer last year in uh June July and the first part of August i was mowing every four days  and i talked to my parents im from Massachusetts originally     uhhuh   and i talked to my parents on the phone i said you know we Texans are a funny breed we we water we water we spend hundreds of dollars a month during the dry part of July August watering our lawn we go out and spend thirty or forty dollars a whack on fertilizer and then we bitch and gripe about having to mow it so often       we said because we Massachusetters werent like that we never did anything to it except mow it and and it always looked nice   yeah thats right we never did this watering stuff everybody waters   yeah we didnt do all that stuff here but they get more natural rain than we do you know we get so much rain in the spring and then we go sometimes entire June July and August without any so i guess were where are you from originally   yeah uh Philadelphia area   oh okay so youve been in Texas how long   eight years   oh well youre youre almost a Texan ive been here thirty two years   thats a long time   yeah thirty two years and my wifes a Texan so of course naturally my children but they still think im a Yankee   uhhuh and i was never called that until i came here   yeah isnt that funny i wasnt either i have uh   and i i was just taken aback by that   yeah when i got here my uh uh best friend who was my office mate when i first got here in nineteen fifty nine said the only Yankees he could ever stand wore pinstripes suits and played baseball       but but people werent as mobile then as they are now i mean i will bet half of your neighborhood or three quarters of it and i know its true with ours is not from Dallas is not even from Texas   well i keep reminding these people that its good thing we came down here and got some changes made like   yeah   shopping on Sunday i said its a little hard to do everything on Saturday no pass no play uh kind of thing i said you know we had that for years in Ohio and Pennsylvania   yeah huh   yeah uh i yeah thats true thats true we did we did and uh do you all do you all uh do you all have to water a lot over there   uh pretty much and our landlord always asks us to uh continue doing that even though we pay for the water because of you know foundation problems around here   oh yeah because of the foundation problem you know thats an interesting thing ive had two overseas assignments with TI uh i was in uh Malaysia eighty one eighty two eighty three and eighty four and i was in the Philippines eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and i had two different tenants   uhhuh uhhuh   and my first one kept the inside of the house nice this is a two story five bedroom and uh uh they only lived in the downstairs because he was divorced and had two children and they only visited him one weekend a month   uhhuh um   and that was the only time the upstairs was so the upstairs looked as new as we left uh they only lived downstairs uh and and his wife was an interior decorator and the house was just kept       very nice you know ive ive heard horror stories from other TIers that have had tenants but he didnt like yard work and what happened was the Saint Augustine grew up you know if you dont watch it and keep it trimmed back it will totally take over your flower beds   um oh yeah   well when we came back what used to be our flower beds were solid Saint Augustine  we had to we had to dig it out  and the second tenant when we went to the Philippines the second tenant he had two little girls   oh uhhuh   and so they lived throughout the entire house he also had a dog in the house that i didnt know about and so our carpeting was in bad shape when i got back but uh my yard was immaculate he did a great job on the yard so you so i guess you cant have everything   um       but but youre right and i guess thats very important because of this black earth with have here that cracks terribly uh and it shifts badly in the summertime that uh if you dont water around the foundation youre going to lose it   yeah   and uh and boy ill tell you youve really got to have a conscientious tenant and its hard for him to be conscientious when hes thinking of paying a hundred dollar water bill uh every uh uh i you know every month when you get into the June July and August time period   yeah   and how how big is your duplex   um each side has three bedrooms and two baths living room and then a big uh kitchen that has uh dining area in it   oh okay theyre theyre fairly big yeah uhhuh   so each side is like seventeen hundred square feet   yeah yeah well where uh where did you go to school   uh Ohio State   oh you went to Ohio State oh youre uh up in the Woody Hays country huh   right and i was i was going to school in his prime back when we had Archie Griffin and we were winning all the Heisman trophies and going to Rose Bowl that was when i was going to school there   uh yeah yeah yeah yeah we were really excited about the were
