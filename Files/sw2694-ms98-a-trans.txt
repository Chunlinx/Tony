        okay   so   well what have you had done recently to your automobile that youre just really excited about     really depressed is a better word i actually its being done as right now as we speak     umhum   i had uh i guess thats something i could kick myself about i uh and i guess this all started with a leaky water uh pump and uh let the engine get overheated and uh right now theyre pulling the heads off my engine and uh having to do uh replace the head and the exhaust manifold and so forth its uh   oh thats major major isnt it   oh about five hundred dollars worth so far i guess around   is that all     in there   oh yeah well now this certainly isnt something that you could do yourself is it or would want too   um well it some people could probably do it themselves uh im not one of those   umhum yeah im not about the only thing i can do mechanically with a a car is put gas in it   are you     i know how to take care of it but i wouldnt attempt to do anything although i did used to try and change the oil   yeah well actually i did start i did some things myself when i before i found out what the problem was or how serious it was i tried a few things like changing the spark plugs and   umhum   pulling the PCV valve out checking uh some of the things that might have been wrong   umhum   i do you know some minor stuff but i dont really like to do uh car work all that much   umhum   id rather do woodworking   oh thats more interesting would i would think   yeah yeah   i had the uh brakes changed on my car and what went in what i went in for i thought was rather a routine um not real expensive but you know maybe expensive but it turned out to be a four hundred dollar brake job   wow   and they they work okay but the noise is so loud theres such a whirring noise and they tell me that that should have gone away in two hundred miles but i   yeah you should of you should of never been there to begin with i dont know i would suspect   really well ive still got it after about seven hundred and im taking it back in next week   um especially for four hundred bucks   but well i didnt know see thats part of the problem you if youre not aware and um   and you just uh you know you just never know and you know you feel like youre getting taken of advantage of a lot of times   i agree um i i guess you know the money has to be spent and that car has to be taken care of but you would hope that uh people would be a little bit more honest with you i guess maybe the key there is to get more than one estimate but i i get so tired tired of having to run here and run there you know   yeah thats not easy to do too because uh you know a lot of them will pull it apart and start on it and then they want to then they add things on to it or whatever you cant always get an estimate i guess   umhum thats very true well i guess weve kind of covered the topic huh           car repair we could go on for days huh   current yeah im afraid so more than they want to hear     yeah   so well i hope you have good luck getting yours fixed   yeah ill uh i uh i hope so too ive got uh my fingers crossed i was expecting that i might hear something this afternoon but not so far and uh   uhhuh       okay   but we shall see have a nice weekend   thank you very much and the same to you byebye umhum   okay good talking with you bye
