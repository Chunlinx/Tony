                                 This isnt Argument Its Mere Refutation            Something has happened to the argument over Flytrap in Washington Itsbecome tedious Initially the issues were legion the ramifications seeminglykaleidoscopic the players unsure of their positions There were traitors andapostates Clintonite Clinton critics and conservative presidencydefendersand many who were simply confused and bemused Now things have settled outalong binary lines that are all too familiar Everyone lies about sex Butit was under oath  So what  Its a crime No it isnt Yes it isTis not Etc Everyones had this argument everyones been annoyed by notwinning this argument nobody wants to have this argument again Were somebodyto start it at a Washington cocktail party the guests would scurry into theother room as surely as if that someone had said Lets build the bridge to thest century or attempted to redebate the Vietnam War  Of courseWashingtonians may have chosen up sides in this fashion in part because so manypeople in the capital need to choose up sides in order to do their jobs inpart because the only thing more boring than having an opinion on Flytrap isnot having one Well I think only time will tell Gee Im so glad Iinvited you  Outside of Washington where people never cared thatmuch about Flytrap in the first place opinions may be much less dug in morevaguelyformed and

dirt on Republicans who might vote on Clintons impeachmentMulholland doesnt duck the charge Many of the House Judiciary members aredivorced and their divorce papers contain a lot of interesting informationand well be sharing that with the American people he tells the Times Fair enough Honest blackmail  Well not completely honest since themain charge against Clinton isnt marital infidelity its perjury andobstruction of justice  Mulholland is good at his job If I were aRepublican Id worry more about him and less about Sidney Blumenthal  EvenChatterbox once did a bit of business with Mulholland What kind of businessLets just say that a ReaganRepublican Senate candidate in California wasknown to somewhat hypocritically visit a Los Angeles newsstand that featured anextensive selection of adult magazines Chatterbox heard about this from afriend told someone else and eventually got a call from Mulholland who askedfor the name of the newsstand which Chatterbox provided Four days before theelection with one poll showing the candidates in a virtual tie Mulholland gotthe story out by shouting questions at the Republican during a campaignstopaccusing him of also patronizing a Sunset Boulevard strip club Headmitted going to the club which he called a cocktail place Witnessesconfirmed his newsstand habits He did not win Democrat Barbara Boxer whodid owes Chatterbox a mediumsized chit  Given this incident howeverMulholland would probably be the wrong spokesman to righteously attack KennethStarr for trying to learn about Monica Lewinskys semipornographic
