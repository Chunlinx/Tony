        okay Vic our topic is budgets     yes   do you keep a monthly budget   uh i talk about doing that a lot   welcome to the club   uh i i use a uh computer software program to keep track of all expenses primarily its a checking   uhhuh   you know a check balancing program but it does categorize categorize everything   oh how interesting   and and it allows you to either to go in and create a budget and then compare against it or actually will sort of generate one based on you know how you categorize things over the over the months   oh   so i have all the information there um its just that i havent been very diligent at at really tracking it and following it   well uh its just like the money its hard to keep track of it  as it goes out   right right what do you do   uh im a teacher and were at a my husband and i are at a stage in life where weve got one left in college   okay umhum   so budgeting is not our priority since we have one in college  their expenses run beyond any budgeting allowances   right okay okay   weve quit   um well the biggest problem that ive had or one of the one of the problems is um keeping track of cash expenditures you know expenditures   yeah   uh i think that one of the things thats uh makes budgeting very hard is the convenience of automatic teller machines uh the ability to go up and get cash so easily   okay i see i stopped those four years ago yeah   really okay well see you have control   yeah oh yeah now we are you know um well were at a point in life that were looking to retirement rather than you know earnings   umhum   so its gotten to the point where um yeah automatic automatic teller i only had the card and it was on my own personal account and it got way out of control very fast   okay huh   so i have a tendency now i take an allowance and when its gone its gone you know im finished if its gone the fifteenth of the month then its gone   well thats pretty good uhhuh its gone huh oh thats great   and uh we have a tendency not to use cash we pay everything by check   right yeah thats a good way to do it   and so that way we we keep control of what were spending where its going what its going for   umhum well thats great   so um you know it i take a hundred dollars a month thats all i take and you know i mean i dont buy groceries out of it its my own little   oh wow   slush fund if you wanna call it that and thats for my little incidentals or running to the grocery store to get a you know gallon of milk or whatever   umhum yeah right   but um after that its check only   right   so we can you know really know where our moneys going and you know whats happening   umhum   what about how are you on charge cards   uh pretty good about that that the last few years anyway we did have a Master Card that got out of hand for awhile but we just just stopped using it didnt get rid of it   good   there are times uh such as oh some mail order type things uh where its very convenient to have   yes   uh but thats really the only thing it its used for and uh one one problem i do have is with uh is it i in my job i travel a good bit and have to use my own uh credit card i dont have a business credit card   okay   so i use that and then have to file expense reports and uh it just adds another complication to properly tracking expenses knowing how much of it is reimbursed business expense uh or how much is my own expense for   well   yeah i i use uh credit cards not for credit but just for convenience in other words i pay we pay monthly the balance due uh but we do   okay yeah well this might help you because see my husband travels as well   uhhuh   and we have separate charge accounts   okay   hes got an American Express and thats only traveling   okay   then we both have a Visa or MasterCard   okay   so anything on his American Express is his   thats a pretty good way to do it   and its his expense now he gave me one and if i go with him on work   umhum umhum   i only charge on that card i dont put it on my MasterCard   okay right   so weve separated those two completely and i know what you mean because at first we used to intermingle our funds and we werent sure  why our bills were outrageous   umhum oh yeah its hard to be sure to be sure right   you know because his traveling expenses were you know i mean hes a traveling salesman so were looking at six five   oh boy
