                                 The Indefensible Stanley Fish            To readers of British fiction Stanley Fish the new dean of arts andsciences at the University of Illinois in Chicago and the secondmostfamousEnglish professor in Americaafter Harvards Henry Louis Gates Jrisindistinguishable from Morris Zapp Everyone knows that the character in DavidLodges trilogy Changing Places Small World and Nice Work  themost popular campus novels since Kingsley Amis Lucky Jim  was based onFish Lodges good friend Zapp a jetsetting starfucking and intellectuallyluminous American deconstructionist whose charm lies in his gleeful disregardfor scholarly convention aspires to become the highestpaid English professorin the world Whats wrong with that he asks            To readers of American newspapers however particularly the Wall StreetJournal editorial page Fish is the symbol of how the left is wreckingAmerican universities Fishs sin according to his journalistic critics ismoral relativism He is the founder of readerresponse criticism which holdsthat texts dont have intrinsic meaningmeaning is a byproduct of theencounter between reader and text He advocates campus speech codes theultimate in political correctness He defends the culturalstudies journalSocial Text and the field of science studies even after they werehumiliated through a brilliant prank by physicist Alan Sokal And yes heis one of the highestpaid English professors around He currently gets a year from the University of Illinois This it is felt does notreflect an amusing brashness It reflects a lack of principle            An implicit answer to these and other criticisms can be found in Fishslatest book The Trouble With Principle Harvard University Press  It opens with a scene from a movieSam Peckinpahs westernThe Wild Bunch Outlaws Ernest Borgnine and William Holden arediscussing a friend who has betrayed them by becoming a railroad detective Whywould their friend do a thing like that Borgnine asks Holden explains Thefriend gave his word to the railroad So what Borgnine replies It isntgiving your word thats important its who you give your word to            Most people would agree with Holden that a code of honor is worth at leastpaying lip service to The combative Fish sides with Borgnine The troublewith principle he writes is first it does not exist and second thatnowadays many bad things are done in its name None of the ideals a liberalsociety is supposed to be based on Fish arguesfairness impartialityreasonablenessis ever truly neutral or principled They all mask a politicalagenda If all disputes over abstract ideals are as Fish says attempts toexploit an elevated moral language for partisan advantage then to hell withhis critics and their faith in chimera such as free speech and scientificobjectivity To hell with conservatives and their absolute values To hell withliberals and their cherished notion of tolerance since the people who benefitfrom it such as fundamentalists and supremacists would punch a liberal sillyif they found one in a dark alley The only beliefs that matter says Fish arethe ones that matter directly to you In the case of Stanley Fish those aremy convictions and commitments            Before you dismiss Fish as either a danger to democratic values or apugilistic idiot you have to know three more things about him First hes aremarkable scholar As a young man in the s he singlehandedly dragged hischosen specialty John Milton studies into the modern era The field was miredin a stale debate over whether Paradise Lost is flawed because itcontradicts itselfSatan is an appealing character even though Milton appearsto side with God etc Fish took Miltons contradictions to be a dramatizationof the theological paradoxes of his day rather than mere literary error            Second Fish is a political realist not a headintheclouds theorist Heis receiving such a princely sum from the University of Illinois not justbecause hes famousor notoriousbut because he was the chief architect oftwo of the most wellthoughtof though controversial American academicprograms in the s and s Johns Hopkins Universitys Humanities Centerand Duke Universitys English department His success as an administratorrested on two insights that are now commonplace first that the academic starsystem could be used to create departments with highprofile brand names andsecond that the longing of academic couples to live in the same placerepresents an administrative opportunity not a headache Fish built both theHumanities Center and Dukes English department by hiring celebrity couples andfinding room for both rather than wooing one member of the couple andbanishing the other to a lesser department or condemning husband and wife to acommuter marriage That both departments are now falling apart can be chalkedup either to his considerable skill at maintaining allies or to his cynicallack of concern with longterm stability            Third it is not as easy as it seems to lump Fish with the progressives andutopianists who dominate the cultural and intellectual left The TroubleWith Principle  with its typically Fishy mix of transgressiveness andrealism demonstrates the distance between him and them The books best essayby far is an attack on multiculturalism In it Fish argues thatmulticulturalism is a logical impossibility His brief goes like this Thereare two kinds of multiculturalism weak or boutique multiculturalismand strong multiculturalism Weak multiculturalism says Fish is a waterytolerance for cultural diversity Weak multiculturalists hold that thedifferences between people are trivial because there are certain centralvaluestolerance respecting the dignity of individual rights etcthatsupersede everything else Weak multiculturalists do not tolerate practicessuch as polygamy or female circumcision that offend those values Strongmulticulturalists recognize that some differences are irreconcilable but sayyou must put up with them In the end Fish argues both multiculturalisms arereally uniculturalism Weak multiculturalists simply impose their Westernliberal values on everyone else Strong multiculturalists if they follow theirargument to its extremes end up having to support some other culture whosebasic principles violate their ownthereby elevating the values of thatculture above their own            If there are no rules for living peacefully in an ethnically mixed societywhat do we do now Why says Fish we do what we have always done since wehave never really practiced multiculturalism We improvise We engage insomething Fish calls borrowing the phrase from a philosopher named CharlesTaylor inspired adhoccery We decide what to do on a casebycase basisWhen it makes sense to offer a major in Hindi studies we offer a major inHindi studies When animal sacrifices become sufficiently offensive we outlawthem This he adds is not a recommendation It is how we do things alreadyand the sooner we admit that the better well get at it            This may be well and good for multiculturalism but Fish has bigger targetsin mind The most troubling essay in the book is called Mission ImpossibleHere Fish claims that there is no such thing as liberalism since liberalismsonly way of dealing with those who dont agree with it is forcibly to excludethem mostly by calling them mad Its an old argument but Fish makes it newby going back to the sourceJohn Lockeand showing that in order to arrive atthe principle of separation of church and state the bedrock of liberal polity Locke had to define religion as an internal process each mans war uponhis own lusts and vices In so doing says Fish Locke defines religion awayor at least all religions with strong beliefs and problematic forms of publicworship Locke does acknowledge that in some rare cases churches must besuppressed but he says thats not a problemwell know which ones tosuppress because they will be condemned by the judgment of all mankind Rightthere says Fish Locke undoes his own argument since the judgment of allmankind requires a reigning consensus that doesnt exist If it did Lockewouldnt have had to invent liberalism Liberals rather than practicingtolerance have by acts of intellectual and real violence elevated their ownideas of what will and wont do to the status of that which is universallyright            The philosophy Fish is practicing here bears some resemblance to pragmatisma turnofthecentury American doctrine that has recently been revived andwedded to European postmodernism Modern pragmatism is a powerful brew ofrelativismthe idea that all truths are situationaland the optimistic beliefthat things work themselves out in the end But Fish is not an upbeatpragmatist His vision of society is far darker for instance than that of theleading American pragmatist Richard Rorty who holds that no idea is truly badas long as it leads to other ideas Mission Impossible is the essay in whichFishs scariest side emerges in clear view The only thinker who is reallyhonest about the implausibility of the liberal state says Fish is Hobbes                           Because the equality of right and ability breeds equality of hope in theattaining of our Ends and because each mans ends are naturally to bepreferred to his rivals the two will inevitably become enemies and in theabsence of a neutral arbiter they will endeavor to destroy or subdue oneanother                        And there Fish more or less stops Well actually he goes on to argue in asimilar fashion against the logical plausibility of free speech academicfreedom and blind justice Maddeningly he leads us to the center of theHobbesian maze then refuses to extricate us If life is a war of all againstall what guarantee do we have that adhoccery will work no matter howinspired None of courseat which point Fish generally cackles and says thatsince hes a pragmatist he believes that his ideas about the world are justthat ideas without consequences There is he says no straight line fromthese propositions to the solution of any reallife problem they are of nohelp and do no work except the nondirecting work of telling you that you areon your own            In other words Fish isnt the unprincipled relativist hes accused ofbeing Hes something worse Hes a fatalist But then so were thepreSocratics several Roman philosophers and Machiavelli Cultureboxcertainly cant tell you whether Fish is right or wrong On the other handFish never claimed to be right In fact he once quipped that now thatobjectivity is dead it is no longer necessary to be right You just have to beinteresting Which he is
