and for the nation saving means forgoingconsumption today so they can enjoy a better standard of living inthe future National savingthe portion of a nations currentincome not consumedis the sum of saving by households businessesand all levels of government National saving represents resourcesavailable for investment to replace old factories and equipment andto buy more and better capital goods Higher saving and investmentin a nations capital stock contribute to increased productivityand stronger economic growth over the long term Saving todayincreases a nations capacity to produce goods and services in thefuture and therefore helps to increase the standard of living forfuture generationsSince the s combined saving by households and business hasdeclined For much of that time the federal government did notcontribute to saving instead it was a borrower its deficitsabsorbing a share of the saving pool available for investment Forthe nation as a whole saving has rebounded somewhat from its lowpoint in the early s but remains relatively low by UShistorical standards In fiscal year  the federal governmentbegan to contribute to the pool of saving by running its firstsurplus since  Federal budget surpluses now are projected forat least the next decade But even with the advent of federalgovernment saving in the late s national saving available fornew investment remains relatively low in large part becausepersonal saving has dramatically declined The US has been ableto invest more than it saves by borrowing from abroad buteconomists question whether this is a viable strategy for the longtermPersonal saving plays a dual role ensuring both individualsretirement security and the nations economic security WhileSocial Security provides a foundation for retirement income savingthrough pensions and by individuals on their own behalf contributesubstantially to retirement income Even as more people areaccumulating balances through employersponsored k savingplans and individual retirement accounts personal savingwhichdoes not reflect gains on existing assetshas declined Thepersonal saving rate has plunged with American households spendingvirtually all of their current income Although aggregate householdwealth has risen in part as a result of the stock market boom overthe s many individual households have accumulated little ifany wealthAmerica faces a demographic tidal wave that poses significantchallenges for individuals retirement security and our economy asa whole More people are living longer in retirement and therewill be relatively fewer workers supporting each retiree in thefuture Without meaningful reform the Social Security and Medicareprograms face longterm financing problems Although publicattention usually focuses on the dates by which the trust funds areprojected to become insolvent the effects associated withfinancing cash deficits for these programs will be felt sooner asthe baby boom generation begins to retire As the population agesspending for Social Security and federal health programs will leaveincreasingly less room for spending on other nationalprioritiesIncreasing national saving is an important way to bolsterretirement security for current workers and to allow future workersto more easily bear the costs of financing federal retirement andhealth programs while maintaining their standard of living As wehave reported in the past the surest way for the federalgovernment to affect national saving is through federal fiscalpolicy particularly in what it chooses to do with the budgetsurpluses projected over the next decade Policymakers appear tohave agreed to save the Social Security surpluses and the fiscalpolicy debate has centered on what to do with the balance of theanticipated surpluses To the extent that they are used to reducefederal debt held by the public surpluses represent an opportunityto increase national saving In addition how surpluses are usedhas longterm implications for future economic growth Policydebates surrounding Social Security and Medicare reform also haveimplications for all levels of savinggovernment personal andultimately nationalThis report is designed to present information about nationalsavingas measured in the National Income and Product Accountsandits implications for economic growth and retirement security in aconcise and easily understandable manner In general this reportis based on widely accepted economic principles and we identifythose areas where many economists do not agree Although manyexcellent studies and books have been written on national savingand longterm economic growth these discussions tend to be complexand technical Also most discussion of the decline in personalsaving focuses on the adequacy of individuals retirement savingrather than on the significance of personal saving for the economyas a whole For example one point that is sometimes overlooked isthat low personal saving has consequences for US reliance onforeign borrowing longterm economic growth and standards ofliving for future generationsThis report addresses the following questions  What ispersonal saving how is it related to national saving and what arethe implications of low personal saving for Americans retirementsecurity  What is national saving and how does current savingin the United States compare to historical trends and saving inother countries  How does national saving affect the economyand how would higher saving affect the longterm outlook  Howdoes federal fiscal policy affect national saving what federalpolicies have been aimed at increasing private saving and howwould Social Security and Medicare reform affect national savingAnd  what are key issues in evaluating national saving For aquick overview of the topics

Irving Managing Director Federal BudgetAnalysis Strategic Issues Director Federal Budget AnalysisStrategic IssuesSummary of Major SectionsPersonal Saving and RetirementSecurityThe personal saving rateas measured in the National Income andProduct Accounts NIPAreflects how much households in aggregateare saving from their current disposable income In evaluatingpersonal saving it is important to distinguish between saving as away for an individual household to finance future consumption andsaving as a way to finance the nations capital formation Strangeas it may seem to the typical household capital gains on itsexisting assets do not contribute to saving as measured in NIPAThat is because capital gains reflect a revaluation of the nationsexisting capital stock and do not provide resources for financinginvestment that adds to the capital stock Whereas employercontributions to pension funds as well as pension funds interestand dividend income are part of personal income and contribute topersonal saving increases in the market value of assets held bypension funds for example are not counted as personal income andsaving Although an individual household can tap its wealth byselling assets to finance consumption or accumulate other assetsthe sale of an existing asset merely transfers ownership it doesnot generate new economic outputThe personal saving rate has largely declined since the splummeting in recent years to levels not seen since the GreatDepression as shown in figure S A low personal saving rateraises questions about whether households have adequate resourcesto sustain their rate of spending A negative saving rate meansthat in aggregate households are spending more than their currentincome by drawing down past saving selling existing assets orborrowing        Source Bureau of Economic Analysis Department of CommerceEconomists use several theories to explain what motivates peopleto save Despite a great deal of study economists have found nosingle reason that convincingly explains the decline in thepersonal saving rate One possible explanation is that surginghousehold wealth in recent years contributed to the virtualdisappearance of personal saving Since the mid s aggregatehousehold wealth has swelled relative to disposable personalincome largely due to increases in the market value of householdsexisting assets see figure  Yet despite the stock marketboom of the s many households have accumulated little if anywealth see figure  and half of American households did notown stocks as of While Social Security provides a foundation for retirementincome Social Security benefits replace only about  percent ofpreretirement income for the average worker As a result SocialSecurity benefits must be supplemented by private pensionsaccumulated assets or other resources in order for individuals tomaintain a reasonable standard of living in retirement compared totheir final working years Pensions income from accumulatedassets and earnings from continued employment largely determinewhich households will have the highest retirement income seefigures  and  Pensions are not a universal source ofretirement income and more than half of those working in lacked a pension plan While most families say they recognize theneed to save for retirementNational Saving Overviewfewer than half of those surveyed in early  had tried tocalculate how much they need to saveOver the next  years the elderly population will nearlydouble as a share of the total US population see figure  Asmore people live longer there will be relatively fewer workerssupporting each retiree unless retirement patterns change Whiletoday there are  workers for each Social Security beneficiaryby  there will be only about  workers paying taxes to supporteach beneficiary see figure  Both Social Security andMedicare face longterm financing problems and the Social Securityand Medicares Hospital Insurance trust funds eventually will beexhausted as the baby boomers draw their benefits see figures and  Absent reform Social Security and Medicare costs wouldconstitute a substantial drain on the earnings of future workerssee figure  Anticipating potential benefit cuts peoplecould choose to save more now work longer to delay retirement orexperience a lower standard of living in retirement With an agingpopulation and a slowly

EconomicAnalysis Department of CommerceNational saving represents resources available for investment inthe nations stock of capital goods such as plant equipment andhousing The nations human capital and knowledgeforms ofintangible capitalare not part of the NIPA definitions of savingand investment Also NIPA focuses on the incomes arising fromcurrent production of goods and services and thus does not countrevaluation of existing assets in national saving Changes in themarket value of existing tangible and financial assets such asland and stocks reflect expectations about the productivepotential of the underlying capital but fluctuations in assetvalues may not represent real permanent changes in the nationsproductive capacityNational saving together with borrowing from abroad provides theresources for investment that can boost productivity and lead tohigher economic growth and future living standards see figure Investment in new capital is an important way to raise theproductivity of the slowly growing workforce as the populationages Greater economic growth from saving more now would make iteasier for future workers to achieve a rising standard of livingfor themselves while also paying for the governments commitmentsto the elderly Economic growth also depends on education toenhance the knowledge and skills of the nations workNational Saving and the Governmentforcethe nations human capitalas well as research anddevelopment to spur technological advancesEven though national saving remains relatively low by UShistorical standards economic growth in recent years has been highbecause more and better investments were made Each dollar savedbought more investment goods and a greater share of saving wasinvested in highly productive information technology Also theUnited States was able to invest more than it saved by borrowingfrom abroad see figure  Persistent US current accountdeficits have translated into a rising level of indebtedness toother countries ie net US holdings of foreign assets seefigure  Many other nations currently financing investment inthe United States also will face aging populations and decliningnational saving so relying on foreign savers to finance a largeshare of US domestic investment is not a viable strategy for thelong runCurrent saving and investment decisions have profoundimplications for the nations level of wellbeing in the futureOur simulations using a longterm economic growth model show thateven assuming the United States could maintain national savingconstant at its  share of GDP future incomes would fall shortof the rise in living standards enjoyed by prior generations whoseincome generally doubled every  years see figures and  Saving more would improve the nations longtermeconomic outlook but this requires consuming less nowFederal fiscal policy affects the amount of federal governmentsaving and this in turn directly affects national saving From thes through the mid s federal deficits absorbed a largeshare of private saving and reduced the amount of national savingavailable for investment see figure  Borrowing to financethese deficits added to the federal debt held by the public Inrecent years federal surpluses added to national saving andincreased funds available for investment So far the federalgovernment has used surplus funds to reduce its debt held by thepublic Accumulating nonfederal financial assets such as stockscould be another way that government saving could translate intoresources available for investment but this idea is controversialAn additional dollar of government saving and debt reduction doesnot automatically increase national saving and investment by adollar because changes in saving by households and businesses willtend to offset some of the change in government savingWhile attention has focused on budget surpluses projected overthe next decade the federal budget will increasingly be driven byone certaintythe population is aging and there will be fewerworkers supporting each retiree In our simulations saving onlythe Social Security surpluses will not be sufficient to accommodateboth the projected growth in Social Security and healthentitlements as well as other important national priorities in thelong term see figure  Absent program changes saving theSocial Security surplusesand even the Medicare surplusesis notenough to ensure retirement security for the aging populationwithout placing a heavy burden on future generations SocialSecurity and health spending alone eventually would exceed totalfederal revenue and squeeze out most or all other spending seefigure  Even if the entire unified surplus were saved oursimulations show that the rise in living standards measured interms of GDP per capitawould fall short of the rise enjoyed byprior generations whose income generally doubled every  yearssee figure  Reforming retirement and health entitlementprograms is critical to putting the federal budget on a moresustainable footing for the long term and to freeing up futureresources for other competing needsAlthough increasing government saving is the most direct way forthe federal government to increase national saving budgetsurpluses also could be used to finance federal investment intendedto promote longterm economic growth or to encourage personalsaving Whereas unified budget surpluses increase national savingavailable for private investment increasing federal spending onnational infrastructure if properly designed and administered canbe another way to increase the nations capital stock In additionfederal spending on education and research and developmentwhilenot counting as investment in NIPAcan if properly designed andadministered promote the nations longterm productivity andeconomic growth The federal government also has sought toencourage personal saving both to enhance households financialsecurity and to boost national saving But developing policiesthat have the desired effect is difficult Tax incentives affecthow people save for retirement but do not necessarily increase theoverall level of personal saving Even with preferential taxtreatment for employersponsored retirement saving plans andindividual retirement accounts the personal saving rate hassteadily declined Economists disagree about whether tax incentivesare effective in increasing the overall level of personal savingThe net effect of a tax incentive on national saving depends onwhether the tax incentive induces enough additional saving byhouseholds to make up for the lower government saving resultingfrom the governments revenue loss In recent years policymakershave explored using government matching or creating new individualaccounts to encourage Americans to save moreCongress found that a leading obstacle to expanding retirementsaving has been that many Americans do not know how to save forretirement let alone how much The Department of Labor maintainsan outreach program to raise public awareness about the advantagesof saving and to help educate workers about how much they need tosave for retirement Other federal agencies also play a role ineducating the public about saving Individualized statements nowsent annually by the Social Security Administration to most workersaged  and older provide important information for personalretirement planning but knowing more about Social Securitysfinancial status would help workers to understand how to view theirpersonal benefit estimatesRestoring Social Security to sustainable solvency and increasingsaving are intertwined national goals Saving for the nationsretirement costs is analogous to an individuals retirementplanning in that the sooner we increase saving the greater ourbenefit from compounding growth The way in which Social Securityis reformed will influence both the magnitude and timing of anyincrease in national saving The ultimate effect of Social Securityreform on national saving depends on complex interactions betweengovernment saving and personal savingboth through pension fundsand by individuals on their own behalf Various proposals wouldcreate new individual accounts as part of Social Security reform orin addition to Social Security The extent to which individualaccounts would affect national saving depends on how the accountsare funded how the account program is structured and how peopleadjust their own saving behavior in response to the newaccountsThe Medicare program is fiscally burdensome in its current formand Medicare spending see figure  is expected to drive federalgovernment dissaving over the long run Given the aging of the USpopulation and the increasing cost of modern medical technology itis inevitable that demands on the Medicare program will grow Thecurrent Medicare program lacks incentives to control health careconsumption and the cost of health care decisions is nottransparent to consumers Although future Medicare costs areexpected to consume a growing share of the federal budget and theeconomy pressure is mounting to expand Medicares benefit packageto cover prescription drugs which will add billions to Medicareprogram costs In balancing health care spending with othersocietal priorities it is important to distinguish between healthcare wants which are virtually unlimited needs which should bedefined and addressed and overall affordability which has alimit Reducing federal Medicare spending would improve futurelevels of government saving but the ultimate effect on nationalsaving depends on how the private sector responds to thereductionsKey Issues In light of the virtualdisappearance of personal saving concerns about US reliance onborrowing from abroad to finance domestic investment and thelooming fiscal pressures of an aging population federaldecisionmakers must consider how much of the anticipated budgetsurpluses to save spend or use for tax reductions Economicgrowth will help society bear the burden of financing SocialSecurity and Medicare but it alone will not solve our longtermfiscal challenge To participate in the debate over how to reformSocial Security and Medicare the public needs to understand thedifficult choices the nation facesSection Personal Saving and Retirement SecurityQ What is the Personal Saving Rate andWhat Does it MeanA The personal saving rate is the most widely citedstatistic about how much households save but most people do notknow what the rate measures or what it means First it isnecessary to distinguish saving from savings In everydayterms saving means spending less than your income and savingsare the assets accumulated over time To better distinguish betweenthese concepts in this report the term saving means the moneyset aside from current income for future consumptionie how muchof each periods income is saved rather than spent The termsassets accumulated and wealth are used for the cumulative stockof resources built over timewhat people commonly think of assavingsThe personal saving rate as measured in the National Income andProduct Accounts NIPA reflects how much American households aresetting aside from current income Under NIPA personal saving iswhat is left over from personal income after taxes and personalspending for goods and services Disposable personal income is theincome available for personal spending and saving after federalstate and local taxes as well as Social Security and Medicarepayroll taxes are paid The NIPA personal saving rate is calculatedas the ratio of personal saving to disposable personal incomeTo understand what the personal saving rate means it is helpfulto understand the NIPA definitions of persons personal incomeand personal spending For NIPA purposes persons include notonly individuals but also nonprofit institutions primarily servingindividuals pension funds and private trust funds NIPA personalincome includes wages and salaries interest and dividend incomerental income proprietors income government transfer paymentssuch as Social Security veterans and unemployment benefits andemployer contributions to pension plans as well as group health andlife insurance plans Contributions to traditional defined benefitpension plans and defined contribution planssuch as kplanstogether with pensionThe national income and product accounts NIPA are thecomprehensive set of accounts that show the composition ofproduction and the distribution of incomes earned in productionNIPA data reflect production in the United States as well as UStransactions with the rest of the world NIPA data are prepared bythe Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce Formore information see Eugene P Seskin and Robert P Parker AGuide to the NIPAs Survey of Current Business Vol  No March  pp NIPA treats the net rental value on owneroccupied housing aspersonal incomefunds interest and dividend income represent an importantcomponent of NIPA personal income and saving Benefits paid bypension plans are not a component of NIPA personal income althoughpension benefits represent an important means for many retirees tofinance consumption see Q NIPA personal spending includesfor example food clothing rent utilities and medical careconsumer interest payments and consumer durables such as cars andmajor appliancesStrange as it may seem to the average household changes in thevalue of existing assets such as stocks bonds or real estate donot contribute to NIPA personal income and saving That is becausecapital gains reflect a revaluation of the nations existingcapital stock and do not provide resources for financing investmentthat adds to the capital stock Under the current NIPA methodologyrealized gains do not count as personal income but any taxes paidon such gains reduce disposable personal income and thus personalsavingAlthough the NIPA personal saving rate is the measure mostfrequently cited by analysts and the media an alternativemacroeconomic measure of personal saving is available from theFederal Reserves Flow of Funds Accounts FFA Whereas NIPAmeasures saving as what is left over from personal income aftertaxes and personal spending FFA measures saving as the netincrease in households financial and tangible assets less the netincrease in households liabilities Both the NIPA and FFA measurescount household purchases of houses as saving The FFA personalsaving rate also counts household purchases of consumer durables assaving and thus is somewhat higher than the NIPA personal savingrate Both the NIPA and FFA macroeconomic measures focus on savingfrom the economys current production and do not include changes inthe market value of households existing portfolios In thisreport we use the NIPA measure ofA defined benefit pension plan generally provides benefitsbased on a specific formula linked to the workers earnings andtenure Typically a defined benefit plan is funded completely bythe employer who bears the investment risk of such as arrangementUnder a defined contribution plan a percentage of pay iscontributed by the employer to an account for each worker with theworker bearing the investment risk The increasingly popular kplans also allow contributions by workersThis refers to spending by persons in NIPA and not just byindividualsThe Flow of Funds Accounts FFA measure the acquisition ofphysical and financial assets throughout the US economy and thesources of funds used to acquire the assets For more informationsee Guide to the Flow of Funds Accounts Vol  Board of Governorsof the Federal Reserve System Q Why Measure Personal Savingpersonal saving because it more closely represents the resourcesavailable from households for the nations capital formationFor the economy as a whole the personal saving rate provides ameasure of how much households are saving compared to currentdisposable personal income A positive saving rate means thatAmerican households in aggregate are saving A low personal savingrate means that households in aggregate are spending virtually allof their current income A negative personal saving rate meansthat in aggregate American households are spending more thantheir current incomeor dissaving Given that the personal savingrate is an aggregate measure some individuals might be saving alot even while others are drawing down past saving sellingexisting assets or borrowing to finance their currentconsumptionA For the economy as a whole personal saving can be a vitalsource of the nations saving available to finance private andgovernment investment NIPA personal saving is widely recognized byeconomists as the key measure of the resources that householdscontribute to national saving A low personal saving rateunlessoffset by relatively higher saving by businesses andor governmentor by borrowing from abroadlimits how much the nation can investand so ultimately limits future economic growth A low personalsaving rate can raise questions about whether current generationsare setting aside enough to sustain the nations productivecapacity especially if the other components of national saving arenot correspondingly higher Some analysts are concerned that thedemand for household consumption is in part fueling the US tradedeficit Section  discusses the trend and the components ofnational saving and section  explains how saving affectslongterm economic growth and living standardsThe personal saving rate also has implications for Americansability to sustain their current rate of spending Personalspending represents about twothirds of the US economy A lowpersonal saving rate raises questions about whether Americans haveadequate resources to withstand a financial emergency such asunemployment in the event of an economic downturn In additionmany policymakers and analysts have questioned whether Americanhouseholds are saving enough to ensure their retirementsecurityHaving said this it is important to recognize thatmacroeconomic measures such as the NIPA personal saving rate do notprovide a complete picture ofQ How Has the Personal Saving RateChanged Over Timethe finances of individual households A households capacity toconsume depends on both its current income and its wealth One wayto measure households wealth is net worth or the differencebetween households assets and their liabilities The change inhouseholds net worth is broader than the NIPA or FFA measures ofpersonal saving and includes both the flow of saving from currentincome plus any increase or decrease in the market value ofexisting assets such as houses and stocks For the economy as awhole however the change in households net worth due torevaluation of households existing assets does not representresources available to invest in the nations capital stockA Figure  shows the personal saving rateexpressed as apercentage of disposable personal incomeover the past  decadesThe personal saving rate averaged  percent

Bureau of Economic Analysis Department of CommerceA Before trying to answer why people are saving less letsstart with the question of what motivates people to save Peoplesave for a variety of reasons such as buying a house taking avacation providing a college education for their children orpreparing for their own retirement They may also save for generalreasons such as for a rainy day or to leave money to their heirsPeople with seemingly identical family and income situations maymake different saving choicessome may save a great deal whileothers save little if anything Economists and other analysts useseveral theories in analyzing how individuals and households decidehow much of their current income to save for the futureThe standard theory for explaining personal saving is thelifecycle model The basic hypothesis is that people save andaccumulate assets to smooth out their consumption and standard ofliving over their lifetimesA complementary theory of personal saving is thepermanentincome hypothesis Generally people save a greater shareof income when their annual income is higher than their expectedlongrun permanent income and save a smaller share when theirincome is lower than the expected longrun levelPage  GAOSP National SavingYoung people entering the workforce anticipating that theirincomes will increase over their careers save little and mayborrow to finance current spending Workers in their peak earningyears save to repay past borrowing and to accumulate assets forretirement The lifecycle model predicts that saving ishumpshaped by age so that wealth

expected retirementage and the number of years they expect to live in retirement butalso project their expected income real returns on assetsaccumulated and inflation over their lifetimeAlthough providing for retirement is a powerful motive forsaving the lifecycle model in its simplest form cannot fullyexplain how people decide to save Faced with the difficulty ofreconciling the standard lifecycle model with available empiricaldata economists have examined other motives that may help explainsaving behavior While some evidence supports each motiveeconomists do not have a unified theory that fully explains howpeople choose to save In general the other major incentives orreasons why people save are categorized as followsPrecautionary saving motive This is saving to protectagainst unexpected expenses or possible emergencies such asunemployment or illness In particular individuals who facegreater uncertainty about their income and those who areriskaverse may tend to save more for a rainy day Precautionarysaving may be overandabove basic lifecycle saving forretirement Some people may choose to save enough to maintain abufferstock or contingency reserve during their early workingyears and defer retirement saving until their s orsBequest saving motive This is saving beyond basiclifecycle saving for retirement Some people may choose to savemore in order to bequeath the accumulated wealth to futuregenerations The desire to leave a bequest may explain why theelderly do not fully deplete their wealth and some even continue tosave during retirement To someFor a

unspentretirement and precautionary savingBig ticket saving motive This is relatively shorttermsaving to accommodate a mismatch between current income andexpenses during the lifecycle Some people save to pay forbigticket items such as cars other consumer durables orvacations Some must save in advance because they cannot borrowwhile others may prefer to save and avoid borrowing Another bigticket is the down payment to buy a home households largely borrowto buy homes and later save by repaying their mortgages Paying forpostsecondary education is a big ticket above and beyond lifecyclesaving for retirementGiven that people save for different purposes increasing therate of return on saving does not necessarily motivate people tosave more A higher rate of return has two opposing effects onpersonal saving On the one hand a higher rate of return mayencourage people to save more because future spending becomes lesscostly relative to spending todaythe substitution effect On theother hand given a higher rate of return people need to save lessnow to finance a given level of future consumption This reducedincentive to save as real rates of return increase is called theincome effect How people react to an increase in the rate ofreturn depends not only on their preferences about spending todayversus spending in the future but also on the real aftertax rateof returnthat is the rate expected after taking into accountinflation and taxesNot everyone behaves like a lifecycle saver Many people planover shorter horizonsa few years or even paychecktopaycheckInstead of trying to forecast lifetime income and economicconditions in the distant future people may use simple rules ofthumb such as saving a fixed share of their income or avoidingdebt Many people are target savers who aim for a fixed levelof wealth or ratio of wealth to income in order to achieveTextbooks in microeconomics discuss these effects in detailFor a brief summary of substitution and income effects see

contractual saving in whichthe homeowners commitment to repay the principal borrowed compelsfuture savingEven though economists have various theories to explain whypeople choose to save some people do not save at all Lowincomeand even some moderateincome households may feel that they areunable to save Others may be unwilling to save Some people may beimpatient and they may discount the future so heavily thatretirement saving seems irrelevant compared to currentspendingA No one is sure why the personal saving rate has declinedDespite a great deal of study economists have found no singlereason

OfficeMemorandum Social Security and Private Saving A Review of theEmpirical Evidence July Q What Is the Relationship BetweenPersonal Saving and Wealth Expectations about future income and wealth People decide howmuch to save based not only on their current income but also ontheir expectations about their future lifetime income and wealthSince March  the United States has enjoyed its longest postwareconomic expansionunemployment and inflation have remainedrelatively low and stable and the stock market has achieved recordhighs Over the s the booming economy and stock market mayhave lulled people into a sense of complacency that good times werehere to stay People may have saved less because they wereconfident about future income prospects and households werewealthier because of gains on their existing assets As discussedbelow in question  increased household wealth in recent yearsappears to have contributed to the plunge in the personal savingrate over the late sA That Americans save little but households are wealthier isa paradox that can be confusing It is widely known that savingfrom current income is the way to accumulate assets and repay pastborrowing thus increasing net worth The flow of saving isessential to accumulating a stock of wealthas a general rulesomeone who never saves will have no wealth Converselydissavingspending more than current incomereduces the stock ofwealth because amounts saved in the past must be drawn downexisting assets sold or borrowing increased Not only does savingaffect the stock of wealth but wealth in turn influences thechoice to saveUnder the lifecycle model people save to accumulate assets tofinance future consumption and attaining their wealthtoincometarget depends in part on the rate of return anticipated Assetsaccumulated can generate income in the form of interest anddividends that in turn may be saved Moreover the change in networth not only includes the saving flow from current income butalso reflects changes in the market value of assets accumulated byhouseholds Economists generally agree that saving and wealth areinversely related increased wealth increases an individualsability to consume in the future and thus reduces the incentive tosave from current income In other words when households existingassets increase in value people can save less from current incomeand still achieve their wealthincome target If householdsexisting assets lose value people have to save more to attaintheir wealthincome target While the idea of wealthA nonsaver could get lucky and receive an inheritance or winthe lotterytargets may seem abstract to the average household increasedwealth clearly influences personal saving through traditionaldefinedbenefit pension plans For example gains on existingassets reduce the amount of an employers contribution necessary tofund its pension liabilityFigure  shows that even as the personal saving rate hasfallen the ratio of aggregate household net worth to

as the flow from saving In recent years nominal gains onhouseholds assetsparticularly financial assetshave dwarfed thesaving flow For example in  even though personal saving wasless than  billion

theory predicts that anticipated wealth changes wouldnot affect planned lifetime spending Likewise changes in wealthperceived to be temporary due to fluctuating market values ofassets would not affect planned spending However people canrespond to an unexpected increase in wealth that they think will bepermanent by spending more of their current income This change inspending in response to a change in wealth is called the wealtheffect Some people may tap their wealth by selling stocks orborrowing against their home equity to boost current consumptionThe wealth effect can also work in the opposite direction Adramatic drop in household wealthfor example due to an extendeddownturn in the stock marketcould eventually dampen householdconsumption and lead to an increase in savingThe increase in spending at any one time due to the wealtheffect would be expected to be small given a lifecycle saverstendency to spread consumption of a significant change in wealthover time Researchers estimate that each dollar in increasedwealth increases consumption by a few cents Estimates of thewealth effect range from  to  cents and the typical estimate isabout  to  cents A recent study

Personal Saving Rate Has DeclinedA With the personal saving rate around zero or negativeeconomists have questioned the relevance of the NIPA personalsaving measure Wealth measures which reflect the value ofexisting assets based on current market conditions show afundamentally different trend as illustrated in figure Although these supplementary measures may explain why individualhouseholds may choose to save less the NIPA personal saving rateshows that people are consuming virtually all of their currentincome and saving little for the futureIn evaluating the level of personal saving it is important todistinguish between saving as a source to finance the nationscapital formation and saving as a way for individual households tofinance future consumption A key difference between measuring thenations saving and gauging a households finances is the treatmentof changes in the market value of existing assets As discussed insection  it is saving from current incomenot gains on existingassetsthat is key to financing capital investment and increasingthe nations capacity to produce goods and services Although anindividual household can tap the increased value of its assets tofinance additional consumption or accumulate other assets byselling an asset to another household the transaction itselfshifts ownership of the existing asset and does not generate neweconomic output Thus the nation as a whole may not be able toconsume and invest more Moreover all households may not be ableto simultaneously tap their apparent wealth to finance consumptionbecause largescale asset sales could tend to depress marketvaluesTo some extent spending wealthlike spending incomedrivesdown the reported personal saving rate As discussed in Qrealized gains do not count as personal income but any taxes paidon such gains reduce disposable personal income and thus saving Ifhouseholds then spend a portion of their realized gains thisspending further reduces the saving residual and

However the sale of assets to foreigners can affect thenations ability to consume and investAlthough the personal saving rate is low economists do notagree on whether this is a problem or whether private saving isinadequate to finance domestic investment On the one hand someeconomists are concerned that low personal saving is undercuttingnational saving and leaving the United States more dependent onforeign capital inflows to maintain domestic investment On theother hand other economists have observed that strong consumerspendingboosted by low saving and the wealth effect discussedabovehas fueled the surge in business investment and strongeconomic growth in the US economy in recent years Someeconomists and analysts are concerned that individual householdsare living beyond their means and some may have been counting oncontinued high gains on their assets to finance future consumptionIf such expectations are not realized and for example there is asustained stock market downturn or an economic downturn householdsmay have to scale back their consumption This in turn couldpotentially slow economic growth given that household spendingrepresents about twothirds of the US economy However someresearchers suggest that the risk of a collapse in householdspending that would hurt overall economic growth is exaggeratedbecause households have greater resources than the personal savingrate suggests Although the aggregate wealthincome ratio rose in recent yearswealth is fairly concentrated and not all households haveexperienced gains in the stock market To gauge the

MeasuredA Just as for people saving for the national economy is theact of setting some of current income aside for the future insteadof spending it for current consumption In NIPA saving is measuredas current income less current consumption expenditures Nationalsaving is the sum of saving by households businesses and alllevels of government federal state and local For the economyas a whole national

used inthe futurethe capital stock and thus the nations capacity toproduce goods and services in the futureNational saving is measured in two waysgross national saving ornet national saving Gross national saving is a nations totalincome minus its consumption and represents resources available fordomestic or foreign investment Some portion of gross nationalsaving pays for replacing capital goods that have been worn out orused up in producing goods and servicesconsumption of fixedcapital in technical terms or hereafter simply depreciation Theother portion of gross national saving which is used to add to thenations stock of capital goods is net national saving Netnational saving is the measure commonly used to gauge whether thenations capacity to produce goods and services in the future isincreasing or decreasingBy itself the dollar amount of national saving is not aparticularly meaningful indicator of the portion of the nationsincome that is not consumed National saving is usually expressedas a share of the nationsInvestment in owneroccupied residential property is defined asbusiness investmentThis represents the current NIPA definition of investment usedthroughout this

Both Overall and by ComponentGross national saving is a good indicator of resources availableboth to replace old wornout capital goods with new and sometimesmore productive goods and  expand the capital stock The shareof gross national saving used to replace depreciated capital hasincreased over the past  years This increase in depreciationreflects a shift in the capital stocks composition from longlivedassets with relatively low depreciation rates like steel mills toshorterlived assets such as computers and software Even if grossnational saving were only sufficient to replace depreciatedcapital the economy could grow to some extent because replacingwornout and used capital with new equipment tends to bringimproved technology into the production process Neverthelessnational saving beyond the amount necessary to replace depreciatedcapital goods is important for increasing the overall size of thecapital stock and the nations future productive capacityA As figure  shows

see William G Gale and John SabelhausPerspectives on the Household Saving Rate Brookings Papers onEconomic Activity  pp in section  economists generally agree that wealthbasedmeasures that reflect changes in the value of existing assets areuseful for gauging individual households finances and retirementpreparations However it is uncertain whether wealthbasedmeasures are reliable for gauging the growth in the nationscapital stock and whether revaluation of existing assets shouldcount as saving for society as a whole Some portion of the changein the market value of existing assets may reflect increasedproductive capacity and thus could represent income and saving butit is difficult to isolate that portion Most gains and lossesfrom transferring assets within and between sectors wash out atthe national level and may not represent newly available resourcesfor the economy as a whole For example when one household sellsan appreciated asset to another household any gain realized may beused to finance the sellers consumption but the transaction doesnot increase the nations income or output Moreover the marketvalue of financial assets is often volatile and may not reflect areal permanent change in the productive potential of theunderlying capital assets Lastly some of the increased marketvalue of households stock holdings may stem from the use ofbusinesses retained earnings for investment which is alreadyreflected in NIPA saving and investmentAn assets market value can change as a result of changes intax treatment investors perceptions of risk taste orhouseholds

Contributeto Investment and Ultimately Economic GrowthA National saving provides the resources for a nation toinvest domestically and abroad Domestic investment in newfactories and equipment can boost productivity of the nationsworkforce Increased worker productivity in turn leads to higherreal wages and greater economic growth over the long term USinvestment abroad does not add to the domestic capital stock usedby US workers to produce goods and services US investmentabroad does increase the nations wealth and will generate incomeadding to US GNP When national saving is lower than domesticinvestment a nation can borrow from foreign savers to make up thedifference The resulting increase in domestic capital wouldenhance workers productivity and wages but the payments toforeign lenders flow abroad In general saving today increases anations capacity to produce more goods and services and generatehigher income in the future Increased economic capacity and risingincomes will be crucial as the population ages because a relativelysmaller workforce will bear the burden of financing Social Securityand Medicare while also seeking to maintain its own standard oflivingSaving entails a tradeoff because it requires consuming less nowin exchange for consuming more later While those who sacrifice tosave now can themselves enjoy higher consumption in the futuresome of the resulting increase in the nations capital stock andthe related income will also benefit future generations Thuscurrent saving and investment decisions have profound implicationsfor the level of wellbeing in the future and current generationsare in a sense stewards of the economy on behalf of futuregenerationsFigure  is a flow chart illustrating savings central role inproviding resources to invest in the capital needed to produce thenations goods and services In this simplified depiction of theproduction process capital and labor are the basic inputs used toproduce goods and services The

hassupplemented its saving and investment by borrowing fromabroadPage  GAOSP National SavingThe amount of goods and services produced depends not only onthe amount of capital and labor but also on how

swellafter  investment in new capital is an important way to raisethe productivity of the slowly growing labor force Investmentboosts labor productivity because workers can produce more per hourwhen they have more and better equipment and better skills capitaldeepening The essence of this point can be illustrated with asimple example Consider the transformation of ditchdigging from arelatively slow and somewhat imprecise process involving severalordinary shovels much labor effort and low skill levels to afaster and more precise process often involving a single powerdigger controlled by a skilled operator The elements of thisexample repeated across millions of individual tasks encapsulatesthe difference between an advanced industrial economy with a highstandard of living and a less developed country with a low standardof livingGrowth in output per worker also depends on total factorproductivity growth A higher rate of technological change andimproved efficiency in using labor and capital can boost GDP andthus future living standards Even if there were no netinvestmentthat is if gross investment were only enough to replacedepreciated capitalthe economy could grow to some extent becausethe new capital tends to embody improved technology However thereis no agreement on how to raise total factor productivity Spendingon education and RD is thought to help becauseWhile the aging of the population is a commonly voiced argumentfor raising national saving some analysts maintain that theprojected decline in labor force growth will increase thecapitallabor ratio and reduce the return to capital while raisingthe productivity of labor They conclude that under somecircumstances saving should actually decline slightly in responseto population aging Other analysts point out however that if theeconomy is operating below the optimal saving rate saving can risewithout overly depressing market rates of return and thereforeprovide significant improvement to future incomes In

contrast citizens companies and governments in anopen economy such as the United States can finance the gap betweendomestic investment and national saving with foreign investment inthe United States In essence the US economy can borrow thesaving of other countries to finance more investment than USnational saving would permit Figure  shows the differencebetween domestic investment and national saving which is definedin the NIPA as net foreign investment Over most of the s ands the US was able to invest more than it saved by attractingfinancing from abroad This means that the United States

desire to acquire foreign goods andservicesWhile using foreign investors saving allows US domesticinvestment to exceed national saving these financial inflows haveimplications for the nations economic growth and for future livingstandards This effect depends in part on how the borrowed fundsare used To the extent that borrowing from abroad financesdomestic investment the foreign borrowing adds to the nationscapital stock and boosts productive capacity This augments futureincome although a portion of the income generated by theinvestment will be paid to foreign lenders However if theborrowing from abroad is used to finance consumption shorttermwellbeing is improved but the ability to repay the borrowing in thefuture will not be enhanced In this respect US experience inthe s differs from that of the s Over the s mountingfederal deficits and the decline in personal saving reduced thesupply of national saving available for investment Althoughborrowing from abroad helped finance

longrun equilibrium increased saving and investmentyields a higher level of GDP per capita but does not boost workerproductivity and economic growth Permanently boosting the rate ofGDP growth would require everincreasing relative shares of savingandSince World War II annual growth in GDP per capita hasaveraged roughly  percent Of course growth was faster duringsome periodsthe s and s and the second half of thesand slower during other periodsthe sPage  GAOSP National Savinginvestment From a macroeconomic perspective any increase insaving up to the golden rule saving rate allows a nation toincrease consumption in the long run Below the golden rule ratesaving and investing more today permits increased consumptionSaving beyond the golden rule rate is counterproductive and wouldreduce consumption not only initially but also in the longtermHowever the nations saving rate is unlikely to reach the goldenrule level much less exceed it Given the steady decline in thepersonal saving rate it is doubtful that Americans would willinglyreduce consumption so much that the nation would be at risk ofsaving too much Estimates based on our longterm growth modelsuggest that the golden rule saving rate for the United Stateswould be more than  percent These estimates also suggest thatincreasing US national saving would not substantially decreasethe return to capital and therefore could provide significantimprovement to future incomes and consumption Although the goldenrule saving rate can be a useful analytical concept in evaluating anations saving the golden rule is not the best policy for savingMaximizing consumption per capita over the long term may not besocially optimal if people value current consumption more thanfuture consumption and discount the futureAnother way to gauge national saving is to estimate how much weneed to save to achieve specific national objectives In simpleterms the nation could act like a target saver For example akey target would be saving enough to afford the nations costs forsupporting the aging population Boosting saving and GDP isunlikely to prevent a rise in the share of GDP devoted togovernment spending on the elderly because economic growth alsotends to increase health spending and raise retirement benefitsalthough with a lengthy lag for the latter A more realistic goalwould be to increase saving by an amount that would generate a risein future GDP equivalent to the increase in spending on theelderly Recent economic research estimated that increasing savingas a share of GDP by one percentage point above the  rate wouldboost GDP enough to cover  percent of the increase in elderlycosts between now and  This isThe golden rule saving rate maximizes consumption per capitaover the long run For a more extensive

futuregenerations to better afford the nations retirement costs whilealso enjoying higher standards of livingSection National Saving and the GovernmentQ How Has Federal Fiscal PolicyAffectedUS National SavingA Federal fiscal policy affects the federal surplus ordeficit which when measured on a NIPA basis represents the amountof federal government saving or dissaving which in turn directlyaffects national saving Federal deficits subtract from nationalsaving by absorbing funds saved by households businesses andother levels of government that would otherwise be available forinvestment To finance a budget deficit the federal governmentborrows from the public by issuing debt securities adding to itsdebt held by the public Conversely federal surpluses asmeasured under NIPA add to national saving and increase resourcesavailable for investment When a budget surplus occurs the federalgovernment can use excess funds to reduce the debt held by thepublicText box  explains how the NIPA surplus or deficit differsfrom the federal unified budget surplus or deficit While the NIPAmeasure reflects how government saving affects national savingavailable for investment the unified budget measure is the morecommon frame of reference for discussing federal fiscal policyissues Given that the two measures are roughly similar as a shareof GDP in this section we use the unified budget measure unlessotherwise specifiedFederal debt held by the public is also called publicly helddebt but is not the same as public debt Debt held by the publicplus debt held by government accounts such as budget trust fundscompose gross federal debt For more information see Federal DebtAnswers to Frequently Asked QuestionsAn Update GAOOCG MayPage  GAOSP National SavingText Box  How do the NIPA and federal unified budgetconcepts of federal surpluses and deficits differIn  the NIPA federal surplus was  percent of GDP whilethe unified budget surplus was  percent Although the twomeasures are roughly similar there are some conceptualdifferences The federal unified budget measure is generally a cashor cashequivalent measure in which receipts are recorded whenreceived and expenditures are recorded when paid regardless of theaccounting period in which the receipts are earned or the costsincurred Thus the unified surplus reflects the difference betweenfederal receipts and all federal government outlays including thoseused to purchase capital goods such as roads buildings andweapons systems The NIPA federal budget surplus however reflectsthe current or operating account of the federal government anddoes not count purchases of capital goods as current spendingInstead NIPA includes a depreciation charge consumption ofgeneral government fixed capital in current spending as a proxyfor the contribution of capital to the output of governmentservicesThe NIPA and federal unified budget measures also differ intheir treatment of federal employees pension programs In theunified budget federal employee pension benefits are recorded asoutlays when paid in cash these outlays are offset in whole or inpart by the governments and employees contributions to thepension programs NIPA on the other hand counts the governmentscontribution to the pension programs as an outlay to the householdsector where the contribution is added to personal income andsaving The benefits paid by the pension programs are not countedas government outlays under NIPA but rather as a drawdown ofaccumulated household assetsOther differences between the unified budget and NIPA measuresarise because NIPA focuses on current income and production withinthe United States For example NIPA excludes capital transferslike estate tax receipts which are recorded as revenue in theunified budget and investment grantsinaid to state and localgovernments which the unified budget records as outlays Lastlyrevenue and spending related to Puerto Rico the Virgin Islandsand other US territories are counted in the federal unifiedbudget but not in NIPAThe unified budget measure is useful in explaining annualchanges in the federal debt held by the public The NIPA measure isuseful in explaining how government saving has affected netnational saving available for investment Again these measuresyield roughly similar estimates of the federal governments budgetposition as a share of GDP In order to provide a consistent frameof reference for discussing federal fiscal policy issues thissection refers to the unified budget measure unless otherwisespecifiedNote For more details see Laura M Beall and

and local government savingof about  percentage pointsPage  GAOSP National SavingQ Why Do Government and Private SavingTend to Move in Opposite DirectionsA Government and private saving tend to move in oppositedirections for several reasonsthree of which are discussed hereFirst federal borrowing can be large enough to affect currentinterest rates which in turn may influence private saving andinvestment Government dissaving absorbs funds available forprivate investment and puts upward pressure on interest ratesHigher interest rates both raise the return on saving and reducethe market value of existing financial assets issued when rateswere lower The combination of higher returns to saving andreduced wealth might encourage households and businesses to savemore Conversely an increase in government saving adds to thesupply of resources available for investment and may put downwardpressure on interest rates Lower interest rates both reduce thereturn on saving and increase the market value of existingfinancial assets issued when rates were higher Lower returns tosaving and increased wealth might dampen private savingSecond if federal budget surpluses are achieved in partthrough higher taxes those higher taxes reduce householdsdisposable personal income As discussed in section  disposablepersonal income is the aftertax personal income includinggovernment transfer payments available for households consumptionand saving Households may choose to save less of their disposableincome and maintain their current level of consumption especiallyif they consider the higher tax payments to be temporary Reducedpersonal saving would tend to offset the increased governmentsaving due to higher taxesThird some economists believe that government saving has someeffect on households expectations about future tax rates evenacross generations This Ricardian equivalence hypothesis holdsthat people are forwardlooking and recognize that currentgovernment surpluses or deficits affect government debt and futuretax rates Thus when the government runs deficits and accumulatesdebt Ricardian consumers would save more to ensure that they ortheir descendants can pay the expected higher future taxesAlternatively when the government runsFor example market prices of interestbearing securities suchas Treasury securities fluctuate inversely with market interestrates The market price of a Treasury security falls when thecurrent interest rate on Treasury securities of equal maturityrisesAlthough this view is named after the th century economistDavid Ricardo who first explored the possible relationship theseminal work on this theory is Robert Barro Are Government BondsNet Wealth Journal of Political Economy Vol  No  pp Q What Is the LongTerm Outlook forFederal Government SavingDissavingsurpluses and reduces debt held by the public as in through  Ricardian consumers would save less in anticipationof future tax cuts If all consumers were fully Ricardian privatesaving would fully offset any change in government saving andnational saving would be unchanged Economists continue to debatehow well the Ricardian equivalence theory works in practice Peoplemay be too shortsighted in their saving decisions to look ahead tothe implications of current government debt on future generationsWhen federal budget deficits and debt mounted in the s privatesaving declinedthe opposite of what the Ricardian equivalencehypothesis would suggest However in recent years as figure illustrates private savingwhich is the major component ofnonfederal savingdeclined as federal saving rosewhich isconsistent with the Ricardian equivalence hypothesisIn summary it is unclear how much each additional dollar ofgovernment saving will ultimately increase national savingEvidence shows that changes in saving by households and businessestend to offset some of the changes in government saving Whileeconomists disagree over the magnitude of the private savingoffset studies generally suggest it is less than oneforone Thismeans that for each additional dollar of government savingaggregate private saving falls by less than a dollar To whatextent the aggregate offset is due to the changes in interestrates wealth disposable personal income expectations of futuretax rates or other reasons is ambiguous Estimating the privatesaving offset is complicated by the fact that individuals mayrespond differently to changes in government savingA While media attention has focused on budget surplusesprojected for the next  years the longterm outlook for federalgovernment saving has received considerably less attention Theoutlook for government saving over the next  years is subject towide ranging uncertainty due to economic changes and futurelegislation However one certainty is that as life expectancyrises and the baby boom generation retires the US populationwill age and fewer workers will support each retiree TheFor example some households live paychecktopaycheck andmight spend all of a tax cut whereas other households might spendonly a portion a Ricardian household might save all of a tax cutin anticipation of future tax increases For further discussionabout accommodating consumer behavior in modeling fiscal policysee N Gregory Mankiw The SaverSpender Theory of Fiscal PolicyNBER Working Paper  February Page  GAOSP National Savingfederal budget will increasingly be driven by demographictrends Absent changes to current law government saving is likelyto decline as government health and retirement programs for

as the flow of personal saving affects the stock offinancial assets accumulated by households government savingaffects the stock of federal debt The federal government borrowsfrom the public to finance a deficit Conversely when a budgetsurplus occurs the federal government can use excess funds toreduce the debt held by the public accumulate cash balances oracquire nonfederal financial assets Holding cash or nonfederalfinancial assets would not reduce debt held by the public but wouldreduce the net debt of the federal government Net debt representsthe federal governments total financial liabilities includingdebt held by the public less its total financial assets Positiveamounts of net debt reflect how much of the nations private wealthhas been absorbed to finance federal deficits Negative amounts ofnet debt reflect how much of the nations private financial assetshave been acquired by the federal governmentAcquiring nonfederal financial assets could be another way totranslate budget surpluses into resources available for investmentHowever the issue of the federal ownership of nonfederal assets iscontroversial Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan among othershas expressed concern that there would be tremendous politicalpressure to steer the federal governments asset selection toachieve economic social or political purposes Although thegovernance issues may not be insurmountable another possibleconcern is that the federal government could become the largestsingle investorThere is a growing body of experience by other governments thatmight help policymakers address the question of whether and how thefederal government can or should acquire nonfederal financialinstruments Investing in the financial markets is a standardpractice for state and local government pension funds in the UnitedStates Also other nations have decided that the potential risksof political interference can be managed and are outweighed by whatthose nations perceive as the risk of failing to save for thefuture or provide a cushion for contingencies In the future weplan to study how other nations invest in nongovernmental assets tolearn more about how they deal with governance and other issuesNote The net debt concept is based on the OECD definition ofnet financial liabilities that can be calculated by subtractingfinancial assets from financial liabilitiesIn recent years the fiscal policy debate has focused on theimportance of saving the Social Security portion of projectedunified budget surpluses While policymakers appear to havegenerally agreed to save

Q What Policies of the FederalGovernment Have Been Aimed at Encouraging Nonfederal Saving andInvestmentmany purposes but one of its primary functions is to controlobligations upfront before the

represent resourcestaken out of the private sector for use by the government Somehave argued that the budget may actually favor shorttermconsumption because the cost of both must be scored upfront aspart of the Budget Enforcement Act process even though most of thebenefits from investment programs accrue in the future In thepast GAO has suggested that the budget could better facilitatepolicymakers weighing choices between federal investment andconsumption by incorporating an investment component withagreedupon levels of investment spending This could promote theconsideration of spending intended to benefit the economy over thelong term while maintaining overall fiscal discipline As theCongress moves to modify the federal budget process with theexpiration of the Budget Enforcement Act attention is warranted asto how the process considers the longterm implications ofalternative spending choicesA Although increasing government saving is the most

Saving Tax Incentives Are Effective InIncreasing Personal Saving Overall How Do These Tax IncentivesAffect National Savingprovisions may increase saving because more people may choose toparticipate and to contribute larger amounts Yet borrowing andearly withdrawals can ultimately reduce individuals retirementincome There would be little benefit to national saving fromallowing early access to mandatory accounts with set contributionlevelswhich has been proposed for Social Security see Q andQA The net effect on national saving depends on whether a taxincentive induces enough additional saving by households to make upfor the governments revenue loss To gain a better understandingof how tax incentives affect national saving look at one examplehow a tax deduction for a traditional taxdeferred IRA may affectgovernment and ultimately national saving For simplicity considera married couple in which neither spouse is covered by anemployersponsored pension plan and each contributes themaximum per person per year allowed under current lawto atraditional IRA As shown in table  how much the couples annual contribution adds to national saving that yeardepends on  how much their IRA tax deduction costs thegovernment and  whether their contributions represent new savingor were shifted from existing assets Further assume forsimplicity that our hypothetical couples marginal tax rate is percent so their deduction costs the federal government  percent of  In other words government saving decreases by or government dissaving increases by that amount dependingon the governments surplusdeficit position for the year If thecouple would have otherwise spent the  ie theircontributions represent new saving national saving would increaseby the  increase in personal saving less the decrease in government saving At the other extreme if the couplemerely shifted the funds from another account or asset to the IRAsie no increase in personal saving national saving would fallby the amount of the governments tax loss The actual change innational saving probably falls somewhere between these twoexamples Table  also provides a third scenariothe impact onnational saving if about  percent of the couples contributionsrepresent new saving In this case national saving would dropslightly but the couple would have saved more and expresslyearmarked more of their assets for retirementk Pension Plans Loan Provisions Enhance ParticipationBut May Affect Income Security for Some GAOHEHS October Page  GAOSP National SavingNote This table illustrates a hypothetical couple in whichneither spouse is covered by an employersponsored retirement planand each contributes  to a traditional IRA Their  IRAcontributions are fully deductible If either spouse is covered byan employersponsored plan their contributions may not be fullydeductible depending on their incomeaChange in personal saving depends on how much of the  IRAcontribution represents new saving These assumptions were drawnfrom three papers presented in the Fall  Journal of EconomicPerspectives see footnote bChange in government saving represents tax revenue loss infirst year due solely to tax deduction for IRA contribution Amountdoes not include revenue forgone as a result of taxdeferral oninvestment income Taxes on contribution and investment income aredeferred until amounts are withdrawncChange in national saving represents the sum of the change inpersonal and government saving for a simplified example focused onone household and one type of IRA The ultimate effect of any taxincentive on national saving would depend on how households inaggregate respondSource GAO analysis based on  individual income tax ratesand IRS publication  Individual Retirement ArrangementsTable  also shows the effect on national saving oftaxdeductible IRA contributions under different tax brackets Ifour hypothetical couple were in the highest income tax bracket andtheir contributions represented all new saving their deduction would cost the government  and add  tonational saving If they were in the lowest tax bracket theirdeduction would cost the government  and add as much as to national saving Of course this simplified example focuses onone household and one type of IRA The ultimate effect of any taxincentive on national saving would depend on how households inaggregate respond A tax incentive for retirement saving mayencourage some households to save more while encouraging others toshift their existing balances into taxpreferred accountsAgain the net effect of a tax incentive on national savingdepends on whether the tax incentive induces enough additionalpersonal saving to make up for the governments revenue loss Asillustrated in table  deductions for taxpayers in higher taxbrackets are more costly for the government Although deductionsfor lowerincome taxpayers appear to yield a greater net increasein national saving because they are less costly for the governmentthey also offer relatively less incentive for lowerincome familiesto save Low and moderateincome households have fewer resourcesand may have less capacity to contribute to an IRA or to earmarkmore assets for retirement Most people saving through taxpreferredretirement accounts are middle to upperincome Althoughhigherincome households might be encouraged to save more byincreasing the annual contribution limits to IRAs andemployersponsored k planscurrently  and respectivelyincreasing contribution limits alone is not likely toinduce more saving from lowincome households Nonrefundable taxincentives may not be particularly effective in encouraging savingby lowerincome taxpayers who already owe relatively little or nofederal income taxesIn recent years policymakers have

to save forretirement For example President Clintons  RetirementSavings Accounts RSAs proposal would have provided governmentmatching on voluntaryPage  GAOSP National Savingretirement contributions for low and moderateincomefamilies Under the RSA proposal a worker between the ages of and  with family earnings of at least  could contribute upto  annually through either an employersponsored saving planor a taxdeferred individual account A worker earning up to was to receive a twotoone  percent match on thefirst  contributed each year and a onetoone match percent on additional contributions The progressive matchingformula was to phase down as income increased A worker earningbetween  and  was to receive a  percent match onthe first  contributed and additional contributions Forindividuals who did not owe federal income taxes the governmentmatch was to be in the form of a tax credit to the employer orfinancial institution holding the taxpayers account Although theRSAs were aimed at accumulating assets for retirement the proposalwould have allowed limited withdrawals after  years for suchpurposes as buying a home or paying educational or medicalexpensesAt this time it is unclear how new taxsubsidized savingaccounts might affect personal saving and ultimately nationalsaving Like any tax incentive matching tax credits would clearlyreduce federal revenue and government saving The tax credits bythemselves would have no net effect on national saving absent anychange in household consumption personal saving would increase bythe amount of the government match but government saving woulddecrease by the same amount Of course the purpose of matching isto change household behavior Government matching of voluntarycontributions could increase national saving if these incentivesindeed induce people to save more A progressive match providinga higher match for lowincome workers and eliminating the match forhighincome workerswould serve to target lowincomePresident Clintons  Universal Savings Accounts USAproposal would have created a more costly centralized system ofaccounts with a flat annual general tax credit of up to  forlow and moderateincome workers plus a  to  percentgovernment match on voluntary contributions Lowincome workerswere to receive a onetoone match on their contributions and thematch progressively declined based on income so that higherincomeworkers would receive a lower match or none at allContribution limits and eligibility thresholds for RSAs for acouple were twice the amount for an individual For example acouple could contribute up to  annuallyDepending on the design and implementation governmentmatching could potentially reduce national saving For example ahousehold could transfer amounts from existing assets to get thegovernment match and then increase consumption in response to itsincreased wealthQ What Is the Federal Government Doingto Educate the Public About Why Saving Mattersworkers who now receive

more meansforgoing consumption today in order to consume more in the futureHowever this tradeoff between todays consumption and tomorrowsconsumption is somewhat different for an individual than for thenation When an individual delays retirement saving thatindividual enjoys the additional consumption in the early years andthen personally bears the burden of saving larger amounts laterworking longer or accepting a lower standard of living inretirement From the nations perspective if current generationsforgo saving for their retirement costs they also forgo investmentopportunities and the economic growth that would result Thereforetheir saving choices affect not only their own retirement incomebut also potentially affect the standard of living for futureworkers Greater economic growth

payroll taxesand investing trust fund surpluses in higheryielding assets Inaddition some proposals would fundamentally alter the programstructure by setting up individual retirement accountsBefore trying to explore how various reform options might affectnational saving it is useful to highlight how the current SocialSecurity program affects personal saving the Social Security trustfund and government savingPersonal saving As discussed in Q some evidencesuggests that the existence of Social Security may have reducedpersonal saving The retirement benefits promised under current lawreduce the amount people believe they need to save on their own forretirement Although some may view their payroll tax contributionsas a form of retirement saving workers need to understand thattheir contributions are not deposited into interestbearingaccounts for each individual but are largely used to financecurrent benefitsSocial Security trust fund In the federal budget atrust fund is simply an accounting mechanism to record earmarkedreceipts and expenditures From Social Securitys perspectiveits annual cash surpluses are saved in the trust fund and thetrust fund balance represents resources accumulated to help payfuture benefits However the accumulation and exhaustion of thetrust funds balance does not reflect how Social Security financesaffect federal government and national saving The extent to whichcash surpluses saved in the Social Security trust fund translateinto increased national saving depends on federal saving as awhole Although the trust fund appears solvent

budgetary flexibility over the long runshown in figure In evaluating reform proposals it is important to considerwhether a reform package will truly increase national saving andgrow the economic pie From a macroeconomic perspectiveincreasing the trust funds balance without underlying reformdoes nothing to enhance the governments fiscal capacity to financefuture benefits For example crediting additional securities tothe trust fund or increasing the interest rate paid on the trustfunds securities would commit additional future general revenue tothe Social Security program but does not increase the governmentsoverall revenue or reduce its costsReforms that reallocate the composition of the nations savingand asset portfolio may serve only to redistribute the existingpie For example

governments asset holdings but doesnot directly increase national saving As we reported in potentially higher returnsalbeit with greater riskon thegovernments stock holdings could boost Social Securitys financingand reduce the size of other revenue increases or benefitDuring the late s and early s Social Securitysexpenditures regularly exceeded revenues causing a rapid declinein the trust

GAOSP National Savingreductions needed to restore solvency Acquiring stocks orother nonfederal financial assets would have approximately the sameeffect on national saving as using the same amount of money toreduce debt held by the public If reducing federal debt held bythe public is not an option as discussed in text box investing in nonfederal financial assets on behalf of the SocialSecurity trust fund could be another way for government saving toprovide resources for private investmentMost traditional reform options involve workers paying more forpromised benefits or getting lower benefits From the governmentsperspective increasing payroll taxes or reducing benefits wouldimprove Social Securitys finances and increase governmentsavingassuming no other changes in government spending or taxesThe ultimate effect of Social Security reform on national savingdepends on complex interactions between government saving andpersonal savingboth through pension funds and by individuals ontheir own behalf The way in which Social Security is reformed willinfluence both the magnitude and timing of any increase in nationalsaving To illustrate the complexities in evaluating howtraditional program reforms might affect national saving letsexamine two basic options that would directly improve SocialSecuritys financial imbalanceincreasing payroll taxes andreducing benefits Payroll tax increases At first glance increasing payrolltaxes appears to be a straightforward way to increase saving now totake advantage of compounding growth Payroll tax increases areeasy to implement and directly improve the trust funds financesHowever the extent to which payroll tax increases would translateinto increased government saving depends on whether the cashgenerated by the payroll tax increase is used to finance newspending or a general tax cut Thus increased Social Securitysurpluses will not necessarily increase government saving Even ifthe federal government saves all of the increased Social Securitysurpluses national saving would not increase dollarfordollarChanges in personal saving may counterbalance any increase ingovernment saving resulting from higher taxes Higher payroll taxesmay depress personal saving to the extent that households have lessdisposable income to save How people adjust their saving inresponse to payroll tax increases may also depend on the form ofthe increaseSocial Security Financing Implications of Government StockInvesting for the Trust Fund the Federal Budget and the EconomyGAOAIMDHEHS April  Page  GAOSP National SavingRaising the payroll tax rate would affect all workers whereasincreasing the maximum taxable earning level would affecthighincome earners Benefit reductions Options reducing initial benefits orraising the retirement age take time to implement or phase inallowing time for people to adjust their retirement plans Reducingfuture benefits obviously reduces future spending for SocialSecurity retirement benefits and stems government dissaving Atfirst glance reducing future benefits promised to current workerswould not seem to increase resources available to invest nowHowever changes in personal saving may complement any increase ingovernment saving resulting from benefit reductions If SocialSecurity reform reduces anticipated retirement income manyanalysts expect that workers might to some degree want to offsetthis effect by increasing their saving outside the Social Securitysystem If people adjust their retirement plan to reflect benefitreductions increased personal saving today could provide newresources to invest For example raising the retirement agereduces benefits and could induce some individuals to save more nowin order to retire before they are eligible for SocialSecurityIn evaluating a Social Security reform proposal it is importantto consider that increasing national saving is one criterion inassessing the extent to which the proposal achieves sustainablesolvency Beyond weighing how a proposal would affect the federalbudget and the economy policymakers need to consider the balancestruck between the twin goals of income adequacy level andcertainty of benefits and individual equity rates of return onindividual contributions Reform elements that could increasenational saving may not satisfy these adequacy and equity goalsFor example benefit cuts depending on how they are structuredcould leave those most reliant on Social Security with inadequateretirement income Also increasing payroll taxes reduces theimplicit rate of return for future beneficiaries It is crucial toevaluate the effects of an entire reform package consideringinteractions between individual reform elements as well as how thepackage as a whole achieves policymakers most important goals forSocial SecurityFor more information about the analytical framework forassessing Social Security reform proposals offered by GAO seeSocial Security Criteria for Evaluating Social Security ReformProposals GAOTHEHS March   and Social SecurityEvaluating Reform Proposals GAOAIMDHEHS November Page  GAOSP National SavingQ How Would Establishing IndividualAccounts Affect National SavingA Evaluating the potential effect of proposals to establishindividual accounts can be confusing Various proposals have beenadvanced that would create a new system of individual accounts aspart of comprehensive Social Security reform while other proposalswould create new accounts outside of Social Security Individualaccount proposals also differ as to whether individualsparticipation would be mandatory or voluntary As we havepreviously reported the extent to which individual accounts wouldaffect national saving depends on how they are financed how theprogram is structured and how people adjust their own savingbehavior in response to individual accountsTo understand how individual accounts might affect nationalsaving it is necessary to examine the firstorder effectsaccounting for how the government might fund the accounts and thento consider how people might adjust their saving in response to anew account programOne important determinant of the effect on national saving isthe funding source for the individual accounts Shifting funds fromthe federal government would affect the relative contributions ofthe federal government and households to national saving Forinstance diverting funding from the Social Security trustfundsuch as a carveout from current payroll taxeswould likelyreduce government saving by the same amount that the accountsincrease personal saving Although national saving would beunchanged financing of the Social Security program absent otherchangeswould be worsened If accounts are funded outside of theSocial Security system using general revenues the effect onnational saving is unclear and would depend on what would have beendone instead with the general funds If the general funds would have been used to redeem federaldebt held by the public or acquire nonfederal financial assetsnational saving initially would be unchanged because personalsaving would increase by the amount that government savingdecreases In a sense individual accounts could serve as a way tochannel saving through the government into resources for privateinvestment while avoiding issues associated with governmentownership of nonfederal assetsSee Social Security Capital Markets and Educational IssuesAssociated With Individual Accounts GAOGGD June Page  GAOSP National SavingIf the general funds would have been spent on additionalgovernment consumption then any increase in personal saving due tothe individual accounts would represent an increase in nationalsaving If the general funds would have been used forinfrastructure investment national saving would be unchanged butmore funds would be available for private investmentIf the general funds would have been used for a generaltax cut then national saving would initially increase becausepersonal saving would increase by the amount of individual accountswhereas some portion of a tax cut would be consumedNational saving also would be affected by how households andbusinesses respond to individual accounts Regardless of thefinancing source the effect of individual accounts would be toraise at least to some extent the level of personal saving unlesshouseholds fully offset the new accounts by reducing their othersaving Households for whom individual accounts closely resembleks and IRAs and who are currently saving as much as theychoose for retirement would probably reduce their own saving in thepresence of individual accounts The extent of the behavioraleffects would depend in part on the structure of the individualaccount program and any limits on accessing the funds Forinstance mandatory account proposals are more likely to increaseprivate saving because such a program would require households thatdo not currently savesuch as many lowincome individuals orfamiliesto place some amount in an individual accountProhibitions or restrictions on borrowing or other forms ofpreretirement distributions could limit the ability of somehouseholds to reduce their other saving in response to individualaccounts In addition to the effects on household saving choicesindividual accounts may also affect the relationship andinteractions between Social Security and private pensionsSocial Security Reform Implications for Private PensionsGAOHEHS September  Page  GAOSP National SavingQ How Would Medicare Reform AffectNational SavingA As we have reported the current Medicare programwithout improvements is illsuited to serve future generations ofAmericans The program is fiscally unsustainable in its currentform and growing Medicare spending is expected to drive federalgovernment dissaving over the long run Despite this loomingfinancial problem pressure is mounting to update Medicaresoutdated benefit design Given the aging of the US population andthe increasing cost of modern medical technology it is inevitablethat demands on the Medicare program will growIn addition to the aging population and the increasing cost ofmodern medical technology the current Medicare program lacksincentives to control health care consumption The actual costs ofhealth care are not transparent and thirdparty payers generallyinsulate consumers from the cost of health care decisions Intraditional Medicare for example the effect of costsharingprovisions designed to curb the use of services is muted becausemany Medicare beneficiaries have some form of supplemental healthcare coveragesuch as Medigap insurancethat pays these costs Forthese reasons among others Medicare presents a great fiscalchallenge over the long termIn the past Medicares fiscal health has

fundamental differences between healthcare wants which are virtually unlimited needs which should bedefined and addressed and overall affordability which has alimit Realistically reforms to address

governmentspending and taxes However the effect of reduced federalMedicare spending on national saving depends on how the privatesector responds to the reductions For example greater privatespending for elderly health careby beneficiaries themselves or byemployers and insurers on beneficiaries behalfcould offset someor all of the improvement in government saving in the short runOver time personal saving could increase if individuals choose tosave more to pay for health care in their old ageSection National Saving and Current Policy IssuesQ What Are Key Issues in EvaluatingNational SavingA Each generation is a steward for the economy it bequeathsto future generations and the nations longterm economic futuredepends in part on todays decisions about consumption and savingThe federal government has gone from the budget deficits of recentdecades to surplus as a result of a growing economy and difficultdecisions to reduce deficits  We appearat least for the nearfutureto have slain the deficit dragon However todays fiscalgood fortune will not survive over the long run If the prospect ofsurpluses over the next decade lulls us into complacency thenation could face daunting demographic challenges without havingchanged the path of programs for the elderly or having built theeconomic capacity to bear the costs of the programs as currentlystructuredEconomic growth will help society bear the burden of financingSocial Security and Medicare but it alone will not solve thelongterm fiscal challenge Increasing the nations economiccapacity is a longterm process Thus saving now and makingmeaningful Social Security and Medicare reform sooner rather thanlater are important Because every generation is in partresponsible for the economy it passes on to the next todaysfiscal policy choices must be informed by the longterm Commonsense tells us that the nation needs to save more when it has ahealthy economy sufficient resources to meet some current needswhile still building our capacity for the future and a relativelylarge workforce National saving pays future dividendsbut we needto begin soon to permit compounding to work for usFrom a macroeconomic perspective it does not matter who doesthe savingany mix of increased saving by households businessesand government would help to grow the economic pie Yet in lightof the virtual disappearance of personal saving concerns aboutUS reliance on borrowing from abroad to finance domesticinvestment and the looming fiscal pressures of an agingpopulation now is an opportune time for the federal government tosave some portion of its anticipated budget surpluses Higherfederal savingto the extent that the increased government savingis not offset by reduced private savingwould increase nationalsaving and tend to improve the nations current account balancealthough typically not on a dollarfordollar basisIn considering how much of the anticipated budget surpluses tosave policy choices must balance todays unmet needs andtomorrows fiscal challenges Saving the surpluses would allow thefederal government to reduce the debt overhang from past deficitspending and enhance future budgetary flexibility Choices aboutfederal spending for infrastructure education and RD as wellas tax incentives for private saving and investment also haveimplications for future economic growthIncreased government saving and entitlement reform gohandinhand Over the long term the federal government cannotavoid massive dissaving without reforming retirement and healthprograms for the elderly Increasing national saving and thuslongterm economic growth is crucial to the longterm sustainablesolvency of Social Security and Medicare Since the economyprovides the tax base for the government economic growth increasesgovernment revenue which helps finance these programs as well asother federal programs and activities and increases budgetflexibility But saving and economic growth alone cannot solve thelooming demographic challenges Saving the Social Securitysurplusesand even the Medicare surplusesis not enough by itselfto finance the governments commitments to the elderly Programreform is needed as well or Social Security and Medicare willconstitute a heavy drain on the earnings of future workers In asense saving more yields a bigger pie but policymakers will stillface the difficult choice of how to divide the pie between retireesand workersThe federal government can also undertake steps to encouragepersonal saving Saving education campaigns are one tool toencourage people to save more for their own retirement Toparticipate in the debate over how to reform Social Security andMedicare the public needs to understand the difficult choices thenation faces Announcing any benefits changes sooner rather thanlater would make it easier for individuals to plan for retirementand to adjust their saving behavior accordingly The federalgovernment can explore how to design tax incentives that inducehouseholds to save enough to make up for the governments revenueloss and the lower government saving that would resultAppendix IObjectives Scope and MethodologyPersonal Saving Household Wealth andRetirement SecurityThis report is designed to present information about nationalsaving and its implications for economic growth and retirementsecurity Specifically this report addresses the followingquestions  What is personal saving how is it related tonational saving and what are the implications of low personalsaving for Americans retirement security  What is nationalsaving and how does current saving in the United States compare tohistorical trends and saving in other countries  How doesnational saving affect the economy and how would higher savingaffect the longterm outlook  How does federal fiscal policyaffect national saving what federal policies have been aimed atincreasing private saving and how would Social Security andMedicare reform affect national saving And  what are keyissues in evaluating national savingBecause this report focuses on the macroeconomic implications ofsaving and investment we used saving data from the National Incomeand Product Accounts NIPA compiled by the Bureau of EconomicAnalysis BEA This report presents the trend in the personalsaving rate as measured on a NIPA basis As a comparison point wealso examined an alternative personal saving rate available fromthe Federal Reserves Flow of Funds Accounts FFA Because FFAcounts household purchases of consumer durables as saving the FFApersonal saving rate is somewhat higher than the NIPA personalsaving rate but also shows a downward trend Both the NIPA and FFAmeasures focus on saving as a flow from the economys currentproduction and do not include changes in the market value ofhouseholds existing portfolios For information about the stock ofwealth accumulated by households we obtained net worth data fromthe FFAs balance sheet aggregated for the household sector Inaddition

encompassspending on education as well as research and development Theseare not included in the conventional NIPA measures but are relatedto longterm productive capacityWe used our longterm economic growth model to simulatealternative fiscal policies and national saving rates Longtermsimulations are useful for comparing the potential outcomes ofalternative saving rates within a common economic framework Suchsimulations can help policymakers assess the longterm consequencesof fiscal policy and saving choices made todayWhile longterm simulations provide a useful perspective theyshould be interpreted carefully Given the range of uncertaintyabout future economic changes and the responses to those changesthe simulation results should not be viewed as forecasts ofbudgetary or economic outcomes  or  years in the futureRather they should be seen only as illustrations of the differentbudget and economic outcomes associated with alternative fiscalpolicy and saving paths based on common demographic and economicassumptionsIn our simulations we used a model originally developed byeconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that relateslongterm economic growthmeasured in terms of gross domesticproduct GDPto economic and budget factors The key interactionbetween the budget and the economy is the effect of the federaldeficitsurplus on the amount of national saving available

other periodsthe s Doubling GDP percapita every  years represents a way to gauge whether futuregenerations will enjoy a rise in living standards comparable tothat enjoyed by previous generationsWhile this report discusses the potential consequences ofalternative saving paths it does not suggest any particular courseof action The choice of the most appropriate fiscal policy path isa policy decision

businessesWe did our work in accordance with generally accepted governmentauditing standards from December  through May  inWashingtonDC We requested comments from BEA OMB and several subjectmatter experts Staff from BEA and OMB and the experts we consultedprovided technical and clarifying comments which we incorporatedin this report where appropriateAppendix IIThe Economic Model and Key AssumptionsIn this report we simulated the effect of different savingrates on the nations standard of living using a standard model ofeconomic growth originally developed by economists at the FederalReserve Bank of New York The major determinants of economic growthin the model are changes in the labor force capital formation andthe growth in total factor productivity To analyze the effect offiscal policy on saving and growth we modified the original modelto include a set of relationships that describe the federal budgetand its links to the economy using the framework of the NationalIncome and Product Accounts NIPA To isolate the effect ofchanges in saving on growth we varied the saving rate while usingthe same assumptions for the growth in the labor force and totalfactor productivityThe model is helpful for exploring the longterm implications ofnational saving and fiscal policy and for comparing alternativepaths within a common economic framework Since  GAO hasprovided the Congress with a longterm perspective on alternativefiscal policy paths The results provide illustrations rather thanprecise forecasts of the economic outcomes associated withalternative policy or saving rate assumptions The model depictsthe links between saving and the economy over the long term anddoes not reflect their interrelationships during shorttermbusiness cycles We have made several simplifying assumptions suchas holding interest rates and total factor productivity growthconstant but sensitivity analyses suggest that variations in theseassumptions generally would not affect the relative outcomes ofalternative policies These simulations are not predictions of whatwill happen in the future as policymakers would likely take actionto prevent damaging outyear fiscal and economic consequencesOverview of the Model In the model GDP isdetermined by the labor force capital stock and total factorproductivity GDP in turn influences nonfederal

togethercompose national saving which influences investment and the nextperiods capital stock Capital combines with labor and totalfactor productivity to determine GDP in the next period and theprocess continuesThe model allows us to focus on the contribution of nationalsaving to output and living standards through the linkage betweensaving and the capital stock In particular the model provides auseful framework for assessing the longterm implications ofalternative budget policies through their effect on nationalsaving Our model does not differentiate between tax policy changesand spending changes The aggregate effect on the amount of federalgovernment saving is what affects the level of national saving andeconomic growth Federal surpluses increase national saving whiledeficits reduce national saving and higher saving translates intohigher GDP Higher GDP in turn lessens the share of the nationsoutput dedicated to government transfer programs in our modelingbecause we use a simplifying assumption that such programs do notsimply keep pace with overall economic growthIn our simulations we make the simplifying assumption that thecombined saving rate of the household business and state andlocal government sectors will remain constant throughout thesimulation period at  percent of GDPaverage nonfederal savingas a share of GDP since  Future saving rates of these sectorswill of course vary in response to a variety of influences such asdemographics expectations and changes in preferencesNonetheless this simplifying assumption allows us to assess theeffect of budget policy on saving investment and output in thefutureLabor Input Economic growth is partlydependent on how much labor is employed In our simulations weused the labor input assumptions of the Social SecurityAdministration actuaries underlying the intermediate projectionsinA more sophisticated approach would be to model the feedbacksbetween the economy and government transfer programs becauseeconomic growth tends to increase health spending and raiseretirement benefitsalthough with a lengthy lag for the latterThe year period coincides with federal surpluses and its useavoids

assumptions imply a sharp drop in theaverage annual growth of aggregate hours worked from  percentthrough  to  percent from  through The three sources of economic growth in the model are

International Financial Flowslast  years and would correspond to a lower assumption fortotal factor productivity growth than CBOs most recent assumptionOur use of CBOs January  year assumption for total factorproductivity growth throughout the year simulation period placesour longterm assumption between the Trustees and CBOs currentlongterm assumptionsThere are also important links between national saving andinvestment and the international sector In an open economy such asthe United States an increase in saving due to for example anincrease in the federal budget surplus may not result in anequivalent increase in domestic investment Instead part of theincreased saving may flow abroad in the form of an increase in USnet foreign investment The income earned on USowned foreignassets adds to the nations income GNP The portion of anincrease in national saving used for domestic investment adds tothe capital stock available for workers to produce goods andservices in the United States GDPThe model incorporates a simple representation of net financialflows between the US economy and the rest of the worldEssentially the rest of the world is treated as analogous to a bankwhere the United States can make deposits or withdrawals or draw ona credit line Every year there are income flows to or from thisbank corresponding to interest received on deposits or paid onadvances The amount corresponding to the bank balance positive ornegative is called the net international investment positionNIIP of the United States which generates a net flow of incomereceiptsA key model assumption affecting international flows is theallocation of gross saving between its foreign and domesticinvestment uses Over the long run we assume that market forcessuch as adjustments in exchange rates interest rates and priceswill tend to move net foreign investment and the current accountbalance towards zero To reflect this tendency to move towardsequilibrium we hold net foreign investment constant at the nominaldollar level in  This reduces the ratio of net foreigninvestment to GDP over time as GDP grows Changes in nationalsaving cause the ratio of net foreign investment to GDP to movearound its longterm trend We assume that net foreign investmentrises by onethird of any increase in the national saving rateBasically for each additional dollar saved about  cents areused for domestic investment and  cents are invested abroadConversely each dollar decrease in national saving is offset by cents in foreign investment in the United States OurBudget and Other Assumptionsassumption is consistent with the strong correlation betweennational saving and domestic investment that persists even in thecontext of a globaleconomyThis is a highly stylized representation of the foreign sectorof one country in isolation A more sophisticated approach would beto model a changing international environment in detail A moredetailed approach would confront major uncertainties concerning theactual course of world economic development exchange rates andrates of returnTable II lists the key assumptions incorporated in the modelSeveral of the assumptions used tend to provide conservativeestimates of the benefit of running surpluses or lower deficits andof the harm of increasing deficits The interest rate on thenational debt is held constant for example even when deficitsclimb and the national saving rate plummets Under such conditionsthe more likely result would be a rise in the rate of interest anda more rapid increase in federal interest payments than oursimulations display Another conservative assumption is that therate of total factor productivity growth is unaffected by theamount of investment Productivity is assumed to advance percent each year through the end of the simulation period even ifinvestment collapses Finally onethird of any saving decline isassumed to be offset by net inflows of foreign capital even in theevent of a dramatic saving decline that might set off a flight ofcapital from the United States Such assumptions tend to moderatethe effect of changes in national saving in our simulationsSensitivity analyses reveal that variations in these assumptionsgenerally would not affect the relative outcomes of alternativepoliciesSee Martin Feldstein and Philippe Bacchetta National Savingand International
