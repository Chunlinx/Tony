                                 Talking Bout His Generation            In a logical world thenumber of books written about a political movement would have some roughconnection with its ultimate importance The noisy crusades that becamehistorical footnotes would all be literary footnotes as well            But we are living in adifferent sort of world one in which it is possible for example to fill upthe better part of a library with volumes written by and about the leftistsin Manhattan in the s Anything you want to know about the sectarianideological warfare of these quarrelsome peopleSocialists StalinistsTrotskyites Schactmanites Lovestonitesyou can find in masochisticdetail            Thatsnot because their arcane disputes held any fascination for most Americans atthe time Nor is it because of their impact on the decades that followed Ihave never heard anyone suggest that the key to understanding American postwarpolitics lay in the arguments among the competing factions at CCNY in  ortheir subsequent recreations on Riverside Drive The truth is that sleftism became a literary genre because those who indulged in it enjoyedwriting books and were also willing to buy them            It would be a mistake to conclude that as those leftistsdepart from the scene the tradition of political verbosity will die outRather a new generation of aging leftiststhe campus radicals

veteranof the s leftist wars who writes for The New Yorker  the New               Republic  and other organs of the nonmilitant journalistic mainstreamThe difference between Bermans volume and most others I have seen on thesubject is that his is an entertaining book readable and unpretentious alittle softhearted toward his old comrades but more than willing to take themto task for their absurdities                           O f all thoseabsurdities one stands out in high relief and also links the leftists of thes to those of the Depression years It is their consistent overestimationof their own significance That the student activists of Bermans generationbelieved a political revolution to be within their grasp may seem a littlepuzzling from the vantage point of  years but is perhaps understandable as aproduct of youthful exuberance Berman himself lapses into a romantic nostalgiawhen he describes what it felt like to be in the vanguard of something new andmagnificentin politics in culture in the way human beings treat eachother            A utopian exhilarationswept across the student universe he writes on the first page Almosteveryone in my own circle of friends and classmates was caught up in it Partly it was a belief hard to remember today that a superior new society wasalready coming into existence And it was the belief that we ourselvestheteenage revolutionaries freaks hippies and studentsstood at the heart of anew society            Thiswas as Berman readily concedes an illusion But what can it claim for itslegacy a generation later A Tale of Two Utopias is a lucidthreepronged attempt to answer that question            The first of Bermans quests for a larger meaningin theexperiences of the Americans who led the Students for a Democratic Society andthe other leftist political organizations of is not a pretty one By theend of  the idealism of the SDS had degenerated into personal bickeringand a flirtation with Maoist terrorism that could be written off as meregoofiness had it not resulted in the loss of innocent lives on both sides ofthe Atlantic            That the radicalenthusiasms of  left no permanent political imprint upon the Westerndemocracies is a conclusion that a simple electoral history of the ensuingdecades the decades of Reagan Thatcher and Kohl would seem sufficient toprove Berman sadly acknowledges it But the politics of the s were achallenge to culture as well as politics Berman locates his second search formeaning in the gay awakening that had its symbolic start in the  protestat the Stonewall bar in Manhattan The students who the year before had marchedand chanted and proclaimed it is forbidden to forbid had been arguing forliberation of the oppressed of virtually every kind and when it comes to thesexually oppressed Berman says the last two decades can be seen as a victoryThere is reason to think that on the matter of homosexuality he writessome small but important aspect of human personality has begun to change            Thatmay be true but the connection between the gay awakening and the studentrebellion of  is an oblique one Gay liberation like feminism is centralto the whole individualist ethos of the last two decades But it doesntexactly count as a trophy from the barricades The world would have concededthe claims of both gays and women without the student occupation of a singlelecture hall anywhere in the world                           T here is onemore search for meaning and it takes Berman across the ocean Adam Michnik wasarrested in a demonstration in Warsaw in February of  went on to becomethe leading theorist of the Solidarity protest movement of the s andsurvived to take up a role as middleaged statesman in the Polish

uprising in Prague thatsummer and became the president of Czechoslovakia in  Shortly aftertaking office he entertained Frank Zappa on a state visit            Perhaps Bermanspeculates Havel and Michnik represent the true legacy of the worldwiderevolutionary sprouting of  Unlike the students of Columbia or theSorbonne they persevered and they wonsomething But what            Thepeaceful revolutions in eastern Europe in  were indeed a defeat for theforces of illegitimate authority That they were the incarnation of the dreamsof  seems a stretch to say the least even if some of the importantplayers came out of the original cast In the end Berman does not make such aclaim He ponders the hopeful predictions of Francis Fukuyama that Westerncivilization is moving gradually if fitfully toward greater individualfreedom But he closes with the darker speculations of Andre Glucksmann aleader of the Sorbonne rebels of  and a later convert to conservatism thatthe utopian enthusiasm of those years simply did not take sufficient account ofthe fundamental reality of evil in the human psyche            And so at the end of his odyssey Berman finds a bit ofmeaning but little reassurance How does the world feel as the  thcentury comes to a close The world feels this Berman declares humbleskeptical anxious afraid shaken            Maybe so On the otherhand it is an oddly grandiose conclusion to an appealingly modest book Bermanpresents almost no evidence about the way the world is feeling What he tellsus is how the student rebels of his own generation are feeling and that theyare not feeling very well In magnifying the global significance of theirdiscontents Berman ultimately succeeds in reinstating his lifetime membershipin the class of
