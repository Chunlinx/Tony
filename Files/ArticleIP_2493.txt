                                 So Sorry            Acceptmy confessions O Lord They are a sacrifice offered by my tongue for Yourswas the hand that formed it and Yours was the spirit that stirred it to confessto Your Name Heal all my bones let them say Lord who is like you                            St AugustinesConfessions  Book  Chapter                         DearEsquire readers            No doubt youre stillreeling from my searing confessional in the April issue of Esquire  inwhich I David Brock apologized for having lighted the mighty blaze nowconsuming the Clinton presidency It told the riveting story of how Iperhapsthe only selfproclaimed conservative journalist devoted to digging up storiesrather than writing editorials author of a bestselling attack on Anita Hilland the star reporter at the  American  Spectator cameto break the Troopergate story and how Troopergate begat Paula Jones and howPaula Jones begat Monica Lewinsky            Actuallythis is the second time Ive apologized for having broken theTroopergate story The first time was last July in my soulandnipplebaringEsquire piece Confessions of a RightWing Hit Man But I didntquestion the veracity of my reporting until my most recent confession in whichI write on my pangs of doubt Is it possible the troopers took me for aride embellishing their account for fame and fortune            Now I realize my newest confession on newsstands nowisnt sufficient            I mustapologize for my apology The White House issued a statement this week sayingthe president appreciates and accepts Mr Brocks apology Will this emboldenhim to embark on sexual adventures I must also apologize for all that nastystuff I wrote in my most recent Esquire piece about R Emmett TyrrellJr editor of the American Spectator  and Michael Isikoff who as areporter at the Washington Post and then Newsweek  pursued theClinton sex scandals so aggressively I portrayed Tyrrell as a venal checkbookjournalist who was ready to pay the Arkansas troopers for their story Howmuch do they want I quoted him as saying This was the same man whom I haddescribed in my July Esquire piece as one bright spot in an otherwisebleak conservative landscape That was while I was still on his payroll Nowthat Im off it I rat him out Sorry And then theres Isikoff Over drinks atthe Four Seasons Hotel several years ago he tried to help me by passing alongsome sex allegations that the Post wouldnt print He had every reasonto believe that our conversation was off the record Now Ive ratted him outtoo And I didnt even pick up the check Sorry about that            To Adam Bellow once my editor at The FreePress but now gone I am soooo sorry I didnt deliver the sort of nasty goodson the first lady that I served up in The Real Anita Hill  and thatThe Seduction of Hillary Rodham flopped I hope that the poor sales ofThe Seduction played no role in your departure from The Free Press Andto the first lady Im sorry I wrote that at Yale Law School you wore theloosefitting flowing pants favored by the Viet Cong and hung out withcomsymps And Im also sorry I wrote in the American Spectator thatVince Foster fondled you in public Whoops I didnt write that DanielWattenberg did Please forgive him            Iapologize for having been until recently a staff writer for the AmericanSpectator  I was the first conservative in human history to performinvestigative journalism yet I did not share the wealth with otherconservative publications like the National Review and the WeeklyStandard  From Bill Buckley and Bill Kristol I beg forgiveness            Before I came to the Spectator  I was an editor andwriter at the Washington Times  the conservative paper controlled by theRev Sun Myung Moon who has cruelly deceived people into thinking hes themessiah I am vexed by this connection now that I know the real messiah is well never mind All will be revealed in time            Before Icame to Washington I was editor of the Daily Californian  the studentnewspaper at Berkeley where I was reviled for endorsing the US invasion ofGrenada But what about the other editors of the Daily Cal who couldntsay theyd been martyred at a campus once renowned for its leftism They weredenied my entree into the world of conservative journalism And what of the kidwho didnt get into Berkeley because I got his place Did he have to settle forUCLA Santa Cruz or God forbid one of the Cal State campuses            Iam gay This is not fair to womankind Myunborn children will never appear on the Today show            After much painfulintrospection I realize that all of creation would have been better off if Ihad never been born The classic Frank Capra film Its a WonderfulLife  tells us that the lives of ordinary people benefit those of countlessothers in ways of which they are hardly aware But what of the lives ofNietzschean supermen like me I am well aware of my deplorable lack ofhumility generally considered a crucial component of any sincere apologia Iapologize for my sin of pride            I wouldlike to apologize to the sperm that were unfairly defeated in the race topenetrate my mothers ovum Sorry fellas            Regretfully            David Brock            PS OhAnita sorry about that book Lets have lunch
