            you uh   uh we are latecomers my husband and i to the world of golf we started when we were both oh i would imagine he was fifty years old so weve not been at the game that long but we love it   oh well good so youre a player then instead of a spectator then   uh probably i am a player but certainly not a good player uh the highlight of my season is probably the four times i get under a hundred   oh right   so   boy youre youre youre right up there about where i am then   oh i see       gosh i thought young people were all good   on no young people like to swing real hard at the ball     uhhuh so you find yourself you find yourself in the rough a lot     they just hit a long way well im im getting better about hitting them straight but where i get into trouble is around the green   oh   my my short game leaves a lot to be desired   well we we speak of the three games of golf here     oh   and that would be the long the short and the putt of it   yes   so   the short of it is my weakest part   uhhuh we uh often times have made a trip to Mississippi in March because of course its still cold here in March and we always hope for warm weather down there and the people that we play with uh the men foursome are all much longer ball hitters than my husband is but he finds that by going straight down the middle he usually wins about a quarter a hole because theyve been in the rough on the right and then in the rough on the left so he ends up playing just as well as they do   yeah i ive you know i see that all the time as a matter of fact i live uh literally right across the street from a golf course here in Texas   uhhuh   and uh most of the older folks that go out there and play are exactly the same way all of us young bucks get out there and hit the ball you know a mile       but its like three fairways over   yes our golf course in this small town is a beautiful course with a creek running through it so we have some water hazards and we have some sand and we have some hills um for the most part we all use carts uh battery operated carts and and most of us own our own carts   uhhuh   my husband happens to be on the board for the first time this year which is a new experience for him uh our membership is very inexpensive um   oh boy yeah   probably total cost with monthly minimum and cart storage and membership would make it about a thousand dollars a year   well you can get a walking membership for two hundred dollars a year at the course down here  yeah   oh can you really that amazes me   yeah its an eighteen hole course i mean its its uh not terribly difficult and theres really theres a a river that runs along the side but it only comes into play on one par three hole   uhhuh   theres really not that many hazards on it but uh its a really inexpensive course to get on   im always amazed that uh larger areas uh they can play for what we can uh many of our friends who are transferred away from  for some reason or another end up in cities that it would cost them ten thousand dollars a year to belong to a club       which   yeah theres a few of those here too   right so do you play much   no not near as much as id like to i mean ive i tend to stay pretty busy at my job and uh   uhhuh yeah   and its hard to get on a regular schedule and then were pretty active in our church which takes up a lot more time too so   umhum umhum and you probably have children at home which takes up a lot more time   but no we actually dont   oh i see   we have we have two miniature dachshunds and ten fish   oh my       well were down to two cats and they dont take a whole lot of time either but we find that each fall when the season seems to be shut down here we say next year were going to play more golf   uhhuh   uh this is the second summer that my husbands been retired and he did play more last year of course but we were gone a lot too uh   yeah   and that makes although weve played golf a lot of places around the United States uh on different trips but its even though we started late its certainly become a very prime part of our life in the summer time   where have you have you played any in Texas   never have in fact we just drove through Texas uh in mid February or late February i guess and we hoped to play while we were there we stayed overnight in a little town called Eastland Texas and wanted to play hoped to play there the next morning but it was like thirty nine degrees the next morning and very windy so we just went on to El Paso   yeah it does basically though the the golf season only shuts down for maybe three months out of the year if that much you know probably not even that much because really   uhhuh   uh February and January were about the only two really cold months that we had it was up in the very warm temperatures even in December this year   uhhuh uhhuh that would be wonderful to be able to play and of course from our town a lot of people go to Arizona or Florida for the winter and theyre able to play all year round but     sure yeah oh Arizonas beautiful   umhum yes i was amazed we spent the only time we played on our trip was in Douglas Arizona and uh that was just   um   it was just wonderful to be able to get out and hit a ball the course was not not green but it was going to be in another month when they started watering   yeah   so yes its its its become a big part of our lives even though were late players   hey well hey you know its never too late is what i say   well i guess not well maybe youll get to play more this year   well i sure hope so   uh well plan on it at least   okay   nice chatting with you   and with you   bye   byebye
