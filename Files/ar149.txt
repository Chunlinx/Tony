                    Introduction        The synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis RA        contains synovial fibroblasts and stromal cells as well as        macrophages Synovial stromal cells and fibroblasts are        thought to proliferate         in situ   On the contrary        macrophages do not proliferate but rather differentiate        from monocytes that migrated from the peripheral blood and        are activated to differentiate in the synovial tissue        Macrophages in RA synovium secrete many inflammatory        mediators IL IL IL tumor necrosis factor        TNF and PGE           and a variety of matrix        metalloproteinases and are thought to play a central role        in the inflammation and joint destruction characteristic of        RA   The number of macrophages in RA synovium        correlates significantly with clinical symptoms and the        degree of joint damage   Understanding the regulation        of macrophage accumulation in the RA synovium should        therefore provide insight into the inflammatory nature of        rheumatoid synovitis        Migration of peripheral blood monocytes is likely to be        influenced by chemokines A number of chemokines including        IL monocyte chemotactic protein MCP macrophage        inflammatory protein MIP MIP        epithelialderived neutrophil attractant  and regulated        upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted        RANTES are known to be found in RA synovial fluid              A number of specific chemokine receptors        including CCR CCR CCR CCR and CXCR are also known        to be expressed by peripheral blood monocytes           Despite this information the specific chemokinechemokine        receptor interactions involved in the recruitment of        monocytes into the rheumatoid synovium have not been fully        delineated        To address this issue we examined chemokine receptor        expression by peripheral blood monocytes and also analyzed        the capacity of supernatants from RA synovial stromal cells        to induce monocyte migration The data indicate that MCP        secreted by synovial stromal cells plays a major role in        attracting monocytes to the synovium and that IL may        also contribute                    Materials and methods                  Antibodies and reagents          Biotinylated mouse

Trizol reagent in accordance with the manufacturers          instructions Two micrograms of the extracted RNA was          treated with  U DNaseI to eliminate DNA and reverse          transcribed with  U SuperScriptII reverse          transcriptase at C for  min using oligo dT primers          in accordance with the manufacturers instructions          Polymerase chain reaction PCR was carried out

migration and the blocking effect of          mAbs The Student           t test was used to evaluate          chemokine production by SCLs and the fibroblast line                            Results                  Chemokine receptor expression by peripheral blood          monocytes          Chemokine receptor expression by CD monocytes was          examined using flow cytometry Representative examples          Fig  and asummary of staining results Table  are          presented CXCR and CXCR were expressed by a high          frequency of monocytes in all healthy donors More than          onehalf of monocytes expressed CCR CCR CXCR and          CXCR in seven of nine cases although a minimal number          of monocytes from two donors expressed these receptors          Expression of CCR and CXCR by monocytes was minimal in          all subjects CCR was expressed by few monocytes in          three donors whereas  of monocytes of the other          donors expressed CCR These results suggest that CCR          CCR CCR and CXCR CXCR CXCR and CXCR are          candidates to be involved in chemokinemediated          trafficking of monocytes                          Supernatants of cell lines attract monocytes          To examine whether SCLs derived from RA synovium can          attract monocytes efficiently migration of monocytes in          response to culture supernatants of RA and OA SCLs and          fibroblasts was examined Fig  Supernatants of all          cell lines attracted significantly more monocytes than          medium alone            P   Those supernatants          from RA SCLs induced the migration of significantly more          monocytes than the supernatants of the OA SCL and skin          fibroblasts                          Chemokine mRNA production by cell lines          Production of proinflammatory chemokine mRNA by the          various cell lines was assessed using RTPCR Fig  RA          SCLs expressed a number of proinflammatory chemokine          mRNAs including MCP IL MIP MIP RANTES and          IP OA SCL also expressed these same chemokine mRNAs          with the exception of MIP The fibroblast line          expressed mRNAs for IL MCP and IP but not          RANTES MIP and MIP                          Chemokine production by cell lines          Chemokines secreted into the culture supernatants of          cell lines were measured by ELISA Fig  Production of          MCP and IL by RA SCLs was greater than that by OA SCL          and the fibroblast line The cell lines produced low          levels of RANTES whereas IP and MIP were not          detected data not shown                          MCP and IL play a role in migration of          monocytes          Blocking experiments were carried out using mAbs to          determine the chemokines that contribute to monocyte          migration induced by RA SCLs Fig  AntiMCP and          antiIL mAbs decreased monocyte migration          significantly with the effect of antiMCP being          consistently greater than that of antiIL AntiCCR          blocking mAb did not effect monocyte migration The          antiCCR mAb did have blocking activity however since          migration of T cells induced by RANTES  ngml was          blocked by  data not shown                          Stimulation with TNF induces RA SCL to produce          more chemokines and attract more monocytes          RA SCLs were stimulated with TNF and chemokine          production and the capacity of supernatants to influence          monocyte migration were examined to assess the influence          of inflammatory cytokines on chemokine production and          monocyte trafficking Supernatants from RA SCLs          stimulated with  ngml TNF produced more MCP IL          RANTES and IP Fig  and attracted more monocytes          Fig  than those that were unstimulated                          MCP and IL play major roles in monocyte          migration by RA SCLs after TNF stimulation          AntiMCP mAb and antiIL mAb significantly          inhibited monocyte migration by supernatants of RA SCLs          stimulated with TNF AntiIP mAb and antiCCR mAb          did not inhibit monocyte migration significantly Fig                                      Discussion        The results of this study indicate that supernatants of        SCL derived from RA synovial tissue can attract more        monocytes from peripheral blood than OA SCL and skin        fibroblasts MCP and to a lesser degree IL played the        major roles in SCLinduced trafficking of monocytes These        results begin to provide an explanation for the extensive        accumulation of myeloid cells in rheumatoid synovium        Importantly RA SCL induced more monocyte migration after        stimulation with TNF one of the major inflammatory        cytokines produced in the rheumatoid synovium        Peripheral blood monocytes express many chemokine        receptors    including CCR CCR CCR CCR and        CXCR The current analysis indicates that along with        these receptors CXCR CXCR and CXCR are also expressed        by monocytes CCR CCR CCR CXCR CXCR CXCR and        CXCR notably appear to be expressed by monocytes obtained        from most donors        Ligands of these chemokine receptors are candidates to        be involved in monocyte trafficking These ligands would        include RANTES MIP and MCP CCR MCP MCP        MCP MCP MCP CCR RANTES MIP and MIP        CCR IL and CGP CXCR IL GRO and        epithelialderived neutrophil attractant  CXCR IP        and MIG CXCR and stromal cell derived factor CXCR          Migration assays using supernatants of RA SCLs were        employed to determine which of these chemokine and receptor        interactions might be involved in monocyte migration in the        RA synovium        Stromal cells are one of the important cell populations        in RA synovium SCL can produce many cytokines chemokines        and can promote viability and functional activation of T        cells and B cells     The current findings also        indicate that supernatants of RA SCLs attract more        monocytes than the supernatants of OA SCL and skin        fibroblasts This result suggests that the supernatants        from RA SCLs may contain more chemokines than or different        chemokines to those of OA SCL or fibroblast lines and        therefore are able to attract additional monocytes This        is likely to contribute to the more marked accumulation of        monocytes in RA compared with OA synovium        An analysis of chemokines produced by RA SCL indicated        that these cells expressed MCP and IL mRNAs and also        secreted MCP and IL It is noteworthy that there were        some discrepancies between mRNA expression and protein        production From the mRNA expression we expected RA SCLs        to produce reasonable amounts of IP RANTES MIP and        MIP RA SCLs however secreted only small amounts of        RANTES and IP and MIP secretion was not detected        According to previous reports mRNAs of MCP IL and        RANTES were found in RA SCL or fibroblasts but only MCP        was reported to be secreted by RA SCL or fibroblasts        without cytokine stimulation      The current        study indicates a wider profile of chemokine expression and        secretion by RA SCL and also a greater production of IL        and MCP by RA SCL compared with OA SCL implying a        greater proinflammatory potential        Experiments with blocking mAbs were carried out to        examine the chemokines in the supernatants of SCL that        accounted for monocyte migration The data were consistent        with the conclusion that MCP and to a lesser extent        IL accounted for the capacity of RA SCL supernatants to        stimulate monocyte migration Whether additional cytokines        produced by RA SCL also contributed to monocyte migration        is currently not known but the combination of the        chemokine data and the mAb blocking results suggests that        MCP and IL play a dominant role in monocyte migration        measured by SCL        TNF is one of the major cytokines produced in        inflammatory sites such as RA synovium and it is thought        to play a central proinflammatory role   We examined        the influence of TNF on monocyte migration induced by RA        SCL RA SCLs stimulated by TNF secreted more MCP IL        and RANTES than those that were unstimulated and began to        produce IP Moreover supernatants of TNFstimulated        RA SCLs attracted more monocytes in migration assay MCP        and IL played the main roles in monocyte migration        induced by TNFstimulated RASCL as documented by        blocking experiments        It has recently been reported that T cells expressing        CCR gather at inflammatory sites such as RA or multiple        sclerosis and that interactions between CCR and its        ligands RANTES MIP MIP are thought to be        important in the accumulation of inflammatory cells at        these sites     CCR expressed by monocytes        however was not apparently active in transmitting        transmigratory signals RANTES is also the ligand of CCR        but the major receptor for RANTES is thought to be CCR In        this regard expression of CCR by monocytes was lower than        that of CCR Moreover antibody to MCP and IL blocked         and  of migration of monocytes respectively        According to this information RANTES is unlikely to play a        major role in monocyte migration by RA SCL        supernatants        MCP has been shown to play an important role in the        development of arthritis in MRLlpr mice   whereas the        migration of monocytes into inflammatory sites was reduced        in the CCRdeficient mouse   These results are        consistent with the current findings demonstrating the        important role of MCP in monocyte migration Blocking the        effect of RANTES has however also been shown to be        effective in ameliorating collageninduced arthritis in        DAB mice and adjuvantinduced arthritis in rats           RANTES might therefore play a different role in the        initiation of inflammatory arthritis in experimental        animals compared with propagating chronic inflammation in        RA        The overlapping roles of MCP and IL in the migration        of inflammatory cells have recently been highlighted in        studies of neutrophil trafficking It was reported that        MCP plays a role in neutrophil trafficking in        inflammation although neutrophil trafficking was        previously believed to be regulated only by IL and not        by MCP   These previous results together with the        current data indicate that both MCP and IL play major        roles in regulating the trafficking of myeloid cells into        inflammatory sites        The role of specific chemokines in arthritis is still        controversial and further investigation is necessary to        delineate to specific roles of these effector molecules        Moreover the role of tissue cells in regulating the        migration of inflammatory cells into the synovium is also        not fully established The current data however strongly        imply that monocyte accumulation in rheumatoid synovium is        regulated by SCL via production of the chemokines MCP and        IL                    Abbreviations        ELISA  enzymelinked immunosorbent assay IP
