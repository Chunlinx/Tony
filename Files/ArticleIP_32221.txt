                                  Its Time To Keelhaul UHaul            Like all superheroes worthy of the title theShopping Avenger has an Achilles heel In the case of the Shopping Avengerhis Achilles heel is not animal vegetable or mineral but something lesstangible            An explanation Last week the magazine you arecurrently reading forced the Shopping Avenger at gunpoint to read a series oftreaclefilled selfhelp books and then to  The Shopping Avenger who canwithstand radiation extreme heat and cold hail bear attacks and EyesWide Shut  almost succumbed to terminal jejuneness after reading thesebooks Except for one thing One of the books The Art of Happiness which collects and simplifies the Dalai Lamas philosophy got the ShoppingAvenger to thinking This in a way is the Shopping Avengers Achilles heelthinking Perhaps it is wrong the Shopping Avenger thought to complain aboutthe petty insults and inconveniences of life in the materialistic s TheShopping Avenger felt that perhaps he should counsel those who write seekinghelp to meditate to accept bad service the way one accepts the change ofseasons and to extend a compassionate hand of forgiveness to those who providepoor customer care            But then the ShoppingAvenger sat down and the feeling passed            The Shopping Avenger does not make light of the Dalai Lamaor of the notion that there is more to life than the impatient acquisition ofmaterial goods If the Shopping Avenger were not for a superhero extremelynonjudgmentalas opposed to his alter ego who is considered insufferablyjudgmental by his alter egos wifethe Shopping Avenger would tell theoccasional correspondent to let go of his petty grievance and get a life            But the Shopping Avengeralso believes that the Dalai Lama has never tried to rent a truck from UHaulIf he had tried to rent from UHaul he never would have escaped from TibetFor the complete back story see Shopping Avenger column and one            The complaints about UHauls nonreservation reservationpolicy continue to pour in through the electronic mail One correspondentBR wrote in with this cautionary tale Last weekend I went to SanFrancisco to help my brother and his family move into their first house Mybrother had reserved a moving truck with UHaul for the big day I warned mybrother about UHauls not really a reservation per se policy that I learnedfrom the Shopping Avenger He didnt believe such a thing would happen to himso he didnt act on my warning            BR continuesas if you dont know what happenedalreadyI went to UHaul with my brother to get our reserved truck Thestore had many customers standing around looking frustrated When we got to thefront of the line the clerk informed us that our reserved truck had not yetbeen returned We asked if we could rent one of the many trucks sitting idle inthe parking lot The clerk laughed and said the keys to those trucks werelost            BR and his chastened brotherthe ShoppingAvenger is resisting the urge to gloatwent to Ryder Ryder had a truckavailable for us The gentleman who helped us at Ryder said Ryder prides itselfon being everything UHaul is not            The Shopping Avenger has still not received a callfrom UHaul spokeswoman Johna Burke explaining why UHaul refuses to providetrucks to people who reserve trucks but the Shopping Avenger is pleased tonote that several correspondents have written in over the past month sayingthat based on what they have read in this column they will be taking theirbusiness to Ryder or Budget or elsewhere            The Shopping Avengerwill undoubtedly return to the sorry state of affairs at UHaul in the nextepisode but now on to this months airline debacle            Before we begin though the Shopping Avenger nearly forgotto announce the winner of last months contest in which readers were asked toanswer the question Whats the difference between pests and airlines            The winner is one TomMorgan who wrote You can hire someone to kill pests Tom is the winner of ayears supply of Turtle Wax and he will receive his prize just as soon as theShopping Avenger figures out how much Turtle Wax actually constitutes a yearssupply The new contest question How much Turtle Wax comprises a years supplyof Turtle Wax            This months airline in the spotlight is Southwest Loyalreaders will recall that last month the Shopping Avenger praised SouthwestAirlines for its sterling customer service This brought forth a small numberof articulate dissensions The most articulate and the most troubling camefrom M who wrote Last year flying from Baltimore to Chicago with my entirefamily two really little kids included we set down at Midway in a rainstormAnd waited for our bags And waited for bags And waited for bags            An hour later M says the bags showed up soakedthrough We took them to baggage services at SW and were faced with the mostcomplicated unclear and confusing mechanism for filing a claim we experiencedflyers have ever seen            When they arrived attheir destination M and her family made a terrible discovery We discoveredthat our clothes were soaked throughthe top clothes were so wet that the dyehad bled through down to the lower levels destroying lots of other clothesObviously our bags had just been sitting out on the runway in the rain Tothis day Ive never heard a thing from SW despite calls and letters            This of course is where Shopping Avenger steps inShopping Avenger knows that Southwest is different from the average airline inthat it doesnt go out of its way to infuriate its paying customers see  soI expected a quick and generous resolution to Ms problem            What I got at first though was a load of corporatehooha            The airlines policywhich is consistent with all contracts of carriage at all airlines requiresthat passengers file a report in person for lost or damaged luggage within fourhours of arrival at their destination a Southwest spokeswoman LindaRutherford emailed me M indicates she called for a few days but did notfile a report in person until April three days later Southwest as acourtesy took her report anyway and asked for follow up information andwritten inventory of the damage Rutherford said that M should have submitteddetailed receipts and photographs of the damage in order to make a claim            Harrumph the Shopping Avenger says It is a bad hair dayat Southwest when its officials defend themselves by comparing their airline toother airlines I forwarded this message to M who replied            Wow Well of course I didnt file it at theairport on the  th because I didnt know the clothes were ruined atthe airport I didnt know until I opened the baggage at my hotel and saw theruined stuff And its worth noting that we had already waited for about anhour for our luggage with two little kids and impatient inlaws nipping at ourheels            She goes on I did call that evening  and wastold that that sufficed This is the first time Ive been told that I had tofile a complaint in person within four hours  When I filed on the th  I was never told that I needed any receipts or photos or othertype of documentation The baggage folks seemed pretty uninterested in all ofthis  They know that the type of evidence they want is impossible toobtain They also know that on April  they screwed up the luggage retrievaland left bags out in the rain a long time            Southwests responseactually served to anger M more than the original problem Before they had amildly annoyed but loyal customer who would have been placated by an apologyand thrilled with some modest token of their regret Now they have apissedoff customer            Things do look bad for Southwest dont they The ShoppingAvenger sent Ms response to Rutherford who emailed back saying she thoughtthe Shopping Avenger was asking for policy information The Shopping Avengeremailed back again stressing to Rutherford that the Great Court of ConsumerJustice would if this case were brought to trial undoubtedly find for theplaintiff the Shopping Avenger serves as prosecutor judge and jury in theGreat Court of Consumer Justicedefendants are represented by the president ofUHaul and that Southwest was precipitously close to feeling the sword ofretribution at its neck            But then she came through provisionally Yep youcan be sure if M will call me we will get everything squared away Im sorryits taken this long for her to get someone who can help but we will take careof it from here            Stay tuned shoppers tohear whether Southwest makes good it promise to compensate M and apologize toher for her troubles            The story of M reminds the Shopping Avenger of a centraltruth
