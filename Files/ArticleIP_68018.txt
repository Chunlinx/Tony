                                 The Masked and the Unmasked            Paul Thomas Andersons                  Magnolia                takes place on a dark night of the soul in theCity of Angels A patriarch is dying No hold on this is a threehour movieTwo patriarchs are dying Rich geezer Jason Robards is slipping in and out of acoma on a bed with an oxygen tube up his nose while his minky young wifeJulianne Moore acts out her despair at losing an old man she thought shedmarried for his money The geezers nurse Philip Seymour Hoffman listens tohis semicoherent monologues then decides to get in touch with the dying mansestranged son Tom Cruise who gives inspirational lectures in which men areexhorted to turn women into sperm receptacles and to leave behind theirunmanly pasts The son gets a double dose of his unmanly past this nightsince a female TV journalist April Grace has uncovered the history he hasdeterminedly concealed and is eating through his mask of machismo on cameraWe may be through with the past says someone but the past isnt throughwith us            The second dyingpaterfamilias is Philip Baker Hall as the host of a quiz show for bright kidsHe bursts in on his estranged daughter Melora Walters with news of hisimminent demise but the addled girl for some reason three guesses wont haveanything to do with him His visit sends her into a cocainesnorting frenzywhich is interrupted by a policeman John C Reilly checking out her deafeningstereo Youve been doing some drugs today After  minutes it isnt clearwhether this dweebish flatfoot is interrogating her or trying to ask for adateor whether he even knows Meanwhile  Magnolia could have beentitled Meanwhile  an aging exquizkid celebrity William H Macy getsfired from his job and goes looking for the love he never had while acontemporary quizkid celebrity Jeremy Blackman tries to make his fatherMichael Bowen understand that he wants to be loved for himself and not his TVachievementseven if that means peeing in his pants oncamera            Whats the connection among these people Some of the linksare familial others merely circumstantial But everyone and their dad arehaving a really lousy day At the peak of their collective loneliness thecokehead daughter puts on a plaintive Aimee Mann song the chorus of whichgoes Its not going to stop Its not going to stop Its not going to stopTill you wise up She moves her lips and the director cuts to all thecharacters in all the movies other strands as they all move their lips to thesame universal refrain Its not going to stop  The wife in the car singsThe aging quiz kid on the barstool sings The cop searching for his lost gunsings I thought Please dont make the guy in the coma sing or Im going tobe hystericalbut yup the guy in the coma sings too At that point I hadan interesting reaction to Magnolia  I laughed at it and forgave italmost everything            OK you could spend threehours snickering at Andersons What the World Needs Now Is Aimee Mannmetaphysic But his vision cuts deeper than a lot of folky bathos Hischaracters have been screwed up by their families so when he turns around andmakes a case for family as the ultimate salvation he doesnt seemsimpleminded Hes saying the diaspora is understandablebut that its alsokilling people At the point where these people could actually start dying ofaloneness he goes metaphorical He goes biblical He goes nuts He has sort ofprepared us with weather reports and the recurrence of numerals suggesting anOld Testament chapter and verse But nothing could prepare us for thefullscale surreal grossout deluge thats the pictures splattery climaxFor the second time he dynamites his own movie And for the second time Iforgave him almost everything            What clinches Andersons case for family is how beautifullyhe works with his surrogate clan Many of the actors show up from his HardEight  and Boogie Nights  and hes so eager to get LuisGuzman into the film despite the lack of a role that he makes him a gameshowcontestant named Luis Guzman Hes like a parent who cant stop adoptingkids Anderson knows what actors live to do fall apart He puts theircharacters backs against the wall then gives them speeches full of freeassociations and Freudian slips so that theyre suddenly exposedandterrified by their nakedness By the end of the first hour of Magnolia the whole cast is unraveling By the end of the second theyve unraveled somuch that theyve burst into song Anderson must have needed that bonkersthirdhour climax because there was nowhere to go short of spontaneouscombustion            The actors aregreatall of them It seems unfair to single anyone out but I loved Reillysunsettling combination of sweetness and pruderyunsettling because hes justthe kind of earnest bythebook cop whose wheels move too slowly in a crisisBetween tantrums Julianne Moore opens and closes her mouth like a fish thatsslowly suffocating at the bottom of a boat And who would have expected a realperformance from Tom Cruise Anderson takes everything fake in Cruisesactingthe facepulling the tooquick smileand turns it into thecharacters own shtick so that when the mask is pulled off you get a startlingglimpse of the rage and fear under the pose Elsewhere Anderson uses Mametactors and Mamety diction but hes the AntiMamet He makes his actors feel sosafeso lovedthat they seem to be competing to see who can shed the mostskin            The title card of                   The Talented MrRipley                is a stroke of genius Adjectives flash before the wordsMr Ripley  with talented an imperfect substitute for about  otherpossibilities including confused Actually I think confused or vulnerableor desperate would have been a more appropriate choice As played by MattDamon this Ripleys chief talent is for licking his lips and looking clammilyout of place Dispatched to the south of Italy by a magnate named Greenleafseeking the return of his wastrel son Dickie Jude Law the workingclassRipley has to pretend hes an old Princeton classmate But nothing in Damonsdemeanor remotely suggests the Ivy League Beside the smooth caramelcoloredLaw even his pale little muscles seem like poseurs            Anthony Minghella  The English Patient  has adapted The Talented Mr Ripley from a thriller by PatriciaHighsmith and its a gorgeously creepy piece of moviemaking The Old Worldluxuryeven the Old World rotis doubleedged subtly mocking itsbantamweight New World protagonist The light that bronzes everyone else burnspoor pasty Ripley We watch him having the time of his life but theres noquestion of his ever fitting in with Dickie his willowy girlfriend MargeGwyneth Paltrow or even their fat tothemannerborn pal Freddie Miles ahilarious Philip Seymour Hoffmanhes too tense too hungry too incompleteWhen Ripley is by himself onscreen theres nothing going on            Minghella is a thoughtfulman and a snazzy craftsman but by the end of Ripley  I wasnt sure whathad attracted him to this material What does a vaguely masochistic humanistsee in Patricia Highsmith The novels Ripley and the Ripley of Ren Clments Purple Noon  Alain Delon isnt so palpably out of his depth Witha bit of polish he can pass for a playboy and the bad fun is watching him doanything to keep from accepting the swinish Dickies view of him as an eternalloser Damons Ripley is an eternal loser an antichameleon and soconscientiously dreary that he lets Jude Law act him off the screen He isntallowed to feel a moments glee at seizing what these rich boobs have deniedhim Minghella comes up with a bleakly sincere ending thats the opposite ofwhat this ironic little melodrama needs Hes trying to inflate it intotragedy where Highsmiths setups are too cold and shallow to be tragic Theold biddy herself would have thought this ending stinks            Along with many Americans I first caught Andy Kaufman onthe Tonight Show in the mids He sat next to Johnny Carson and inhis heliumpitched foreign man voice told jokes without punch lines Hercooking ees so badees terrible and did nonimpressionistic impressionsthen he got up and launched into the most electrifying Elvis Presley takeoffIve ever seen Without that final flourish of virtuosity the shtick wouldhave been just weird With it Kaufman signaled that his comedy was about morethan untranscendent ineptitude It was about wondrously fucking with yourhead            That whole act isreproduced in the funny frustrating Kaufman biopic                   Man on theMoon                but not on the Tonight Show  Kaufman Jim Carreydoes it onstage at a tiny club We dont know where it came from or what thethinking was behind it He brings down the house lots of shots of peoplesmiling and laughing then goes out for a drink with a potential managerDanny DeVito who tells him Youre insanebut you might also bebrilliant Thats about as close to analysis as the picture gets            As in their Ed Wood  and The People vsLarry Flynt  screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewskitake marginal or plain cruddy characters and stick them in the middle ofbreezily wideeyed biopics Their Horatio Alger tone is the joke but its nota joke that director Milos Forman seems to be in on Forman tells one deadlyserious story A reckless individualist is slowly crushed by society It meshedwith McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  but seemed oddwith Mozart  Amadeus   and disastrous with Valmont  Valmont  With Andy Kaufman it seems not so much wrong as beside the point Wheredid the rage in Kaufman come from and at what point did it kill the comedyMore important Did Kaufman himself consider some of his experiments failuresor had his aesthetic finally become so punkprowrestling that he thoughtdriving people crazy was enough As Jared Hohlt  in                   Slate                thecomedian got sick at the point where he needed to reinvent himself to keep fromsinking into obscurity The filmmakers reverse the trajectory and the actualchronology of Kaufmans career so that he seems to achieve a magicalsynthesis of warmth and aggressionand then gets cut down at his prime Thatsnot just bogus its false to the conflicts that ate Kaufman alive            The reason to see Manon the Moon is Jim Carrey Its not just that he does the Kaufman routineswith the kind of hungry gleam that makes you think hes channeling the deadcomedian Its that he knows what its like to walk the high wire and bomb Heknows what its like to lose control of his aggression It happened to him inThe Cable Guy  maybe his real Andy Kaufman film I betthat what Carrey saw from inside Kaufmans head would be more illuminating thananything in the movie Hes not just a man in the moon He generates his ownlight            Anyone who reads                   Angelas Ashes                istorn down the middleappalled by the misery and deaths of small children andyet exhilarated even turned on by the cadences of Frank McCourt Hisalcoholic father starved him of real food but filled his head with the kind ofstories that nourished his poets instincts I worried that the movie directedby Alan Parker would miss McCourts voice and dwell too much on the tragicdetails But what happens is the opposite McCourt narrates the film and itturns into a lifeless slide show Theres no flow no connective tissue betweenepisodes After the  th teensy scene goes by you realize the movieisnt just botched It doesnt even exist Emily Watson suffers prettily butwhatever shes thinking stays in her head and Robert Carlyle is so mopilypresent that you dont have a clue why such an earnest fellow would drink somany lives away The horror of the father McCourt describes is that hes notat home on planet Earth The narrator says his dad was a helluva storytellerbut the man on screen doesnt say so much as Once upon a time  Has anyoneinvolved in this disaster ever heard a real story
