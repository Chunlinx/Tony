for an acceptable punishment toaccompany censure if indeed censure is chosen in lieu of impeachment The keypoint is that there must be a humbling element without complete humiliationand that a purely financial penalty such as a fine would not be enough            One approach worthconsidering is the loss of Clintons postpresidential privileges I amthinking particularly of the postpresidential pension and office expenseallowances Beyond any actual financial loss which Clinton could probablyrecoup with a highpaying postpresidential job there is likely to be aperceived element of strong moral rebuke associated with the forfeiture ofretirement benefits Perceived analogies would be to rogue cops who are notprosecuted but must resign from the force and lose their pension at least ontelevision Loss of office expense allowances would carry an implicit messagethat while we dont want to force you out of office we really dont want tohold you out as an honored expresident Indeed even Richard Nixon did notsuffer these two penalties            Inessence while Clinton would not be forced to resign or leave office he wouldsuffer a penalty that is often associated in the public mind with officials whoare required to resign to avoid being removed or criminally prosecuted Thepenalty in effect would be bad spin                           Donald BSusswein Bethesda Md

     Slate                readers want more Monica Their email says no no buttheir mouse clicks say yes yes This is not a contradiction Rather it is anextension of a wellknown game theory model called The PrisonersDilemma            Take the following exampleSuppose the world consisted of only two people If both know nothing aboutMonica then both are happy If both have information about Monica then bothare unhappy If one has information about Monica then that one is happy butthe other one is very unhappy since he or she is at a disadvantage Nowassume that information about Monica is published Unless the two people havean agreement not to read anything about Monica both defend against extremeunhappiness by reading the info settling for moderate unhappiness Expand thisto hundreds of millions of people and its obvious that no agreement can holdespecially when some of them actually do want the information            Oursituation is comparable to the situation                   Slate

Kinsleysdefense in the Politicians and Privacy dialogue I would add that althoughI do not find invasions of privacy acceptable people do wish to know somethingabout the relationship between the individual and his or her work            Biographical criticism isimportant not only for the three reasons that Kinsley expressed in his initialargument especially the point on hypocrisy but for historical reasons Wehave no problem accepting biographical criteria for literature In fact thereis an entire school of criticism devoted to the relationship between author andwork Why shouldnt politicians lives be open to examination in the sameway            Forhistorical reasons attention should be paid to the private life of thepolitician or to the idea of the work as an expression of the politiciansinner being If it turns out that the politician is a fraud or a hypocrite weshould be able to know thisas long as the methods of revealing such knowledgedo not invade the persons
