Justice A FiveYear Status Report onAccess to Justice in California prepared by the CaliforniaCommission on Access to Justice Katherine is just one of million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs  ofteninvolving such critical needs as housing health care educationemployment safety and transportation  are not beingaddressedCalifornia has a critical dearth of legal services for the poorand as this report makes clear it is imperative that the statejoin with the federal government and private funders to increaseresources so that all Californians regardless of income haveequal access to our justice systemOur justice system is predicated on the assumption that bothparties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers andguides through a complex legal system that would otherwise beinaccessible to many of us Unfortunately the most vulnerablemembers of our society are the least able to afford legal servicesCalifornia does have a strong network of legal aid organizationsthat try to help meet the needs of the poor but theres just onelegal aid lawyer available per  poor people We may promisejustice for all but for those who cant afford a lawyer thatpromise is often a lieIn its new report the Commission on Access to Justice notessome significant steps toward providing equal access to justice forall Californians In  thanks to Gov Gray Davis and leaders inthe Legislature the state committed  million a year to legalaid for the poor In addition California Supreme Court ChiefJustice Ronald George made access to justice issues a toppriority and a growing community of judicial legal and civicleaders committed to expanding legal aid is working to ensure thatwhat little funding is available is used in the most efficient waypossibleBut resources are extremely limited The combined federal andstate government support in California is at  million on legalaid for the poor  just  per poor person The Commission onAccess to Justice says that government investment would have totriple to match the investment made by comparable states and thecombined publicprivate investment must reach  million toadequately meet the legal needs of the poor That may sound beyondfinancial reach but it is actually only  percent of the amountCalifornians spend on lawyers each year  and that  percent wouldbe providing legal assistance to nearly  percent of thepopulationThis isnt a controversial issue Close to nine in  Americans percent agree that legal help for civil matters should beprovided for lowincome people according to the commissionsreport Eight in  people even support the idea when it isdescribed as a governmentfunded program Indeed in many statesthroughout the country government funding for lega l aid doublesor triples that of California And democratic governmentsthroughout the world have recognized that government funding forlawyers is as critical to a fair legal system as are judges courtsand laws For a state whose economy is the sixth largest in theworld California should certainly be able to adequately fund freecivil legal aidMore funding and more resources for legal services for the poormust be a statewide priority Recent achievements  new governmentfunding a growing community of legal aid advocates  demonstratethat the goal of equal access to justice for all Californians isachievable and that the public as well as key leaders throughoutthe state will support the effortThe statistics might seem cold but its impossib le to remaincomplacent after meeting someone like Katherine  or a family whohas been left homeless by an illegal eviction a senior who losthis home to foreclosure from a crooked loan transaction or adomestic violence victim unable to navigate the courts to get arestraining order California can and must  do better
