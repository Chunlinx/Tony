        do you think do we spend enough on that or     uh probably not from what ive been hearing i mean theres not enough getting done   oh yeah uhhuh yeah i just kind of wonder uh you know ive been thinking i dont know how much they spend on cancer and how much they spend on AIDS and some of those other things but it seems like uh you know it needs to be somewhat equitable i guess as far as the number of people that are affected uh cancer seems to affect a lot more people and youd think they need to spend more on that but   yeah well you think this AIDS thing has been around since about nineteen eighty and   yeah   i would have thought by now theyd have been a lot more advances   yeah   in treatment and then again i guess there is i mean theres some drugs that they didnt have and   uhhuh   im sure that didnt come cheap   yeah thats true its uh i dont know its kind of interesting issue you wonder now its gotten so out of hand that you know its not just that the homosexual population and stuff like that uh you know its affected everybody just even if you go to a hospital its kind of hard to know what to do and   yeah   you really i dont even think they really a decent idea of how many people really have it i   its pretty uh   i would imagine a lot more people have it than they think and     yeah i keep thinking that myself   its kind of a scary   i i was last year when the war thing was going on and it was over and they said it costed you know like seventy billion or something   uhhuh   and they said if they had that much money for AIDS research they could have found found a cure   uhhuh   so i kind of wondered about that   yeah wait whether amongst   to me thats an astronomical amount of money  and uh   yeah seventy   and uh but it suddenly comes from somewhere i dont know where it comes from but   yeah and you just wonder i you know i look at kind of now too where were getting all this people asking us for aid outside the country you know or to support the Soviet Union this that and the other and you know i sometimes wonder if its not time we started you know maybe turning some of that stuff back towards home and helping some of those problems and you know AIDS being one of them to   yeah   i think didnt the President put i dont know if it was a billion or so more dollars or something in the budget this well i guess it was in ninety one to try and find a cure for it or   there again that doesnt seem like a whole lot of money   uhhuh   you know if to do something like that with   yeah   uh but i i kind of agree with you we should spend more in this country for not only AIDS but a lot of other things before we start helping other countries   yeah yeah its kind of kind of ironic ourselves were on the down trend and here we are trying to still pick other people up and   yeah   seems like thats all we ever do and it comes back to haunt us in the long run   yeah   but   i mean in in in your own financial budget if if youre not doing well youre not going to help out anyone else   yeah yeah thats true i mean that you might that you want to try and be charitable but yet you got to take care of your own house and put your own house in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and   but but thats not the way this country is or ever been i think weve always   yeah i   they had reasons for it i think i heard one just the other day that because of all the money he was you know giving away right now uh the president was i think his wife said something with well weve got to keep these countries in a democratic mode and   uhhuh uhhuh   uh sometimes i dont think it matters   no and and yeah i i i agree that just and and like i say what do we really get out of it a lot of times you know i guess if we didnt help the Soviet Union there could be just total chaos and go back to the old order but you know were either paying for it in weapons and arms or were paying were giving it to them for nothing you know   yeah   and then we you know at least we have jobs when were making all the weapons and stuff it seemed like and now we dont even have those because we cut back so much and then we give it away and you just wonder what we really get  out of it   my wife and i used to work at a research laboratory for the government   uhhuh   and i know things go slow   yeah   an incredible amount of money is spent to achieve little or nothing sometimes   uhhuh   so i understand you know where the money gets ate up at and but there really should just be more   more money spent   and now that yeah and now that theyre you know the weapon spending is going down   uhhuh   but we could put some of these laboratories even like the one we worked at at Los Alamos put them onto you know more AIDS things   uhhuh yeah well uh do you know that much about i mean have you ever met anybody that has AIDS or   not that i know of   yeah ive never met anybody myself but   i think that where we used to live we had a neighbor down the street and i heard a rumor that one of them died with AIDS   uhhuh uhhuh   but i never knew for sure i met them once or twice because they used to sell plants in the yard but   uhhuh   i never really considered that i knew them so   yeah just more passing but   yeah   yeah i just i havent had anything strike home so it really hasnt hit me as bad as some you know you tend to sometimes wonder well hey you know you kind of brought it on yourself but like i say now its getting so much more in into society that people that you know have no intention of doing anything you know kind of end up with it and you know little kids and stuff like that that   yeah   that is its and i say i dont have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to to find out i just i just hope they kind of keep things in perspective and remember theres a bunch of other you know type diseases out there it seems you hear a lot more about the AIDS activists than you do these other people with these other diseases and   actually
