                                 Bill Bradleys Air Ball            Lastweek announcing his candidacy for president Bill Bradley compared politics tobasketball recalling his love of discipline teamwork and the swish of thenet Pundits ate up the speech  Paul Gigot called it a character and ethics assaulton Bill Clinton and Al Gore Fred Barnes applauded Bradley for slamdunkingthe case against Gore Its the best speech Ive ever heard him give saidMargaret Carlson A video replay of the speech however shows that the swishwas the sound of a jump shot missing the rim altogether Bradley continues tothink up new ways of saying nothing while making it look like something                                           Leadership A speech can set a direction define anagenda and explain what the candidate has done or would do Instead offulfilling these responsibilities Bradley simply asserts that he has fulfilledor will fulfill them He promises to act on his convictions but doesnt saywhat they are Rather than explain where America should go he says he has astrong sense of where America is and where we need to go Rather than defineAmericas role in the world he pledges to define more clearly Americas rolein the world Rather than challenge his listeners or tell them where he plansto lead them he says they deserve leadership that respects the people as wellas challenges them Rather than say what he would do he promises There aretwo kinds of politicians those who talk and promise and those who listen anddo I know which one I am                                           Depth Bradley like George W Bush says prosperityisnt enough What we need in America is a deeper prosperity  a prosperitythat makes us feel rich inside as well as out he argues The leadership thatis called for at this moment goes beyond a presidency and into every home andheart  A leadership that understands the peoples fears as well as theirhopes By exuding profundity Bradley shames those who wonder what it means tofeel rich inside and why this is more important than rising incomes anddeclining unemployment The problem isnt that Bradleys message is empty Theproblem is that youre too shallow to understand it                                           Immeasurability The Dow Jones is at recordheights Bradley concedes but such numbers are not the measure of allthings They do not measure what is in our heads and our hearts They do notmeasure a young girls smile or a little boys first handshake or agrandmothers pride They convey nothing about friendship or theselffulfillment of helping a person in need They tell us little about themagic of a good marriage or the satisfaction of a life led true to its ownvalues As                   Slate               s Jacob Weisberg  these things have nothing todo with the presidency But never mind The point is that they cant bemeasured and therefore no one can disprove Bradleys suggestion thattheyre lacking today and that his presidency would restore them                                           Wholeness Bradley speaks constantly of elusivewholes America should be made whole he says He proposes to build racialunity confidence in our collective will and a prosperity that adds up tomore than the sum of all our possessions A team is not just about winninghe adds Its about shared sacrifice its about giving up something small foryourself in order to gain something large for everyone Its the same for ourcountry What is the something large What does unity entail What doesour collective will call for Bradley doesnt dwell on such coarse concernsThe point is wholeness itself                                           Things Lest anyone doubt Bradleys substance hetouts his record of doing things In the Senate he reached across partylines to get things done I attempted to do big things without ever losingsight of the little things If elected hell do some of the big things thatneed to be done  We will do fewer things but they will be essentialthings and we will do them more thoroughly And what exactly are these largeand essential things Bradley cites only one example the Works ProjectAdministration How he would apply a Depressionera public jobs program totodays roaring economy remains unclear                                           Reality To those who suspect him of empty idealismBradley asserts a firm grasp of reality Isnt it just common sense that wemake sure every child in America is covered by health care he asks Isnt itjust common sense that we protect our natural world from destruction and dowhat it takes to achieve racial unity Isnt it common sense that all ourschools should perform well and that more Americans should do bettereconomically What others may call idealism is a common sense reality I know wecan achieve How will Bradley realize these realities He doesnt say Thepoint is that he will do what it takes Really Its just common sense                                           Possibility The American Dream Bradley arguesis not just an ideal to wish on It should be a possibility available to all The renewal of the American Dream has to shine so bright that we can dreamdreams we never thought possible before  I want that hope thatencouragement that sense of possibility to be a reality for everybody Sincepossibility cant be measured no one can disprove Bradleys claim that theAmerican Dream is impossible for too many people today and no one can disprovehim if he claims four years from now that he has made it possible again                                           Poetry Bradley relies heavily on metaphorsAmericans should be fixing our roof while the sun is shining he says Aspresident he pledges to set the table for future economic growth put everyAmerican on the train of that deeper broader prosperity and urge Americansto bridge the divide of prejudice What any of this means is left to theimagination As a child Bradley recalls he learned from his father thatcharacter is where you find it As a senator I tried to help people wherethey lived their lives As president he will invest in our common futureSo if you want a president who invests in the past finds character where itisnt and helps people where they dont live vote for someone else                                           Skepticism Our campaigns often end up doing thevery opposite of what they intend Bradley laments Instead of engenderinghope and optimism they breed mistrust and cynicism Just last week in Iowaafter I spoke about political involvement once again making our nation bettera woman came up to me and said It all sounds so wonderful if only it couldbe true  Yes the American people have a right to be skeptical But I havea right to try to change that skepticism  I am trying to run a differentkind of presidential campaign Im calling us to renew our faith in eachother            Skepticism as Bradley defines it is about whether a bigmoney politicalsystem will let his vision come true This obscures a more sophisticatedskepticism about whether he has a substantive vision to begin with much less aserious plan to achieve it Bradley isnt asking us to overcome thatskepticism Hes asking us to overlook it And by planting what looks like abold ideathat the purpose of campaigning is to engender optimism and renewour faithhe erases his obligation to tell us how he would govern Bradleyscampaign it turns out isnt about the presidency Its about campaigning            Thepundits cant believe Bradley has nothing to say Some surmise that hescleverly waiting to unveil his platform Others infer that hes alreadymounting a brilliantly oblique attack on Gore Both camps read insight into hisevery remark If you dont recognize his wisdom you must not get what theelection is about Does Bradley get it Dont be a cynic Ask not whether yourcandidate is worthy of you but whether you are worthy of your candidate
