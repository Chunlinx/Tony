                                 The Changelings            When did the WashingtonPost swap identities with the New York Times  One day it seemedthe Post rollicked readers with its cheeky personality and the nextsuffocated them with the sort of overcast official news that made theTimes famous Meanwhile the Times sloughed its Old Gray Ladypersona for the daredevilry that was the Post franchise            Theswitch dawned on me one morning  years ago as I found myself flipping throughthe Post because I had to not because I wanted toand reading theTimes for the joy of it not because it was the newspaper of record Iknow this sounds like the beginning of an encomium for the Times at theexpense of the Post  but its not When the papers traded places theyexchanged virtues as well as vices             In the traded virtue category The Times takes a lotof risks It has turned its back on the five boroughs to become a nationalnewspaper even purchasing the Boston Globe  while the Post hasburrowed deeper locally Its columnists Maureen Dowd and Frank Rich dish thesort of sauce Nicholas von Hoffman and the young Richard Cohen once served atthe Post  It continues to innovate with new sections like MondaysBusiness Day a k a The Information Industries and Saturdays Arts andIdeas while the Post hasnt contributed anything significant to thetemplate since the Style section in  Its Sunday magazine is the bestgeneral interest publication in the world The Post s isnt            Othertraded virtues The Times prints in color the Post doesntyet The Times sports an aggressive and handsome design The recentPost redesign aches like a bad face lift Times Editorial PageEditor Howell Raines writes barrelhouse editorials demanding actionsuch asthe resignation of Janet Renothat stir substance and fanfaronade ThePost editorial and oped pages are so evenhanded that if Scotty Restonwere resurrected his soft gas would appear there alongside that of JimHoagland And the Times seasons its reporting with opinion while theonce liberalandproudofit Post prides itself on cool neutrality somewould count this as a swapped vice and not a swapped virtue On the news sidePost Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr boasts hes so biasfree thathe doesnt vote            On the vice side of the exchange theTimes  takes a lot of risks Its now the primary exponent of whatPost ie Bob Woodward famously called the holy shit storypieces soastonishing that you scream spontaneous profanities when you read them Thedownside of holy shit stories is that they can turn out to be wholly bullshitas Woodward learned in  when a reporter under his editorial watch JanetCooke got caught making up a story about an yearold heroin addict            In itspursuit of holy shit the Times routinely spins out of control In it published the name of the woman who accused William Kennedy Smith ofrapefor no particular reasonand then apologized for it That same year thepaper digested Kitty Kelleys spuriously sourced Nancy Reagan biography on Page In a transparent lunge for a Pulitzer Prize in early  the Timespublished a sevenpart series alleging that the downsizing of the Americanworkforce was creating millions of casualties Actually job creation wasbooming Later that year the paper spread its legs for the theory that TWAFlight  was downed by foul play based on the discovery of PETN residuesin the wreckage The Times reported Law enforcement officers said itwas impossible to know for now whether the explosion was caused by a bomb ora missile because PETN is an explosive component commonly found in bothStill the discovery would seem to knock from contention the theory thatmechanical failure caused the airplane to explode on July  killing all aboard  Emphasis added Eventually the Times and theinvestigators abandoned the PETNbomb theory for the mechanical failuretheory            Just this spring two reckless Times stories slidoff the road Gina Kolata prematurely announced a cancer cure while shopping abook proposal on the subject and Rick Bragg botched a simple story aboutpolice corruption in smalltown Alabama Bragg a writerish reporter who wouldbe at home in Style earned in the June  Times  The jailed sheriffspent  months behind bars not  years as Bragg originally reported Braggalso got the age of the crusading newspaper editor wrong misstated the paperscirculation and mistakenly described the method by which the sheriff defraudedthe government the sheriff cashed checks improperly made out to him he didnot cash checks made out to the government            HorribleJust horrible But consider the alternative Who wants to read a porcelainwhite newspaper that has flushed all its holy shit Whose reporters driveVolvos to work            The Post isnt powered by VolvoyetBut in adopting Old New York Times values of cautiousness and fairnessand dullness in striving to become the new Newspaper of Record thePost has lost its verve Sometimes a loss of verve is not a bad thingCompare the Times and Post coverage of the China satellite storyIn the Times  Jeff Gerth implies that illegal campaign donations fromChina  the extravagant campaign donations by Loral Space  Communicationschief executive to Democratic coffers  Clintons OK of US satellitelaunches The Post s sober coverage expands the theme to detail how thepresident was as happy to fulfill the satellite dreams of the Republicanbusinessman from Hughes who lobbied heavily and donated sparingly as he was tosatisfy the Democratic businessman from Loral who gave hundreds of thousands ofdollars see John Mintzs June  article How Hughes Got What It Wanted on China ThePost s version is probably closer to the facts but Id be lying if Ididnt say that Ive enjoyed the Times  sensationalist coveragemore            Of coursethe Post doesnt tiptoe all the time Woodwards  campaign financepieces struck a chord that still rings and I predict a similar impact forBarton Gellmans twopart series last week about how the United States andChina nearly went to war in  click here and here At its best the Post can still swarm abreaking news story like Flytrap But at its worst it sits on hot news In the paper delayed its expos of masher Sen Bob Packwood ROre untilafter the election thereby assuring his return to the Senate In  itspiked Michael Isikoffs Paula Jones reporting so he left for Newsweek where he has led the Flytrap story            Timesmen dont pay much attention to the Post except to periodically raid the paperas if it were a minor league teamforsome of its better players  Post defectors include Celestine BohlenGwen Ifill Julia Preston Michael Specter Patrick Tyler Patti Cohen andDavid Richardswho defected back Few careers outside of EJ Dionnes havebeen made by going the other way But it should pay closer attention Itdesperately needs something like the Style section where it can run imprudentstories that readers are dying to read but have yet to acquire the Heft andImportance of a New York Times News Story Then again if theTimes were to embrace the virtue of a Style section or is that avice would its news sections lose their current virtue of attitude                           Post ies on the other hand obsess on the Times  Last month atthe Post s annual Pugwash editorial retreat outgoing Managing EditorRobert Kaiser began his speech with the preposterous boast that thePost  with a staff half the size of the Times  does more forits readers day in and day out Kaiser obviously lusts for the OldTimes as he repeatedly calls for authoritative journalism and higherjournalistic standards and petitions Post ies to be more intellectualand creative Authoritative creative journalism that meets the higheststandards must have intellectual content Kaiser says at speechs end as heroadwrecks his themes Somebody get this editor an editor            The question of how the audacious paper turnedstodgy floats over the Post newsroom like a thought balloon The easyanswer Executive Editor Benjamin Bradlee departed in  after  years atthe top This theory singles out current Executive Editor Downie for abuse butcomplacency took root as early as  when the Post s crosstowncompetitor the Washington Star  folded allowing the fat beast todiddle all it wanted without paying a price When Donald Graham took over aspublisher he picked Downie as the editor who would help steer the paper awayfrom the Georgetown elites and toward the masses away from nationalcompetition and straight at the suburban dailies Youre reading the paper theywanted to make            DonGrahams biggest handicap is that hes the publisher who came after Katharineand hes fearful that hell blow her legacy Downies is that he came afterBradlee and hes afraid hell blow his Who remembers the guys who canoedafter Lewis and Clark No wonder they operate the paper as if the frontier hasclosed behind them In that context Grahams conservatism makes businesssense His paper claims the highest reader penetration in the nation and isimmensely profitable Warren Buffett a major stockholder in the companywhispers into his ear that hes a business genius Why disturb the moneymakingmachine            The last time the paper took an editorial risk was in when it barred no expense in relaunching the Washington Post               Magazine as a prestige Sunday magazine on the scale of the New YorkTimes                Magazine  But the Magazine never got to compete withthe Magazine  It was bushwhacked by a black talkradio demagogue whounfairly labeled the debut issue racist and targeted the paper withdemonstrations and a boycott Its momentum shattered the extravagantly fundedWashington Post Magazine limped along for a couple of years until thePost abandoned its grand financial and editorial ambitions anddownscaled it            Varioussections of the Post have improved since thenit has invested heavilyin zoned suburban coverage expanded its business page improved the quality ofits travel section extended the heft of its sports coverage experimented withan advertorial insert about consumer electronics and added a monthly midbrowsciencehistory section Horizonbut its taken no publishing risks            The boldest Post stroke in recent yearscame this spring when Downie dethroned Kaiser as managing editor and appointedSteve Coll a yearold Pulitzer Prizewinning whiz who most recently servedas Sunday magazine editorpublisher Colls vision for the Post  alsolaid out in a Pugwash speech sounds like a description of the New New YorkTimes  The future of the Post depends mightily on our ability toexcel at enterprise journalismon our ability to think more creatively totear the skin off of our subjects more often to write better to go deeper tobe more alive to make more of a difference to readers Good luck Steveyoull need it            Perhaps the Timesderives its edge from its succession politics Whereas Ben Bradlee served asPost editorforlife the Times places an informal term limit onits executive editor job and this turnover has helped to reinvigorate thepaper Times executive editors know they must make their mark in hastebefore their tenure is over AM Rosenthal reinvented the paper during histenure from  to  stealing from Clay Felkers playbook to explode theTimes into a many sectioned national paper His successor Max Frankelbrought vivid writing to the paper from  to  making sure that onestory made it to Page  every day just because it was fun to read JosephLelyveld who took over from Frankel has stayed their courses            Meanwhile the yearoldDownie is now seven years into the job If he were a Times man theyd befarming him out to write a column right about now Instead hes ensconced likethe pope
