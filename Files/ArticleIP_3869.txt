                       Last weekin Slate Jonathan Rauch documented former Secretary of Labor Robert BReichs fabrications in his muchtouted memoir Locked in the Cabinet Reich to Rauchs accusations And Rauch Reichs response                                                    This week thecontroversy continues                                       ThirdReich                        TheJonathan Rauch vs Robert Reich controversy captures the meaning ofcommunication in the new world of Webzines I dont particularly care abouteither party nor do I find the substance of the controversy particularlygripping a reporter and an expolitician going after each other like a coupleof school kids in the playgroundbig deal What did matter to me was beingable to access the gestalt of the experience Sounds like psychobabble but itmeans I liked Rauchs original piece felt and understood Reichs arguments inreply to Rauch and was able to incorporate Rauchs counterarguments all inwhat seemed like a comprehensive whole occurring at one moment in time Sort oflike playing a good point in tennislots of interchange and then a preciseconclusion quick and satisfying It doesnt happen the same way in printjournalism             Gary               Walters Toronto                           Rauch toJudgment                        Thank you for theRauchReichRauch dialogue I found the Rauch counter particularly compellingsince it mirrored exactly my reaction to the Reich reply What struck me mosthowever was how this little folk tale of inaccurate reporting of eventsillustrates a dilemma of modern life            From myoccasional role in affairs reported in the media I have drawn the generalconclusion that very little reporting is  percent accurate Whether theinaccuracies are intentional mere failures to understand or justoversimplifications in order to dumb down the message or meet space or timelimitations matters not My rule of thumb is that  percent right is wayabove average How therefore am I ever to recognize the minimum  percentwrong in most articles It is this question which for me limits mediacredibility more than any other

Recording companies never challenge chairmens changes Obsequious staffoften offer trimmed and tabulated transcripts the better to butter theirbosses            In contrast to a courthouseI can tell you that the official record of any Senate or House proceeding iswhat the chairman says it is Hired recording companies make typed transcriptsof what their stenographer thinks the tape recorder supplemented by writtennotes captured This draft transcript goes back to whomever the senator orcongressman designates for corrections Tradition mandates that changes areassumed to be technical correctionsto set the record straight to translategarbled portions or to sort who said what when more than one person speaks atonce            Corrections can be complete rewrites however Sometimes the corrections areaccurate sometimes awful Angry sarcastic or tongueincheek responses aremost likely to be struck from the record Poor grammar misspoken words andconfrontational moments between important men and women also regularly hit thecuttingroom floor Even the most ethical staff member gets to the typedtranscript draft days or weeks after the event and is dependent upon his or herown memory to edit the record The connection to the stenographers wire hasbeen known to fail suddenly at sensational senatorial clashes Finally membersof the press have also erroneously visualized

Wrights treatise on the evils of shoe companies and theirathlete pitchmen it becomes clear that Wright has failed to do his homeworkat least with regard to the Chicago Bulls Scottie Pippen            Wright calls Pippenreprehensible for his failure to enter a playoff game in which the final shotwas not designed for him Firstlynot that this makes Pippens decision anybetterPippen felt that he ostensibly the Bulls best player at the timeshould be on the floor as an option for the last shot not inbounding the ballHe would most likely draw a double team freeing a teammate for the final shotthereby giving his team a better chance to win His behavior was indeedimmature and boorish Is it not enough however that he publicly apologized tohis coach his teammates and the fans of Chicago            Unlike many selfcenteredand pampered athletes of the s Scottie Pippen is recognized by his peersand in the league as one of the more giving players to disadvantaged youthUnfortunately Pippen does not call the media to follow him around with cameracrews every time he finds an opportunity to give back to the community IsWright aware that on Christmas Eve a couple of years ago Pippen delivered over winter jackets to innercity kids in Chicagos notorious Cabrini Greens orthat he was very upset when USA Today wrote a story about it Is heaware that the Pippen Foundation supports reading programs for disadvantagedyouth in Chicago Does he know of all the Pippen Parks underwritten by Pippenin his home state of Arkansas to provide safe play environments for kids            On more than one occasion ithas been suggested to Pippen that he issue press releases to help the RobertWrights of the world understand who he really is and the values for which hestands His response has always been that it does not matter what people thinkthat he knows and the children know and thats what matters            ScottiePippens problem is that he is a very private personone who has learned andgrown as a person To suggest that he made a mistake by not entering a gameseveral years ago is fair To suggest that he is reprehensible is absurd                           Peter Flack
