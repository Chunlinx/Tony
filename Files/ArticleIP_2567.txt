                                 Father of the Star            When I walk in Georgetownwith my son pretty young girls nudge each other and whisper Its him Itshim They dont mean me My function in this street scene is to hold thegirls camera and take their picture with the Star            I amsurely not the most objective observer of the Ben Stein phenomenon but I amprobably the best informed So let me explore the question How did my sonBen become a Star It wasnt by being the worlds most devoted son making thelong trip from Los Angeles to Washington about once a month to give me companywhich he does It wasnt by being the worlds most devoted father spendingmany hours each day with his yearold son or by writing  books I have adevoted daughter who is a great wife mother writer cook and proIsraelvolunteer workerbut that doesnt make her a Star            You become a Star by being seen repeatedly in arecognizable way by millions of people That means being in the movies orespecially on TV What you have done in these media doesnt matter terriblymuch what matters is having been seen Even after my occasional appearances onTVtalk shows people come up to me and say I saw you on TV They dont saywhether they liked my performance or agreed with what I had to say Theimportant thing is that they recognize a face they have seen on TV            My sonsapproach toward stardom began about  years ago with a movie FerrisBuellers Day Off  and continued through various other films sitcoms andTV commercials But he was not then a fullfledged Star I guess we dont usethe word starlet for such cases it is reserved for something else Whatmade him a Star was his new TV show Win Ben Steins Money  As its namesuggests the show would not be the same without him            WBSM is a unique quiz show It is more playfulthan for instance Jeopardy  Ben first plays the role of the hostexplaining the game and asking the questions But he then becomes a contestantcompeting with the more successful guests There is a witty sometimes rudeinterchange among Ben Jimmy Kimmel the cohost and the guests The closestparallel I can think of is the old Groucho Marx show You Bet YourLife             The factthat the guests are competing for Bens money gives it an unusual thrill Thewinners in other quiz shows are not taking the money away from anyidentifiable live personAlex Trebek on Jeopardy  for example Theyare taking the money from some faceless institutionsuch as Merv GriffinEnterprises But trying to get the money from this wellknown person BenStein who is right there and expressing his torment at losing the moneycreates an unusual tension Of course the money is Bens only in what aneconomist might call the opportunity cost sense That is he did not put itup originally but the more the guests win the less he has to keep            Even after I have seen about  episodes of the show I amstill amazed that my little boy is up there on the screen There has been verylittle theater in the Stein family A greataunt had the candy concession in aYiddish theater on the Lower East Side of New York City An uncle was in thechorus of one of those doughboy musicals after World War I The Steins are notthe Barrymores but there is Ben on the screen Im also amazed at the thingshe knows like of what river the Zambezi is a tributary            He playstwo different characters on the show In one character he is what I think of ashimself He is witty wellinformed and goodnatured In the other characterhe shouts becomes excited and goes through various gestures like bowingsaluting and rapping himself on the chest I much prefer the former but theaudience seems to like it all and thats show business            How does it feel to be the father of a Starpeople often ask me It would be hypocritical of me to deny that there is acertain amount of envy Like almost everyone else I like attention He may bediverting attention from me although those pretty young girls on the streetin Georgetown would not have been giving me attention anyway And there is somegain in attention probably a net gain for me People who never paid anyattention to me as economic adviser to the president or even as a columnistfor                   Slate                do give me some attention because I am the father of aStar And I get satisfaction from thinking that part of his theatrical successderives from the dull voice he inherited from me            But theenvy is a small thing and I confess it only in a rather transparent effort togain credibility Mainly I am happy and proudnot just because he is a TV Starbut because he is a TV Star in addition to being a good son a good father agood writer and an energetic worker for many good public causes I am happy tothink that his mother and I if we did not make him what he is did not preventhim from becoming what he is            Ido feel however some anxiety in this situation In oneof Saul Bellows books there is a sentence which I have never been able tofind since I first read it about grasping the hot wire of publicityand notbeing able to let go Stardom can be addictive It can be so exhilarating thatone needs ever greater amounts of it and can be induced to do silly or recklessthings to get more of it Stardom can also be very transitory and losing itafter once having had it can be terribly depressing I dont think any of thatwill happen to Ben He is too many other solid things in addition to being aStar But that is something the father of a Star worries about when he isntjust enjoying the fun of it all
