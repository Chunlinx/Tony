                                  China Crackup            For the past two weeksRepublicans have raised a ruckus over President Clintons failure to promptlyremove a suspected Chinese spy from the Los Alamos nuclear lab Making theGOPs case on Face the Nation  Sen John McCain RAriz blamed the spyfiasco on six years of inattention and a feckless photoop foreign policyBut when asked how he would treat China McCain sketched a policy hardlydistinguishable from Clintons And when asked about Russias loose nukes heconceded I dont know the answer to this Maybe its inappropriate for me tocome on this program            Its painful to watchRepublicans discuss foreign affairs these days No doctrine binds togethertheir complaints about Clintons actions While calling him soft on China manyquietly espouse the same ClintonBush policy of tradeplusscolding Whiledemanding boldness abroad they have opposed military action in Kosovo IraqSudan and Afghanistan And while falling back on Cold War rhetoric theyignore Russias nuclear garage sale Winning a presidential election on foreignpolicy will be hard enough Winning it without a coherent message will beimpossible The Republican identity crisis is fourfold             The Cold War                Many Republicanssee the spy scandal as an opportunity to revive Cold War rhetoric They alludeconstantly to Los Alamos and the Rosenbergs On Meet the Press  PatBuchanan accused Clinton of failing to clean out a nest of spies in Americasatomic laboratories whove stolen the most vital secrets since the Rosenbergswent to the electric chair At a Senate hearing Tuesday another presidentialhopeful Sen Bob Smith RNH compared the Chinese spy case to past Sovietespionage and warned that it might precipitate another arms race            Other Republicans however realize that nuclearthreats are now diffuse rather than concentrated in one enemy Appearing on thesame show with Buchanan Sen Richard Lugar RInd rejected the Cold Warmodel I accept the fact that the Chinese spy on us Many people do AtTuesdays hearing Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner RVatried to broaden the discussion from China which has  missiles that canreach the United States to Russia whose  such weapons could end up onthe black market            The missiledefensedebate highlights the Republican dilemma The original Strategic DefenseInitiative was supposed to defend the United States against a massive nuclearstrike by the Soviet Union By contrast the missiledefense program approvedby the Senate Wednesday is designed to stop one or two missiles fired by arogue nation such as North Korea or Iran If Buchanan and Lugar cant agree onwhich kind of threat China poses they wont be able to agree which kind ofantimissile system the GOP should stand for             Capitalism The GOP has been the party of freetrade President Bush made this the linchpin of US China policy Over thepast two years the Republican Congress has renewed mostfavorednation tradestatus for China approved legislation enabling US companies to sell Chinanonmilitary nuclear technology and killed a proposed ban on satellite sales tothe Chinese More than  House Republicans signed up last month to sponsorlegislation to relax restrictions on exports of encryption technology despiteClintons objections that this technology might be passed to terrorists Thisweek the Republicanleaning business community launched a lobbying blitz toremind hawks in Congress that China will be the secondlargest computermarket in the world by the year             Yet the GOPs bestknownhawk Sen Jesse Helms RNC is leading the charge to restrict trade withChina as punishment for its spying The continuing problems with Chinese humanrights violations espionage and possible technology transfers suggest thatthis is not the appropriate time for China to enter the World TradeOrganization he says Likeminded strategist Bill Kristol denouncesRepublicans who have sided with Clintons policy of trade above all else inChina             Constructive engagement Having ripped Bushsengagement policy in  Buchanan is already locking and loading the samecritique for  The policy of engagement has devolved and degenerated intoa policy of appeasement he declared this week Many conservatives sayengagement has led to nuclear proliferation deterioration in human rights andnow laxity against espionage            Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich avidly defendedengagement however and his successor Rep Dennis Hastert RIll agreesThe more were involved with China the better off we arefor us and forChina and the Pacific area Hastert said last week Its also important thatwe stress our views on human rights If we arent engaged we cant do thatLikewise Sen Craig Thomas RWyo rejected his colleagues fierce responseto the spy story Ive never supported the idea that every time China doessomething we dont like we ought to submit a thing to the Senate and get afterthem            The GOPs identity crisisover engagement is almost comic When Sam Donaldson pointed out on ThisWeek that two Republicans President Richard Nixon and Secretary of StateHenry Kissinger had pioneered engagement in the Shanghai Communiqu GeorgeWill exploded I was for impeaching Nixon over the ShanghaiCommuniqu Clintons spokesmen have learned to brush off Republican criticsof engagement by quoting the policys Republican defenders             Clinton Republicans arent sure whether to blamethe spy case on ideology or corruption Some want to paint Democrats as soft ondefense Sen Tim Hutchinson RArk calls the case symptomatic of the casualattitude with which the Clinton administration views issues of nationalsecurity Others want to blame it on Chinese contributions to the DemocratsMcCain for example demands an investigation of the allegations abouttechnology transfer and all these campaign contributions that came out ofChina            Nor have conservatives figured out whether to blameDemocrats in general or Clinton in particular Many have grown more disgustedwith Clintons triangulations than with congressional Democratsstraightforward liberalism The Clinton China policy from the first has beensubsumed into the permanent campaign says the Wall Street Journal citing objections to that policy from Democrats and Republicans alikeMoreover given the political damage the GOP has suffered by unilaterallyimpeaching Clinton Republican leaders fear that the merits of their argumentswill once again be drowned by charges of partisanship Sure enough this weekClinton spokesman Joe Lockhart accused the GOP of using the spy case forpartisan pointscoring            To beat the partisanship rap several Republicanleaders are invoking Democrats as their allies against Clinton House MajorityLeader Dick Armey RTexas cites a growing unrest over China on both sidesof the aisle and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas accuses Clinton oftrying to cover up Congress bipartisan findings of laxity in ClintonsChina policy When ABCs George Will tried to goad Rep Chris Cox RCalifinto blaming Democrats for suppressing those findings Cox shot him down Itis not a Democratic party position because Democrats and Republicans haveworked very closely together on this issue            If Clintons approach toworld affairs has been aimless and inconsistent assailing his China policyfrom all directions is hardly the way to make that point The opposite ofinconsistency is principle And the GOP has yet to figure out what itsprinciple is
