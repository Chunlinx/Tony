                what kind of car would you like to buy next   well i guess Cadillac i guess thats kind of everybodys dream   huh why would that be a   oh i guess its a General Motors product and i like General Motors because theyre made in the United States and uh weve had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them   okay well thats good if you had uh no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy   umhum oh  um i think id still go with a Cadillac i dont i dont care about a big fancy fancy   say what which type of Cadillac uh is your favorite   oh i dont know i guess the Seville probably or yeah yeah   the Seville thats a sharp looking car that really is it it always has been though   yeah they have been   you know it doesnt have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness it never really has its always had its own unique look   uhhuh   yeah ive always liked that i liked the the one year they had or the couple of years they had were uh       the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it   oh yeah right   i thought now that looks sharp that looks real sharp   yeah well i think the ones uh now with all of the um fancy gold lettering and all you know i think theyre very pretty   umhum   and course the top now the vinyl what is it a vinyl top i think those are pretty   yeah and uh the i ive never really uh ive never ridden in one recently um but theyre supposed to be just real smooth   uhhuh   just a nice comfortable ride   yeah they are and uh they theyre just always they they look like  theyre sturdy you know they look like theyre very sturdy and     uhhuh   you dont have to worry that much about  um getting you know hurt like you would in a small one   right now theyve got a uh a unique feature uh feature in them now if uh if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the engine the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesnt come through the so it does not go it doesnt go through the you know into the inside itll go underneath the car instead   oh i didnt know that   so thats thats a big safety factor theyve got in them now   yeah and i suppose they all have the balloons   the air bags yep   the air bags yeah well   so though thats great thats great so you say youve youve always uh preferred General Motors products what uh   yeah yeah yeah i do um i i go for things you know built in the United States rather than foreign countries help our economy and   right what kind of uh General Motors cars have you had in the past   mostly Oldsmobiles   Oldsmobiles those are real nice riding cars too   yeah oh yeah thats what i have now but of course if i had my choice id still have the Cadillac but um ive been very satisfied with the with the Oldsmobiles weve driven them for about probably twenty years     has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra   uh no the Ninety Eight   the Ninety Eight okay   umhum yeah so   well i dont think uh lets see the Ninety Eight now thats got that big V eight engine in it doesnt it doesnt it   well no now the one we have has a six uhhuh but its a very good car its uh   has a little V six okay   a have not had one minutes problem with it and ive had and i have twenty three thousand miles on it   it oh thats great thats great thats always nice to get uh reliability   yeah   in a product especially when youre spending you know anywhere from fifteen to twenty five thousand dollars for for a single item   right   you know you just dont want any hassles with it you just you expect it to do its its job and i think a lot of   no   a lot of car manufacturers dont really keep that into consideration dont take that into consideration you know   umhum there thats true   they just expect you to buy their product but thats always been something thats been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car gonna be you know price is is an issue but its not the most important issue   umhum no it really isnt because now you can get like five year financing on them and so um but i i i would go with the General Motors any time   right uh well ive always been a Ford man myself   oh really oh   yes but thats all right you know its its American made too which is good um but i ive ever since i guess i was i was growing up my dads always had Fords   yeah well sure right uhhuh   and uh well i grew up in South Dakota so everybody has a truck   uhhuh   and uh my Ford trucks have just ive ive just never had problems with them i honestly think i would die before my truck would kill over on me   uhhuh   yeah well uh Ford yeah those are good products also um   so   doesnt seem like
