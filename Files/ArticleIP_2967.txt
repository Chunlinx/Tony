                                 Sisters Under the Mink            Has anyone noticed thespooky resemblance between these two memoirs Both were written by actressesfamous for playing ethereal damaged or somehow incomplete souls Bothactresses chronicle restless unstable childhoods capped in each case by aquick rise to fame Both regretfully conclude that they were unprepared forthis early acclaim and that missing out on the trial and error of adolescencecaused them permanent damage Considering how successful these women have beeneach of them spends surprisingly little time talking about her work and quite alot discussing her illchosen romantic adventures The great love of eachwomans life was a difficult genius known for his neurotic darkly comicmusings on the battle of the sexes In Blooms case it was the novelist PhilipRoth In Farrows of course it was Woody Allen In both cases the affair wasa long ugly and finally public catastrophe            Whichleads us to another intriguing similarity between Leaving a Dolls Houseand What Falls Away  Both have met with awkward squeamish reviewsCritics have asked tough questions about the writers judgment and motives Howcould these women just sit by and let this happen Why should we believe eitherone when she says that her book is an attempt to understand what happened andnot a bid for revenge In The New Yorker  novelist Daphne Merkincomplained that Bloom asks for more sympathy than she deserves In a pitilessreview in a recent New York Times Book Review  novelist Kathryn Harrisonwrote that Farrow exaggerates the emotional damage wrought by an early boutwith polio unfairly vilifies Allen and tries to solicit sympathy in thecourt of public opinion Merkin doubts Blooms claim that she was helplessOne can discern through the pious gloss Bloom puts on the events of her lifethe shrewd maneuverings of a stage brat Harrison accuses Farrow of exploitingher celebrity and touting her famous friends the glitterati chorus andsays that the account of her battle with Allen will satisfy a Peeping Fanreadership            Why the discomfort One suspects in part a generationalexplanation Feminists todayor at least feminists within the small circle ofwomen assigned to write about women for the elite media many of them a decadeor two younger than Bloom and Farroware more upbeat than they used to be butalso more arrogant and hardhearted They have a buckup attitude They wantwomen to stop harping about men and start taking care of their own lives Mostof all they think that women control what they do with their bodies As longas they consent to something they cant be victims This last idea is infact rather weirdly prominent in the work of both Merkin and Harrison A fewmonths before she reviewed Blooms book Merkin wrote a long personal essay forThe New Yorker about how much she likes to be spanked Harrisons reviewof Farrow precedes by a few weeks her muchgossipedabout new memoir TheKiss  about her consensual love affair with her father            Or maybethe reaction points to a new jaded distrust of celebrity The days when wefelt sorry for the famous are overnowadays we dislike stars who pleadconfusion insecurity and no common sense While this sounds reasonableenough it overlooks the most gruesome similarity of all that in the case ofBloom and of Farrow both it is crippling passivity that brought them to thepublic eye in the first place and crippling passivity that kept them there            Early on both Farrow and Bloom demonstrated aflair for actingand an eerie inertness in their relations with other humanbeings Bloom started appearing on stage at  But for all her worldlyambition she writes to become an actress as young as I did was to enter acloister of my own making  Woefully painfully ignorant of the most basicfacts of life I was always ill at ease in the company of men Farrows entryinto the cloister was even less thought out She was born into it Her fatherwas a Hollywood directoranother difficult genius and a violent alcoholic tobootand her mother was the Irish beauty Maureen OSullivan Dead earnest evenas a child Farrow planned to escape the narrow competitive world of actingto become a Carmelite nun or a pediatrician in Africa until her fathers deathforced her to start earning money Thereafter she never left the fishbowl andwhen she says she never enjoyed it you believe her She bounced from onefamous husband Frank Sinatra who made her sit around while he drank untildawn with the Rat Pack to another Andr Previn who made her schedule herwork around his            Neitheractress knew what she wanted and each was rewarded for her ignorance WhenClaire Bloom was  Charlie Chaplin recognized that her preposterousinexperience and eagerness to please made her the perfect actress to staropposite him in Limelight as Theresa an ideal of preVictorianselfimmolation Farrow says that after Roman Polanski cast her in thecareermaking role of the young pregnant woman in Rosemarys Baby  hetook advantage of her lack of an instinct for selfpreservation and filmed ascene of her threading dangerously through oncoming traffic There are varieties of nuts he marveled approvingly Mias  of them            In their love lives each actress served as MiracleGro toan especially prized kind of male creativity Roth coolly plumbed hisrelationship with Bloom for material At one point he even planned to name acharacter in his novel Deception a hideous dowdy actress and aneverspouting fountain of tearsClaire She found out and made him changeit Allen of course made repeated cinematic use of Farrows skinny creepybeauty and her pained abstracted stare She accurately describes herself aseyes perched on a stalk            To befair Roth emerges as the tamer monster But here too the analogies areuncanny Each courtship begins with the great man sending charming but oddlyformal notes to his beloved or having his secretary call to determine the timeplace and sometimes the precise length of their meeting Both Roth and Allenhold forth on the subject of their favorite artists for Roth Cline andKafka for Allen the old jazz greats Sidney Bechet and Jelly Roll Morton butare less interested in the womens recommendations Both loathe their loverschildren and strive to avoid them Each acts as if everything is all rightthen lets loose with crushing invective Roth resents having to go to theopera having to make arrangements for Blooms mothers funeral and lessunreasonably having to deal with Blooms nervousness in the face of illnessAllen throws a tantrum when he and Farrow are walking together on the UpperEast Side and Farrow points to a house and asks if it belongs to William FBuckley Her sin She was forgetting that he had pointed out Buckleys house toher the year before There were explosions too writes Farrow when I didntknow the name of a certain kind of pasta and again when I was off in myestimate of the weather by only four degrees            To put up with any one of these things letalone all of them requires an almost monstrous lust for effacementa tastefor masochism  These women are character studies in the most terrifyingsort of selflessness the kind that results from the failure to develop a selfTheir celebrity didnt shield them from the consequences of their passivity Infact we have watched them be passive on screen for years and we haveapplauded The Passive Woman has long been one of the most cherished staples ofour culture high and low Who better to play her on screen            Not that any of thisjustifies the truly rotten choices both Bloom and Farrow have made And youcant help but be glad that women these days are at least being told to takecare of themselves But it is curious that these actresses should be attackedinstead of encouraged in their efforts to change Or maybe it isnt socurious Philip Weiss tellingly led his attack on Farrow in the New YorkObserver last week with a little temper tantrum at his mom Leaving aDolls House and What Falls Away seem less like vindictivemanipulative performances than like baby steps in the right direction Theyreevery bit as awkward as their critics accuse them of being Its unnerving tohear the muse speak at last as if a character had escaped from fiction to tellher story for the first time Her voice is unsteady and her conclusionssometimes seem canned evasive not yet complete Bloom glides over hermotives Farrow is humorless and steeped in a bottomless melancholy Stillbetter late than never The Passive Woman deserves a little more of oursupport Itll be a good thing for all of us if she finally gets into the habitof speaking for herself
