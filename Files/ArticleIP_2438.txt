                                 Labors Diversionary Tactics            A friend of mine recentlytook a job organizing with the Service Employees International Union The SEIUyoull recall is the union that nurtured AFLCIO President John Sweeney whowon office a year and a half ago on pledges to revitalizeor at leastresuscitateAmerican labor There is good reason to take those pledgesseriously Between  and  a period when most of the labor movement wassubmoribund Sweeneys SEIU launched a series of clever and dogged organizingcampaigns and nearly doubled its membership But to reverse its fourdecadedecline the AFLCIO will need to do more than adopt the SEIUs organizingwizardry It must convince the nation at large that organized labor is notsimply a lobby a New Deal relic or a clubhouse full of graysuited men                         Just after she was hired myfriend attended a retreat of SEIU organizers and rankandfilers They spentthe weekend chewing over the tactical innovations that have made the unionsreputation card check campaigns that bypass the National Labor RelationsBoards sclerotic certification process aggressive scrutiny of employersfinancial profiles blitzkrieg drives that take on entire sectors at once            Andevery evening she reports with a smile we all stood in a circle and sangThe Internationale             Now the sight in  of selfrespecting American tradeunionists singing a socialist anthemin however jokey a spiritwoulddoubtless set off alarm bells Its easy to imagine Dick Armey and Trent Lottnudging each other with toldyouso glee or Gore and Gephardt averting theireyes with a shudder But youll hear no complaints from me Like my friend Imsomewhere to the left of paleoliberal I believe that human civilization peakedin Sweden circa  I hope my friend and her colleagues have long andhonorable careers tightening labor markets and kicking the shit out ofcorporations that bully or cheat their workers            But I haveto confess Something about that SEIU retreat sounds depressing Imagine it Inthe daytime Jesuitical preparations for long uphill organizing drives Andthen for uplift and inspiration a chance to sing Solidarity Forever andother anthems that no normal person under the age of  has ever heard Thisis bear in mind one of the most vigorous and progressive corners of the labormovementand yet it somehow carries the odor of a fading religious sect            This is John Sweeneys burden The Americanlabor movement is alone like no other in the advanced industrial worldIt operates in a crippling legal environment The TaftHartley Act of  andits ensuing case law have erected absurd barriers to workers freedom ofassociation For the price of a lawyer and a few gnatsize fines nonunionemployers can comfortably fire workers simply because they seek to organizeIn Canada the country whose economy is most similar to ours organizingworkers are better protected from dismissaland per capita union membership ismore than twice the US level            And whereWest European labor movements are well embedded within a broader left theAmerican left is populated by romantic individualists whose pulses are not setracing by the letters AFLCIO Elaine Bernard the Canadian scholar whodirects Harvard Universitys Trade Union Program quips I sometimes thinkthat American radicals will march in solidarity with any countrys workingclass except their own            The tactical savvy that Sweeney brings might help stanchthe AFLCIOs bleeding its been losing more than  members a year Buttactics alone wont rescue labor from its peculiar weakness and insularity Tobreak through that barrier the AFLCIO will need to convince a majority ofAmericansor at least a muscular pluralitythat solidarity is good for whatails us They need to sell the case that our colossal wage inequality is not afact of nature that a progressive labor movement can make our workplaces moredecent and more productive and that strong unions can leverage gains not onlyfor their members but for the broader society            Makingthis case wont be easy but its unavoidable Without such a framework eventhe cleverest organizing tactics will come to seem hollow As Bernard saysThe labor movement is eternally in danger of becoming a Contracts R Usoperation that only services its existing members Youve got to look in themirror every morning and ask yourself What am I organizing for              If labor were less defensive and insular andbetter embedded in a larger reform movement it might be more motivated toaddress its own shortcomings Firstahemthere is the matter of housekeepingGod bless the day when no ones Uncle Ed will be able to lean across theThanksgiving table and say So I hear youre working for the labor movementIsnt that Americas last bastion of mobsters racists and hacks            Second a humbler labormovement might be less likely to cut shortsighted political deals that undercutits larger purpose There was a pathetic scene a few weeks ago in Los Angeleshome to several respected laborcommunity initiatives These alliances havesweated blood in fights with Republican Mayor Richard Riordan over publictransportation housing and health care But in February the Los AngelesCentral Labor Council voted to endorse Riordans reelection bid after hedangled promises of an immense hoteldevelopment project The endorsementvote which was narrow to begin with was later rescinded after an outcryRiordan won anyway            Andtheres also a risk that tactical innovations like the SEIUs will come at theexpense of movementbuilding            Several weeks ago I spoke with a New York City organizerabout the disastrous newspaper strike in Detroit This organizer is an alumnusof the AFLCIOs muchpraised Organizing Institute which trains bothrankandfile workers and zealous college students in the latest tactics Hewas full of scorn for labors plans for a national march on Detroit this JuneThats the lamest idea imaginable he said Even if  people show upwhos going to pay attention If they want to win a decent contract in Detroitwhat they need is a squad of  people who will target the boards of directorsof Gannett and KnightRidder Find out where they live Jam their fax machinesHarass them when they go shopping Thats how you defeat corporatepower            This sort of strategy is verymuch in the Organizing Institutes spirit Its training materials stressfinding the person who can give you what you want and making his or her lifehell The ghost of Max Weber might denounce these fratboy tactics with a longsermon about means and ends but Im a bit more tolerant After all employersroutinely do things just as nasty Did you catch the story a few weeks agoabout the CocaCola truck driver who was bribed thousands of dollars as part ofan effort to subvert an organizing drive            But Im still uncomfortableIsnt there something amiss when a movement based on solidarity and cooperationtrains its organizers to behave as if they were in a Hobbesian world of allagainst all The New York organizer is probably correct The march on Detroitwont do much to help win a contract But without a steady drumbeat of publicengagementthrough marches debates CSPAN the worksthe labor movementwill continue to smell of anachronism So kudos to Sweeney for toning laborsmuscles Now lets work on the heart and the voice
