                                 Pats Personal History            Pat Buchanans new book A Republic Not anEmpire  has drawn fire for its claim that Hitler posed no threat toAmerican national interests Already some Republicans have disavowed him andsome historians such as NormGoda Gerhard L Weinberg and Robert G Kaufman have rebutted himBut Buchanans Hitlerophilia is just the start of his problems The real newsabout A Republic Not an Empire is that it repeatedly warps Americanhistory to support Buchanans nativist ideology Click to read if todayscongressional Republicans would have voted to stop Hitler            The aim of Buchanans book is to revive thedoctrine of isolationism and restore legitimacy to its advocates As Buchanannotes the term isolationist which he rejects was coined in the s todenigrate those who would keep America out of European wars For Buchanan whatothers call isolationism has a noble history dating to George Washingtonsadmonition that America should steer clear of permanent alliances In the th century Buchanan argues presidents obeyed and the nationthrived But with the SpanishAmerican War he says the policy was junked andsince then weve been rushing headlong into ruin            Errors distortedemphases discredited theories internal inconsistencies and outrightprejudice permeate Buchanans book right from the beginning Early on herefers to the American West before European settlers arrived as empty landFor a screed against American imperialism his book is astonishingly uncriticalabout the nations violent conquest of the West In writing about the Battle of Tippecanoethe showdown between the troops of the Indian leaderTecumseh and of the Indiana Gov William Henry HarrisonBuchanan treats theIndians as Britains hired minions who ran around scalping Americans for sportrather than a threatened people who enlisted Britain in a strategic allianceHe also describes the Florida of the early  th century as a havenfor  marauding Indians who regularly crossed into US territory to pillageburn and murder and calls Andrew Jackson who ruthlessly waged war againstthem a man of vision unapologetic about the means he employed to realizethe destiny he foresaw for America Theres much to admire about AndrewJackson  but his brutal Florida campaign should elicit at least pause if notapologies            Buchanans determination to see the  th centuryas a success story the better to underscore the failures of th century policy also leads him to a rosy view of theMexicanAmerican War Dismissive of those who have questioned Americasaggressive annexation of the Southwest he argues that opponents of annexationwere dupes of Britain Actually expansion aroused Northern fears mainlybecause it promised to create more states hospitable to slavery but inBuchanans telling the central issue of antebellum America garners barely amention The Anglophobia returns when he buys into hoary theories that Americafoolishly accepted the Open Door Policy in China because the British hadconned Secretary of State John Hay Buchanan also resurrects yearold claimsthat the wily schemes of Wall Street financiers and munitionsmakers plungedAmerica into World War I And as Kaufman notes in the Weekly Standard recent scholarship suggests Kaiser Wilhelm was more of a continental menacethan previously recognized and that the war wasnt necessarily the mistakecommon wisdom once held it to be            Buchanans theory of th century foreign policy is basically that Democratic presidentshave been bad His vituperation for Woodrow Wilson extends beyond the familiarargument that Wilsons arrogance sabotaged his efforts to win Senate approvalfor joining the League of Nations Buchanan also faults Wilson for impugningthe patriotism of socalled hyphenatesimmigrants who wanted American policyto favor their native lands The criticism is plainly disingenuous In two ofhis last three chapters Buchanan bashes Jewish and MexicanAmericans forspeaking up on behalf of Israel and Mexico Likewise Buchanan until now notknown as a friend of Asian immigrants sheds crocodile tears for theJapaneseAmericans interned during World War IIapparently so he can takeanother swipe at Franklin Roosevelt            This brings us to the muchreported World War IIcontroversy Buchanan argues that Britain and France never should have pledgedto defend Poland Had the Allies acquiesced in Hitlers invasion therefollowing mind you Germanys unchallenged invasions of the RhinelandAustria and Czechoslovakia then Hitler would have spared the West andattacked Stalins Russia leading the two regimes to fight to the deathBuchanan further argues that after Germanys loss in the Battle of Britain in the United States was safe and thus Roosevelt who inveigled the countryinto war is at fault for the  American lives lost            Counterfactualsareunprovable They carry rhetorical power but no meaning Besides as Goda andWeinberg  have both shown at TomPainecom Hitler did plan for war with America In he commissioned bombers that could reach New York City and Germanyactively quested for the atomic bomb And even if Germany had ignored theUnited States and achieved only its goal of becoming master of EuropeBuchanans words no historian would agree that American interests would haveremained unimperiled            As for the charges against FDR they too are specioustheresidue of s conspiracy theories by the ultrarightists Buchanan seeks toredeem Yes in  politicians of both parties ran for office promisingpeace while contemplating war But throughout  and  the overallclimate became increasingly belligerent making neutrality untenable For awhile Roosevelt succeeded anyway in his balancing act supporting Americasallies as he knew he had to while satisfying popular antiwar sentiment withwhat he called in a Fireside Chat of Dec   methods short of warMainly this policy meant LendLease a congressional act that allowed theUnited States to arm countries under attack most importantly Britain In thePacific theater meanwhile FDR pursued a diplomatic resolution with Japanuntil late November  when he learned that Japan was continuing itssouthward aggression despite the negotiations            Recently Buchanan boxedin by criticisms has insisted that he does agree the United States should havedeclared war on Germanybecause Germany declared war on the United Statesfirst He has called it a damnable lie to claim that he doesnt consider thewar to have been a noble one But he doesnt realize how this admission leaveshim without an argument If going to war against Hitler was ultimately theright policy then in hindsight Buchanans beloved isolationists even ifwellintentioned were wrong Buchanan might reply with what he says in hisbook that FDR maneuvered us into one collision after another with Germany andJapan so that war would be thrust upon us in other words that the UnitedStates effectively made the choice to wage war first But if thats the case aconsistent argument would have to stick by the claim that the war was amistakea position even Pat Buchanan knows to be untenable in a presidentialelection            To revive the isolationists reputation Buchanan alsodistorts the views of Charles Lindbergh who even his sympathetic biographer AScott Berg admits was an antiSemite While Buchanan correctly notes that manynonbigots opposed the war Lindbergh isnt so easily exonerated Lindberghopenly admired Hitler cozied up to Hermann Goering and branded Jews asunAmerican agitators who used their alleged power to attain their parochialends Buchanan pities the Lone Eagle who he says suffered for the rest ofhis lifeand beyond for uttering three short paragraphs Recently Buchananyelled at CBSs Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation for asking about apassage in A Republic Not an Empire in which he bemoans the allegedpower of the Israeli lobby That is one paragraph out of a point essayBuchanan retorted suggesting an affinity with Lindbergh In fact just asLindbergh was guilty of more than three offending paragraphs Buchanansbigotry is not confined to just one paragraph of this book as             Buchanan cant reconcile his lifelonganticommunism with the antiinterventionist philosophy that supposedly uniteshis book so when it comes to the Cold War he carves out an absurd exceptionThe extreme evil of communism he says warranted military action in places asfarflung as Vietnam or as minuscule as Nicaragua Hitler wasnt a threat tothe United States but Ho Chi Minh was Nearly everyone agrees today that theVietnam War was unwinnable and was needlessly prolonged so America could saveface But Buchanan deems it a legitimate war of containment that could havebeen won in half the time  if the United States had used full conventionalpower Incidentally he also asserts wrongly that Richard Nixons Christmasbombing of Hanoi in  made peace possible In fact the peace treaty signedin January  differed little from one on the table the previous October Thekey to peace lay in Nixons decision to jettison his demand that Ho Chi Minhwithdraw from South Vietnama demand that he could have renounced four yearsearlier sparing  American lives            One could go on Buchanan throws in tenuousassertions and crusty old theories willynilly regardless of their provenanceThats because he has set out to make an argument and only then rounded upwhatever evidence he can find to support it And the real argument that comesthrough is less about foreign policy aimshis arguments on behalf of Cold Warintervention make that clearthan about a nativist vision of America whereforeigners arent to be trusted where the fates of Indians blacks and Jewsdont count Most Americans reject this vision But even those who dont shouldrealize that Buchanans methodforming his conclusions based on prejudicethen rustling up the support for theminvariably produces bad history
