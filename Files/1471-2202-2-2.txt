                    Background        Although intense efforts are being directed toward the        development of safe and effective viral vectors that permit        the introduction of foreign genes into mammalian cells        chemical transfection continues to attract interest not        only because chemicals are less difficult to use from a        technical standpoint but also because this form of gene        transfer may prove less toxic and immunogenic from a        therapeutic perspective   Synthetic vectors include        cationic polymers such as polyethyleneimine PEI and        polylysine as well as cationic lipids such as        Lipofectamine   and negatively charged liposomes          The unique chemical properties of PEI underscore its        potential as a vector for gene delivery For example PEI        has a very high cationic charge density making it useful        for binding anionic DNA within the physiological pH range          and forcing the DNA to form condensates small enough to        be effectively endocytosed   which is the primary mode        of the PEIDNA complex into the cell     Via the        endosomal compartment PEIDNA complexes travel to the        nucleus whereupon the plasmid DNA is expressed within         hours after the initial attachment of the complexes to the        cell surface   Another property of PEI that makes it        suitable as a DNA vector is its structure in which every        third atom is a protonatable amino nitrogen that allows the        polymer to function as an effective buffering system for        the sudden decrease in pH from the extracellular        environment to the endosomallysosomal compartment This        feature is important for the protection of genetic material        as it travels to the nucleus           Over  cell lines have been successfully transfected        using PEI including COS cells   rat hepatocytes          human dendritic cells    and mouse mammary        epithelial cells   Especially exciting is the ability        of PEI to introduce foreign genetic material into fully        differentiated postmitotic cells         in vitro  Such examples include        mouse myotubes   and chick embryonic neurons          Lambert et al   also demonstrated PEImediated uptake        of nucleic acids in rat sympathetic neuronalglial        cocultures in serumsupplemented media In this report we        describe the application of PEI in the transfection of        postmitotic rat sympathetic neurons in serumfree        gliafree conditions thereby showing the capability of PEI        as a method for studying the effects of targeted genetic        manipulation in a rigorously defined cell culture system        In addition we show that foreign genetic material can also        be introduced into human retinal neurons that are decades        old                    Results                  Expression of galactosidase in SCG neurons          Transfection conditions were optimized using cultures          of postmitotic sympathetic neurons that had been treated          with a DNA synthesis inhibitor to remove nonneuronal          cells Neurons were transfected on the fifth day           in vitro           Three days after transfection galactosidase gal          activity was detected in a subpopulation of sympathetic          neurons Figure Aand B Labeling was present in both          the soma and processes Labeled axons could be followed          for many millimeters and growth cones were consistently          labeled gal protein could also be detected using          immunocytochemical methods and the labeling pattern was          identical to that detected using Xgal Figure C          Another gene that is commonly used to identify          transfected cells EGFP was also successfully introduced          into sympathetic neurons using PEI Figure D As with          gal EGFP was detected throughout the neurons          including synaptic varicosities and growth cones          Pretreatment of our cultures with          cytosineDarabinofuranoside prior to transfection almost          completely eliminates the presence of nonneuronal cells            To further demonstrate that the transfected cells in          our cultures are neurons we transfected cultures with          the plasmid encoding EGFP and then immunostained them          using an antibody for microtubuleassociated protein           MAP a neuronspecific marker Ninetyfive out of           EGFP cells were also MAP Figure  indicating that          the vast majority of transfected cells in our cultures          are neurons Those few cells that expressed EGFP but not          MAP possessed a clearly distinct morphology from the          neurons such as smaller size and shorter processes and          thus were easily distinguished from neurons in subsequent          experiments                          Transfection efficiency is dependent on DNA PEI          ratio and concentration          Consistent with previous results                we found that the gal transfection efficiency varied          according to the ratio of DNA to PEI Figure  Peak          yield was observed at a ratio of  g plasmid DNA to  g          PEI concentration of PEI stock is  gl in  ml          culture media producing   transfected cells As the          number of protonatable nitrogens on the linear  kD          ExGen  PEI polymer at physiological pH is roughly          equal to  nmol per g PEI and  g DNA corresponds          to  nmol phosphate groups this means that the peak          yield observed was at a PEI nitrogen DNA phosphate NP          ratio of   Thus the most suitable NP ratio for           in vitro sympathetic neurons          appears to be around  creating positively charged          DNAPEI complexes            The percentage of gal neurons varied according to          the total amount of DNAPEI complex added to the          cultures Keeping the   DNA PEI ratio constant lower          yields were obtained at   and   DNA PEI          Figure  Toxicity increased at higher overall amounts          of DNAPEI Figure                           Kinetics of foreign gene expression          Sympathetic neurons were transfected with gal          plasmid and PEI  g  g ratio At various times          thereafter  h  d  d  d  d  d cells were          fixed and assayed for the presence of galactosidase          activity gal neurons were detected as soon as  h          posttransfection Figure  a finding consistent with          previous work   A maximum of   gal neurons were          observed at  d posttransfection with   DNA PEI          followed by a progressive decrease from  d to  d          During this time many gal neurons appeared to either          die or cease expression of the foreign gene However the          percent of cells expressing galactosidase at  d           was similar to the percent at  d  This          suggests that the neurons that still expressed          galactosidase by  d continued to do sothrough  d          Therefore PEImediated gal expression in a certain          percent of neurons is persistent                          Cotransfection of gal EGFP          To determine how efficiently cotransfection occurred          with PEI we used gal and EGFP together in a            ratio with the overall DNA PEI ratio at  g plasmid          DNA  g PEIml culture media Neurons expressing EGFP          were also found to express galactosidase Figure            out of  transfected neurons examined clearly          demonstrated expression of both plasmids indicating that          cotransfections are reliable using this method                          PEImediated transfection in cultured human retinal          ganglion cells          Cultures of cells dissociated from adult human retina          were transfected with plasmid encoding EGFP after           weeks           in vitro using the same protocol          developed for sympathetic neurons A variety of cells          were transfected most notably glia Figure A Smaller          processbearing cells expressing EGFP were also detected          Figures Aand B these cells possess a morphology that          strongly suggests a neuronal origin Similar types of          cells were able to express the gal plasmid as well not          shown                            Discussion        Our data demonstrate the utility of polyethyleneimine as        a vector for exogenous gene delivery in cultured neurons        Although the sources of the neurons varied widely in age        and species PEI was nonetheless able to facilitate the        expression of at least two foreign genes LacZ and EGFP in        each of the experimental settings This finding underscores        the versatility of PEI as a method for introducing genes        into postmitotic populations of cells particularly as our        previous efforts to transfect sympathetic neurons using        lipidbased reagents Lipofectamine and Lipofectin had        been unsuccessful        From a technical standpoint PEI is relatively        straightforward as commercial preparations are sterile and        ready for use There are however important factors to        consider while striving for optimal results The first is        maximizing yield and minimizing toxicity Although the        reasons for PEI toxicity are not completely clear it        appears to involve the disruption of the endosomelysosome        complex    In our experimental conditions the        optimal density for transfection of rat sympathetic neurons        is around  neuronsmm  in contrast to a typical culture        density of  neuronsmm   This allows for sufficient        numbers of transfected cells and appears to lessen the PEI        burden per neuron yet does not preclude detailed        morphological analyses of individual neurons Another        factor is the presence of serum Based on our unpublished        observations rat sympathetic neurons that are transfected        in the absence of serum show much greater toxicity than        those in which  serum is temporarily added for the        transfection process data not shown Furthermore the        presence of serum does not seem to greatly interfere with        the transfection process of either rat sympathetic or human        retinal neurons although in other cell types it sometimes        does    Rinsing the cultures immediately after        centrifugation is also a critical step in mitigating the        toxic effects of PEI Increasing the number and volume of        rinses improves cell survival but decreases the yield of        transfected cells data not shown Clearly such        parameters must be tailored to the specific type of cell        under investigation        Altering the ratio of DNA to PEI also affects the yield        In our neuronal cultures it appears that the DNA PEI ratio        of  g  g or  which produces complexes that bear a        net positive charge produces the highest yield This is in        contrast to previously published data showing that        positively charged complexes and neutral complexes produce        comparable yields in lung epithelial cells   However        considering that the optimal DNA PEI ratio may vary from        cell line to cell line   this is not an unexpected        finding        Perhaps the most attractive aspect of PEImediated gene        delivery is the flexibility of the method For example a        DNAPEI ratio of  also produces reasonable numbers of        transfected neurons in our system meaning that the        measurement of the DNA and PEI solutions need not be        rigorously accurate for the transfection process to work        The applications can vary greatly as well PEI may be used        in conjunction with adenovirus vectors              and can be conjugated to various ligands for targeted gene        delivery    or to minimize nonspecific interactions        with blood when injected into the circulatory system          It also has been shown to be effective as a vector for         in vivo transfection in the mouse        brain    and lung    as well as a potential        way to target therapeutic genes to tumors          Our results confirm the findings of others that show the        possibility of transfecting postmitotic fully        differentiated cells using PEI    In addition we        show that adult human retinal neurons which have been        fully differentiated as long as seven decades are capable        of expressing foreign genes when administered in this        manner As the eye is considered to be the most accessible        part of the central nervous system any method of gene        transfer that works on human retinal neurons         in vitro presents an attractive        avenue of research for potential         in vivo applications                    Materials and Methods
