        what are your views Mister     uh  i think Vietnam war was justified but it was carried out badly unfortunately politician got a hold of it and it was a military victory but it was uh id say uh a political defeat what what what do you think about of world i mean the Vietnam War   well im just not really still not really sure why the war started uh there was a conflict with the Vietnamese had conflict with the French i  i know that and theyve been in a war like state for seems like most of the time that their countries been prospering so theyre just award tarnation   no uh from what i remember was uh the French had a Vietnam as a colony   uhhuh   and then after the war World War II uh Vietnam wanted to become independent of of France   uhhuh   so they started an up rising and that was the French and oh Chinese War   uhhuh   and and uh basically Vietnamese Vietnamese where beating the French so we took over because we had our containment policy and uh the north side of Vietnam went to Russia for military aid and so  we didnt want so we didnt want  Vietnam  become communist so thats why we started supporting the South Vietnamese Vietnamese thats how the war started   does oil come into the equation all of that is there oil in that area see oil is a a motivating factor for most of the   uh   altercations that go on in the world   but its not necessarily oil i i i know you are talking about like uh natural resources but i dont think they had that much of a natural   exactly   to much natural resource its just like i said our we had a containment policy and if we didnt help the South Vietnamese   umhum   the North Vietnamese would have definitely won and then our views in those days they would have become communist or pinko   umhum   so we didnt want that so we got into the war   what about what do you think about strategic location just as if you think about it Russia has Cuba which is an island outside the United States and United States has Japan thats right out side of Cuba it it does Vietnam have a any strategic location   uhhuh uh actually i i i really havent considered that much about a strategic location   umhum   hum uh other than it being another country falling to the to pinkos or the communist no not to much real strategic location its just uh for for Russia to continue it has to expand if it doesnt expand itll collapse   umhum   so by doing our containment policy were defeating Russia   umhum   i dont know if uh if that containment policy was was right or the best   uhhuh   but that was our our little view then   i sort of believe that the Vietnam because of the Vietnam war and the the way that the United States exited from it that that has brought on other scrimmages and i i thinks that thats some what related to the Gulf War because it makes the American people keep safe face   uh i i i agree partial with you the Vietnam War made us loose loose faith uh politically and and that and and to the fact that the American public cant stomach war or high causality so we arent really steadfast in that regard but military we unquestionably you know unquestionably quick ass in Vietnam   umhum   uh it might have had probably did have some repercussions repercussions towards now you know people do the enemy does know if the America takes high causality it will leave   umhum   just like in uh uh that uh a car bombing or three hundred marines were killed and we just got the hell out   from umhum umhum is this is this something in your in your military in your military training that that uh suggests that that is  a um procedure of the of the American way of war   uh what what is uh low causality or high causalities   right is there you know like there
