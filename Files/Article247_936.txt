                                 Partly Mozart            Went to the Kennedy Center Thursday night to see the Los Angeles Operasproduction of The Abduction from the Seraglio  which is nearing the endof a onemonth run            Opera is something I know zilch about Whenever I go I recall an essay Iread in college A Soviet literary criticeither Viktor Shklovsky or RomanJakobsondescribed ostranenie or making strange Great art thecritic implied hews comfortingly to the familiar but cultivates states ofmind that challengingly make the familiar fresh In those days we buddingartistes found this doctrine a congenial one since you could carry it out bygetting drunk before lectures or going to breakfast stoned            But the essays example was Tolstoys use of Natasha Rostova in War andPeace  At Tolstoys balls teas and operas even jaded readers get to seeeverything anewbecause we see it through Natashas gushing teenybopperheart At balls Natasha doesnt understand the music and looks at mens facesAt teas she doesnt understand the conversation and concentrates on the cakesAt operas she doesnt understand whats going on onstage and just scans at thecrowd            Its a good point but it was lost on us since we were all more or lessunfamiliar with balls teas and operas ourselves So perhaps Im justextrapolating a generalized boobery out of my own specific ignorance Butwhenever I go to the opera I feel like Im in a roomful of Natashas            The showstealer Thursday night was the baritone Gunter Missenhardt as thePashas sadistic overseer Osmin He has sung the role in half dozen bigEuropean houses and seems made for itburly and snarly with a gift forviolent gesture            But for this Washington crowd the delight was more than operatic At theend of Act  Osmin catches the four lovers trying to escape their Turkishcaptivity Since the Pasha owns three of them he would be within his rights tohang them He pardons them of course and sends them on their cooing way Butwhile hes thinking it over Osmin goes into a paroxysm of bloodthirstdemanding that the four be first decapitated then hanged then impaled thenburnt at the stake then tied up and drowned and then flogged                           Erst gekopft dann gehangendann gespiesst auf heisse Stangendann verbrannt dann gebundenund getaucht zuletzt geschunden                        Osmin delivers this tirade while jumping and grunting and flapping his whipIn so doing he shows us that a great deal of sadism animality and outrightlust can lurk behind peoples anodyne professions that they just want touphold the law or maintain a level of decency To fall afoul of the tiniestlaw or custom is to issue orgyinvitations to the authorities            Washingtonians know this Its what lawmaking nowadays is all aboutPresident Clinton is our leading Osmin victim having nearly lost his officefor conduct that in other countries would be considered praiseworthy But hesalso our leading Osminist Look at how deadbeat dads are jailed how drugusing smallfry get put away for decades how the  of Americans who continueto smoke are gradually being made liable for the entire federal budget            So it wasnt Missenhardts singingmarvelous though that wasthat madeOsmins rantings so thrilling It was that all the Natashas in this Washingtonaudience had suddenly recognized themselves And we are all Osminists now             Christopher Caldwell
