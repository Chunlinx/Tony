                                 I Fit the Profile            Ive been through securitycountless times at countless places and I pride myself on wasting the leastamount of time This requires that I be fully cooperative I am also a privatepilot and so I can affect a pretty good yes sir yes maam style of snappycamaraderie When airport security is tightened and everyone is being askedMay I look into this bag please I reply happily You bet sir Let me openit for you            On arecent Friday I picked up my prepaid overnight roundtrip tickets  minutesbefore departure without any checkin luggage The ticketing agent told methat my carryons would be searched and that I needed to obtain a signaturefrom security on an attached label in order to board I said Yes maam noproblem I thought Security must be really tight today            With no lines at security I got through in record time Mybags got Xrayed and my level of whatever those portals you walk throughmeasure was determined to be under the threshold I must be the person with thelowest metal content in the history of air travel I do not even carry smallchange I am practical So I asked the security people What about thesignature A supervisor appeared quickly signed while avoiding my naivelyfriendly gaze and handed me to Junior who then proceededmethodically ifnot neatlyto unpack everything I was carrying and to toss my clothestoiletries etc into a dirty bin nearby            Then ithit me It was not that security was especially tight It was only methey wanted And that May I polite foreplay had gone out the window Thelabel my friendly hometown airline had affixed to my bags had unexpectedly mademe a marked man someone selected for some unknown special treatment Theroutine was broken the power had shifted the violation had begun I suddenlyfelt as if in the grip of a giant vise a terrible feeling I had lastexperienced as a teenager before fleeing Communist Hungary            When I recount this story to friends this iswhere they start to smile as if a diagnosis of my condition had suddenlybecome apparent After all if someone with posttraumatic stress disorderjumped  feet in the air every time a door slammed shut good friends would bemore concerned about the persons condition not the door In a like manner myfriends may suspect I am suffering from some Hungarian Refugee Syndrome whichmakes me overly sensitive to perfectly reasonable intrusions by the state            I try toexplain The communism I had fled was hardly traumatic or violent One aspectof the horrible vise was the constant minor humiliations I had to suffer suchas interaction with the block warden the party overlord of a block of houseswho had to give his assent to all matters tiny or grand including travel Onthis Friday in the United States I was being singled out for an unusual andhumiliating search My personal goal was to fly to Los Angeles for a meetingthat was important to me If I had refused the searchcried NO as itwereI assume they would have let me go home but I would have been forbiddento board the plane and would have missed my meeting So I did what I had done years ago I chose to be humiliated just so I could reach my goal            Ive just had my FAA physical for my pilots license It isa thorough search for diseases and disabilities I knew what it would entailwhy they do it and that everybody is treated the same way I had no problemwith that            The airportsecurity searchtook about six minutes Junior kept up an awkward canned patter assuring methat I would be a safer person for this and that he understood my anger Imumbled a lie about how I was not angry with him personally First I attemptedto hang onto my dignity by being passive However as time stretched out Ifound myself cooperating to get it over with            Icollected my clothes from the bin my tie from the floor I was free to go toLA            The next day I found the Note in the returnticketenvelope Of course it had been there from the beginning slipped in by theticket agent But who reads those inserts next to the Limitations on BaggageLiability The salient paragraphs from the Note                           Why wasI chosen                        Passengersare selected both randomly and through an objective systematic approach basedon direction from the FAA                           How canI avoid this in the future                        Please understand thatFederal Regulations prohibit FAA personnel XXXX Airlines and all other aircarriers from sharing specific information regarding this program with thepublic            Who couldbe against an objective systematic approach except for the inventor of theautomatic buzzword generator that gives us terms like synchronized synergisticsystems What does based on mean Is the airline just following orders oris it adding its own fantasies And as to what one can do to avoid thistreatment in the future good question the pamphlet is clear nothing            The following Wednesday I had to fly to LA again thistime with an associate I decided against carryons I still felt like a totalparanoiac when I repacked the contents of my soft carryon bag into a hardcasebag to check in and when I asked my associate to do the same But I wasdetermined not to be humiliated again And of course we flew Another AirlineAt curbside checkin the agent noticed my oneway ticket Uhoh Well have tocheck it inside Surprise            Both of you guys have beentagged by the computer            What does this mean Why Iasked innocently            It is a random selection bythe computer came the reply            I do not believe it israndom I opined with conviction            Sir I assure you it iscompletely random said the agent quite sincerely adding for reassuranceWhy half an hour ago the computer tagged a guy who could barely walk            But what does it mean to betagged we asked again            You have to identify yourcarryons the agent ordered            We have none we saidtriumphantly            In that case you do not havea problem            Myassociate was impressed by my prescience and we both felt free and in controlas we walked off with our hands in our pockets carrying only a few dollarsthe boarding card and a drivers license We had a great day I felt muchbetter I was not completely paranoid I fit the profile But a profile ofwhat I could not even begin to imagine            My associate was returning before me Earlynext morning there was a phone message from him I am calling you from thegate Ive been tagged again and this time they wanted to search my checkinluggage I was livid and made a big scene They relented and bypassed thecomputer I am a shaggylooking guy with a foreign accent My associate is anAir Force Reservist who has the bearing of Iceman in Top Gun  Whatprofile does he fit            I returned to my hometownlater using another form of transportation
