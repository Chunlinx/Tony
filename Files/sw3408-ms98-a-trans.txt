        i was gonna say my uh college is Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota and our head football coach Dennis Miller used to be an assistant coach at BYU     oh really   so i thought that was kind of an interesting interesting coincidence   huh  so you went to what college   uh Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota   and what did you graduate in   i just in what major or what year   yeah major   uh international business   oh really   and you   im going to BYU and im going into nursing   okay   so   well that sounds interesting ah how long of a program is that   forever  seems like anyways its about five years       but its probably gonna take me longer because i didnt decide to major in that until  uh about a year and a half after i was already in school so   you know i read a study once and it said that uh like thirty four percent of uh college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program   oh really that sounds   it took me it took me five years you know you just you get started and and you change your mind or you wanna pick up a second major if youre management you you you decide ill ill take that marketing its just what three more classes   yeah yeah   you know and it it just just doesnt happen that you get out in four years   umhum   but   so what is your advice to   my advice is is uh   picking a college   look for at the student to faculty ratio you know if youre gonna go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one i dont think youre gonna have as meaningful of of a college experience as if youre down to the thirty to forty to one   umhum is that what was yours more like   yeah ours was about twenty six to one     really oh thats great   yeah which is you know it its interesting but it its what i thought was nice is you could always there was always time to talk to professor you know and and they knew you   umhum   you werent just in their class you know and so you could you could go talk to them in their office hours at any time and or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you know you could sit down and talk to them about a problem they were always willing to help you out so but our house i i put that against uh my high school where we had uh a biology class of three hundred and fifty students and   wow in high school   yeah it was a biology lecture class   oh   and you know it it   wow   it just wasnt the same youre sitting there and youre taking notes and you know you got a computerized test scores with multiple choice because theres no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test or you know a three hundred and three hundred and fifty person short answer test   umhum   and it just wasnt the same you youd run youd pass the teacher in high school you know and even in high school you could say hi to your teachers and unless youre in that biology class and they just you know theyd look at you like do i know you or should i know you   umhum yeah theres its the classes here are pretty big so its hard to get individual help  its kind of youre on your own   do you get uh a lot of tutoring or   no  very little i mean well like my for example i have im in a chemistry class right now and theres tons of students in it and theres one TA for the whole class   umhum     and he only has certain office hours and so theres only certain times you can talk to him and   and you could get there and his office hours could i mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty two people waiting to talk to him and you still wouldnt get to talk to him anyway     right yeah   well what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college   oh man i think your advice is good um lets see   my advice would be to pick a major before you get into college   thats excellent advice   because i i didnt and i took ton of classes that i didnt need to and um i dont know i just feel like im its its gonna take me a lot longer than and not thats always bad but its i dont know its frustrating i guess   well it it it does get it you know you get to the point where its im never gonna get done   right   you know i i mean i was taking summer classes and finally i said let me get out of here   yep   but uh no thats good advice even if you dont have your major decided on have an idea of what you think you might want you know  so you dont want management but you think you want business   umhum
