                                 Its a Wonderful Conspiracy                         You can just about imaginethe pitch meeting for Barry Levinsons clever new movie Wag the Dog Its a Paula JonesmeetstheGulf War kind of deal Just  days before thepresidential election a major scandal breaks A young girl accuses thepresident of having molested her during a White House tour Robert De Niroplays Conrad Brean a jaded political consultant who is called out ofretirement to rescue the incumbent Brean isnt interested in whether thegirls accusation is true or not Its a story  which he needs tosmother with a bigger storya fake war with Albania For help generating thewar he flies to Los Angeles to recruit bigtime movie producer Stanley Motssbrilliantly played by Dustin Hoffman In an early scene PC Mac the consultant explains to the producer that realevents work just like invented ones Washington and Hollywood are in the samebusiness            This isparody of course not explicit commentary When Brean wants to show off toMotss he flicks on his tiny cell phone and beams a message directly into theearpiece of the White House press secretary who is in midsentence at a pressconference The flack mouths the words PC Mac injected into his head But despite being a satire Wagthe Dog embodies an analysis of Washington that is fairly typical of thebetter class of political movie The view is conspiratorial not in thestrungout scandalized manner of Oliver Stones JFK but in a coolironic way That a secret government runs the show is just a fact oflifepeople who get excited about it are ridiculous Connected to this hipparanoia is an equally jaded belief that politics is merely the art of mediamanipulation Fed a compelling diet of music and images the consultant and theproducer agree a docile and credulous public will go for just aboutanything            Asimilar message comes through in almost every recentWashington movie In Dave  the gimmick is a lookalike who becomespresident after the real president has a stroke atop a bimbo In thisscene PC Mac Kevin Kline preps with the coupplotters to fool his own Cabinet The film takes its biggest wink in the scenewhere Oliver Stone playing himself in a cameo tries to convince a skepticalLarry King that the presidents appearance has changed slightly since hisstroke Do you think youre a little paranoid King asks him In BobRoberts  Tim Robbins plays a rightwing folk singer running for the Senatewith the help of a rogue exCIA agent A frightening demagogue Roberts whipscrowds into a nationalistic frenzy with antis protest songs like DrugsStink  PC Mac He subsequently wins theelection after staging a fake assassination attempt My Fellow Americansis much cruder We never understand why the president Dan Aykroyd is tryingto have two expresidents Jack Lemmon and James Garner killed The two hateeach others guts but wind up as buddies trying to escape theirsuccessor PC Mac            Theres a good excuse for allthis paranoiaits a great plot device The one recent movie that presentssomething resembling an accurate view of Washington An AmericanPresident  is cloying and tedious This scene PC Mac in which an environmental interest group moves tohire an outside lobbyist might have been based on an article from theNational Journal  But the more usual conspiratorial refrain cant bedismissed as a mere narrative technique It expresses the way Hollywoodunderstands Washington            Hollywoodfalls prey to paranoia because its easy If you dont have the patience to tryto understand politics or arent really interested conspiracy allows you toseem sophisticated Its a dumb persons way of seeming smart My colleagueMickey Kaus proposes an additional hypothesis Much that happens in Hollywoodis attributable to conspiracies of a kind The fact that Producer X issleeping with Starlet Y really does explain why she gets a big part in DirectorZs new movie A film gets made or doesnt because of Geffens rivalry withOvitz or Turners with Murdoch In portraying Washington this way those inthe movie business are depicting their political culture not ours            The other component of Hollywoods view ofWashington is that politics is a species of show business Its all a changeof wardrobe Hoffmans character opines in Wag the Dog as he emergesfrom the Oval Office This notion seems to have taken deep root when RonaldReagan was elected president Reagan used his acting skills as governing oneshe was accused of confusing art and life remembering scenes from the movies asif theyd really happened Because Reagans politics were conservativeHollywood couldnt believe he was legitimately popular It had to be a trickThe argument was that hed brainwashed the country with smoke and mirrorsartifice and stagecraft The problem with the view that politics is merely theeffective manipulation of images is that it inflates a minor consideration intothe whole ballgame It makes democracy irrelevant while discounting the singlemost important motivation in politics which is conviction But once again youcan appreciate why Hollywood sees Washington this way Staging is one part ofpolitics the entertainment business understands Theres also a projectionfactor Belief plays a negligible part in what people in the movie industry doso they assume its the same elsewhere            The opinion that conspiracyand show business rule Washington exists in tension with an olderliteralminded Hollywood liberalism The premise of The AmericanPresident is a widowed president dating an environmental lobbyist Theyfall in love and the president is emboldened to do the right thing on crimeand global warming The right thing of course is to replace phony toughnesswith gun control and demand a larger reduction in greenhouse gases InDave  Kline wins the affection of first lady Sigourney Weaver byrestoring funding for a homeless shelter In almost all Washington moviestheres an impassioned speech echoing Jimmy Stewarts climactic filibuster inMr Smith Goes to Washington  In Dave  the president calls apress conference to announce a fullemployment program In Bob Roberts the voice of decency is the worthy old WASP incumbent played by Gore Vidalwho declares that politics is about reality not illusion            This contradiction resultsin disorientation for the viewer The Capraesque idealism is in conflict withthe postStone paranoia Wanting to have it both ways fosters a tone ofincoherence Wag the Dog is the exception among these films in thattheres no voice of democratic decency attempting to shine through Thanksperhaps to David Mamet who wrote the screenplay it doesnt have anysentimental Mr Smith speeches Its funnier than most Washington movies anddarker
