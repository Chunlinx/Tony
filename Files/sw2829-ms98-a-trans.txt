have ive was never really into Star Search   well uh well Star Star Search who wants  really Star Trek well uh well this is this this cannot be compared to the old Star Trek   i mean Star Search Star Trek yeah uhhuh okay is   cant be compared at all it   is it better in your opinion   oh much better   umhum whats better about it   uh well its its its its better put together better better dialogues the the the uh the the stories are a little deeper and and and the the the technology of course that they use is much more believable from a from a scientific aspect also theyre theyre much more sound about what they say and do   umhum umhum is it much more believable sounds like i would i would probably like that better then the the old Star   oh yeah oh its got got a lot more credibility than than the others also they they they they touch you know a a a a lot of issues that are are are quite relevant you know   okay huh   and uh yeah yeah yeah i like it   maybe i ought to try it out sometimes  uh   hey try it out and then then the following nights you can watch Married with Children   right you like that show   well yeah   yeah yeah i like that um i dont watch a whole lot of television but when i do i like just a lot of sitcoms because i look at television myself as       kind of a get away so i dont i dont like to watch a lot of serious movies uh not on television anyway uh when i watch TV i like to kind of getaway kind of laugh and that i like i even like to watch the sitcoms   yeah well that uhhuh yeah well sure its a its a good escape   uhhuh right now im watching uh The Wonder Years   The Wonder Years thats a good show   and yeah yeah and i like that because the you kind of get to think along with the characters you know so thats why   yeah well uh you you you dont sound old enough   no huhuh   to to  to go back that far  uh i am unfortunately uh so  i was there during the sixties and i that thats what i love about the show it   uhhuh okay oh   back a lot of memories and its its it its amazingly accurate   umhum hum i was going to ask if it if its accurate for you uhhuh   oh yeah yeah it it it it really is   yeah because i really cant i guess i cant tell but i i enjoy watching it and i think we learned a lot from it   well   you know and how it was back back then and you know   yes yes well it it it is it it is accurate theres there there is um uh   because of you   the the latter part of the sixties was totally dominated by Vietnam and uh   uhhuh   those issues and i mean you know it was it was everywhere and and that is the one thing that i notice they sort of shy away from a little bit   right hum   i mean  they hit it a little it but they dont you know i mean it was in everything at the time i was in college and and it totally dominated college but   yeah yeah umhum right   uh at at at one point uh before nineteen what was it i guess it was seventy you know uh when they enacted the the what they called the lottery   right   system of the draft in which um you know uh uh everyones everyones birthday was chosen it was chosen at random and and only the first third of those were taken and and and would be inducted into the you know Army the Army was the only one accepting toward the end   umhum right right   and so um you know it it it it really was terrible because uh until until that it least every one was going crazy at least when they inducted uh they they did the lottery only only one third of the people were going crazy because   umhum right right   they were going to go have to go and it was a war that was really quite unpopular but   umhum umhum   it was kind of crazy   yeah unlike this war that we just got out of here   yeah anyway so so but but they they should uh uh you you you you know i think maybe maybe hit that a little heavier on that show what other shows you watch   yeah yeah um i like the Thursday night lineup on NBC the Cosby Show A Different World Cheers i really like Cheers and uh even   yeah yeah yeah Cheers  i i used to like the Cosby Show ive kind of gotten burned out on that though   yeah im kind of getting burned out but i still watch it i guess just for the heck of it because ive been watching it   uh yeah yeah   um i like Evening Shade a lot of the new   yeah ive got a friend that keeps threatening to kill me if i dont watch Evening Shade   yeah thats a really good show thats a really good show   she says that its its a really good show so im going to have to check it out   and uh Designing Designing Women i like that a lot uhhuh   yeah uh so do i   yeah i like a lot of the newer a lot of the newer shows i like um theres   yeah i i i i i was really glad to hear that they were finally taking that dinosaur off what Dallas did its last show   oh yes that was Friday in fact i went to a last episode of Dallas party   yes   at a friends house and we just all got together and watched the last episode although although we didnt although we hadnt watched it in years you know yeah it really was everyone was pre tty disappointed in the ending   oh they   yeah i hear it was the dog of a show   oh well go out with a whimper   so yeah exactly uh   i guess thats the way to go   what else do you watch besides Star Trek   oh do is there anything else on       no no i i uh i watch a lot of ive got cable here so i dont watch a lot of network stuff   yeah uhhuh   i i mean you know the typical three networks i um i do watch a lot of CNN stuff and and uh uh im home most of the time so   right yeah yeah i find myself watching a lot of CNN i like they have a fashion show on CNN that i like to watch   huh yeah i i got really uh i mean i i i watched it a lot before the the the Saudi crisis but after that uh it just seemed like it it became apart of my every day viewing   uhhuh right you feel like you really dont know whats going on unless you tune in at least for you know fifteen minutes or so and   yeah and and thats what i like about it i can tune in any time   uhhuh right and get the all all the days events uhhuh   and get all the yeah i dont have to you know uh view it at at a certain time of day i can i can check it out anytime generally and uh and find out whats going on and i like that i   right right yeah   i remember  i remember when Turner started that thing they said that it would never fly and for the first year or two it really it really   uhhuh   sort of wallowed but uh   yeah and and if you know notice i mean its gone so far in the with just with just with this   well the thing is is that that the world finds out most i mean like you know it was interesting uh like during the Saudi crisis the people here were finding out   uhhuh uhhuh   about more what was happening by watching CNN than they were getting i mean the military folks even   umhum right and the the networks themselves were depending on CNN   so oh exactly   for a lot of things you know they would make they would even mention CNN and have their footage on and everything   exactly yeah yeah so it it it it really has become sort of like the worlds eye   so their going to become right exactly   uh and and i you know it was a it was an idea whose time had come that Turners quite a character   umhum um umhum   Ted Turner   yeah   anyway i really enjoy i really enjoy having access to that all the time   yeah yeah ill turn to it just
