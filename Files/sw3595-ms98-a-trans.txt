        say Arlington Texas now since i got somebody from Arlington Virginia one day yeah      is that right yeah well i never thought about that but there is an Arlington like i i had a card the other day from Birmingham Michigan   oh Birmingham   uh you know and i was thinking yeah and i was thinking the only Birmingham i could think of was Alabama   right its funny how many names have been used uh all over the country   yeah well tell me what kind of books have you read   but uh well to tell you the truth ive been going to college for the last four years so mainly text books   i was gonna say not fun kind right   no um but i i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones but you know sometimes biographies i just read one about Grace Kelly i i love to read about   uhhuh   real people to me half the time its more fascinating than some of these made up stories   yeah it is because you know that its really and truly a the true thing you know i read one about Bob Hope that i liked   yeah it happened it happened really   yeah that was real good im like you if its not a heavy biography you know i enjoy it   right i used to like to read about royalty a lot i read when i was younger i read about every king and queen that lived  i think in Europe that was my thing for a while   im trying to think uh i read a uh a novel  that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all and there was a murder yeah it was sometime ago seems like it was The Spy Went Dancing or something like that uh   oh really oh it sounds like fun   it was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know   wonder if it was by one of those famous writers you know Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those   yes in fact i believe it was because uhhuh i believe it   really sounds like something she would write   yeah i think it was by her that you mention it because uh someone had given it to me and i thought well this will be great and it was   yeah ive heard heard that shes done real you know her books are really interesting and they always sell well   umhum well when you use real people like that i think you know and royalty especially you know   and uh yeah brings it to life i know uh the British some of the British people laugh at us because were so enthralled with their royalty   yeah but you know thats like them being enthralled with our football and so forth you know   i know our movie stars   our movie stars because its totally different concept to us   oh right   but i havent i havent had a chance to read a lot lately either i have read uh mostly novels i went to visit my daughter in Florida and i took a novel with me oh   um   and read it at Thanksgiving time and um it was uh one of those generation novels you know starts out when theyre small and continues through generations and i like that you know   oh yes oh i always like those have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch   yes i have   isnt she fabulous   oh she is wonderful   oh once you start i dont like to get one of her books because i i just live to read ill ill skip everything just to get back to the book       i stayed up one night i think till two in the morning finishing one of hers because i start i could not put it down   oh yeah shes just uh i dont know does she how often does she come out with them i probably have missed the last few since ive been back in school   well no it seems like she doesnt write as often as oh well like Danielle Steele and those silly things she writes the same thing   oh well she can she can turn them out overnight i swear   yeah and and theyre the same silly things i mean if youve read one there i mean its you know its   yeah ive never read a whole one of hers i dont think   it its practically the same thing over and over you know   and think how rich she is   yeah wouldnt i you know im criticizing her and wouldnt i like to have her money   oh yeah   you know because they go from hardback to paperback and she has millions of them umhum   and then make movies out of some of them or   you know miniseries and so forth but i seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often i have not seen as many of hers   right well hers are so involved and theyre and so  such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot you know   umhum i think she does a lot of research too   i do too so she couldnt possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers but oh her books are just incredible i dont think theyve ever made a movie do you   huhuh yeah no i dont think so and ive often wondered why havent you you know i   yes well no uh i really just thought about it now but theres just maybe its because they take so much in i dont know   yeah umhum maybe theyre just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them you know   umhum theyre so big theyre such you know it would be like another Gone with the Wind i guess a three hour movie   umhum   yeah well and maybe that turns people off but look at Gone with the Wind you know   oh i know its about one of my favorite movies   uh have you uh gotten into Scarlett yet   no it had such a bad press i wasnt too intrigued   i yeah thats exactly what i was gonna say i was amazed because i in the beginning when it was on you know  on route coming out i heard mixed publicity you know kind of good and bad   umhum right   and then when it came out all i heard was just uh how bad it was that i didnt even wanna get it   me either do you know anyone thats read it   humum   no i havent heard of anybody thats read it either but it was i think it was on the bestseller list though for a while   no well it wouldnt surprise me
