                                 What Tocqueville Missed            Nostalgia is rampant amongpublic commentators today as they look for some critical juncture when USdemocracy was flourishing more than it seems to be now hoping to drawinspiration and lessons for what might be done to revive our apparently ailingcivic life            Those who still admit tobeing liberals usually locate the golden era of US democracy in the s ands when it is thought Franklin Delano Roosevelt provided boldprogressive leadership Those of conservative or centerright proclivitiescharacteristically look at Americas past through the eyes of Alexis deTocqueville the French aristocrat who toured the fledgling United States inthe s gathering observations and ideas that were in due course publishedin Democracy in America  Tocquevilles opus has become one of the modernworlds most influential political ethnographiesthat is a set of denselydescriptive observations of another nation written to influence politicaldebates back in ones own country            That messagetohome aspectof Tocquevilles work is important in understanding its limitations Alarmed bythe simultaneous expansion of democracy and an evermorecentralizedbureaucratic administrative state in postrevolutionary France he used hisexplorations of early Republican America to make the case to his own countrymenthat they should encourage voluntary associations in civic society as a newbuffer against state centralization            Americans of all ages allstations in life and all types of dispositions are forever formingassociations Tocqueville reported in a famous oftquoted passage This happysituation was possible he felt because extralocal government seemed barelypresent Nothing strikes a European traveler in the United States more wroteTocqueville than the absence of what we would call government oradministration  There is nothing centralized or hierarchic in theconstitution of American administrative power            GivenTocquevilles antistatist purposes it is not surprising that contemporarycritics of the US federal government celebrate the great Frenchmans stresson voluntary associations understood as functioning in opposition tobureaucratic state power Still before Americans plunge forward on a foolserrand we might want to notice that the best historical social sciencechallenges the claims of conservatives and centrists about when how and whydemocratic civic engagement has flourished in the United States            Before the American Revolution many towns of the requisitesize for commercialization and urbanization had already emerged but without avibrant set of voluntary associations By the early s however theemergence of associations in both smaller and larger communities wasoutstripping commercial and demographic change Social historian Richard DBrown emphasizes that the Revolution political struggles over the Constitutionand the Bill of Rights and deepening popular participation in national stateand local elections served to spur associational life So did religious andcultural ideals about selfimprovement and growing awareness of extralocalcommercial and public affairs through widespread newspaper reading            Tocqueville himself was well aware of many of these extralocal influencesPresentday conservatives often overlook how much he stressed politicalparticipation marveling at the United States as the one country in the worldwhich day in day out makes use of an unlimited freedom of politicalassociation which in turn encouraged a more general taste forassociation            In retrospect it is obvious that what socialhistorian Mary P Ryan has dubbed the preCivil War era of association fromthe s to the s coincided with the spread of adult male suffrage andthe emergence of competitive massmobilizing parties first the JacksonianDemocrats then the Whigs and finally the Free Soilers and theRepublicans                           Democracy in America took note of early US newspapers tooNewspapers make associations and associations make newspapers Tocquevillewrote Thus of all countries on earth it is in America that one finds boththe most associations and the most newspapers Yet blinded by his negativepassions about state power in France Tocqueville failed to grasp what hisobservations meant about the early American state            As historian Richard John cleverly points out inSpreading the News The American Postal System From Franklin to Morse Tocqueville traveled by stage coach in the hinterland of Kentucky andTennessee remarking on the astonishing circulation of letters and newspapersamong these savage woods Yet the Frenchmans travels might not have beenpossible if many stagecoach companies had not been subsidizedthroughCongressso that mail could be carried and representatives travel home toremote districts            Awellknown quip has it that early modern Prussia wasnt so much a state with anarmy as an army with a state Similarly the early United States may have beennot so much a country with a post office as a post office that gave popularreality to a fledgling nation John points out that by  only  yearsafter Congress passed the Post Office Act of  the American postal systemhad almost twice as many offices as the postal system in Great Britain and overfive times as many offices as the postal system in France In the s ands the system accounted for more than threequarters of US federalemployees            Obviously the institutional structure of theU S government had everything to do with the spread of the postal networkThe legislative system gave senators and above all members of the House ofRepresentatives a strong interest in subsidizing communication andtransportation links into even the remotest areas of the growing nationSpecial postal rates made mailing newspapers cheap and allowed small newspapersto pick up copy from bigger ones            Thepostal system was even more important for civil society and democratic politicsthan for commerce Congress could use it to communicate freely with citizensCitizens even in the remotest hamlets could readily communicate with oneanother monitoring the doings of Congress and state and local governmentsVoluntary associations soon learned to put out their message in newspaperformats to take advantage of the mail Emergent political parties inJacksonian America were intertwined with the federal postal system Partyentrepreneurs were often newspaper editors and postmasters and postmastershipsquickly became a staple of party patronage            In short the early American civic vitality that soentranced Alexis de Tocqueville was closely tied up with the representativeinstitutions and centrally directed activity of a very distinctive nationalstate The nonzerosum nature of US governmental and associational expansionbecomes even more apparent when we consider that most of the big voluntaryassociations founded in the  th century prospered well into the th  often building toward membership peaks reached only in thes or s and in full symbiosis with public social provision            The Grand Army of theRepublic spread in the wake of state and national benefits for Union veteransof the Civil War for example The Fraternal Order of Eagles was so active inpromoting state and federal oldage pensions that the Grand Eagle himselfreceived an official pen when FDR signed the Social Security Act of  Thegreat womens federations of the early  th century were championsof local state and federal regulations services and benefits for mothersand children New Deal laws and administrative interventions were vital aidsfor nascent industrial unions And the American Legion sponsored the GI Bill of                           Lessons forToday                        Maybe the problem today is that many Americansquite rightly no longer feel they can effectively band together to get thingsdone either through or in relationship to government The problem may not bea big bureaucratic federal governmentafter all the US national governmentstill has proportionately less revenueraising capacity and administrative heftthan virtually any other advanced national state The issue may be recentshifts in society and styles of politics that make it less inviting and farharder for Americans to participate efficaciously in civic life except locallyor on very narrow issues            Data doshow an explosion of Washington DCbased advocacy groups between themids and the early s But apart from a few on the rightnotably theNational Right to Life Committee the Christian Coalition and the NationalRifle Associationthe few new big voluntary associations that have beenfounded have been structured like thousands of smaller ones They arestaffled mailinglist associations            Obviously societal conditions so propitious forencompassing voluntary federations have changed a lot Highereducatedwomenonce leaders of many such associationsnow have nationally orientedcareers and crowd into cosmopolitan centers Indeed by the s the UnitedStates developed a very large professionalmanagerial elite that was arguablymore oriented to giving money to staffled national advocacy organizations thanto climbing the localstatenational leadership ladders of traditionalvoluntary associations            Voters these days are rarelycontacted directly by party or group workers Politicians may not care muchabout them at all if they arent relatively welloff or members of targetedswing groups of voters This has happened in electoral politics at the sametime that all our mailboxes are full of computergenerated mailings fromsingleissue advocacy groups seeking to raise money from papermemberships            Were Alexis de Tocqueville toreturn to the late  th century United States for another visit hewould be just as worried about these national trends as about possible declinesin purely local or smallgroup associationalism After all one of Democracyin America s insights was that vital democratic participation served as akind of school where Americans learned how to build social and civicassociations of all sorts He would also surely be surprised that todaysconservatives are using his Democracy in America to justify adepoliticized and romantic localism as an improbable remedy for the larger illsof national politics
