                    Background        The three goals of most microarray experiments are        description classification or characterization For        example microarrays have been used to describe        comprehensively the diauxic shift progression through the        cell cycle sporulation and the effects of treatment with a        small molecule      They have been used to        classify the cancer type of a given sample or classify        groups of coregulated genes      Finally        microarrays have been used to characterize biological        systems using comparisons of wildtype and mutant cells        with the goal of obtaining mechanistic insights                   Searching for concerted dramatic changes in gene        expression or searching for differential expression of a        given gene has been a successful method in analyzing        transcriptionprofiling data especially in description or        characterization    Often investigators take a        manual approach to accomplishing these tasks However        manual approaches to data analysis are sometimes        impractical or cumbersome inspiring the development of        tools to accomplish the three goals described above A        variety of techniques such as hierarchical clustering         k means clustering and        selforganizing maps have been implemented with success        especially in classification          As the number of publicly available profiles in         Saccharomyces cerevisiae alone now        exceeds  a great need exists to exploit this        information properly to understand cell function At least        three independent international projects have been set up        to serve as databasedriven repositories of genomewide        expression data   A major effort is being made to        systematize data storage especially involving XML        extensible markup language to ensure interoperability of        these databases and associated analysis tools        A related need that has been less addressed is the        systematization of expression data analysis This        requirement extends not only to analysis but also to        pedagogy and to practical aspects of algorithm        implementation Various studies in the literature have        successfully implemented tools from vector algebra in        analyzing genomewide expression data            However a framework for the analysis of transcription        profiles using vector algebra has not yet been codified        Here we present such a framework Common statistical        measures have natural counterparts in vector algebra that        have visual interpretations and are easily implemented on a        computer Within this framework the analysis of        genomewide expression data is converted to the study of        highdimensional vector spaces The many powerful theorems        that have been developed in vector algebra can be applied        to these spaces and these theorems offer biologically        relevant insights Elements of the vector space can also be        analyzed statistically This construction has analytic and        pedagogic appeal                    Results and discussion                  Constructing expression vectors          Transcriptionprofiling experiments offer different          kinds of measurements depending on the technology used          One type of technology using noncompetitive          hybridization measures absolute gene expression while a          second type using competitive hybridization measures          relative gene expression A microarray that uses          competitive hybridization yields a list of fold changes          for each gene between the conditions or cell types          measured The data from a microarray that uses          noncompetitive hybridization can be divided after          proper normalization into another microarray of the same          type to produce the fold change of each gene from one          condition to another In practice even those          investigators who use noncompetitive technology platforms          generally interpret and publish the fold changes between          conditions or strains rather than absolute          geneexpression levels Therefore this study will focus          on analysis of foldchange values hereafter called a          transcription or expression profile          There are three common types of values that can be          associated with the fold change of a gene The first a          signed fold change such as a  or  fold change          corresponding to induction or repression respectively          has the most intuitive appeal but has a discontinuity          spanning from  to  that can be problematic The          second type an unsigned fold change such as  or           fold change again corresponding to induction or          repression respectively has no such discontinuity but          is bounded on the left by zero and is unbounded on the          right This asymmetry about unity hinders analysis The          third type a logarithm base  base  or natural of          the unsigned fold change is undoubtedly the most          tractable No fold change in expression is represented by          zero induction is positive and repression is negative          Most importantly there are no discontinuities or          asymmetries          Once a set of transcription profiles is obtained          where each profile represents a set of fold changes for          a set of genes a data matrix can be generated with          genes as rows and experiments as columns Figure a          With this picture in mind generating vectors from the          data matrix the logarithms of the unsigned fold changes          is a natural operation for which there is an obvious          construction                    Definition For           p transcription profiles measuring          the expression of           n genes let           s           ij  represent the logarithm of the          expression of the           i th gene in the           j th experiment The vector          s                     i  s                     i  s                       ip             T          is defined as a gene vector Similarly                    is defined as an experiment vector By construction          a gene vector is           p dimensional and an experiment          vector is           n dimensional An expression          vector represents either a gene vector or an experiment          vector The superscript Tdesignates transposition          It can easily be seen that with respect to the data          matrix a gene vector consists of the elements of a row          and an experiment vector consists of the elements of a          column Figure a By convention vectors are treated as          columns and not as rows Experiment vectors are already          columns so gene vectors are transposed from rows to also          become columns          In the most common scheme of comparing two profiles a          cloud of genes is plotted on a scatterplot This view          is simply the display of           n twodimensional gene vectors          Figure b It is well suited to detecting particular          genes whose expression varies between experiments As          more experiments are added to the matrix the dimension          of the space grows but the number of points remains          fixed Considering a large number of experiments genes          that have similar biological regulation remain in nearby          regions of highdimensional spaces Integrated with          promotersequence analysis and consideration of chromatin          structure the study of gene vectors is useful in studies          of transcription regulation          There is another complementary way of thinking about          expression profiles or more generally about          multivariate statistical data   Although analysis of          gene vectors is a powerful tool it is less efficient at          demonstrating relationships between profiles This is          because overlaying clouds of thousands of gene vectors          may not offer an insightful picture because of the many          data points in view In the alternative method of          analysis an expression profile is regarded as just one          point in a highdimensional space Because this point          captures the same information contained in the          scatterplot of gene vectors the point must reside in a          much higherdimensional space In this space the          relationships between profiles become more apparent          Instead of plotting genes one now plots experiments          Figure c As new profiles are added to the data          matrix the dimension of the space remains fixed but the          number of points increases the reverse case of gene          vectors Although the highdimensional space of          experiment vectors cannot be visualized the          relationships of vectors in the space can often be          understood using intuition from the two or          threedimensional case The power of vector algebra comes          from its ability to scale  the concepts equations and          theorems move seamlessly usually identically to higher          dimensions          Assuming that there are           n genes represented on the          microarray it is theoretically possible that each          profile would yield an           n dimensional experiment vector          However because of poor detection of scarce transcripts          flaws on the microarray or experimental error an          expression profile in practice gives fewer than           n values This leaves three basic          options for how to carry out the analysis The first is          that a lack of data can be declared as no change in          expression and a zero inserted into the position of that          gene This approach is generally too simplistic for use          in further analysis          The second option is to estimate the missing value on          the basis of other profiles and insert it into the          vector For example we can look for the gene most          similar to the missing gene as judged by all other          experiments and then replace the missing value with the          value of the similar gene for that experiment For          robustness we can also find the most similar           k genes and use the average of          those genes for that experiment as the replacement A          comparative study has found that this           k nearest neighbors method          performs better than filling missing values with zeros or          the averages of that gene in other experiments            There are more complicated imputation methods in the          statistics literature but their usefulness given the          complex calculations involved is not yet clear          Finally the vector space can be resized to a smaller          dimension than           n  where the expression profiles          of interest have data for all genes in that space As the          missing data are not estimated this is the most          conservative method of analysis although at the price of          discarding some data                          Vector angle is the counterpart to the Pearson          correlation coefficient          One of the most fundamental measures in statistics is          the Pearson correlation coefficient referred to as           r  This represents a widely used          measure of similarity between           n tuples With expression vectors          the geometric picture of similarity is that the vectors          are pointing in the same direction of expression space          This picture is equivalent to two vectors with a small          angle between them When expression vectors are          uncorrelated they are orthogonal This leads to the          following remark                    Remark  Correlation of expression          vectors corresponds to the angle  between those vectors          Low angle            r near  implies correlation          Angle near             r near zero implies uncorrelation          and angle near             r near  implies          anticorrelation          This remark is motivated by consideration of the          relationship between the Pearson correlation coefficient                     r  and vector angle  We use          the notation where   represents an inner          product also called a dot product and where cov is          the covariance between ordered           n tuples For two vectors           x and           y  the formulas for           r and  are                    It is evident that           r and the argument of the inverse          cosine function are identical except that covariance and          inner product are interchanged In practice the argument          to the inverse cosine and           r are nearly identical because the          covariance is essentially a mean adjusted inner product          and the means of expression vectors are near zero In          fact covariance and inner product are identical for          vectors with zero mean Thus there is no advantage of          either measure because of nearly identical performance on          actual expression data Figure a          For gene vectors angles are a measure of how similar          two genes are expressed across experiments For          experiment vectors angles are a measure of how similar          two experiments are across genes For experiment vectors          a quantitative sense of the distribution of  can be          obtained by examining a collection of diverse          transcription profiles A set of  transcription          profiles in           S cerevisiae from a wide variety          of gene deletions and treatments was obtained and made          publicly available   We converted these profiles          into experiment vectors and computed all possible angles          between the vectors a total of  angles Computer          source written in Matlab is publicly available at our          website   These angles gave a distribution with a          mean of  close to orthogonal as expected and a          standard deviation of  Figure b In practice we          have found  and  as useful cutoff values for          significance of correlation or anticorrelation          respectively          The vector algebra approach is illustrated using a          publicly available data set The small molecule rapamycin          has been transcriptionally profiled by three research          groups in four separate studies      It has          a very dramatic expression profile in which hundreds of          genes are rapidly within minutes up or downregulated          The protein targets of rapamycin the Tor proteins are          known to sense nutrients When treated as an experiment          vector other experiment vectors were searched for that          had a low angle with the rapamycin vector Against the          same set of  diverse expression profiles described          earlier   not a single vector could be found that          had an angle less than  with the rapamycin experiment          vector data not shown However another study identified          two vectors with smaller angles to the rapamycin          expression vector angles of  and    These          similar vectors were those corresponding to the removal          of highquality carbon or nitrogen from the media Thus          it can be inferred that the Tor proteins regulate the          responses to carbon and nitrogenquality of the medium          This is an example of using angles to identify the          functions of uncharacterized proteins          It is apparent that angles provide a quantitative          measure for asserting genomewide similarities This          measure is important when making claims about the target          of a small molecule effects of gene deletion or          specificity of a drug Orthogonal angles implying          uncorrelation when similarity is expected or claimed          raise questions about the validity of the hypothesis          under examination                          A ratio of magnitudes is a natural second metric          for comparing two expression vectors          An advantage of vector algebra is the extension from          angles into ratios of magnitudes for which other          formulations have awkward or no counterparts The two          fourdimensional vectors           x      Tand           y      Thave    implying           r   However there is an          important difference between the vectors not identified          by these measures as we can observe that           y             x  This information is captured by          computing the ratio of vector magnitudes                    Remark  Besides angle the ratio          of vector magnitudes  is a second measure of          similarity of two expression vectors For two vectors           x and           y  this is calculated as                    With the two fourdimensional vectors listed above           is easily seen to be  By interchanging    and          cov   as was done with           r and  it is tempting to think          that the quantity             cov           y            y cov           x            x  might behave similarly to             With the same vectors as above                                   When considering the two          vectors           x      Tand           y      T it can be calculated          that              the value expected as           y is a smaller vector However                Indeed the mean          subtraction component of the covariance fundamentally          alters the behavior of  compared to  making it an          unsuitable measure of expression vector magnitude An          elegant feature of regarding microarray data as          expression vectors is that both angles and magnitudes are          natural measurements with important biological meaning          as will be discussed in later sections                          Searching subspaces is an important step in          analyzing expression vectors          Another advantage to treating expression data as          vectors in a space rather than as           n tuples is the associated notion          of subspaces With experiment vectors this concept is          particularly valuable Experiment vector space can be          divided into subspaces most naturally where the          subspaces correspond to coregulated or functionally          related genes This can most easily be done using          annotated lists where genes are classified by function          The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences          MIPS provides a commonly used functional grouping for          genes            Considering subspaces is nearly always an essential          part of analysis From the vantage point of certain          subspaces many different experiment vectors may          collapse into identical vectors This enables the          decomposition of vectors into sums of common and distinct          components For example yeast stress responses such as          DNA damage or heat shock are composed of a general          response that stresses share and a specific response for          the particular stress faced Identification of these          subspaces remains a goal in biology Another example is          that of the Tor proteins which have many effectors one          of which is called Urep Comparing the expression          vectors of rapamycin treatment with a           URE deletion reveals that the          genomewide angle between these two vectors is  and          thus the vectors show only weak correlation However          calculating the angle of these same vectors within the          subspace of genes controlled by Urep gives an angle of             With respect to this subspace of genes          treatment with rapamycin and deletion of           URE are nearly identical          Experiments reveal that treatment with rapamycin leads to          dephosphorylation of Urep corroborating this low angle             Thus it is important to consider not only          wholegenome angles but also those for important          subspaces                          The effects of mutations on vector angles and          magnitudes          When studying a particular process by transcription          profiling it is common also to transcriptionally profile          the same process after deleting one or more genes known          to be involved For example this has been carried out          with MAP kinase deletion mutants after pheromone          treatment   deletions of effectors of the Tor          proteins after rapamycin treatment   and           lexA deletions after UV irradiation                     When an effector of some process is deleted the          resulting vector is often not uncorrelated in the          subspace involving that effector but is reduced in          magnitude For example when there are two transcription          factors with overlapping specificity for some genes          deletion of one can be compensated by the presence of the          second with a similar though weaker induction of the          same genes If an effector truly is an exclusive          controller of some set of genes when it is deleted the          resulting experiment vector in that subspace would be          expected to be orthogonal uncorrelated with the          original vector However biological networks generally          exhibit redundancy in their control of genes  a          reduction in the vector magnitude is to be more commonly          expected than rotation toward perpendicularity          uncorrelation Thus it is important to rely on the          coordinate use of angles and magnitudes in          expressionprofiling analysis something that is not          always performed in the literature                          Combined use of angles and ratios of vector          magnitudes is a tool for biological discovery          When one is characterizing a transcription profile of          an uncharacterized gene deletion or treatment with a          small molecule the first operation that should          ordinarily be completed is a comparison of that profile          as an experiment vector with all other available          experiment vectors from the same organism By performing          such a comparison the gene can be partially          characterized or the target of a small molecule can be          identified   By coloring the results of a          comparison mimicking the falsecoloring schemes usually          found on microarrays one can quickly scan a large set of          profiles for those correlated uncorrelated or          anticorrelated with a reference profile that is being          tested   This color scheme is red to represent          correlation yellow to represent uncorrelation and green          to represent anticorrelation Figure  This overall          depiction is called a colorimetric comparison array          CCA It can also be carried out with ratios of vector          magnitudes where red represents greater magnitude yellow          unchanged magnitude and green reduced magnitude          To understand the most general relationships it is          useful in the first row of a CCA to compare          wholeexperiment vectors This gives an important          genomewide characterization of the profiles being          studied  assertions of global behavior should be          substantiated in these values As previously discussed          the angles and magnitudes within subspaces are important          to analyze  in subsequent rows therefore the same          experiment vectors are compared in various subspaces of          the genome By examining a range of subspaces this          analysis can be used to partition a transcription profile          and define which effectors are responsible for particular          patterns of expression By looking at wholegenome angles          as well as angles within subspaces of interest the CCA          reveals a wealth of information about the expression          vectors being studied Figure  A CCA can also be used          to identify the structure of signaling networks                          Singular value decomposition in expressionprofile          analysis          We next explore ideas relating to dimensionality          reduction of expression vectors Dimensionality reduction          is a common problem in many disciplines of science and          engineering Questions include what are the essential          pieces of information within a transcription profile and          what is noise If the full set of genes around  in           S cerevisiae  carries redundant          information how small a subset can we choose Are most          transcription profiles merely combinations of a smaller          number of transcription profiles The first tool we          discuss is singular value decomposition SVD          SVD is a matrix factorization that reveals many          important properties of a matrix It is a standard tool          in many areas of the physical sciences and many          algorithms in matrix algebra make use of SVD Given an           n            p rectangular data matrix           A                     n            p  of expression profiles          again where           n is the number of genes           p is the number of experiments we          can obtain the following factorization                    where           U and           V are orthonormal and           D is diagonal Mathematical details          of the SVD can be found in Materials and methods The          intuition behind the SVD is straightforward Let           u                       i            be the           i th column of           U  Note that this column vector is           n dimensional The best vector in          a sense that can be made mathematically precise see          Materials and methods that captures spans the          experiment vectors of           A is           u             Similarly the best two column          vectors that span the experiment vectors of           A are           u            and           u             In the limit all           n vectors           u                       i            exactly span all the experiment vectors of           A  In the same way the columns of           V  in descending order are           p dimensional vectors that best          span the gene vectors of           A  These ideas are best illustrated          with an example                    The first column of           U            u            best spans that is when multiplied          by a constant the columns of           A  Together with the second column           A is exactly captured by taking          linear combinations of           u            and           u             In this case           u            and           u            are not needed to capture           A  Similarly the first column of           V            v            best spans the gene vectors rows          of           A  The first value along the          diagonal of           D measures how much contribution           u            and           v            make to capturing           A  and the next value measures how          much contribution           u            and           v            make In this case the large size          of the first singular value indicates that           u            and           v            capture most of the information in           A  These values along the diagonal          of           D are called the singular values of           A  Matrices that contain mostly          redundant columns lowrank matrices have singular          values that rapidly decay because the matrix is          efficiently spanned by a small number of vectors          However matrices containing very independent columns          highrank matrices have singular values that slowly          decay In the limit the identity matrix which has the          highest possible rank of           n  has singular values that do not          decay at all  they all are one          For microarray data SVD can be used to bring out          dominant underlying behaviors For example examining the          cellcycle data   using SVD revealed that among the          first           U vectors            u                      u             the first corresponds to a          steadystate and the subsequent ones correspond to the          oscillatory behavior that one would expect from such data             SVD can also be used to denoise profiles by          recomputing the data matrix using only significant           u                       i            vectors significance determined by reading the           i th singular value along the          diagonal matrix           D  The SVD can also be used to          estimate missing values          A technique called principal components analysis PCA            is closely related to the SVD In PCA the          factorization is applied to the covariance matrix of the          data rather than the original data matrix If the data          are meanadjusted both SVD and PCA give the same          information If the data are from a time series then the          principal components may correspond to derivatives of the          data                            Towards a basis of expression vectors          One of the most powerful ideas in linear algebra is          the notion of basis vectors Besides constructing the          space basis vectors can be chosen to highlight important          features of the data or simply to store the data          efficiently For example the function sin           x can be expressed either in a          polynomial or exponential basis                    The first basis is clearly awkward  it is          infinitedimensional and offers little insight However          the second basis captures the sine wave more compactly          and provides more insight Many of the successes of          vector algebra in image compression smoothing and signal          detection come from the identification of appropriate          basis functions          This concept has important implications in the          analysis of transcriptionprofiling data Considering the          data as expression vectors what is the right basis to          express the data in The data is originally in the basis          of genes But is that the best basis We have already          examined one change of basis  the SVD In this case the                    u                       i            and           v                       i            vectors are basis vectors for the spaces of          experiment vectors and gene vectors respectively While          very efficient basis vectors the vectors themselves are          completely artificial and do not correspond to actual          profiles          An important question in biology is how many different          fundamental cellular states or transitions exist It may          be that there are a relatively small number and that          cellular states or transitions are essentially          superpositions of a finite number of basic states or          transitions This question is easily posed in expression          space because if the hypothesis holds the complete set          of expression profiles can be examined for the smallest          number of basis vectors that can construct the nearly          identical entire set If a profile is added to the data          matrix and cannot adequately be constructed by other          existing profiles then it becomes a basis vector The          collection of basis vectors formed by this procedure can          be thought of as containing the building blocks of          cellular state or transition space Thus it would be          interesting to try to find basis vectors for all          experiment vectors using actual experiment vectors and          not artificial bases that offer little insight          First how can one estimate how many basis vectors are          required This problem corresponds to estimating the rank          of the data matrix This problem of finding an          approximate rank of a matrix           k  is a common one SVD as          described above is often employed Using SVD one          typically looks for a sharp drop in the singular values          to estimate the rank Let us suppose that the singular          values fall below a defined threshold at some value This          value serves as a logical choice for           k  In fact the first           k vectors           u                       i            of           A serve as the best possible basis to          span           A  In our case however we desire          the basis vectors to be a subset of the original vectors          of           A  This is a more difficult          problem          We investigated these concepts using two large data          sets of transcription profiles generated in           S cerevisiae  the set of           expression profiles previously analyzed and a second set          of over  expression profiles of various yeast          environmental responses    We converted these          sets to data matrices of experiment vectors and computed          the singular values of each matrix For each matrix the          singular values decayed rapidly Figure  This decay          shows that the columns of the matrix are far from          orthogonal and a basis containing a small number of           u                       i            vectors can efficiently capture the original matrix          Interestingly the singular value decay of the          environmental responses was much faster than the more          diverse  profile set compare Figure bwith a This          is due to the limited number of responses that yeast          cells possess when facing stress This further suggests          that there are a small number of buildingblock          transitions that yeast can undergo and that other          behaviors are at least partially superpositions of          these transitions          But how can one find these buildingblock fundamental          expression vectors in the profile set Instead of using          the           u                       i            vectors from SVD which are linear combinations of          the experiment vectors it would be useful to identify          which actual experiment vectors are most useful to form a          basis for the matrix That is it would be useful to          express profiles in terms of other profiles basis          vectors rather than simply as lists of genes Figure           There are a number of possible algorithms for          identifying these basis experiment vectors We tested a          variety of algorithms especially those utilizing          projections of the           u                       i            vectors on           A  to identify optimal candidate          basis vectors The source code for one such algorithm is          publicly available online at   While small subsets          of experiment vectors could span the entire set of          experiment vectors it was found that there were many          such subsets of experimental vectors that had a          comparable spanning ability toward           A data not shown This suggests          that the cell probably does have a small number of          fundamental transitions although many different groups          of transitions as represented by experiment vectors          appear nearly equivalently able to span the          transcriptional range of cellular behavior          Given this behavior perhaps the ideal basis vectors          for transition space would be the basis of experiment          vectors in which only one signaling pathway is          selectively modulated This could be accomplished with          small molecules like rapamycin that selectively modulate          one signaling pathway with complete specificity If one          had a collection of small molecules that could          selectively modulate every signaling pathway in the cell          then it might be possible to simply project an experiment          vector on these small molecules experiment vectors and          determine which pathways are activated and to what          degree This would immediately characterize the          expression profile in a very powerful basis that provides          a great deal of biological insight                            Conclusions        We have described various techniques motivated by vector        algebra for analyzing genomewide expression data Some of        these techniques have been used previously but we find        that by regarding expression profiles as vectors either in        the sense of genes or experiments we gain a richer        understanding of the existing techniques and can take these        insights into new directions        The angle between two vectors is essentially equivalent        to the Pearson correlation coefficient and studying the        changes in magnitudes as well as the angles provides        important biological information In particular we find        that decomposing the experiment vector space into a set of        smaller subspaces using functional categories for        instance results in a concise but useful description of        the biological system Figure  These types of        genomewide descriptions are essential for understanding        large amounts of complex expression data Thinking in terms        of vector spaces naturally introduced the idea of optimal        basis vectors but with the constraint that these basis        vectors belong to the original set of expression vectors        This may be a useful way of characterizing expression        profiles We have described the usefulness of the singular        value decomposition as a tool for reducing the dimension of        the problem and the insight it brings to the problem of        finding basis vectors        A complete analysis of genomewide expression data        involves numerous issues not discussed here The importance        of preprocessing and normalization to correct for various        artifacts has been noted recently    Artificially        large fold changes caused by small values in ratios        redgreen or vice versa should be numerically bounded in        competitive hybridization experiments Assigning a level of        significance to observed changes in expression levels is        also an important issue and has been addressed by a number        of different approaches most often with a derivation of a        statistical model for noise to obtain estimates for the        fold changes    For oligonucleotide arrays there        are similar and sometimes more complicated issues for the        same steps Finally there are a variety of clustering and        datamining techniques for understanding the structure of        the data in other ways Appropriate methods should be        chosen carefully depending on the type of data and the        questions to be answered As the quantity of expression        data increases rapidly more tools such as the ones        developed here will play an important role in understanding        biological states and transitions                    Materials and methods                  Software          Computer software was written in the Matlab          programming language and is publicly available for          download from our website                            Singular value decomposition SVD          SVD is the matrix factorization                    where           D is diagonal and           U and           V are orthonormal            UU T           U T           U            I                     n            n  and           VV T           V T           V            I                     p            p   The diagonal entries of           D are the singular values                                                    p            and the columns            u                       i                                 i             n  of           U and            v                       i                                 i             p  of           V are called left and right singular          vectors respectively For microarray data we assume          that           n            p as we usually think of the data          matrix as having           n rows for genes and           p rows for experiments and we          assume that the columns are linearly independent          The geometric visualization of the SVD is the          following When           A                     n            p  is applied to a           p dimensional sphere the result          is an           n dimensional ellipse in which the          principal axes have been stretched by factors                                     p            in directions           u                       i                      u                       p            respectively The right singular vectors           v                       i            are the axes of the sphere that get mapped to           u                       i            through           Av                       i                                    i                      u                       i             The usefulness of the SVD is often based on the          fact that it answers the following important question          what is the best approximation to           A using a matrix of lower rank The          term best can be defined mathematically This is          important because a comparable matrix with a smaller rank          may make the underlying structure of the matrix more          apparent Another way of writing           A  UDV Tis                    Then it can be shown mathematically that the best          approximation of dimension           k is obtained by the partial sum of          the first           k terms   Sometimes the terms                                 i                      u                       i                      v                       i            Tare called the characteristic modes This          representation is similar to that of a signal by a sum of          its Fourier modes The SVD can be used to denoise the          data by recomputing the sum with the small singular          values set to zero                          Measuring basis quality          Let           A be an           n            p matrix where the columns of           A represent a collection of           p transcription profiles over           n genes           k expression vectors are chosen          from           A as a basis for the complete set          Let           B be the matrix whose columns consist          of the           k expression vectors            B is therefore           n            k  The ability of           B to form a basis for the remaining           p  k vectors of           A designated           x                       i             is tested by application of the projection          theorem Let           P be the projection matrix for           B  that is           P            B            B T           B             B T A measure of the spanning          ability of the basis           B toward the           x           i is                    Until  is below a determined threshold for the          original matrix           A  a different collection of           k expression vectors can be tested          or           k can be increased to include more          basis vectors          In the expression for  the numerator is the          residual vector the part of the           x                       i            that could not be captured by           B  The normalized magnitude of the          residual vector measures how well the           x                       i            can be constructed from the           k columns of           B
