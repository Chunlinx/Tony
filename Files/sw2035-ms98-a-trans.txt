weve gone other you know all kinds of places we go out to dinner we take the kids to the park and um   yeah   you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo or we you know we we do everything we can possibly as a family   do you work outside the home   no i dont   yeah i dont either it makes a little bit easier i think that way   yeah it does and and then uh you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know hell hell take them out just to be with them so he they can have time with him and   yeah so you have a break too   right so and we uh       we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like Monday nights we call it family home evening and   uhhuh   have our kids um you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and you know teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them and we just do all kinds of fun things like that and   uh we have family thats far away it sounds like you might too   yeah we do so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures so   yeah right   and um   and phone calls thats about about it   yeah right and uh you know they we you know we go to the park or we go in the backyard and sit down and   thats what yeah thats what we mostly do pretty simple things especially since my youngest one is  excuse me only fourteen months she shes really getting to the age where shes playing and likes to go places   yeah right uhhuh yeah and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you dont have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things so you you make more fun than you know you know the kids just think its wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or   that thats right oh thats a big thrill for them   yeah or um you know go get a bag of M and Ms or something like that they they think thats a lot of fun so we just we try to spend as much time as we can we you know our whole our whole weekends are divided are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something but   yeah   during the day you know its all devoted to our kids and they come go to church with us and   yeah thats true   so yeah so   have um have you ever been to the Science no its called the Science Place   yes yes thats what   we just we havent lived here too long we went there couple weeks ago   uhhuh the kids thought that was wonderful   and uh   oh yeah we i guess theres Science Place One and Science Place Two weve only been in i think its Science Place Two   i is im not sure which one we went into it was about a year or so ago when we went   the one we went in had um the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a like a kids place area that really seemed i mean they really seemed to go wild in there   uhhuh yeah yeah yeah they had a lot of fun in there and um theres uh theres some petting you know like uh uh i think its Owens Country Farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to and the kids can pet animals and stuff   wheres that   thats on Plano Road um  its like in Richardson you go up Plano Road its like a little bit past Campbell on Plano Road   uhhuh uhhuh   and thats a lot of fun they have tours going through there and   oh yeah   um the kids think that was a lot of fun too and   oh that does sound like fun its a little bit of a ways   we take you know whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think its wonderful just to go to McDonalds you know they dont go for the food they go for the to play around and   oh   thats right   theres another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business   uhhuh   and its a indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for kids   that sounds fun too   and parents get in free and its like during the week its like five dollars admission for child all day   and and you said about about Plano and Campbell is the petting   the petting farm yeah     that sounds fun i think maybe well try to do that   yeah yeah and the one in Mesquite is um Scyene exit   uhhuh   and it its uh the kids just had a wonderful time there they you know you just pay that admission and then all the the the rides are free you know they of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to and stuff like that but they thought that was a lot of fun you can have birthday parties there and   yeah   i think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza because theres more for them to do   because they can just do you dont have to have tokens for everything yeah   yeah right so they had a lot of fun   that does sound like fun well ive gotten some good ideas from you   yeah i we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible so   definitely   yeah   well i think i dont know if weve done five minutes but
