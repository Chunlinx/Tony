                    Background        Recent US national surveys    show that in          of Americans were frankly obese a marked increase        from  in  underscoring the fact that over the        last few decades an emerging epidemic of obesity has        become a major cause of preventable death    and disease            Recognizing the effects of obesity on the nations        health governments and industry have vigorously pursued        the genetic metabolic and environmental roots of obesity               Despite the effort it remains true that little        is known about prevention of obesity and its treatment        remains no less difficult or failure prone than it ever was                     Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder ADHD is also        a common disorder even if its prevalence is not precisely        known In children the rate of occurrence has customarily        been given as  to  but recent studies show the        condition is present in  or more of school age        populations      Persistence of ADHD into adulthood        has been shown to occur in  to  or more of childhood        cases     depending on the criteria used     It        is clear that adults with a history of ADHD in childhood        have greater difficulty functioning compared to their        nonADHD peers     One example is the higher rate of        substance use disorders in ADHD adults compared to the        general population     such use often viewed as a kind        of selfmedication of unpleasant emotions     In        obesity similar patterns of eating seeking immediate        gratification using food to reduce dysphoria have been        observed     though not previously linked to ADHD        It is established that obesity has serious medical        sequelae and that both obesity and ADHD have psychiatric        comorbidities          but surprisingly        searches found no existing literature describing comorbid        obesity and ADHD OBADHD However one study           reported a potentially relevant correlation between        symptoms of conduct disorder but not depression during        adolescence and obesity in early adulthood attributed to        common mechanisms underlying impulsive aggression and        dysregulation of body weight The role of impulsivity in        this correlation is important given that impulsive        behavior is common in adolescents with ADHD pointing to a        connection between ADHD and development of obesity an idea        consistent with our clinical observation that impulsive        eating behaviors are common in adult and adolescent OBADHD        patients        With persistent effort some bariatric patients have been        able to achieve and maintain a reduced level of body fat        In the bariatric clinic at Behavioral Medicine Center for        Treatment and Research BMedCTR in Portland Oregon among        the patients who failed a subset was observed to have        unusual difficulty adhering to diet and exercise plans and        as a result lost less fat mass than typically occurs        Diagnostic evaluation showed a substantial fraction of        these patients had Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder        ADHD a condition that was recognized in our clinical        work as a risk factor for poor treatment outcome        Fortunately ADHD patients often responded to        pharmacological and behavior therapies with results that        included improved task persistence decreased impulsivity        and distractability and for some greater success with        weight control efforts        Cumulative bariatric clinic experience showed OBADHD        was commonly encountered and a potent contributor to        obesity treatment failure In this context it became clear        that more information about OBADHD was needed and that        wider exposure of this comorbidity would be valuable and        interesting to clinicians treating obese patients        Consequently this report was constructed to begin        exploring the basic characteristics of this heretofore        unrecognized population                    Methods        The primary working hypothesis was that the prevalence        of ADHD among obese patients was higher than in the general        adult population In addition it was anticipated that ADHD        patients would have less weight loss fewer visits and        shorter duration of treatment than their nonADHD peers        Differences between groups were not expected to be widely        divergent        The method used to conduct a systematic examination of        clinical data was a retrospective review of medical records        of patients who had been treated for obesity at BMedCTR        during the period Jan   through Dec   and        enrolled in treatment by Nov   The clinics        scheduling database referenced  unique individuals who        were active patients during the study period        Data relevant to demographic and clinical status was        collected from medical records including age sex body        mass index BMI at first and last visits interval between        first and last visits number of visits and diagnosis of        ADHD entered in the record during the course of obesity        treatment This diagnosis was not determined        retrospectively although the diagnosis was confirmed to be        supported by the written record of behavioral observations        The  records were were divided into  groups patients        without ADHD NAD those with ADHD symptoms or behaviors        but not meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD ADSx and        patients with ADHD AD        Diagnosis of ADHD was made by the author during the        course of patients obesity treatment using        semistructured interviews over one or more visits        Structure was in accord with DSMIV criteria that is a        patient needed to have shown or given substantial history        of  or more inattentive behaviors to be considered as        having ADHD Patients who had fewer than  but at least         inattentive symptoms were classified as having symptoms of        ADHD but not diagnosed as having the disorder None of the        patients had as many as  hyperactiveimpulsive symptoms        Patients inattentive and hyperactiveimpulsive behaviors        were not separately tabulated during records review At        the time diagnoses had been made a behavior was not        considered a symptom of ADHD if occurring only in        association with obesity treatment for example trouble        adhering to diet or exercise plans A significant level of        impairment associated with symptoms was required for ADHD        to be diagnosed While many of the patients had current or        past treatment for depression or anxiety these conditions        were required to be in remission or insufficiently        prominent to obscure or account for ADHD behavior or        impairment for the diagnosis of ADHD to be made        The interview method is termed semistructured because        in a clinical setting the approach to each patient was        necessarily individualized at least to some degree        Within this constraint information was gathered in a        reasonably consistent manner in that the same pieces of        information were sought from each patient the same        questions asked of each even if the order of inquiry        varied that is to say the path through the decision        tree reflected patients differences        During the period of treatment and diagnosis a single        exception to DSMIV ADHD diagnostic criteria was made        regarding age of onset nominally  years for several        reasons Pragmatically adult patients were often uncertain        about the precise age symptoms began though often able to        identify a time in early childhood when symptoms were        already occurring eg in the nd or rd grade making        it impossible to be certain if symptoms were present before        age  For middleaged adults third party confirmation of        early events was seldom available leaving the patients        recall as the only data source Recent studies have shown        that patient memory was consistent enough with other        information to be useful for diagnostic purposes            Patients reports were likely to be accurate but there        were often gaps in memory of early experience not        inconsistent with ADHD in general favoring an inference        that they didnt remember their behavior rather than not        having had the behavior It was concluded that the risk of        misdiagnosis by modifying the age of onset criterion was        much lower than the risks of not diagnosing a condition for        which treatment can make a great difference in life        quality In other words for this population the risks of        underdiagnosing ADHD were judged to be far more        consequential than risks of overdiagnosing the disorder        Accordingly during treatment diagnosis of ADHD was made        when all other DSMIV criteria were met and symptoms were        clearly evident by  years of age        A similar point was made by Wender     who argued        that availability of lowrisk treatments for debilitating        conditions warrants clinicians using less specific criteria        to avoid excluding patients who may benefit A different        argument was made by Barkley and Biederman     that        requiring symptoms to have been present by a single        specific point in early childhood in order to diagnose ADHD        is not rational that is ADHD is better conceptualized as        a disorder arising in childhood generally        None of the ADHD group had a level of        hyperactivityimpulsivity meeting DSMIV criteria        therefore all were classifiable as having Inattentive Type        of ADHD        Data were tested using Unixbased tools including xmstat        and xlispstat Significance was set at    Analysis        of variance was applied to means of age

obesityIII and        extreme obesityIII and a range of symptoms AD ADSx or        NAD These classifications were organized into a           array which was suitable for determining prevalence of ADHD        in whole sample and looking at the differences in ADHD        prevalence among the classes of obesity        The whole sample of  obese patients partitioned by        ADHD group contains  or

   was not statistically distinct from AD in other obesity        classes        Analysis of variance of patients BMI at the start of        treatment showed a significant difference among the group

CI to          randomizations                    Discussion        The most important results are the prevalence of ADHD of         in the sample and the surprisingly strong        association between ADHD and Obesity III Nearly half         of patients with Obesity III had ADHD that is the        OBADHD population was concentrated in the obesity class        having the highest mortality and morbidity risks and        greatest need for effective treatment        Moreover at all levels of obesity patients with ADHD        symptoms were less successful at losing weight than        nonADHD peers Compared to NAD AD had a significantly        higher starting BMI  vs  yet lost less weight         vs  kgm  Greater contrast is found in Obesity        III with NAD in that class achieving more than twice the        weight loss of AD  vs  kgm  while mean weight        loss for ADSx did not differ significantly from AD  vs         kgm  implying that the presence of even        subthreshhold ADHD symptoms reduces the effectiveness of        obesity treatment In other words in OBADHD treatment        outcome has stronger association with symptoms of ADHD than        level of obesity Effect size of ADHD for the whole sample        was only about  but in Obesity III patients effect        size was about  comparable for example to the        moderate effect size of SSRI drugs on panic symptoms                   Impersistence was not the cause of worse results for AD        who attended more visits than NAD  vs  mean total        visits over a longer span of time ADSx was no more        successful than AD but had fewer visits comparable to        NAD in this respect ADSx showing characteristics        intermediate between AD and NAD The result is AD ADSx and        NAD having similar rates of clinic visits AD had         visitsmonth ADSx  and NAD  while NAD had the        highest rate of BMI decrease NAD lost  BMImonth ADSx         and AD  However these statistics have limited        utility given the large variance in number of visits and        months of treatment The slow aspect of task performance        in ADHD has been previously reported     and could be        described as a kind of inefficiency that is taking more        time to accomplish less        The reasons for a strong association between ADHD and        obesity particularly extreme obesity are unknown but        there are a number of reported findings that appear to be        relevant and certainly interesting For one evidence        exists that variations of dopamine receptor DR genes        affect both conditions In obesity DRD and DRD            genes and in ADHD the DRD     gene have been        implicated in the transmission of or predisposition to        the disorders raising the possibility that similar        overlapping or shared DR functioning or dysfunction in        these disorders is related to their cocooccurrence        DRD and a range of dopamine and other genes have been        associated with a reward deficiency syndrome    in        which insufficient dopaminemediated natural reward leads        to use of unnatural rewards such as substances        gambling risk taking and inappropriate eating This        syndrome is associated with obesity     and common in        ADHD     The DRD gene has been associated with        novelty seeking traits said to be greater in substance        abusers     and individuals with both DRD and DRD        genetic variations may be especially prone to multiple        difficulties eg having both ADHD and reward deficiency        syndrome     further suggesting obesity and ADHD        could share neurobiological attributes        A recent study showed the availability of striatal DRD        receptors was decreased as a function of increasing BMI            supporting the idea that rewardseeking behavior        plays a role in the onset or continuation of obesity In        other studies administration of D agonists resulted in        decreases in hyperinsulinemia associated with obesity            and it is known that the brain is richly supplied with        insulin receptors including the cortex and striatal areas            suggesting an intriguing link between insulin        resistance characteristic of obesity and        dopaminemediated psychiatric symptoms including ADHD No        doubt this hypothesis and many far more refined hypotheses        will be studied in coming years and will elucidate the        complex neurophysiological connections hinted at by the        above        The  prevalence of ADHD in obese patients is        considerably higher than found in the general adult        population reported as  by Murphy and Barkley            Across studies of other specific populations prevalence of        ADHD or ADHD symptoms was also greater than in general for        example cocaine abusers      anxiety disorders             panic disorder      and substance abusers             Considering the differing methods and        populations the reported prevalences are difficult to        compare yet are fairly consistent with one another for the        most part The prevalence of OBADHD in this report is        plausibly within the range of these studies        The uniformity of the Inattentive subtype of ADHD in        this adult population was not unusual or unexpected        considering the wellknown attenuation of hyperactive and        impulsive symptoms observed as children with ADHD grow into        adolescence and adulthood compared to the much stronger        retention of inattentive symptoms     This is not to        say that ADHD adults dont behave impulsively simply that        with maturation continuing hyperactiveimpulsive HI        behaviors are usually expressed in less obvious ways than        among their schoolage counterparts That is while ADHD        adults frequently have impairing HI         symptoms  the number and types of        these behaviors seldom meet DSMIV diagnostic         criteria for the HI or Combined        subtype of ADHD DSMIV ADHD subtyping strictly applied        is likely to have limited correlation to neurobiological        processes assuming processes reflect impulsivity or        disinhibition since the level of symptomatic behavior        required for diagnosing DSMIV HI or Combined subtypes is        higher than nearly all ADHD adults will display even if        substantial HI behavior is evident        Another factor is that girls compared to boys have        lower rates of HI symptoms which is associated with lower        likelihood of being diagnosed in childhood but if        diagnosed girls more frequently have the Inattentive        subtype     It would be expected that this difference        would persist into adulthood augmenting the likelihood        that Inattentive symptoms would predominate the clinical        presentation In a sample in which most patients are female        and middleaged predominance of the Inattentive subtype is        predictable        Inevitably there are numerous caveats and limitations        that apply to this preliminary work For one results        reflect the origin of data in clinical practice  hardly        ideal from a research perspective Treatment settings may        favor a higher casefinding rate because of the opportunity        to observe and assess behavior is greater than the methods        of prospective research designs For example ADHD research        instruments have a sensitivity of       and        would likely identify fewer cases of ADHD than the gold        standard of careful clinical assessment expected to find        most cases For this report diagnosis had been made        primarily by one interviewer which could favor        consistency but also leads to potential biases that skew        results In addition the modification of age of onset        criterion for ADHD may increase difficulty of comparing        present results to those of studies using the unmodified        criterion Clearly for the purpose of comparing prevalence        among diverse populations a prospective design is strongly        advantageous but likely not congruent with the goals of        clinical practice        Bias could also be introduced by patient factors such        as comorbid conditions producing symptoms which might not        be easily separable from those found in ADHD and        erroneously diagnosed as ADHD Several disorders common in        obese patients fit into this category eg obstructive        sleep apnea depression and anxiety disorders While the        differential characteristics of these conditions eg        relative duration pervasiveness and continuity of symptoms        can help distinguish one from another the nature and        interactions of these comorbidities are not particularly        welldelineated While careful clinical practice requires        effort to avoid diagnosing ADHD if symptoms are not        sufficiently distinct from those of confounding disorders        reducing error requires further research into the effects        of comorbidities intercurrent with ADHD        Another form of bias originates in patients        predisposition to endorse symptoms because of dysphoria        negative affectivity or readiness to attribute distress to        some preferred rather than actual source when queried by        the interviewer For the OBADHD population the idea is        that some patients may have had a preference for endorsing        ADHD symptoms instead of accepting more accurate        explanations for distress or lack of obesity treatment        progress eg failure to lose weight while being        unwilling to exercise I cant lose weight because I just        get so distracted        Some forms of endorsement bias are readily seen in        medical practice for example patients who would rather        talk about somatic events than discuss their anxieties or        depressed mood Implications for the OBADHD population are        hard to assess since this form of bias and its effects on        research of ADHD prevalence have not received comparable        study nor are there reports of the frequency of        encountering this bias in clinical work with adult ADHD        patients Moreover no special measures were taken to        reduce or account for such biases during the course of        diagnosing patients in the present sample rendering it        quite difficult to estimate how much and what kind of        effect biases have had on the above reported prevalences of        OBADHD At this point it remains an open question        suggesting additional reasons for cautious interpretation        of the results given in this report        The demographic characteristics of the sample population        are worth a few comments Notably about  of the        patients were women which obviously does not reflect the        general population but may not be surprising in this        context because more women than men are concerned about        weight gain and are more likely to seek medical care than        male contemporaries The patients as a group were also        distinctly middleaged no doubt reflecting the fact that        older individuals are more likely to be able to afford        noninsured medical care obesity treatment isnt covered        under most policies and the time to devote to their own        needs        Some effects of demographic factors on diagnosis of ADHD        were discussed above Gender and age differences eg        younger patients or higher male to female ratio could        conceivably affect the range and intesity of ADHD symptoms        that are observed prevalence findings and individual as        well as aggregate response to obesity treatment        In addition generalizability of conclusions based on        the data in this report are limited by a modest sample        size and uncertainty that the bariatric patients in the        sample were truly representative of the general obese        population Results could be misleading for example if        the sample had a disproportion of individuals with serious        medical or psychiatric problems higher weight or greater        social skill deficits even if the sample is construed to        be typical of those seen in similar practices                    Conclusion        This report is explicitly exploratory and its findings        need to be replicated in larger and more systematic        studies Nonetheless these findings are already quite        interesting and could have implications for the        understanding of the etiology of obesity as well as the        treatment of obesity The nature of the connections to the        extent that they exist between attention and obesity is of        course not at all clear but the results may point to forms        of attentional components and impulsivity playing a role in        the onset or continuation of obesity or that attentional        mechanisms are linked in some way to metabolic and energy        storage regulation        Implications for clinical practice may be of more        immediate consequence Treatment of obesity has been        marginally effective at best particularly for extreme        obesity If an attentional disorder is present conceivably        its treatment could improve obesity treatment outcome        which makes awareness of the ADHDobesity comorbidity        pragmatically important It has been shown that reduction        of body weight as small as  substantially reduces the        morbidity and mortality risks of obesity so even if        recognizing and treating ADHD is only a modest contributor        to reducing body fat mass it is worthwhile on that grounds        alone Moreover the impairment of ADHD is an intrinsic        reason to diagnose and treat the condition because even if        comorbid obesity were not changed normalizing brain        function in ADHD sufferers more often than not provides        substantial benefit and improved quality of life        The apparent association of OBADHD relatively poor        obesity treatment outcome and high prevalence of OBADHD         especially in the extremely obese  argue        that comorbid ADHD increases the health risks of obesity        and that extreme obesity itself a stressful condition        adds burden to the profound impairments common in ADHD The        chance that more knowledge could lead to reduction of        suffering disability and economic cost offers compelling        reasons for further investigation of this subject        Inclusion of more diverse and nonclinical populations of        obese and extremely obese individuals and using research        designs that better account for rater and subject biases        interrater reliability and diagnostic methodology will        likely give more definitive answers to this reports        questions and implications                    Competing interests        None declared
