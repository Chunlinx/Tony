                                 Al Dunlap            Of all the stupid things theAmerican Medical Association has done during its disastrous fling withcommercialism choosing Sunbeam CEO Al Dunlap as its business partner has to bethe most stupid Dunlaps nicknames preferred nicknamesare ChainsawAl and Rambo in Pinstripes so you can scarcely imagine two moreantithetical worldviews than his and the AMAs The AMA pitches itself asAmericas selfless medical counselor indifferent to the demands of themarketplace Dunlap by contrast is the marketplace The mostcoldblooded businessman around Dunlap personifies the relentless logic of WallStreet He champions efficiency and ruthlessness and follows no higherprinciple than the value of his companys stock If the market is controlled byan invisible hand Dunlap is its iron fist            The AMAhoped the would help the companys bottom line and not cause it embarrassmentBut since its Aug  announcement Dunlap has been teaching the association apainful lesson in the realities of the market The AMA tried to softpedal theSunbeam deal as a consumereducation project but Dunlap exploded that notionby touting its commercialism Sunbeam he declared would eagerly advertise itsexclusive AMA partnership When public outrage prompted the AMA to wriggle freeof the Sunbeam deal last week Dunlap threatened to sue the association toenforce the contract The AMA and Sunbeam havent settled their dispute buteveryone knows who won and who lost Dunlaps company has received a vastamount of press Its littleknown homehealthcare product line got a huge PRboost Its stock price jumped four points The AMA meanwhile will spend thenext few months or years trying to repair its image The AMA has beenDunlapped            Aholy terror of a CEO Dunlap has emerged as the mascot ofa new kind of capitalism Dunlapism begins and ends at Wall Street Itssole credo is How can we make our stock worth more Nothing that isvalued by less steely businessmenloyalty to workers responsibility to thecommunity relationships with suppliers generosity in corporatephilanthropymatters to Dunlap Business ethics professors tout stakeholdercapitalism Dunlap sneers at the phrase Dunlapism is the perfect religion forthe Mutual Fund Age As the AMA discovered everyone who deals with Dunlaplosesexcept his stockholders            Otherexecutives share his creed but none matches Dunlaps methods In the past twodecades the yearold executive has run nine companies in the United StatesAustralia and England He served as righthand manenforcer for bothAustralian media magnate Kerry Packer and recently deceased British billionaireSir James Goldsmith In the process he has earned a reputation as the mostmerciless turnaround artist in the world To wit As CEO of struggling cupmanufacturer Lily Tulip Corp in the s Dunlap fired most of the seniormanagers sold the corporate jet closed the headquarters and two factoriesdumped half the headquarters staff and laid off a bunch of other workers Thestock price rose from  to  in his twoandahalfyear tenure AtScott Paperhis preSunbeam tour of dutyhe fired  employees includinghalf the managers and  percent of the companys hourly workers eliminatedthe corporations million philanthropy budget slashed RD spending andclosed factories Scotts market value stood at about  billion when Dunlaparrived in mid In late  he sold Scott to KimberlyClark for billion pocketing  million for himselfa modest payoff he says for the billion in increased shareholder value            Dunlapping continues at Sunbeam a stagnantconsumerproducts company Dunlap has fired  of  workers sincetaking over in July  sold off subsidiaries employing another eliminated corporate charity and shuttered  of  factories The payoffSunbeams stock has climbed from  to  in barely a year            Whatdistinguishes Dunlap from his colleagues is that he takes pride in histoughness expressing only cursory regret for having cashiered thousands of hisworkers When Newsweek ran a cover story about corporate layoffs Dunlapcontributed a gleeful column about how wonderful such firings are forstockholders Then he savaged ATT CEO Robert Allen publicly for notsacking enough people He posed as Rambo on the cover of USA Today  Andhe titled his  best seller Mean Business How I Save Bad Companies andMake Good Companies Great  In it he likens himself to Michael Jordan andBruce Springsteen fellow superstars            Its easy to hate Dunlap for the wrong reason which isthat he is a brutal heartless arrogant bastard According to BusinessWeek  Dunlap skipped the funerals of both his parents failed to supportor even pay attention to the child from his first marriage and refused tohelp pay for his nieces cancer treatments But to criticize Dunlap for hiscruelty is akin to scolding a lion for killing an antelope Dunlap lacksconscience Well so does the market If Wall Street were a CEO it would skipits parents funerals too And there is logic to Dunlaps crueltyStruggling companies do need to shed workers in order to recover Dumping percent of your employees as Dunlap did at Scott may save the jobs of theother  percent Stockholder profits should not necessarily be squandered onthe CEOs favorite charity            But there is a right reasonto hate Dunlap which is this Hes not as good as he looks Dunlap does notknow how to build a company If capitalism is creative destruction Dunlapismis simply destruction He prettifies struggling companies for Wall Street butundermines them in the long term Both Barrons and Business Weekhave chronicled how Dunlap has built his turnarounds on cosmetic measuresdesigned to pump up stock prices At Sunbeam and Scott he has sold assets toraise quick cash cut prices to artificially boost sales and squeezedsuppliers for shortterm savings at the price of longterm reliability HisRD cuts have come at a time when other American companies are investing innew technology He uses PR brilliantly Hill and Knowlton tout him relentlesslyto reporters and investors winning him an adulatory profile that serves himwell The day he was hired for example Sunbeam stock jumped  percent on hisreputation alone Another example Within an hour of my call to Sunbeam HQ forinformation on Dunlap I received five voice mail messages from three Sunbeamflacks Dunlaps companies too rely heavily on shortterm marketingcampaigns and advertising What he does not do is spend time developing newproducts nurturing talent and cultivating customers Why Because he neversticks around a company long enough for that to matter            Sooner or lateralmostcertainly soonerDunlap will quit Sunbeam liquidate his stock options cleara profit of about  million and move on to another highprofile jobSunbeam will be worth a lot more than it was when Dunlap arrived It may not bea better company
