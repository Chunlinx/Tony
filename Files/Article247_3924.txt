                                 Britannica Burned by the Web for Now                        Encyclopedia Britannica was the definitive oldeconomy media company It wasponderous authoritative and dedicated to the proposition that the world waschanging slowly enough that giant tomes were the perfect vehicle forcommunicating information about it And Britannicas experiences with newtechnologies beginning with the CDROM and then extending to the Internethave done nothing to dispel its oldeconomy image The problem is that nowBritannica is trying to play in the new economy At every turn Britannica hasreacted slowly incompletely and in almost blissful ignorance of the economicsof the Web            But whats important about Britannicas most recent screwupit opened itsrevamped Web site for business two weeks ago and then immediately shut it downbecause the sheer volume of traffic crashed the siteis not just that it showshow illequipped to deal with the Internet most big companies remain It alsoshows that Britannicas reputation carries enormous weight in the online worldThe site crashed after all because tens of millions of people tried to accessthe encyclopedia online And that has interesting implications for the way wethink about offline brands and their extension onto the Internet            First though the bad news Britannicas performance in the s has beenan object lesson in what not to do Because the company thought its brand namewas irresistible it brushed off the challenge posed by Microsofts EncartaCDROM encyclopedia and when it first introduced the CDROM version of its ownencyclopedia it priced it so high that Encarta was essentially handed themarket There are now millions of people who use CDROM encyclopedias andalmost none of them have bought Britannica in book form            You could argue that those are customers Britannica couldnt have pursuedwithout endangering its core franchise But as the last few years havedemonstrated the endangering was going to take place whether Britannicapursued them or not And had Britannica approached the CDROM market seriouslyit could have snared a huge chunk of it Or so at least its recent ifshortlived performance on the Internet suggests            The Website disaster similarly speaks to Britannicas continued struggle toadapt to new technology The company has actually been online since offering feebased research but the revamping marked Britannicasacknowledgement one we                   Slate               sters are very familiar with thatthe Web and fees dont go together well and its hope that its brand waspowerful enough to make an advertising business work As has been the casewith Yahoo Making that conceptual shift was important But so was doing thebackend work that would keep users happy And here Britannica fell shortagain            This may very well mean that Britannica wont ever really figure out how tocapitalize on the Internet since technology isnt going to stop changing andany successful company will have to make adaptability a core competence atBritannica right now its not even a marginal competence But the fact thattens of millions of people wanted to use the Britannica Web site makes up for alot of mistakes A few weeks ago at a conference organized by MichaelMauboussin of Credit Suisse First Boston Disney Imagineer Danny Hillis saidthat he thought Britannicas brand was so strong that once it got its acttogether it would be a Web powerhouse At the time I thought he wasincredibly wrong both about Britannicas brand name and about its future onthe Web But oddly after the last two weeks it looks more and more likeHillis might very well be right
