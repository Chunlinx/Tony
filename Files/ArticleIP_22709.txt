                                            With the Oscars newly behind us a questionbegs for resolution Its common knowledge that many big box office stars oftenborrow glittery gems for special occasions from the likes of Harry Winstonetc At the Golden Globe Awards in pixelperfect color viewed fromBarcaloungers around the world we all gasped in horror when Miss Redgrave theone now embroiled in an almost Kentuckian divorce drama lost an earringThere in front of the breathless masses it fell from her ear while she beingthe consummate professional continued without even seeming to notice Onemight have assumed that as soon as the camera panned elsewhere she scooped upthe errant earring However for the rest of the event she was photographedwith only one earring                                       My question is this Did she find the earringWas it borrowed or her own Ah for the good old days when there was no doubtthat Lizs diamonds were her own

the litter boxare enough to make you lose your appetiteor worse The kitchen sink is filledwith dishes that have been there for days on end From having lived with herbefore I always knew she was a

youare feeling faint of heart about leveling with your chum simply refuse toconvene at the house that the cats have taken over Prudie would hope howeverthat you would take a more direct approach which might actually be doing akindness Since you and this longtime pal have a history of warmth andfriendship why not tell her the conditions in her home are way beyond theclutterbug stage and you are worried about her health            Prudie has always felt there is something a littlenutty about people who are able to ignore an extreme mess and the sensibilitiesof others In the spirit of constructive advice a word from you might focusher attention and remedy the situation If not simply state that you can nolonger be a visitor to her home            Prudie hopefully
