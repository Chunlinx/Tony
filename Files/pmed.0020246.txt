                    Introduction        With an estimated  million people with HIVAIDS Nigeria is home to one of every         of the  million people with HIVAIDS worldwide  The HIV prevalence among adults in        Nigeria has increased from  in  to an estimated  in   Prevalence ranges        from  to  in the countrys  states and Federal Capital Territory  According to        official estimates Nigeria has an estimated  million people with HIVAIDS and        approximately  AIDS deaths this year alone  and these numbers are projected to        increase each year In  with the election of President Olusegun Obasanjo Nigeria        emerged from approximately  years of military dictatorship in which little governmental        attention or funding was directed at addressing HIVAIDS         People living with HIVAIDS PLWA in Nigeria have been found to be subject to        discrimination and stigmatization in the work place and by family and communities         PLWA may also face discrimination from those employed in the healthcare sector         Discriminatory or unethical behavior by healthcare professionals against PLWA as        documented in other countries  may create an atmosphere that interferes with        effective prevention and treatment by discouraging individuals from being tested or seeking        information on how to protect themselves and others from HIVAIDS  Furthermore        discriminatory practices and violations of international principles of medical ethics may        serve to legitimize other forms of discrimination against people living with HIVAIDS        Anecdotal information suggests that healthcare professionals in Nigeria may engage in        discrimination against and stigmatization of PLWA  The prevalence character of and        factors contributing to these practices are however largely undocumented To address        this Physicians for Human Rights PHR Policy Project Nigeria and the Center for the        Right to Health conducted a survey of health professionals in four sites in Nigeria The        study was designed to answer three research questions  Are there discriminatory        practices in the health sector that affect the health and wellbeing of people with        HIVAIDS in Nigeria  How receptive are health workers and institutions to treating        people with HIVAIDS And  what underlying factors may contribute to any discriminatory        practices The study was intended to inform ongoing policy discussions and development of        effective interventions                    Methods                  Sampling          At the time of the study approximately  people were living in the           states and Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria  We conducted the study in four          states Abia Gombe Kano and Oyo These sites were selected by dividing the countrys          six geopolitical zones into two sectionsnorth and southin order to capture geographical          and other differences and then randomly selecting two of three zones from each section          Within the four selected zones using healthcare facility lists compiled by Nigerias          Federal Ministry of Health  we identified states that have a tertiary care          institution and randomly selected one of these states from each zone To obtain a          representative sample of healthcare professionals we proportionally sampled doctors          nurses and midwives from the tertiary facility and systematically selected public and          private secondary and primary healthcare facilities in the four states Fiftyfour          percent of the healthcare professionals were sampled from tertiary care facilities We          determined the sample size based on local activists estimates that  of clinicians          have discriminatory behavior and attitudes a margin of error of   and a           confidence  significance level The sample size required given these constraints was           healthcare professionals However our sample design included several levels of          clustering and we therefore assumed a design effect of three and thus the sample size          needed was calculated to be approximately  Eligible facilities were medical          facilities included in the published federal government database which indicated that          there were  health facilities in the four states  In each healthcare facility          we systematically sampled from all doctors nurses and midwives to acquire information          about their knowledge attitudes and behavior Eligible professionals were physicians or          certified nurses or midwives working in positions with direct patient contact Data on          the number of healthcare professionals were derived from Federal Ministry of Health          data which indicated that these four states have a total of nearly  healthcare          professionals who serve a population of approximately  million people                           Survey Questionnaire          The item healthcare professional survey included questions on respondent          demographics practices regarding informed consent testing and disclosure treatment          and care of patients with HIVAIDS and attitudes and beliefs about treatment and care of          patients with HIVAIDS including informed consent testing and disclosure          Treatment and care practices of patients with HIVAIDS were assessed using Likerttype          scales eg the possible answers were always most of the time sometimes          rarely and never Attitudes and beliefs were assessed by a response of agree or          disagree with statements regarding testing treatment and care of patients with          HIVAIDS          Using a separate item survey instrument we obtained information about each          facilitys capacity resources and policies from the person in charge of the facility          The questionnaires were written and interviews conducted in English Seven regional          human rights and medical experts reviewed the questionnaires for content validity The          instruments were pilot tested among  participants in Lagos and suggestions regarding          clarity and cultural appropriateness were incorporated                          Interviewers          After completing an intensive training program  Nigerian surveyors conducted the          survey interviews Interviewer training consisted of  d of classroom teaching and          roleplaying followed by several days of field observation and ongoing supervision by PHR          and Nigerian researchers          All interviews were conducted over  wk in October and November  Interviews          lasted approximately  min and were conducted in the most private setting possible          within each healthcare facility All questionnaires were reviewed for completeness and          for correctness of recording after the interview by the interviewers themselves by the          Nigerian research team leaders and by PHR field supervisors at the end of each day                          Definitions          In the surveys informed consent was defined as ensuring that a patient who is          competent to make decisions is informed and consulted about his or her care Respondents          were informed that this included the responsibility of the clinician to let the patient          know about any procedure or medical decision reasonable alternatives to it and the          risks benefits uncertainties and possible consequences related to each alternative          The clinician must carry out the discussion in laypersons terms assess the patients          understanding along the way and ensure that the patient understands the information and          consents to it voluntarily  Universal precautions were defined as the use of          protective barriers such as gloves gowns aprons masks or protective eyewear which          can reduce the risk of exposure to potentially infective materials at all times          regardless of a patients HIV or other status                           Human Subjects Protection          This study was reviewed and approved by an independent ethics review board of          individuals with expertise in clinical medicine public health bioethics and          international HIVAIDS and human rights research developed for this research project by          PHR In reviewing the research the review board was guided by the relevant provisions of          Title  of the US Code of Federal Regulations  and complied with the Declaration of          Helsinki as revised in   The study was also reviewed for ethical and cultural          appropriateness by a panel convened in Nigeria by Policy Project Nigeria In addition          permission for the study and access to facilities was granted by the Nigerian Federal          Ministry of Health state and local government authorities and facility directors There          were no limitations placed on movement or surveying Verbal informed consent was obtained          from all participants their names were not recorded and only minimal identifying          information was taken in order to preserve the anonymity of their responses Participants          did not receive any compensation                          Statistical Analysis          The data were analyzed using Stata   To control for clustering and design          effect the sample was weighted by the number of states selected with a tertiary facility          from each of six selected geopolitical zones the number of local government areas per          location the number of facilities selected from each local government area and the          response rate in each location The studys principal objective was to describe          healthcare professional practices and attitudes towards people with HIVAIDS rather          than to conduct comparisons between professionals or explore associations between          professional characteristics and different outcomes However we conducted bivariate          analyses using chisquare analyses and simple logistic regression to compare negative          practices and attitudes among the three health specialties surveyed doctors nurses and          midwives and to test for associations between reported facility resources and providers          reported adequacy of AIDS training and reported negative practices and attitudes about          HIVAIDS                            Results                  Characteristics of Facilities          Of the  facilities sampled  were no longer operational for ten contact could          not be established after two attempts at the time of sampling and  were not eligible          Of the  eligible facilities where contact was established  participated in the          study  of operational facilities Over half of the facilities were general hospitals           and  were primary health centers          Eightyfour percent of facility directors reported not having antiretroviral          medications in their facility Moreover the availability of other medications and          dietary supplements was limited and protective materials and other supplies and          utilities were not always available Table                           Characteristics of Respondents          Of the  professionals sampled  were not eligible five were not available          after two attempts at the time of sampling eight were interrupted during the course of          the interview and  refused to participate Consequently  professionals          participated in the study  response rate Although we did not gather information on          nonrespondents most of the  nonrespondents who refused to participate cited lack of          time as the reason they were unable to participate  with other nonrespondents citing          other

age of  y Fiftysix            percent were nurses  were physicians and  were certified midwives Table                                            HIVAIDS training            Most professionals reported having some training on HIVAIDS Table  Current            literature  conferences  and courses as a student  were most            frequently reported by professionals as the sources of this training Seven percent            reported having no training on HIVAIDS at all                                    Testing and Consent                      Practices            Seventeen percent of surveyed healthcare professionals reported that their facility            had a written HIV testing policy Table  Respondents indicated that the policies            included requirements for informed consent  pretest counseling  posttest            counseling  and posttest referral             Over  of professionals reported obtaining informed consent of patients for HIV            tests half of the time or less including  who reported never obtaining consent for            HIV tests Table  Fiftyfour percent of respondents reported that regardless of            consent routine HIV testing of all patients scheduled for surgery always took place at            their facilities and  reported such routine HIV testing of all women attending            antenatal care clinics Providers who reported that they lacked adequate training in            HIVAIDS treatment and ethics had  higher odds of reporting that they failed to            obtain informed consent for HIV tests more than  of the time compared to providers            reporting adequate training in these areas odds ratio OR   confidence            interval CI                                 Attitudes            Ninetyone percent of professionals agreed that staff and healthcare professionals            should be informed when a patient is HIVpositive so they can protect themselves Table             Over threequarters of respondents  agreed that there are circumstances when            it is appropriate to test a patient without his or her knowledge or permission            Fiftyseven percent of participants believed that relatives and sexual partners of            patients with HIVAIDS should be notified of the patients status even without the            patients consent Fortysix percent of professionals thought that the charts or beds            of patients with HIV should be marked so that health facility workers know the            patients status            Forty percent believed that healthcare professionals with HIVAIDS should not be            working in any area of the health professions that requires patient contact Twenty            percent of respondents agreed that many of those who have HIVAIDS behaved immorally            and deserve the disease Table             Providers working in facilities that did not always practice universal precautions             citing lack of sufficient materials as the reason were significantly more likely            than those working in facilities that always observed universal precautions to agree            that people with HIVAIDS should not be employed in the health field OR   CI             and should not work in areas that require patient contact They also had            higher odds of agreeing that under certain circumstances patients could be tested for            HIV without their knowledge or permission OR   CI  Working in a            facility that did not always practice universal precautions being a nurse or midwife            and reporting inadequate training in HIVAIDS treatment were all associated with            agreeing that patients with HIVAIDS should be on a separate ward in a hospital or            clinic Nurses and midwives both had more than five times the odds of agreeing that            people with HIVAIDS should not be employed in the health field than doctors and that            the charts or beds of HIV patients should be marked Nurses and midwives also had            almost twice the odds of physicians of agreeing that under certain circumstances it is            acceptable to test patients for HIV without their consent or knowledge                                    Treatment and Care                      Practices            Among healthcare professionals the three most important concerns about treating            patients with HIVAIDS were fear of becoming contaminated  contamination of            facility materials or instruments  and not having materials needed to treat            them  Table  Seventytwo percent of respondents reported that universal            precautions were always practiced in the facilities in which they worked Lack of            materialsreported by  of professionalswas cited as the main reason for            nonpractice of universal precautions Table             Nine percent of professionals reported refusing to care for a patient with HIVAIDS            and  indicated that they had refused a patient with HIVAIDS admission to a hospital            Table  Sixtysix percent had observed other healthcare professionals refusing to            care for a patient with HIVAIDS and  had observed others refusing a patient with            HIVAIDS admission to a hospital While less than one percent of professionals reported            verbally mistreating a patient with HIVAIDS  of respondents reported seeing others            verbally mistreat patients with HIVAIDS            Thirtyeight percent of professionals reported giving confidential information to a            patients family member without the patients consent and  had observed this            behavior Twelve percent of professionals reported giving confidential information to a            person not related to a patient without consent and  had observed this behavior            Table             Providers who reported inadequate training in HIVAIDS treatment and in ethics were            significantly more likely to have refused to treat a patient with HIVAIDS than those            reporting adequate training in those two areas OR   CI  Providers            working in facilities that did not always practice universal precautions were not more            likely to have refused care to a patient themselves but were significantly more likely            to report having observed other providers refuse to care for a patient with HIVAIDS            OR   CI  There were no differences among specialties in reporting            having refused to care for a patient with HIVAIDS                                Attitudes            To prevent discrimination by healthcare professionals against patients with            HIVAIDS most participants  indicated that healthcare professionals who engage            in discriminatory practices should be educated and counseled Health facility policies            against discrimination were cited as solutions by  of professionals and stronger            laws against discrimination were suggested by  Table             Ninetyfour percent indicated that medications to treat opportunistic infections may            prolong the life of a patient who is HIVpositive Table  Over half  of            professionals agreed that people with HIVAIDS should be on a separate ward in a            hospital or clinic Fortyeight percent of participants expressed their belief that a            person with HIVAIDS cannot be treated effectively in their facility Forty percent of            healthcare professionals reported that it is possible to determine a persons HIV            status by looking at him or her and  agreed that they could refuse to treat a            patient with HIVAIDS to protect themselves and their family Twelve percent expressed            agreement with the statement that treatment of opportunistic infections in patients            with HIVAIDS wastes resources and  agreed that treating someone with HIVAIDS is a            waste of precious resources            Nurses had higher odds than physicians of agreeing that treating opportunistic            infections in patients with HIVAIDS is a waste of resources OR   CI             but physicians were  more likely than nurses to agree that they could            refuse to treat a patient with HIVAIDS to protect themselves and their family            Respondents who reported inadequate training in HIVAIDS treatment also were            significantly more likely to agree it was acceptable to refuse to treat a patient for            these reasons OR   CI  Physicians had significantly higher odds            than either nurses or midwives of agreeing that there were circumstances under which it            was appropriate to reveal a persons HIV status to others without the patients            knowledge or permission                                      Discussion        Most healthcare professionals in the four states where the study was conducted appeared        to be providing care to patients who were HIVpositive and complying with their ethical        responsibilities despite their lack of training on HIVAIDS and their having insufficient        supplies of materials needed for treatment and prevention in the facilities where they        work A significant number however reported engaging in discriminatory andor unethical        behavior These practices are corrosive to the health professions as they taint all health        professionals and erode trust in them They also represent missed opportunities for        prevention positive living education and treatment thereby undermining Nigerias        concerted national efforts to address the HIVAIDS epidemic Our study findings suggest        that there are several factors that may contribute to such discriminatory andor unethical        behavior by healthcare professionals against people with HIVAIDS in Nigeria        The vast majority of professionals expressed an interest in additional information and        suggested education as a way to address discriminatory behaviors by their colleagues An        immediate investment to ensure the education of all existing clinical staff about HIVAIDS        including modes of transmission universal precautions and the rights of PLWA would likely        reduce the number of discriminatory practices towards PLWA and may improve these patients        care and access to health services This assertion is supported by previous studies that        demonstrate the effect of HIVAIDS education of nurses and other health workers on their        attitudes and behavior towards patients who are HIVpositive in Nigeria and elsewhere         These studies also suggest that education about scientific matters is not likely        to be sufficient to achieve change in practice and that educational programs may also need        to address attitudes and cultural beliefs        This study further suggests that the lack of protective and other materials needed to        treat and prevent the spread of HIV and related conditions contributes to discriminatory        behavior While the issue of access to affordable antiretroviral treatment is the subject        of much debate in Nigeria  many of the facilities in this study did not even have        sufficient stocks of basic antibiotics to treat opportunistic infections The lack of        protective materials documented in the health facility survey and cited also by        professionals as the main reason for not applying universal precautions contributes to        discriminatory behavior in two ways First professionals lacking adequate protection may        come to fear PLWA and fear may lead to discrimination  Second lack of resources        also results in differential treatment practices that may contribute to stigmatization of        PLWA        In order to do their jobs safely and effectively health professionals must be provided        with adequate supplies of essential protective materials Further the lack of basic        medications hampers the ability of health professionals to provide appropriate treatment        Without these materials it is unlikely that education of health professionals and        implementation of antidiscrimination policies alone will have the desired impact on        practice        It is likely that in other lowresource contexts the absence of medications needed to        treat HIVAIDSrelated illnesses a lack of materials needed for protection of health        personnel and insufficient knowledge of health personnel about HIVAIDS may contribute to        discriminatory behavior towards people with HIVAIDS The role of these factors should be        investigated While addressing these factors may not eliminate all discriminatory behavior        these basic investments in the healthcare sector are likely to result in improvements        HIV infection is both a product of and a factor contributing to human rights violations         The documented marginalization of certain groups and their increased risk for        infection with HIV in Nigeria  must be considered in light of this study        Misconceptions must be taken into account when developing education and training programs        for professionals and the public Nigerian health professionals are members of their        society one in which stigma and moral judgment appear to be attached to HIVAIDS         Twenty percent of respondents agreed that many of those who have HIVAIDS behaved immorally        and deserve the disease As such it is likely that governmental and facility policies and        monitoring to reduce discriminatory practices in the healthcare sector will be an        important aspect of addressing these practices        Numerous international and regional human rights instruments to which Nigeria is a        party  protect the rights of PLWA These include  the African Charter on Human        and Peoples rights  the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination        against Women  the Convention on the Rights of the Child  the International        Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  the International        Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights  and the International Covenant on        Civil and Political Rights  Of these only the African Charter and the Convention on        the Rights of the Child have been incorporated into the domestic law of Nigeria         Nigeria is also a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights         The above instruments set out Nigerias obligations to protect the rights of PLWA        including the right to life  the right to education  the right to marry and found        a family  the right to nondiscrimination  the right to share in the benefits of        scientific advancements  the right to privacy  and the right to freedom of        association         Several of the instruments to which Nigeria is a party include the right to health         The right to health was first elaborated in the International Covenant on        Economic Social and Cultural Rights Article   which states                                         The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to            the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health             The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the present Covenant to achieve            the full realization of this right shall include those necessary for                                                          a The provision for the reduction of the stillbirthrate and of infant            mortality and for the healthy development of the child            b The improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial            hygiene            c The prevention treatment and control of epidemic endemic occupational and            other diseases            d The creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and            medical attention in the event of sickness                          In  the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ESCR Committee        responsible for interpretation and monitoring of the International Covenant on Economic        Social and Cultural Rights published General Comment  on the Right to the Highest        Attainable Standard of Health  The ESCR Committee determined that fulfillment of the        right to health means that access to health services must not be limited based on        discrimination on a prohibited ground including HIV status         In General Comment  the ESCR Committee also set out the core obligations of a state        party to protect the right to health which include ensuring the right of access to health        facilities goods and services on a nondiscriminatory basis especially for vulnerable or        marginalized groups the provision of essential drugs as from time to time defined by        WHOs Action Programme on Essential Drugs and ensuring equitable distribution of all        health facilities goods and services In addition to these and other core obligations        the ESCR Committee also set out obligations of comparable priority  including a state        partys obligation to take measures to prevent treat and control epidemic and endemic        diseases to provide education and access to information concerning the main health        problems in the community including methods of preventing and controlling them and to        provide appropriate training for health personnel including education on health and human        rights        The ESCR Committee also stated in General Comment  that any person or group who is a        victim of a violation of the right to health should have access to effective judicial or        other appropriate remedies at both national and international levelsAs a state party        Nigeria is bound by the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic Social and        Cultural Rights and the authoritative interpretations of the ESCR Committee This study        finds that some PLWA have been excluded from access to health care because of their HIV        status and that at this time PLWA have no access to judicial or other remedial processes        to address this The data further suggest that inadequate education of health personnel        about HIVAIDS along with a lack of protective and treatment materials likely contribute to        these behaviors by health professionals It is therefore likely that Nigeria has not met        its core obligations to fulfill and protect the right to health The findings of this study        suggest that in order to fulfill its obligations the government of Nigeria should        continue to address gaps in policy and legislation and work together with the international        community to ensure that health professionals receive the training protective materials        and medications they need to treat PLWA        International principles of medical ethics and Nigerian codes of conduct clearly provide        for patient autonomy ie the right to informed consent and confidentiality of patient        information In addition to representing violations of human rights the denial of        treatment and breaches of informed consent and confidentiality detailed in this paper        contravene international principles of medical ethics and Nigerian health professional        codes of conduct The         Rules of Professional Conduct for Medical and Dental Practitioners in        Nigeria  states that a doctor shall preserve absolute secrecy on all he knows        about his patient even after the patient has died because of the confidence entrusted to        him The binding rules also state that practitionersmust always obtain consent of the        patient or the competent relativesbefore embarking on any special treatment procedures        with determinable risks        Nigerian medical practitioners also have a duty under these rules to report any        unethical conduct by their peers to the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria According to        the rules every doctor or dentist must be his brothers keeper with regard to the        observance and indeed the enforcement of the rules and regulations which guide the        profession Doctors and dentists should expose without fear or favour before the Medical        and Dental Council of Nigeria either directly or through the Nigerian Medical Association        any corrupt dishonest unprofessional or criminal act or omission on the part of any        doctor or dentist There is no indication that this may have happened in the case of the        breaches documented in this study At the time of publication no specific medical ethics        principles on HIV and AIDS have been articulated by the Medical and Dental Council of        Nigeria                  Limitations          The study was conducted in four states in Nigeria with a total population of           million  It is possible that these sites though chosen at random from states with          tertiary care facilities may differ significantly from others in terms of resources and          training provided to healthcare providers Although sampled systematically it is          possible that sampled facilities and healthcare professionals may differ significantly          from those that were not sampled in the four study states          Although the findings of this study can not be generalized to Nigeria as a whole it          is likely that depending on resources and training available to the healthcare sector          the level of discriminatory behavior may differ in other parts of the country          The apparent discrepancy between reported and observed behavior may indicate under or          overreporting of discriminatory behavior or may result from healthcare professionals          within the same institution having observed the same incidents          While this study focused on HIVAIDS it is possible that healthcare professionals          also engage in inappropriate behavior toward or breach the confidentiality of people with          other conditions The healthcare system in Nigeria is underfunded and suffers from          fundamental problems including material scarcity and inadequacies in infrastructure          which may contribute to this behavior overall  We did not specifically ask          clinicians to compare their treatment of patients positive for HIV with that of other          patients Even if healthcare professionals engage in breaches of confidentiality and          other inappropriate behavior toward patients with other conditions however it is likely          that the consequences of such actions may be worse for patients positive for HIV than for          patients with other conditions          Despite efforts to ensure privacy during interviews the lack of privacy or concern          about job status may have resulted in an underreporting of discriminatory behavior          andor an overreporting of correct practices or attitudes Although interviewers were          careful to explain that there would be no material gain or penalty to the respondent or          his or her facility from participation in the study the responses may have been          inaccurate if respondents judged it in their material or political interest to exaggerate          or conceal certain behaviors                          Conclusion          Despite these limitations the study documents a significant proportion of health          professionals in four states in Nigeria as reporting discriminatory attitudes and          engaging in discriminatory and unethical behavior toward patients with HIV or AIDS          including denial of care breach of confidentiality and nonconsented HIV testing The          breaches of confidentiality and testing for HIV without informed consent reported by          participants are in contravention of international principles of medical ethics  and          are also breaches of the Nigerian physician code of conduct  The study identifies          four factors that may contribute to this behavior lack of correct information and          education about HIVAIDS and prevention of infection lack of protective materials needed          for the practice of universal precautions lack of materials needed to care for and treat          patients with HIVAIDS and prevailing attitudes about PLWA This study suggests that          adequately addressing these discriminatory practices and attitudes requires targeted          education of health professionals and provision of adequate resources to healthcare          facilities combined with instituting and enforcing antidiscrimination policies
