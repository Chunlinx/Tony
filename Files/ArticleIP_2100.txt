                                 Geeks Dont Need Welfare            The multibilliondollarcomputer industry is adamant about doing things its own way insisting that thegovernment stay out of its business So why is the Clinton administrationspending  million to remedy an alleged shortage of information technologyworkers            Theinfotech worker shortfall cited by the government is documented in a recentVirginia Tech study which claims that  computerrelated jobs are goingbegging for lack of trained people This shortage said Secretary of EducationRichard Riley translates into billions of dollars in unearned wages andunrealized corporate earnings According to the Bureau of Labor Statisticsthe volume of vacant hightech positions will increase fivefold in the nextdecadebut the number of college students majoring in computer science isshrinking Today said Vice President Al Gore mournfully many employersreport difficulty in recruiting enough workers with these skills            Assuming that there is a shortage of infotechworkers the administrations  million remedy announced in January wontfix it The Clinton plan is an amalgam of several modest programs divided amongthe Commerce Education and Labor departments For comparisons sake SunMicrosystems spends  million a year on education and training Much of theeffort is little more than exhortation like the Commerce Departments plan tohold four town hall meetings to examine the shortage and discuss ways toalleviate it Other elements are only coincidentally helpful The EducationDepartment touts Pell grants and HOPE scholarships and calls for nationaltesting and better teacherswhich are no more helpful to computerrelatedbusinesses than to banks breweries or oil companies            Much ofthe administrations program is mere packagingthe rest is wellmeaningchatter notably a plan to launch an advertising campaign to convince kids thatcomputer jobs are not just for geeks anymore There is a little meat on thesebones including  million to fund local efforts to retrain dislocated workersfor informationtechnology jobs and  million for a computer job bank on theInternet But neither promises to make a dent in the supposed shortage            I keep writing about a supposed or allegedshortage because the dearth of infotech workers is an illusion Translatedinto English what the academics and bureaucrats are saying is that businessescant hire all the computer specialists they want at prevailing rates Theyresaying that businesses could make use of more of these trained workers if theywere abundant and cheapjust as I could drink Dom Perignon every night if itwere priced like Old Milwaukee When the unemployment rate is below  percentas it has been since last July a lot of industries find that hiring is notquite as easy as it used to be In a fastgrowing industry that requirestechnical skills its no shock that demand for workers is rising faster thanthe supply The cheapest way to close the gap would be to increase thenumber of essentialskilled immigrantscurrently fixed at a maximum of each yearbut the administration rejects that proposal            Fortunately there is a simple solution to the shortage higher pay Since lastSeptember salaries for new college graduates with computer science degreeshave jumped by  percent reports the Information Technology Association ofAmerica That may be painful for the companies signing the paychecks but itsgood for the youngsters who had the foresight to enter the field It alsoadvances the goal of encouraging kids to consider computer careers Whats morelikely to dispel the nerdy image of programmers and softwarewriterspublicservice commercials on TV or a big pile of cash Even if higherpay doesnt improve the image of computer jockeys it will doubtless providesufficient consolation to enable more young people to live with it Risingsalaries will also encourage midcareer adults to enroll in the nearestcommunity college to retool for a second career It should also induce firms toprovide more computer training for existing workers            The ITAA which advocates raising the visa limit says theindustry it represents cant wait for the market to fix the problem Weoperate on Internet time ITAA President Harris Miller told CongressionalQuarterly  Well everybody operates on Internet time these days The notionthat the computer industry is uniquely important is common but groundless Allsorts of industries are important to national prosperity yet the federalgovernment doesnt take on the responsibility of monitoring and adjusting theflow of workers into each one Riley claims that all those unfilled jobsrepresent lost wages and profits But the money that would be spent doesntvanish up the chimneyit ends up in paychecks and dividends in otherindustries whose products are also valued by consumers            As withmost Clinton proposals this ones modesty is meant to disarm The naturalresponse is Oh what could it hurt Not much But some students will beinduced to study computer science rather than some other subject and each oneof these gains for computerrelated businesses is a loss for other businessesA lot of the money is likely to be simply wasted though            Despite Clintons infatuation with the ideathe federal governments record in training people for better jobs is notstudded with triumphs The Job Training Partnership Act a decadeslong federalprogram appears to be almost entirely futile Its been a failure overallsays University of Chicago economist James Heckman A  survey by theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development an internationalassociation of market economies found remarkably meager support for thehypothesis that such programs are effective The best programs nearlyeveryone agrees are those conducted by companies for their own workers WhyBecause employers have strong reasons to tailor the training to assure itspractical value and to avoid wasting funds on feelgood exercises            If it makes cold economicsense to invest more in training computer workers and attracting more people tohightech jobs we can sleep easy knowing that the relentlessly rationalpropellerheads who run computerrelated businesses will do so eliminating theneed for taxpayers to do it for them Corporate welfare is a bad enough ideawithout adding the Silicon Valley gang to the rolls
