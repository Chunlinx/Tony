                                 Judge Not            Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki hasinstructed the jurors in the OJ Simpson civil trial to ignore everything thathappened in the criminal trial This makes him the judicial equivalent of theautomaticelevator operator who will not allow the passengers to press thebuttons If passengers started pressing their own buttons there would be fewerjobs for elevator operators if jurors started gathering their own informationthere would be fewer jobs for judges            Economictheory predicts that specialinterest groups will try to manipulate the rulesof the workplace to make themselves indispensable Everybody knows about unionfeatherbedding and everybody knows about complex legislationwritten bylawyersthat only lawyers can interpret But it seems to have escaped popularnotice that judges have developed the arcane rules of evidence that keep judgesin demand            Judicial featherbedding explains why judges insist onfiltering everything the jurors hear In the Simpson case in particular a lotof interesting arguments have been made and not all of them have been made inFujisakis courtroom Why would we want to shield jurors from perfectly goodreasoning just because it happens to arise not in the courtroom but in aneditorial or over the dinner table            Thestandard response of course is that we want to shield jurors from badreasoning But if we trust these people to sort out wrongheaded analysis fromsound reasoning in the courtroom how can we not trust them to do the same withthe editorial page            In fact the entire system of shielding jurorsfrom irrelevant information like past convictions in criminal trialsbetrays a disturbing inconsistency A juror who is capable of sorting throughconflicting claims from dueling DNA experts surely is capable of judging theinformational content of a past conviction            Nevertheless we allow judges to exclude evidence even though once evidencehas been introduced we trust jurors to decide how much weight it shouldreceive In other words we believe that jurors are perfectly competent todecide whether a given piece of evidence should be given a weight of  percentor  percent or  percent but not whether that same piece of evidence shouldbe given a weight of  percent I can think of no set of beliefs about thelimits of jurors competence that would recommend such a policy            Either jurors are capable of deciding how much weight toassign a given bit of evidence or theyre not If they are capable then by allmeans show them all the evidence and let them ignore what they think isirrelevant If they are not capable then why do we have juries in thefirst place Either we have a very muddled view of what jurors can accomplishor the system has been devised to serve the interests of judges and lawyers whothrive on confusion            Im nottalking about things like the exclusionary rule which prohibits jurors fromseeing evidence that was gathered illegally The exclusionary rule serves aclear purpose by discouraging overzealous police officers from inappropriatebehavior Whether that benefit is worth its cost in terms of false acquittalsis arguable but at least there is a clear benefit By contrast thelimited admissibility of legally acquired evidence serves no apparentpurpose except to generate motions by lawyers rulings by judges and groundsfor appeals            You might think that without judges tocarefully control the flow of evidence jurors would drown in a sea ofirrelevant informationand trials would go on forever But that problem issolved most efficiently by having lawyers pay in cash for excessive use ofcourtroom time not by the long and costly process of motions and appeals            The juryselection processis another good example of judicial makework The officers of the court go toenormous lengths to choose unbiased jurors But what is so desirable about theabsence of biasand of the informed speculation that might have led to thatbias At election time we are not urged to avoid the media so as to remainunbiased until we get to the voting booth Isnt it inconsistent to prefer botha wellinformed electorate and an ignorant jury            Sometimes apparently jurors are chosen not just for specific ignorance ofthe case but for general ignorance of the world around them I have a friendwho was excluded from a jury because he answered yes to the question Do youthink a man whos been arrested is more likely to be guilty than a man whohasnt been arrested Presumably his place was taken by another juror whoreally believes that the police arrest people completely at random            Jurors are kept offbalanceand in need of additionalguidance from the benchby the judge who instructs them to convict if thedefendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt without telling them whether areasonable doubt consists of a  percent risk of error a  percent risk oferror or a  percent risk of error Lawyers scoff at the notion that doubtcan be quantified so precisely Their scoffing is justified but its alsoirrelevant It is true that no juror can be sure whether his or her doubt ismore or less than  percent but it is equally true that no juror can be surewhether his or her doubt is more or less than reasonable With a quantifiedtarget jurors would at least know what to aim for even if they cant be sureof hitting it            Its crazy to think thatjurors who are unsure about two criteria what is a reasonable doubtand does my own doubt exceed that level will be more accurate than jurors whoare unsure about only one criterion does my doubt exceed  percentAnd quantified standards have the added advantage of flexibilitythey can beadjusted to different levels for different crimes But judges whose jobsdepend on judicial procedures being impenetrable convoluted andselfcontradictory systematically conceal what they are thinking of when theyuse the phrase reasonable doubt            The entirepurpose of legal tradition and precedent is to make outcomes predictable Butjudges have both the motive and the opportunity to contort tradition andprecedent in ways that render outcomes illogical and un predictableRespect for the law is enshrined in our culture but it should not blind us tothe possibility that the law can be corrupted to serve sordid ends
