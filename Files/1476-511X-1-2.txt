                    Background        The presence and abundance of long chain polyunsaturated        fatty acids LCPUFA in humans diets have been the basis        of scientific investigations for decades Studies have yet        to resolve all the mechanisms of action of LCPUFA in        particular the remarkable phenotypic differences between        populations that consume different quantities of fish and        fish oil in their diets         Dietary LCPUFA        affect processes including growth neurological        development lean and fat mass accretion reproduction        innate and acquired immunity infectious pathologies of        viruses bacteria and parasites and the incidence and        severity of virtually all chronic and degenerative diseases        including cancer atherosclerosis stroke arthritis        diabetes osteoporosis and neurodegenerative        inflammatory and skin diseases          Due to        lack of mechanistic knowledge predictions for optimal        intake of nutritionally important LCPUFA remain vague and        dietary recommendations simply relate to prevention of        overt deficiency There is not even scientific consensus on        whether LCPUFA present in human milk should be included in        infant formulas            The most often cited action of n LCPUFA is that they        induce alterations in eicosanoids by antagonizing the        primary substrate of eicosanoid metabolism arachidonic        acid AA     Certainly n LCPUFA replace AA in        cellular membranes to some extent and alter eicosanoid        products but is this the primary mechanism underlying the        benefits of consuming fish The n LCPUFA alter        postprandial lipoprotein production and clearance and        lower circulating triglyceriderich lipoproteins            N LCPUFA induce alterations in membrane properties        including ion transport trafficking and vesicular        transport and alter the transcription of genes encoding        proteins in lipid biosynthesis lipid desaturation and        lipid oxidation                Fish oil contains among others docosahexaenoic acid        DHA n and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA n as        important components The concentration of DHA in the        retina and neurological membranes suggests a specific role        for DHA in the brain However neither the mechanism of        uptake nor the precise role of DHA in the brain is        currently well understood     Rigorous elimination of        DHA and its precursor n from animal diets leads to        limited but significant phenotypic effects     The        basic biochemical pathway of DHA biosynthesis from its        precursor n is still being resolved     The EPA        component of fish oil is linked to antiinflammatory        antithrombotic and generally eicosanoidmediated effects        by antagonizing AA metabolism        Arachidonic acid AA n either formed from n        precursors in mammals or obtained directly from the diet        is believed to exert most of its biological activity via        conversion to various eicosanoids N LCPUFA and        especially AA are also now recognized to elicit        significant physiological effects when consumed in the        diet The lack of significant commercial sources of AA has        limited the study of this fatty acid FA as a dietary        ingredient until relatively recently Due to the        commercialization of fungal biomass production to produce        very high levels of AA as a storage oil it is now possible        to study this FA        Until recently LCPUFA effects on gene transcription        were thought primarily to be mediated by a single subfamily        of orphan nuclear receptors  peroxisome proliferator        activated receptors PPARs however it is now becoming        evident that FAs can affect many different genes either via        direct interactions or indirectly through additional        transcription factors including hepatic nuclear        HNF nuclear factor  NF retinoid X receptor         RXR sterol regulatory element binding proteinc        SREBPc and liver X receptors LXR and LXR            Indeed the enthusiasm for uncovering the biological        pathways underlying the beneficial actions of LCPUFA has        revealed a story that is increasingly more complex than        originally supposed     thereby making microarray        technology an ideal platform to further decipher the many        roles of these nutritional lipids        In the present work mice were fed control diets        adequate in n and n but lacking LCPUFA or a        diet enriched in fungal oil FUNG enriched in AA the n        elongation and desaturation product of n or a diet        containing fish oil FISH enriched in n and n        the major n LCPUFA elongation and desaturation products        of n or a diet containing both fungal oil and fish        oil FUNGFISH Thereafter gene expression profiling was        performed on two organs in parallel with quantitative        metabolic profiling of a broad spectrum of liver FAs        Tissues of interest were liver the major lipid        metabolizing tissue and brain the major neurological        tissue and principal site for accumulation and        functionality of DHA and other fish oil components The        hippocampus brain region was specifically chosen because of        its importance in memory and learning     Liver and        brain are metabolically connected organs as both AA and DHA        cross the blood brain barrier via several possible        carriers Diets were fed for  days to study chronic and        sustained alterations in control of gene expression rather        than acute effects                    Results and discussion                  Body weight feed intake and incorporation of          dietary LCPUFA into tissue membranes          Mice were fed relatively low fat diets to minimize the          accretion of body fat and to avoid the confounding          effects that LCPUFA rich diets are known to exert on          the progression of obesity Body weight and the change in          body weight d minus d were not affected by dietary          FA modulation            p   Feed intake data showed          no significant differences amongst groups classic ANOVA          considering the cages and diets as cofactors           p   There were also no          obvious differences in brain and liver weights            p   By these criteria          differences in gene expression and metabolic profiles          described herein were judged to be linked to the FAs          present in FUNG and FISH oils on healthy normal weight          animals          The incorporation of n and n following          feeding of the AArich FUNG diet and the incorporation          of n n and n following feeding of the          EPADHArich FISH diet into whole brain hippocampal          and hepatic phospholipid PL pools Table  was further          evidence the diets were consumed resulting in          significant changes to PL acyl composition Fish oil          feeding is well established to increase n LCPUFA in          hepatic PL as well as whole brain PL     whereas          deficiency of n LCPUFA can decrease n in          hippocampal PL     DHA present in the brain can be          formed from precursors in the liver or astrocytes and          intact DHA passes the blood brain barrier via selective          transport mechanisms     These data confirm that          diets did result in actual increases in the brain of the          appropriate FAs and set the stage for interpreting          transcriptional responses observed in each organ          Importantly our lipid profiling data revealed that          FUNG and FISH FAs were not identically incorporated into          individual PL in the two organs studied partly shown in          Table  and this may affect subsequent transcription          factor signaling For example there was consistently          more AA accumulating in various hepatic PL than in the          hippocampus following AA feeding and more DHA          accumulated in hepatic cardiolipin CL than in          hippocampal CL whereas the reverse was true for          phosphatidylserinephosphatidylinositol PSPI Thus          there are several explanations for why FUNG FISH and          FUNGFISH feeding resulted in different transcriptional          profiles in liver and hippocampus as discussed          subsequently                          Gene Expression analysis          Differentially expressed genes induced by the dietary          treatments were selected using a limit fold change LFC          model in addition to a more conventional confidence          interval test     Genes that satisfied the  LFC          model and which lay above the  confidence interval          of pooled replicates were selected as differentially          expressed It should also be noted that for the liver          data interindividual variation was examined All genes          selected as differentially expressed using pooled data in          the liver also laid outside the  confidence interval          when compared to individual mouse variability thereby          lending additional confidence to the selection method          used with both the liver and hippocampus data According          to these criteria which involves examining all possible          pairwise comparisons between the four diets  and           differentially expressed genes were selected in the liver          and hippocampus respectively In the present document          genes that are discussed are followed by parentheses          indicating fold changes according to the following          convention FUNG versus control diet FISH versus control          diet and FUNGFISH versus control diet           eg Gpc    Those          fold changes that are significant by the  LFC model are          further identified with an asterisk  It is important          to note that the nature of the LFC model allows          differentially expressed genes to be selected based on          differences between the treatments and therefore          explains why some genes discussed in the text have no          fold changes marked with an asterisk as significance was          observed between treatments and not versus the control          diet All liver genes discussed in the present          manuscript are found in Figure green dots and lie          within the range of validation data black squares The          high degree of concordance between RTPCR and microarray          data  reported in detail elsewhere              establishes a certain level of confidence in the results          discussed throughout this manuscript          To understand the trends in transcriptional response          within and between the two organs studied genes were          annotated using GO classifications a dynamic          structured yet precisely defined system which          characterizes genes based on defined categories of          molecular function biological process and cellular          component     Since the GO classifications contain          several thousand descriptors many differentially          expressed genes had a unique annotation Record counts          for most GO identifiers were not high although a number          of significant trends were observable Venn diagrams were          constructed for the top  GO descriptors for each          category according to record count to visualize broad          transcriptional responses induced by dietary LCPUFA          Figure  The interpretation of transcriptomic data          especially that stemming from a nutritional study such as          this benefits greatly from such a classification system          The diverse wholebody effects of LCPUFA render          individual gene interpretation difficult however          considering groups of genes reveals preliminary          information concerning the biological mechanisms          responding to the addition of dietary LCPUFA          The GO analysis and specific gene expression patterns          were interpreted to indicate that LCPUFAenriched oils          affected liver metabolism through the regulation of genes          directly involved in FA metabolism and lipid          bindingtransport Figure  as previously reported in          rats     When examining GO classifications for the          hippocampus such descriptors as cell signaling and cell          cycle control are seen in response to dietary LCPUFA          This result was expected as the two organs have very          different biochemical roles and import dietary FA via          distinctly different means The tissue functions were          reflected in the transcriptomic profile Although there          were relatively few overlapping functions between the two          organs the most prominent overlapping function indicated          that LCPUFA was affecting genes related to transcription          and DNARNAbinding                          Hepatic gene expression analysis and transcription          factor signatures          It is difficult to interpret transcriptional profiling          data alone since dimerization posttranslational          modifications relative quantities of coactivators and          corepressors and the formation of multiple          transcriptional complexes binding to common promoter          regions ultimately determines the binding activation          potential of transcription factors Nevertheless          clustering analysis of differentially regulated genes          revealed numerous genes known to be regulated by specific          transcription factors thereby enabling several          transcription factor signatures to be established These          signatures then provide clues concerning the various          pathways through which FA may effect gene transcription          Additionally FUNG and FISH diets regulated some          transcription factors not Table  previously associated          with these dietary oils thereby indicating novel LCPUFA          mediated molecular mechanisms of action These include          Spot Thrsp

focus will be on transcription factors          previously identified as mediators of LCPUFA actions          such as PPARs SREBP and HNFs                          Hepatic peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors          PPARs          PPARs are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated          by micromolar concentrations of various FAs and FA          analogues such as fibrates and thiazolidinediones              This subfamily can be divided into three isotypes          designated PPAR PPAR and PPAR each with          tissuespecific expression PPARs form heterodimers with          retinoid X receptor RXR and interact with the          peroxisome proliferator response element PPREs in gene          promoters PPREs are direct repeats DR of a          hexanucleotide sequence AGGTCA separated by one          nucleotide and are therefore referred to as a DR          response element     PPAR and PPAR play critical          roles in the catabolism and storage of FA whereas the          function of PPAR is less certain PPAR is the          predominant PPAR subtype expressed in liver as confirmed          presently The other two subtypes were not likely          expressed in the mouse liver as negative values were          obtained with the Affymetrix software PPAR is reported          to regulate genes involved in FA transport synthesis and          oxidation glucose and lipid metabolism ketogenesis and            and desaturation              In spite of dramatic differences in the expression of          a variety of PPARresponsive genes PPAR gene expression          itself was quite constant in all mice analyzed as          previously reported     This constancy of PPAR          expression indicates that differences in the          transcription of genes containing a PPRE are likely due          to the direct activation of PPARs Feeding our diets          affected various genes containing a PPRE with roles in

VII IX X have been          previously found to be induced by PPARs     but were          not transcriptionally regulated in the present          experiment          A recent study examined effects of PPARspecific          induction in murine livers using cDNA microarrays              Despite the different strain of mice examined          CBLJ and the different genomic technology utilized          for the examination of differentially expressed genes          cDNA microarrays several genes were found          differentially regulated in both experiments indicating          that the PPAR agonist and LCPUFA affect gene expression          through similar pathways Genes such as Cd Cypb          Hmgcs and Ech were induced more than fold when          Wy a PPARspecific agonist was administered to          mice for  weeks These transcripts were similarly          regulated in the current study providing further          indication that many of the differentially expressed          genes were likely PPARactivated          Preliminary evidence suggests preferred ligands for          PPAR activation are  C and  C FAs as FAs shorter          than  C or longer than  C will not fit correctly into          the PPAR binding pocket and stabilize the AF helix              The net effect would be that PPAR coactivators are          not recruited to relax nucleosomal DNA and allow          transcription machinery to interact with various promoter          elements Therefore DHA n may require          retroconversion via oxidation to an  C or  C          LCPUFA prior to activating PPARs      Without the          use of purified FA it is difficult to distinguish whether          the DHA in our fish oil preparation was retroconverted          since the fish oil also provided the retroconversion          products n and n Table  Likewise AA was          not provided as a pure FA component making comparisons to          the control to detect retroconversion difficult However          earlier work clearly shows that both DHA and AA can be          retroconverted to  carbon shortened intermediates                          Hepatic sterol regulatory elementbinding proteins          SREBPs          SREBPs are critically important basic helixloop helix          bHLH transcription factors activated in response to          variations in intracellular cholesterol levels that          induce transcription of genes with sterol regulatory          element SRE and Ebox containing promoters Within the          SREBP promoter element the liver X receptor          LXRresponsive elements LXRE may have an important          role     LCPUFA may affect SREBPc mediated          transcription via several mechanisms One mechanism is to          antagonize activation of the LXR receptor leading to          fewer LXRRXR heterodimer complexes to bind the LXRE in          the SREBPc promoter and less SREBPcmediated          transcription of SREcontaining genes     The PPAR          signaling cascade intertwines with SREBP pathways since          LCPUFA also activate PPAR which can induce LXR          expression              In the present experiment saturated FA replaced AA          and DHA to equilibrate total fat content Yoshikawa           et al    found AA to be more          potent than DHA saturated and monounsaturated being          ineffective at inhibiting activation of SREBPc          promoter and LXRE enhancer constructs induced by          coexpression of LXR or  An increase in transcription          of SREBP may be associated with increased levels of the          active SREBP protein          Numerous hepatic genes containing SRE promoters were          regulated by LCPUFA in the present experiments          including SREBP itself consistent

metabolism and transport Fpps and ketone body          formation mitochondrial Hmgcs It is evident that          genes containing a PPRE have roles in FA oxidation but          not FA synthesis whereas the converse is true for genes          containing SRE promoters          Several genes that may contain SRE promoters such as          SREBP and Acly and Elovl and Cd were found in the          same cluster However similar to PPREcontaining genes          not all SREcontaining genes coclustered indicating          that not all SREcontaining genes were regulated          identically by the three LCPUFA diets Overall the          number of regulated genes with SREs and PPREs indicates          the breadth of molecular responses to dietary LCPUFA          many of which appear to be coorchestrated not only by          these two transcription factors but by additional          elements as well          Hepatic SREBP was down regulated with FISH and          FUNGFISH but importantly not affected with FUNG             Thus chronic AA feeding alone does not          appear in our experiments to interact with the SREBP          signaling cascade It is not clear how AA is handled          differently in the liver to prevent its interaction with          SREBP The probe set in the Affymetrix Murine  k chip          could not differentiate between the a and c splicing          variants of SREBP There was however high sequence          identity  between the probe set sequence and rat          ADD mRNA the murine homologue of human SREBPc The          SREBPcADD isoform regulates transcription of genes          involved in FA biosynthesis and desaturation              SREBPc in addition to interacting with SREs binds          Ebox containing promoters     Ebox containing          promoters were not examined so the current data analysis          could have underestimated SREBPlinked effects Some          Ebox or bHLH binding factors activate the same genes as          SREBP For example both upstream stimulating factor          USF an Ebox binding factor and SREBP bind the FA          synthase Fasn Ebox     Hepatic Usf transcription          was significantly down regulated with FISH but not          affected by FUNG or the combination diet using          microarrays but this result could not fully be confirmed          using RTPCR    with microarray             with RTPCR          The NFY transcription factor adds further complexity          to transcriptional regulation since it can interact and          modulate the expression of SREBPc target genes          containing Ybox motifs such as those found in Fasn              Mutating the NFY binding site in Fasn relieved          LCPUFAinduced Fasn down regulation     Nfyb was          differentially expressed after dietary LCPUFA addition             Although no significant changes were          observed between dietary treatments and control diet a          significant difference was observed between the FUNG and          FISH diets Thus LCPUFA could have induced a joint          SREBPcNFY effect on common promoter elements                          Hepatic nuclear factors HNFs          Hepatic nuclear factors have been recognized to be          transcription factors mediating the transcription of a          variety of genes putatively involved in energy          metabolism HNFs may compete with PPARs for binding to          DR elements Thus LCPUFA can activate PPARRXR          leading to displacement of HNF from PPRE or be          converted to CoA derivatives which in turn can suppress          HNF transcriptional activity Alternatively these          transcription factors may respond differently to chronic          versus acute administration of LCPUFA          Hnf was not differentially regulated in the current          experiment The related transcription factor HNF          winged helix protein fork head Foxa was however down          regulated  fold with FUNGFISH but not with the          individual LCPUFA HNF protein may be involved in          etiology of obesity hyperlipidemia and diabetes by          regulating glucagon transcription insulin resistance          and pancreatic  cell function      To our          knowledge the regulation of hepatic HNF expression by          LCPUFA has not been previously reported          HNFsignaling may regulate transcription of Pck up          regulated ca  fold with each diet presently and          Gpc differentially regulated in the current experiment              HNF is also reported to increase transcription          of several genes that were not differentially regulated          in the present experiment including transferrin          tyrosine amino transferase     and IPFPDX                                       Hepatic fatty acid synthesis          In the cytoplasm FA synthesis is controlled via Acly          acetyl CoA carboxylase ACC and Fasn The Acly reaction          enhances FA synthesis by providing more acetyl CoA and          NADPH substrates and enhancing ACC activity The malonyl          CoA generated in the ACC reaction then inhibits FA          oxidation by reversibly inhibiting Cpt          It has previously been shown that the Acly gene in          human cultured hepatic cells has a regulatory region from           to  in the  flanking region similar to that of          Fasn which is responsive to insulin and LCPUFA              In the present experiment there was coordinated down          regulation of both Acly between  and  fold          regulation for four different probe sets and Fasn             FUNG and FISH were not statistically          significant from one another but each was significantly          different with the combination diet It is intriguing          that in general both Acly and Fasn were more strongly          down regulated with the combination diet than the          individual LCPUFA This synergy represents just one of          the many unexpected findings revealed with a          transcriptomic approach Although ACC was not regulated          at the transcriptional level cytoplasmic citrate          generated from the Acly reaction is an allosteric          activator of ACC so less cytoplasmic citrate would lead          to less activation of ACC     Transcript levels of          hepatic acetyl CoA synthetase  AMP forming acetateCoA          ligase AMP forming Acas were consistently down          regulated by LCPUFA    This enzyme          typically has specificity for  C FA chain lengths In          the liver intestine adipose and mammary gland the          cytoplasmic form synthesizes acetyl CoA for lipogenesis              It is regulated by SREBPa c and  as well          as SP and SP binding to GCboxes the promoter also          contains an Ebox     It is down regulated with          fasting and induced with refeeding such dietary          regulation does not exist in SREBP knockout mice              More generally acyl CoA synthase is reported to be          PPARactivated     The observed down regulation is          consistent with less acetyl CoA available for the ACC          reaction as well as a plethora of other reactions          Overall it is plausible that both FUNG and FISH feeding          decreased FA synthesis in the current experiment                          Hepatic FA oxidaton          As described above Acly expression and possibly ACC          activity was significantly down regulated by LCPUFAs          likely leading to less FA synthesis Malonyl CoA inhibits          FA oxidation by reversibly inhibiting Cpt Cpt          transfers acyl residues from CoA to carnitine in the          intermembrane space of the inner mitochondrial membrane          and has a regulatory role in controlling hepatic          oxidation     Cpt transfers carnitinoyl residues          to CoA in the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation          Carnitine acetyltransferase Crat may have the same role          as CPT but with specificity for  C units          Mitochondrial Cpt    Cpt             and Crat    were all up regulated by          LCPUFA but the three LCPUFA were not identical in this          regard For example Crat expression was significantly up          regulated  fold with FISH treatment but was less          effected with FUNG and the combination diet          AcylCoenzyme A dehydrogenase catalyzes the first step          in mitochondrial oxidation converting acylCoA to          transenoyl CoA Isoforms with specificity for short          medium and long chain FA exist Mediumchain          acylCoenzyme A dehydrogenase Acadm was up regulated          particularly with the combination diet                      Dienoyl CoA isomerase also known as   dienoyl          CoA isomerase Ech transcripts converts double bonds to                    trans bonds during oxidation of          LCPUFA Ech was significantly up regulated with FISH          alone    consistent with the need to          isomerize numerous double bonds during oxidation It is          not clear why FUNG did not also up regulate transcripts          as LCPUFA are generally reported to up regulate this          isomerase     The present data generally suggest          LCPUFA increased FA oxidation by down regulating Acly          and up regulating Cpt and  Ech and Acadm However          FUNG FISH and FUNGFISH did not affect regulation of          these transcripts identically                          Hepatic carbohydrate metabolism          Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Pck is the          ratelimiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis and most of its          activity is regulated transcriptionally Feeding of all          three LCPUFA diets led to an increase in hepatic Pck          transcription indicating gluconeogenesis was favored          over glycolysis Specifically four probe sets with high          sequence similarity to rat Pck accession numbers          AA AA AA AA demonstrated          differential gene expression for the mouse Pck          homologue The signaling pathways affecting Pck          transcription are discussed in the section cAMP          signalinglinks to carbohydrate metabolism          Gpc converts glucose phosphate to free glucose          during gluconeogenesis Gpc was unaffected with FUNG          significantly up regulated  fold with FISH          consistent with up regulated gluconeogenesis but down          regulated  fold with the combination diet             Rat Gpc has HNF consensus binding sites              In HeLa cells and HepG hepatoma cells PUFA          down regulated Gpc possibly via inhibition of HNF           promoter activity     In our current mouse          experiment the transcriptional effects of LCPUFA on          Gpc may thus have been HNF or PPAR mediated                          Hepatic cAMP signalinglinks to carbohydrate          metabolism          cAMP is an important signaling molecule that can be          found in specific cellular domains     Levels are          controlled through synthesis via adenylate cyclase and          degradation via phosphodiesterases PDEs Calmodulin          PDEs CaMPDEs are sensitive to calmodulin and calcium          up regulation     cAMP can then affect cell          signaling via interactions with the regulatory subunits          of cAMP activated kinases including protein kinase A          leading to their subsequent activation and via binding          of cAMP response element binding proteins CREBs to cAMP          response elements CREs or cAMP response units CRU          consisting of CREs          In the liver cAMP regulates Pck transcription via          the binding of CREB as well as CCAATenhancer binding          protein CEBP to the CRU The Pck promoter can thus          exist in altered states of cAMP responsiveness depending          on the transcription factors bound to CRU elements              In hepatocytes SREBPc can block transcriptional          induction of cAMP on PEPCKC metabolic action                       In the present study liver CamPde c was not          regulated by FUNG and FISH feeding alone but was          significantly up regulated  fold with FUNGFISH          together A calciumcalmodulindependent protein kinase           CKII Camkb was not affected with FUNG feeding or the          combination diet but was significantly down regulated           fold with FISH alone CKII is a calmodulin target          in the brain involved in synaptic plasticity In the          liver CKII may be associated with SAG protein sensitive          to apoptosis gene and phosphorylate it SAG in turn has          a role in preventing oxidation by inhibiting cytochrome c          release and caspase activation Further CKII may          activate CPT via cytoskeletal phosphorylation of          cytokeratin Thus an activation of CKII may lead to          increased oxidation and antioxidant protection Feeding          of all three LCPUFA diets led to an approximately           fold increase in hepatic Pck for each probe set          identified          Overall LCPUFA may up regulate Pck the          ratelimiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis via cAMP          SREBP andor PPARsignaling     This has the          overall effect of limiting fat accumulation and shunting          metabolic flux to gluconeogenesis In a molecular sense          FUNG and FISH feeding mimics or accentuates the fasted          metabolic state                          Hepatic Cytochrome p metabolism of          LCPUFA          There are at least  cytochrome p gene families          Cyps with four hepatic types Cyps  that          metabolize foreign compounds and lipophilic substrates          including hormones FAs drugs and xenobiotics Cyp           transcription is activated when cytosolic hydrocarbons          activate the Ah receptor which then translocates to the          nucleus and heterodimerizes with Arnt leading to binding          to an upstream xenobiotic response element on Cyp  Cyps           are induced through nuclear hormone receptors          Phenobarbitol and phenobarbitollike substances activate          CARRXR heterodimers CAR constitutive androstane          receptor that bind DR response elements on the Cyp           promoter Cyps  and  are activated by PXRRXR PXR          pregnane X receptor and PPARRXR respectively also          binding DR response elements in both cases          Nine hepatic cytochrome p family members were          differentially regulated by LCPUFA Cypa Cypa          Cypb Cypa Cypa Cypa Cypa Cypf and          Por Two broad clusters hierarchical clustering alone          and  specific clusters hierarchical and           k means clustering of          coexpression exist within this subset indicating          transcriptional coregulation Table  Furthermore          additional specific clusters were close to each other          indicating only a fine split in expression behavior          across diets          Cyps a  and  are specifically involved in           FA hydroxylation     Cypa             with microarray    with RTPCR and          Cypa    were both up regulated by          LCPUFA The murine P a is highly homologous to rat          A and A Rat A and A and murine a are          reported to  hydroxylate C and n whereas          murine a hydroxylates only C     Levels of          hydroxylated FA were not examined Changes in other          hepatic cytochrome p genes are included in Table                                    Hepatic desaturation of LCPUFA          As previously noted SCD is an important enzyme          whose transcription is mediated by both PPAR and          SREBPmediated signaling     SCD introduces           cis double bonds at position C in          FA chains It has preferred substrate specificity for          C but will also desaturate other saturated chain          lengths FUNGFISH showed a significant down regulation          of transcripts    with microarray             with RTPCR In this instance the          microarray indicated no change with FUNG however RTPCR          indicated an up regulation This may be expected as          RTPCR is more sensitive than microarrays It is          important to note however that changes deemed          significant by the microarray were also confirmed to be          significant by RTPCR as is the case for FUNGFISH          induced changes in Scd The transcriptional changes in          Scd expression were in some cases consistent with a          marker for apparent decreased enzymatic activity namely          the ratios of FA in hepatic PL pools with a  double          bondsame FA without a  double bond Table  For          example in PSPI and phosphatidylethanolamine PE the          ratio of n and n was lowest for the          FUNGFISH diet                          Hepatic elongation of LCPUFA          There are suggestions in the literature that FA          elongation may also be controlled by transcription factor          signaling The elongase Elovl may contain an SRE and          therefore be under the transcriptional control of SREBP              Due to observations in the metabolite data which          suggests a repression of elongase activity the dietary          regulation of Elovl and Elovl was focused on          Changes in genes with known elongase activity were          examined The yeast gene Elo is associated with          elongating FAs with  to  C yet this activity is          often masked by cytosolic FA synthase activity              Evidence shows Elovl elongates FA to C and Elovl          elongates FA to C with preference for converting FA          from C to C in yeast              The probe set for Elovl was down regulated          particularly with FISH and the combined diet             consistent with some of the lipid data          described below whereas the probe set for Elovl was not          affected by FUNG up regulated with FISH and down          regulated although not significantly with the          combination diet    An NCBI BLAST search          identified the murine homologue of yeast ELO Elovl to          be Ssc Sequence similarity to Cig predominating in          liver and testes     complementation studies in          yeast mutants indicated the functional equivalent of ELO          Elovl is Ssc     Substrates of mouse Ssc were          AA and EPA DHA was not tested     Thus FUNG and          FISH feeding may transcriptionally regulate their          subsequent conversion to elongated products          Our metabolic data showed evidence that elongase          activities may have been altered by LCPUFA feeding          There was reduced conversion of  to C FA following          LCPUFA feeding Specifically the ratio of C in          phosphatidylcholine PC PSPI PE and ether PE was          decreased by FISH Table  The ratio of nn          in sphingomyelin was decreased by FUNG and FUNGFISH in          PC PE and CL only FUNG feeding decreased the          nn ratio There was also possible reduced          conversion of C to C FA and C to C FA The          ratios of  in sphingomyelin and PSPI          nn in PSPI and CL nn in PC PE          and CL and nn in PC and PE were all reduced          by FISH whereas FUNG had either a neutral effect or          partly reversed effects seen with FISH with exception of          CL nn ratio                          Hepatic Lipid Transport of FAs          Transcription factors such as PPARs and SREBPs are          also known to have an effect on various lipid transport          genes Hepatic Abca Abca and Abce were differentially          regulated however their roles in the liver are not          precisely known Several members of the ATPbinding          cassette ABC superfamily such as Abca are induced          via PPAR and LXR activation     Abca has been          shown to play a role in reverse cholesterol pathways and          may be linked to HDL deficiency in metabolic syndromes              In macrophages n and AA increased ABCA          protein degradation without affecting transcriptional          levels     In the current study Abca was          significantly decreased by FUNG and FISH          FA translocase Cd was significantly up regulated          with FISH alone    Cd coclustered          with EFABP Apoe Apoc and Abce transcript all          involved in FA and sterol transport CD protein          mediates long chain free FA uptake in adipocytes and          other tissues including liver In murine preadipocytes          it is transcriptionally up regulated by long chain free          FAs via a PPARmediated process     Approaches          using antisense technology null mice transgenic mice          and microarrays revealed important additional roles of          CD protein as a receptor for thrombospondin collagen          type I and oxidized LDL on macrophages     The up          regulation of Cd with FISH and antagonism in presence          of FUNG merits further study          FA binding proteins FABPs are small cytosolic          proteins with virtually identical backbone structures          that facilitate the solubility and intracellular          transport of FAs EFABP is found in liver and other          organs     but it has been most studied in psoriatic          skin lesions    where it has putative roles in FA          cytoplasmic transport skin barrier function and          keratinocyte differentiation     Although links          between PPARs and EFABP have not currently been          identified this gene clustered with other known          PPARaffected genes suggesting a possibly important          regulatory link Purified EFABP has five fold higher          affinity for  than for n and n n not          studied     Herein hepatic EFABP expression          Fabp transcript was down regulated by all three diets             with microarray             with RTPCR The significance of this large          decrease in hepatic expression by both FUNG and FISH and          particularly the combination of the two is a potentially          important finding whose physiological consequence must be          further investigated Whether LCPUFA induces the same          decrease in Fabp in psoriatic skin is not known to our          knowledge N LCPUFA particularly n are known to          be of clinical benefit in treating psoriasis                              Hepatic cholesterol metabolism ketogenesis and          apolipoproteins          Mitochondrial Hmgcs which is involved in          ketogenesis was up regulated particularly with the          combination diet    Mitochondrial Hmgcs          is known to be induced by PPAR activation in experiments          with hepatocytes      The cytosolic form involved          in cholesterol biosynthesis was not affected Fpps was          consistently down regulated    across          diets which could lead to reduced cholesterol synthesis          cholesterol synthesis and plasma cholesterol levels were          not determined Oils rich in DHA such as fish oil have          cholesterol and triacylglycerol lowering properties                       LCPUFA altered expression of various apolipoproteins          Apolipoprotein C Apoc was only down regulated with          FUNG alone    Apolipoprotein E Apoe was          only up regulated with FISH alone             There was consistent up regulation with all three LCPUFA          diets of an EST expressed sequence tag highly similar          to human apolipoprotein B ApoB precursor             Both apolipoprotein C Apoc             and apolipoprotein A Apoa described in detail          below were consistently down regulated across diets          Apoe and Apoc and Apoa and Apoc were similarly          coexpressedcoclustered across diets When clustered          with genes in the more general transport category          categories of coexpressed genes with underlying roles in          lipid and sterol transport were evident For example          Apoe and Apoc coclustered with Abce and Cd and          Apoa and Apoc coclustered with Abca and Fabp          FUNG and FISH alone moderately down regulated Apoa          whereas the combination diet resulted in a large down          regulation    with microarray             with RTPCR A similar trend was seen for          Apoa precursor transcript    ApoAIV          protein is an antiatherogenic component of highdensity          lipoprotein HDL particles and is also found in very          lowdensity lipoproteins and chylomicrons     It is          involved in cholesterol absorption lowdensity          lipoprotein LDL clearance as a cofactor for hepatic          lipase increasing dolichol acylation and increasing PE          but not PC hydrolysis FUNG and FISH may decrease Apoa          expression through PPAR      and in the current          experiment LCPUFA may have affected PPAR          transactivation and signaling ApoAIV activity could also          be affected by diet induced structural changes to          membrane PL in lipoprotein particles as Apoa          intercalates with PC in model membranes     The          biological consequences of reduced Apoa transcription          particularly with the combination diet merits further          investigation Rodents fed low cholesterol diets as in          the present study carry most of their cholesterol in the          HDL fraction and under these conditions fish oil          feeding reduces cholesterol from the HDL fraction so the          above mentioned changes in apolipoproteins although          fascinating must be interpreted within the context of          the chosen models                          FISH and FUNGmediated effects in the          Hippocampus          In the present study  differentially expressed          genes were identified in the hippocampus using a  LFC          model The trend in the data was similar to that seen          with liver data as shown in Figure see Materials and          Methods for details These data revealed that the          consumption of dietary oils led to differences in the          expression of a broad range of hippocampal genes that          have been previously indicated to be involved in cell          signaling and signal transduction including cation          transport calcium binding protein phosphorylation          protein kinases and ATP and GTPbinding as revealed by          examining GO identifiers across all of the dietregulated          genes Figure  In striking contrast to the liver a          number of hippocampal LCPUFAinduced differentially          expressed genes had annotations suggesting immune related          functions as well as general defense responses specific          to the hippocampus including MHCinteracting proteins          lymphocyte antigens immunoglobulins and defense          response Additionally there were numerous ontological          assignments for genes which suggested dietary LCPUFA          feeding affected cell cycle control including the          following categories

inhibitor of DNA          binding  Idb D site albumin promoter binding protein          Dbp paired box gene  Pax and the ELK member of          the ETS oncogene family Although dietary LCPUFA          activated numerous transcriptional factors in both liver          and hippocampus it is a noteworthy difference that the          transcriptional signatures for PPAR SREBP and HNF could          not be detected in the hippocampal dataset          The interpretation of all  hippocampal transcripts          is beyond the scope of the current manuscript but all          raw data is deposited at the NCBI gene expression Omnibus              The present data provides evidence that LCPUFA          were incorporated into brain and hippocampal tissues as          previously discussed and thereby influenced novel          signaling pathways via receptor interactions Some of          these signaling pathways are highlighted below                          Hippocampal signaling pathways affected by dietary          LCPUFA                      Transthyretin signaling            Thyroid hormones including transthyretin are            generally involved in neuronal proliferation and            differentiation and are required for normal            cytoskeletal assembly Transthyretin is specifically            involved in transporting thyroxine T and            retinolbinding protein in cerebrospinal fluid and            brain serum AA has been found to bind transthyretin            and inhibit thyroxin associations                Transthyretin may also sequester  amyloid thereby            having neuroprotective properties Dietary FISH had the            effect of decreasing Ttr whereas FUNG and            particularly the combination diet increased Ttr               Similar to our findings in mice feeding            rats fish oil significantly decreased Ttr expression in            whole brain  fold     Interestingly feeding of                        Ginkgo biloba extract publicized            to affect mental function in mice increased            hippocampal Ttr     Levels of transthyretin and            associations of transthyretin with thyroxine and            retinolbinding protein should be assessed in future            LCPUFA feeding experiments                                hydroxytryptamine signaling            Dietary LCPUFA may affect hydroxytryptamine            serotonin HT signaling Specifically              N acylethanolamine can displace            binding of ligands to HT receptors     and            displace HT              receptor currents     and we            have previously reported that dietary AA feeding            increased whole brain              N acylethanolamine as a            separate component of the present work     In the            present work dietary FUNG and FISH alone or together            increased Htr receptor levels    HT              receptor Htr transcript            increases in expression have been shown to augment            hippocampal acetylcholine outflow thereby affecting            cognitive processes                                    Alphasialyltransferase            Hippocampal sialyltransferase Siate was            down regulated with FISH and the combination diet but            not with FUNG difference relative to control was only            significant for the combination diet               Hippocampal protein kinase C Prkcd was            slightly down regulated with the three LCPUFA diets               PUFA feeding can influence PKC            activity    and one mechanism of action may be via            generation of unique diacylglycerol molecular species                           Alphalinked disialic acid residues are found in            glycoproteins     During learning there is a            transient increase in neuronal polysialyation in the            dentate gyrus of the hippocampus This has been            associated with selective retention andor elimination            of synapses that are transiently overproduced during            memory consolidation     In rat hippocampus            during development PKC can negatively regulate            polysialyltransferase activity and neural cell adhesion            molecule NCAM polysialylation state     NCAM is            implicated in neural differentiation and cellular            plasticity     Our observed decrease in Prkcd            expression may have affected hippocampal            polysialyltransferase activity It is not known if            Prkcd regulates expression of Siate                                Proopiomelanocortin POMC            POMC is a hypothalamic neuropeptide and a target            for leptin POMC is cleaved posttranslationally            producing bioactive peptides adrenocorticotrophin            endorphin and   and melanocyte stimulating            hormones that interact with neurons expressing            melanocortin receptors leading to appetite suppression                Feeding high fat diets is known to increase            Pomc expression     Herein FUNG feeding resulted            in a  fold increase in hippocampal Pomc whereas            FISH and the combination diet had smaller            nonstatistically significant effects               The physiological effect of potentially increasing POMC            protein with FUNG feeding is not known As a next step            levels of POMC protein and downstream POMC peptides            should be quantified                                      Conclusions and key findings        The molecular effects of dietary fish oil fed in        reasonable quantities over prolonged periods has been found        in humans and animals to be related to alterations in        health outcome In the present study mice were fed        relevant quantities of fish oil and AA rich fungal oils and        the responses were studied in murine liver and hippocampus        using a combined gene expression and lipidprofiling        strategy The simple addition of these oils to the habitual        diet of mice influenced hundreds of gene products            Furthermore in a striking number of examples interdiet        FUNG vs FISH vs FUNGFISH and interorgan differences        in the transcriptional profile were observed indicating        that the predominant bioactive FAs in fish oil n        n and n and AA enriched fungal oil n do        not affect gene transcription identically in the two organs        studied        Hepatic gene transcriptional profiles and ontology        classifications indicated that fish oil LCPUFA likely        increased FA oxidation and gluconeogenesis and decreased        FA synthesis Furthermore the transcriptional profile        observed indicated that these LCPUFA regulated hepatic        energy processes through the tight coordination of several        critical transcriptional factors Feeding both LCPUFA        containing oils mimicked or accentuated the fasted        metabolic state confirming this aspect of the beneficial        health effects of dietary LCPUFA for both normal and        clinical populations and even household pets        These same conclusions regarding energy expenditure were        reached in experiments assessing enzymatic activities and        transcriptional changes in rat liver using Northern blots        where fish oil feeding increased palmitoyl CoA        mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation rate increased        Cpt Cpt    enoyl CoA isomerase and Ech        expression and activity and decreased expression and        activity of FA synthase malic enzyme glucose phosphate        dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase compared to palm andor        safflower oil feeding     Likewise in rat white        retroperitoneal adipose tissue fish oil feeding also        decreased Fasn expression     Intriguingly the        hormone leptin which also acts through SREBP and PPAR        affected many transcripts similarly to LCPUFA          eg  leptin decreased Gpam and        Apoa transcripts and up regulated Ech mitochondrial        Hmgcs and Cypa transcripts            Chronic feeding of fish and AAenriched fungal oils        broadly affected genes regulated by PPAR HNF and        SREBP in the liver transcription factors implicated in        lipid metabolism as well as other processes Only with        future studies in which PPARspecific agonists and        antagonists are included along with receptor antagonists        will the precise role of PPARsignaling in response to        LCPUFA feeding be elucidated The overlapping        actionseffects of these various transcription factors        present a challenge that will require tools such as        genomics and metabolomics to provide a stepping stone        towards the complete understanding of LCPUFA        metabolism        There were striking differences in the genes and        transcriptional factors activated by LCPUFA in the liver        and hippocampus despite these organs being metabolically        linked as AA and DHA cross the blood brain barrier There        are at least three reasons for these interorgan        differences Firstly the dietary FAs were not identically        incorporated into both tissues as indicated by tissue        lipid profiling Secondly different transcription factors        exist and were activated in the two organs which would        affect downstream signaling Thirdly there is the        possibility that even when the same transcription factors        were activated in both organs factors including        dimerization partners multiple binding of various        transcription factors posttranslational modifications        and signaling kinetics could affect the transcriptional        profile        Currently nutritional FA recommendations are made        largely by examining levels of key LCPUFA in plasma and        less often red blood cells platelets and biopsied        tissue Transcriptional gene profiles have not been        considered in making such recommendations The present work        convincingly shows the potential importance of examining        transcriptional profiles in addition to FA profiles and        the importance of examining more than one tissue in making        such LCPUFA nutritional and clinical recommendations                    Materials and Materials                  Experimental diets          All diets contained  fatfree AING rodent diet in          powder form Lot  Dyets

FUNG          diet  fish oil providing  dietary wt DHA and          en in the FISH diet and  fungal oil and           fish oil in the combined FUNGFISH diet The levels of AA          and DHA chosen were similar to that previously shown in          rats to affect neurotransmitter levels and behavior              and were not excessively high being  fold higher          than that recommended for human babies who have a slower           desaturase activity than rodents Food was maintained          at C in daily aliquots under liquid N             thawed each afternoon before

    dislocation over these last  experimental days Food was          not removed the night before and since nocturnal mice          are known to eat during the normal period dark cycle          employed the mice could have been fasted  h at          sacrifice Mice were thus not completely fasted at          sacrifice a complete fast being  h          After feeding diets to  mice per group  mice were          randomly selected for inclusion in hepatic and          hippocampal gene expression analysis From these  mice          livers were dissected according to standard protocols

    livers cut into  mg subsections and frozen as          described for livers Hepatic and hippocampal lipid          analysis was performed according to standard methods at          Lipomics Inc USA on individual mice            n                            Nucleic acid preparation          Liver tissue was extracted from  individual mice per          group and extracted separately using Qiagen RNeasy          minikits Basel Switzerland according to manufacturer          instructions except that RNeasy columns were impregnated          with DNase I Roche Basel Switzerland to remove any          genomic DNA contamination          For the group fed a control diet two independent          hepatic pools            n   of  g each were created          consisting of equal amounts  g of total RNA from each          of the  aforementioned mice This was done to assess          measurement variability Secondly a separate piece of          liver was excised from three of the individual control          mice            n   to additionally and          independently extract a second set of RNA these three          mice were chosen at random from the group of five This          second round of extraction was used to independently          assess the variability of normal control mice housed          under the prevailing conditions of the study          For each of the other dietary groups a single pool            n   of  g total hepatic RNA          was created for comparison against the control          Hippocampal RNA was prepared as described above for          hepatic RNA except only  pooled control RNA sample from           mice was prepared hence there was a total of  pooled          hippocampal samples           ie one from each of the  diets          Control FUNG FISH and FUNGFISH In sum eight liver          samples and four hippocampal RNA samples were hybridized          on Affymetrix GeneChips          All RNA samples were quantified with the RiboGreen RNA          Quantification Kit Molecular Probes Eugene Oregon          then analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis for intact          S and S rRNA All study samples were judged to          contain sufficient

      cRNA preparation            For the control diet group each of three individual            mouse liver RNA samples              n   were hybridized to            Affymetrix GeneChips For both the control and LCPUFA            diets  g pooled total RNA was the starting material            for hybridization to the MukA  B GeneChips            Pooled liver controls were evaluated in duplicate on            the Affymetrix probe array cartridge to estimate            experimental variation in gene chip hybridization as            previously described in detail                In all cases total RNA was converted to            biotinylated cRNA hybridized in the Affymetrix probe            array cartridge stained and then quantified First            and second strand cDNA synthesis was performed using            the SuperScript Choice System Invitrogen AG Basel            Switzerland according to manufacturer instructions            but using an oligodT primer containing a T RNA

using a confocal laser            scanning microscope made for Affymetrix by            HewlettPackard Readings from the quantitative            scanning were analyzed with Affymetrix Gene Expression            Analysis Software                                Selection of differentially regulated genes and            data analysis            A mathematical method was developed and applied to            the raw GeneChip data for the selection of            differentially regulated genes This method moves            beyond setting a single fold change cutoff by            considering fold change in the context of absolute            expression     In brief this method includes A            the determination of the upper  of fold changes            within narrow bins of absolute expression levels to            determine a limit fold change LFC function and B            subsequent ranking of genes by a combined fold            changeabsolute difference calculation Herein            absolute expression is referred to as average            difference intensity ADI in all mathematical            equations The function describing the upper  of            hippocampal and liver data was described with the            following equations LFC             hippocampus    min ADI            and LFC             liver  min ADI            respectively            The selection of differentially expressed genes was            corroborated in three ways for liver samples             assessing the measurement variability and  assessing            individual mouse variability in order to establish            confidence intervals with which to calculate the            significance of differences with pooled diet response            groups and  confirmation by RTPCR for a            subselection of genes Replicate analysis established            that all genes selected by this method also laid above            a more conventional  confidence interval when            compared to the variation of pooled replicates              n   Subsequent analysis of            the variation between individual mice              n   indicated that this            variation is comparable to the pooled variation and            that all genes selected as differentially expressed            lied above the  confidence interval for individual            mouse variability The gene expression means of the            three individual mice were calculated and compared to            pooled data in a scatter plot A correlation            coefficient of  was obtained indicating that the            pools are accurate representations of the individual            mice used to create them Lastly validation studies            showed up to  concordance of microarray data with            real time polymerase chain reaction RTPCR across the            range of absolute expression for specific genes            selected as differentially regulated     All            RTPCR data including information about the low false            positive rate for all of the liver samples mentioned            in the present work can be found in the aforementioned            reference            The  LFC method indicated that  genes in the            hippocampus and  genes in the liver were            differentially regulated by LCPUFA from the original             genes represented on the MuK Affymetrix            GeneChip Absencepresence calls were not considered             a priori in selecting            significantly regulated genes but were a            postselection criterion After removing those genes            that were identified as             absent across all dietary            conditions  hippocampal and  hepatic            differentially expressed probe sets remained in the            list for further analysis and interpretation Of these             and  genes represented annotated sequences in            the hippocampus and liver respectively            Fold changes are always listed in the respective            order FUNG FISH and FUNGFISH without repeating            these labels and negative signs indicate down            regulation To determine if the ADI for a treatment            group was significantly different from the control            diet the  LFC bestfit equations were utilized LFC             hippocampus    min ADI            LFC

mathematical model            utilized also selected some genes due to significant            differences between experimental treatments even when            no significant differences versus the
