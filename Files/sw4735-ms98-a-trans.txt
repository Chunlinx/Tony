                i dont know if you feel the same but uh when it comes to telling kids that they have to do uh two or three years of service into some kind of community i dont know if thats uh appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that were telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do   right   and um i as far as a high school course i could see it as uh maybe a social uh sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program   umhum umhum   and to me thats fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year but to tell them that they had to do two years there after post high school of community service im   umhum   im not quite sure if thats appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do   hum well thats a good idea to have it as a study program for school where itd be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to uh mandatory   umhum exactly   yeah and yeah i kind of agree with that um i dont think you know it it they shouldnt have they should have the same rights as anyone else   right right   you know it shouldnt be uh anything shouldnt be mandatory other than i guess like uh when you come to paying taxes or something like that uh or if its beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh people be more eagle to do it uhhuh yeah   umhum exactly and doing it for a purpose that they want the other thing is this i have thought about this and many times when you get these uh young troubled teenagers that uh dont have like the perspective of uh of of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems but there are other people out in the community that may have problems then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing you have to do so much as far as in a community service now if they were you know the abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse   right umhum   or if uh they destroyed some property around the uh area then they would have to do uh to restore it and perhaps um work um for the community to beautify it or whatever but   umhum   i could see that working in you know cases where the it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever and thats i think they have done that and judges have said well you know this is what youre gonna get for um you know a misdemeanor misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service so i could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled   umhum   so   uh thats a good idea uh i think they should have more programs like that   umhum   and i think uh us being taxpayers we pay for people thats in jail or in trouble anyway   umhum sure we sure do   so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas   umhum yeah   and i i agree wholeheartedly   yeah   yeah but uh the thing is that its not enough of that kind of stuff going on uh   yeah   because you like you say its a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors why why have someone in your jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor   umhum   and sometimes you know putting them in jail it doesnt really help   umhum   because theres nothing in there that to rebil rebilitate rehabilitate rebilihatate them and then when they get out they because they have the stigmatism of being in jail they cant   exactly yeah umhum and theres a lot of anger sure you know especially if they havent went through treatment and they dealt with other people in the uh system of prisons which um you you always deal with somebody thats a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever i would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might somebody that has has done a crime even worse than what you have so youre dealing with people um that may uh be an influence later on and uh an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two but i didnt get any rehabilitation or um   umhum   you know but then again those that have physically assaulted somebody um thats extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if theyre of a violent sort and to say well you have to   umhum right
