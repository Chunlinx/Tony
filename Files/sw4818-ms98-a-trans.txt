            um well im just really excited about it because im graduating from college next month and i hope to be buying a car sometime  in the future   uhhuh   so so hopefully uh maybe do you have any good advice do you have a car or     uh yeah i do have a car   umhum   uh right now i have sort of a sporty car its a Subaru that is its called an XT i dont think they make them anymore i think i have the last year   uhhuh   and its one of these Japanese cars that run without needing many repairs um   umhum   my advice about cars is uh get a good engine get something that goes not because im a speed freak uh something because if you want to get on a highway you dont want to step on the gas and and say come on come on   umhum thats true thats true   i do you know  they make jokes about women picking out the color but i really do like to have a decent sized engine in my car       and i have a six cylinder and it does go when i tell it to and and i just like the looks of a kind of sporty car   umhum   uh i think my car needs are going to change i had very small children and i was saddled with a station wagon that i never wanted   oh   um i was told that you know itll hold groceries and all this stuff well the grocery bags fell over in a station wagon   thats true they do my mom has one   you know and and you know and i wasnt that thrilled to put a bike in it or a dog in it and i didnt so when i got a new car i got a sporty little car and my kids were still small enough but they werent in baby seats anymore and they sat in the back   umhum   and now my son is fourteen and a half and hes taller than i am and every time i go over a bump he crashes his head because   oh oh no   you know these cars have theyre backseats but theyre kind of toy backseats   yeah yeah   so i think should i get another car uh much to my chagrin itll have to be something more boxy   umhum   and you know practical again so this i guess i guess this is my reprieve and i guess my suggestion to you is to get something you really enjoy because at some later date youll have to get something more practical     thats great advice im so glad i got to talk to you thats good thats what i needed to hear  yeah i guess       im looking for uh something kind of small because its only me and im a small person im only about five one  so   uhhuh   um and id like to get something made in the United States so i would look for that first but if it turns out that a better price is from say Japan like the Subarus then i i would go for that because the most important thing is price i mean because   well you know the more i think of it  you know with whats going on in the world nowadays i think the next car i would try to buy an American one   umhum would you really   yeah i think so its you know Toyotas and all those theyre theyre nice cars but you know surely theres an American car i id love to check out the Saturn which is supposed to be a new newly made American car   yeah you would think so umhum actually i heard really good things about them and uh its funny because i just spent last weekend i was down in Washington DC visiting my sister and they are everywhere down there its amazing because you hardly see any of them on the road here in Philadelphia but i saw about ten in one weekend and uh my sister had gone to the dealership and she was really impressed she uh the one thing that really impressed her which sounds kind of weird but they actually have women salesmen its weird because i mean have you ever seen a woman car salesman   oh yeah i have   really because i was surprised but and she said they were really nice and one good thing about the car is its really hard to dent you know when youre driving a car and you you go in a parking yeah you know most cars in a parking lot like a cart shopping cart hits it or a car door hits it and you have like these dents well the lady took a hammer to this car and it didnt dent   is it really huh   she was like smashing it and it didnt  its its made of something i dont what it is but   really how was the pricing   its actually supposed to be really good the smaller ones i think around are eight thousand and then it gets up to maybe twelve thousand   oh thats thats not horrible at all thats quite good nowadays   so they they look really nice yeah yeah so i dont know maybe thats something to think about because theyre supposed to be completely made in the United States not one of these deals where   yeah   it says its made in the United States but the engine is really made in Japan and all the parts are made in Japan right   parts are made in different places right i wonder who makes the the Geos because   i think thats Chevrolet   is it because theyre so cute The Geo Storm is adorable   umhum that is really nice thats true i dont know anything about them at all do you know anyone who has one   no no i dont in fact i i sat in one a long time ago and slammed the car door and it felt a little tinny you know it was its a smaller lighter car   i know yeah umhum   but you know that was years ago that was about four years ago when i bought mine so it may have changed i know on looks i think the Storm is just adorable little car for a single person   hm yeah that is really cute thats true   hm are are you working yet   so um well im in ROTC so ill be in the Army so on active duty so yeah   uhhuh yeah because i was wondering if youre are you going to finance it   probably yeah is that a good way to go i guess i dont know which one   right uh well i have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and i i like to do that but there are people who can pay for it who prefer to finance it   uhhuh really   yeah it it seems to me as youre paying interest youre bound to be end up paying more i guess now you have to think about uh if the money in the bank will get more interest   right right   uh then then youll want to finance it but if now the banks are giving so little interest i imagine you might as well just pay for it if you could   oh i see
