          well good afternoon to you Mary first let me ask you whats whats the weather like up there to begin with   and good well well today uh when i got up it was twenty nine degrees       yes and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon but its been cloudy overcast and threatening rain all day   that sounds more like our winter weather down here   and weve also had extremely strong winds fifteen to twenty miles an hour for the day     well you know i bet thats what we that storm we had last night   is that right     oh we had a frog strangler go sweeping sweeping through here uh yesterday and last night and were expecting another one tonight   oh really   oh i mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street   we had one of those two days ago   uhhuh   but not uh but uh no rain at all yesterday and uh no rain today   well its probably on its way up there it was heading north   thanks a lot  could couldnt you send us some nice weather     well it was nice today   oh was it   uh in between the thunder showers yes   well the one things for sure we can always discuss the weather how some ever we cant do very much to change it   well you know what they say about the weather here in Texas   whats that   if you if you dont like it wait five minutes itll change   oh yes well thats about the way our weather is here also   uhhuh what   and i grew up in Saint Louis and Saint Louis was much the same   uhhuh well tell me uh is is it normally that cold up there in the in the Spring   no its not this is uh about uh ten degrees cooler than usual but about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty five degrees   youre kidding   no no it uh it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems   you are you sure you didnt leave your refrigerator door open   im sure i didnt i was ready to turn on the air conditioning it no it really was extremely warm it only got down to about sixty five in the evening   umhum   we had about three or four days of that and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and uh temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time and uh it has gone down gradually each day this morning it was twenty nine yesterday it was about thirty two uh cars were scraping ice off their cars this morning if theyve been sitting out all night       it really wasnt too wasnt too pleasant   oh mother macree no i should say not well i i sincerely hope that you dont have that terrible storm we had   oh i hope not   i hope it doesnt reach you up there   well they are predicting rain and thunderstorms and i wouldnt be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had   well i lets hope it well it if its the same as what we had at least itll be warmer   uh yeah  yes warm rain well of course by the time it gets up here it may run run into a cold front coming down from Canada   yeah oh boy the the that whew that would be tear disastrous if you had that rain storm and freezing weather   yes yes   oh   we had uh a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the uh of the city of Dayton itself   uhhuh   and uh then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour it was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning it it wasnt uh it wasnt conditions to being out in it and i had just gotten home we had a lot of tornado warnings also   oh yes   and i had gotten home shortly before that uh the rain started so uh i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it   uhhuh well uh i heard on the news this morning that um one of our local schools uh lost the roof of their gymnasium   is that right   and they suspected may have been a tornado   uhhuh   but uh uh thank God for small favors the uh uh what do they call them the the marching band or something   yeah   uh uh had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before   oh they that was very very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous   oh and how   well of course this is tornado season uh in to uh we have many tornadoes spawned in this area and northern Indiana now were in the southwestern part of uh Ohio   uhhuh   just forty miles north due north of Cincinnati and uh but uh northern Indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across and we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself   uhhuh   so uh we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area but of course youre supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion   oh yeah well during the winter yes we do uh weve had uh well past four or five years i guess at least one day during the year when just everything would just close down because wed have freezing rain   umhum   and uh of course people down here they just dont know how to handle themselves and     right yes i was going to say that it does make a difference when youre not accustomed   oh not only that but were were either either dont have the equipment to handle it either   to uh having to drive in it right right and   uh they go out there and the well all you can do with with uh freezing rain of course is spread sand on the ice   right   and but uh you know we dont even have vehicles that will do that they they have to get uh a truck of sand and uh uh four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand   umhum right well uh well here what they do and i i contend that its certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt and of course the salt does melt the ice but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes uh a perpetual problem   well and then to make matters worse it destroys your vehicles too   oh it sure does do that   yeah they well we they do that down here too they mix the salt in with the sand   well sand and uh but i have learned to do is uh now that i am alone is uh to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car um not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight in the back of the car and then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that   yes uhhuh   i dont know whether youve ever thought in terms of that but   ive no im a dog lover myself   yeah         well the dogs dont use litter but kitty litter is excellent for uh getting under the wheels of cars and what have you and giving you traction uhhuh     yeah i guess it would be   yeah it uh works out uh really quite well course i have i have a dog also my son brought me a little Lhasa Apso uh for my birthday last Thanksgiving he brought him from Dallas he   oh oh wasnt that nice of him   yes that uh he just thought i had been without a dog uh for three years that was long enough   uh i have uh a a chowperd myself   he he had oh a what   a chowperd   now that one im not familiar with   well shes part Chow and part shepherd   uh okay okay that makes sense then  i believe   uhhuh but shes the best the best of both breeds   yes right well ive always had big dogs before never had a little dog before and   well June is medium sized but she is scared to death of thunder storms   yes well oh well i had a German short hair that was frightened of storms the minute it would begin to storm he would just panic   uhhuh   and uh i had to put him down when he was fourteen and two months later i had to put my yellow Lab down because he had leukemia   oh   and uh  then uh then there was no point in having all my acreage i had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides   oh that must be nice   oh well it was great i loved it but then i didnt need all that anymore so i finally sold that and im in a fair size condo and i have a nice size patio   uhhuh   and uh so this little dog has plenty of room to run   well good   yeah and he is a a cutie and uh but ive never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomers to have groomed either and its   no well now you know it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in Miami Beach somewhere       or better yet down around Saint Petersburg Florida   is that right   uhhuh thats what i call home   oh is that right   i lived there for ten years   oh well i was there once way way back in nineteen sixty i think for just a weeks vacation   uhhuh   but uh i thats about the only time ive been to Florida except passing through on the way to someplace else   yep well i lived there in the seventies   but uh uhhuh   and uh i i love it i have two sons still living down there   umhum well uh uh most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in Florida but uh i have just thats just not been my thing we used to always head west or head north now that im alone why uh i uh prefer to travel overseas if im going anywhere   oh uhhuh   and uh course there too you never know what the weathers going to be when you start getting over to   well thats thats why i was suggesting uh that Saint Petersburg is got got to be the finest weather in the world   oh is that right   oh i i loved it down there   um   course you could tell always tell which were the the natives natives   yeah   and which ones were the snowbirds      oh is that right   yeah the snowbirds were the
