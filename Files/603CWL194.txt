              I have a place where dreams are born And time is never planned Its      not on any chart You must find it with your heart Never never land      Dear      As I settle into my first season as artistic director of one of      Indianas most treasured institutions the Civic Theatre embarks on her      nd year with a heritage built on dreams The title of the oldest      continuouslyoperating community theatre in the nation means that      through prosperity and depression war and peace through the best and      worst of times Civic has continued to produce quality family      entertainment for our community Also since the s Junior Civic has      been instilling in children an appreciation not just for the arts but      for the dreams of which theatre is made      I made my Indianapolis debut as a stage director a month ago with      Inherit the Wind a classic of the American stage attended by more than       junior high and high school students My second production at Civic      wi be Peter Pan a tribute to children and were expecting at least       such youngsters to attend The board and staff of Civic Theatre      believe that the future of the arts is in the hands of these little      people and we strive to insure the future of live theatre with programs      like the Holiday Family Production the Student Matinee Series the Young      Adult Summer Musical Junior Civic programs and Kid Connection      I hope that the theatre is still as important to this community as it      was in  when a group of dreamers got together to begin the legacy      that is now the Booth Tarkington Civic Theatre of Indianapolis I hope      that dreams of flying and pirates and fairydust are still part of the      magic of childhood And I hope that you will support the artistic and      educational efforts of Civic Theatre again this year      Yours sincerely      Robert Sorbera Artistic Director
