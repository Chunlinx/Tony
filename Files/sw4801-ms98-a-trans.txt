        what do you think about capital punishment     well im kind of in favor of it for certain crimes   yeah which crimes do you feel that   well i think first degree murder um probably warrants it   yeah because most so many times thats so brutal and just recurrent   right   felons i think should also   exactly recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever   yeah   i come from a state that has well i originally come from a state that has uh the death penalty i come from Florida and uh theyre pretty liberal on it they tend to like fry people left and right which go ahead   uhhuh yeah thats a go ahead Texas is too Texas i saw on TV the other night is the has had forty six in like the past several years   yeah   so theyre pretty hip on it too i guess they do it by lethal injection at Huntsville   yeah okay i think Florida still uses electric chair   yeah   um i dont i dont know in some ways i dont like it because its like youre playing God   yeah   and thats not you know i dont think thats right but on the other hand theres a lot of advantages to it i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it   yeah   and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not   yeah   um with Florida thats a big problem because theres so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year they   yeah thats whats happening here there is like um thats in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turn over rates of   umhum   um repeat uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again   sure and its like you know thats a big problem but theres not a whole lot you can do about it because theres only so many jails you can build   umhum   and its really you know its it gets to be a a really a big problem   yeah   um go ahead   i wish if they if they were gonna do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesnt be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years   right umhum yeah because a lot of these guys you know they get in and they they get off for good behavior and i dont know i mean up in Minnesota where i am now they dont have the death penalty and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system you know because they figure well you know sure i i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something um but then for if i if i elicit good behavior im out in maybe five or ten   oh really   oh sure you know i mean just because like we said before they dont have enough room in the jails um you know theres a lot of incentive for them to be let out early   goodness umhum yeah   but if youve got the death penalty hanging over your head um i dont know i think that may solve a lot of that maybe not solve it but   yeah   i dont know maybe even help a little bit   i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient um kind of takes away   yeah   from the significance of the death penalty   umhum what do you do Georgeanne   im a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas   oh okay great what program you in   um Audiology   okay fantastic uh im a doctoral student at University of Central Florida   yeah what do you do oh really   yeah im doing an internship up at Honeywell   oh really neat   uh yeah but um i dont know its its an interesting issue theres like you say in Texas theres been quite a few and and in Florida in the last few years i think theres been a lot i cant i  i mean i cant give you figures but um   yeah i just and this was in conjunction with a guy that was put in the gas chamber in California so i i think it the forty sixth in last twenty five years i think its what they gave a run down that Texas   uhhuh oh is that right okay   Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then   yeah i i kind of yeah ive heard things about that ive heard that they dont mess around very much yeah   yeah um they they dont get repealed as easily as they do   umhum   like in the guy in California got third you know twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay no you dont have to go and then they took him back i mean it just seems   jeez thats a lot of repeals   yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent and then you had like who you have these people who are serial killers that didnt even get the death sentence back whenever you know   umhum yeah i dont know i im trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it uh i guess what is it whats the policy now with treason do they uh do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence i   no i dont i dont think um the military doesnt execute anymore so   yeah   or death before the firing squad or whatever   yeah   so i think about the only one is um rape
