                              Redundancy in Natural Languages            In this fastpaced age when information is digitizedfaxed uplinked and downloaded it is appropriateto consider natural languages from thepoint of view of information theory  That is we examinethe information content of text or messagesand the efficiency with which that information isrepresented  The idea here is not to convert languageinto some sort of highly efficient but inhumanstream of ones and zeroes  That type of efficiencyis fine for computers but not for humanbeings  In fact as we shall see natural languagescontain a fair amount of redundancy  While thisdoes not provide us with the most concise form ofcommunication possible it is a form that is ideallysuited to human experience which after all is whyit came to be as it is            It cannot be denied that some words are simplylonger than they strictly need to be  This is perhapsmore noticeable in German than in English  In Germanas new words are needed they are oftenformed from smaller words already existing  Thuswe have the words Haupthandelsartikel  meaningstaple and Autoreparaturwerkstatt  meaning garageIf we were to construct a new vocabularyfrom scratch from the point of view of an extremelyorderly but overzealous cataloguer we mighthave as the first two words in our dictionary AAAAand AAAB  We would continue in this manner untilwe reached our last two words ZZZY and ZZZZ Our dictionary would contain  words  Thislexicon is of sufficient size to form a rich writtenlanguage such as German or English  In fact wecould associate to each English word one of our newwords  Thus the phrase To be or not to be   mightbecome THJL BDMN OQRA NOOP THJL BDMNSo much for pronounceability  Of course in thisexample our twoletter words become fourletterwords which hasnt helped keep things concise  Butnow there is no word longer than four letters  Thisgame of recataloguing all our words undoes a naturalprocess which occurs as languages evolve  This isthe tendency to shorten frequently used words andto allow less frequently used words to becomelonger  This trend known as Zipfs Law  causescommon words such as to in a  and it to be as shortas they are  It would be unthinkable to replacethese with tenletter variants  In this way languageat least attempts to follow a path of least resistancein which the effort expended in writing or speech islessened            Despite the economies of effort introduced byZipfs Law natural languages nonetheless containredundancies  One example is the indefinite articlea in English  Many languages are inflected which isalso a form of redundancy since English gets bynicely with little inflection  In English the functionof words within sentences is typically signaled byword order  The sentences I threw the dog the balland I threw the ball the dog are not equivalentHere some of the semantic information is providedby word order and not simply from the words themselvesIn an inflected language endings affixed tothe words for dog and ball indicate which object isdirect and which is indirect  Thus it is possible torearrange words as in the example above  The resultmay not always be idiomatic but it will probably getthe point across  Such flexibility allows for a greaterdegree of expression in poetry for example  Thusone has a romantic poem written in Latin in whichthe first line contains the words for man and womanon opposite ends of the line  By the end of thepoem the words have gravitated toward the middleof the line  It can even be argued that word formsused to show tense are superfluous since Chinesehas no notion of tense  A sentence may be in thepast present or future depending on context  Onewonders how a person translating into Chinesewould deal with unexpected or unpredictable tenseshifts Veni video vincam                        Not only does the degree of redundancy varyfrom language to language but also from one writingstyle to another  One author might have a more loquaciousbent than another  Neither author can besaid to have the better style  A lengthy passage ifwritten well can be more expressive and havegreater effect than a simple oneline statement offact  On the other hand brevity is what gives a pithyaphorism its strength  This is true of both poetryand prose  More so than prose however poetrytends to explore both extremesthe concise andthe protracted  Poe for example used repetition inhis poem The Bells to convey to the reader a sense ofactually hearing the tolling of the bells as thoughthe sounds themselves were imprinted on the pageSomehow it would not have been the same had Poewritten simply that The bells rang a lot  Orbells bells et cetera  At the other extreme somepoets attempt to carefully choose words in such away that the poem expresses a great deal in verylittle space  Thus we have a verse form like haikuin which the totality of the poem is condensed intoonly seventeen syllables  If only certain genres ofprose could be as succinct  A neverending meetingat the office could be completed in plenty of time fora coffee break  Presidential debates could begin andend with the introductory niceties since very littleof substance is ever said  The civilized world wouldbe grateful indeed if lengthy advertising pitcheswere instead given in haikuSudzo detergentClean white garments full of fluffBuy many boxes                        Notwithstanding certain benefits arising fromcompactness redundancy actually plays an importantrole in the communication process  One is remindedof an experiment in which two subjectswere placed in separate rooms and allowed to communicateonly through a teletype  One person wasgiven a box of parts to a wheelbarrow as providedfrom the factory some assembly required  Theother was given the assembly instructions  The objectwas to successfully assemble the wheelbarrowSentences transmitted usually read something likePut bolt into Lshaped part  Such an imperativemight elicit the response Which bolt  or  Which LOr perhaps the recipient of the message would insertsome bolt into some part only to find later thata needed part had already been attached  When thetest is modified to allow phone conversation thetime required for assembly decreases dramaticallyPhrases become more verbose and more redundantbut more communicative  With very little effort itis possible to utter a terrific runon sentence likePut the mediumsized brass boltnot the one withthe little black top but the other oneinto the sortof oblong Lshaped part with the green paint on oneend but first make sure that you have the axlepointed towards the side with the sort of woodenhandle  A person would not be inclined to type outsuch a message verbatim  More likely he would removeoccasional words deemed to be redundantBut in the process the sentence would become lesscolloquial and less intelligible            The presence of redundancy in language is perhapsbest observed when the communication processbreaks down  The fact that a deaf person candetermine a spoken phrase by reading lips demonstratesthat the information is simultaneously beingconveyed in two different ways  Those with normalhearing can use visual clues to assist during the listeningprocess  Thus it is possible to pick out thenecessary morsels of information in noisy surroundingsif facial expressions gestures and other contextualclues are taken into account  But even in theabsence of visual clues the very sounds of humanspeech are overflowing with many times the volumeof data strictly required to convey the message  Examininga graph of a simple speech component suchas the sound of a vowel one sees a complex patternof superimposed waves having myriad peaks andvalleys  When such a pattern is recorded and storedin computerreadable digitized form it occupiesan inordinately large amount of storage  This seemsall the more wasteful considering that the only usefulinformation being conveyed in our example is asingle vowel sound  This apparent redundancyonce again proves to be beneficial  Conversing overa noisy telephone line would be impossible were itnot for the complexity of speech sounds  When oneof a hundred sound peaks is altered by an electricalpop or crackle the sound of an E does not suddenlychange to that of a U it simply sounds like anoisy E  If on the other hand speech containedjust enough data but no more then the alterationof just one peak or bit would change the sound orcharacter entirely  A moderately noisy phone linewould render messages as unintelligible gibberisheven those messages that did not start out thatway  For this reason when computers talk toone another over communication lines in theirhighly efficient system of beeps conventional phonelines are seldom used owing to the high error ratethat would result  In any event computers must usean elaborate method of doublechecking transmitteddata to ensure that no error is made  In otherwords computers must introduce redundancywhere none previously existed in order to communicateeffectively            Predictability is closely related to redundancyIf the recipient of a message such as the reader oftext is able to predict the next word before seeingit the word is apparently not conveying any additionalinformation  In the following transmission itis easy to predict the concluding letter WITH LIBERTYAND JUSTICE FOR AL  The transmission has almostcertainly not ended there  On the other hand onlythe most avid trivia buff could complete the sentenceHARRY TRUMANS HAT SIZE WAS   While it isvery unlikely that the final word is giraffe the correctcompletion of the sentence requires somewhatmore insight  Similarly the ability to infer the existenceof an omitted letter or word such as the indefinitearticle is a form of prediction  It is hard toascertain the missing word in the sentence Aftercrashlanding on the planet Zartok I saw the mostenormous  I had ever seen  The word in questionis probably not portfolio  But lack of familiarity withthe planet Zartok precludes a more accurate guessAlthough these examples deal with predictabilitybased on semantic content it is also possible to basepredictions on patterns within the text itself  In Englisha Q is almost never followed by anything but aU   Also the letter E is the most frequently used letterin English  So if one had no other informationwhatsoever about an omitted letter guessing thatthe letter might be E would probably be more reasonablethan guessing X  And if the missing letterseemed to function as a vowel the odds would begreater still  This is the type of predictability studiedin information theory            Effective communication must contain theright blend of redundancy predictability andnew information unpredictability  If a message istoo redundant it becomes tiresome  This calls tomind a British comedy sketch in which an announcerspeaks on behalf of the Society for People Who SayThings Twice Things Twice   But as we have seen if acommuniqu has been compacted to maximize efficiencythe listener must strive to receive each andevery morsel a process which leaves no room forerror  An analogy might be made with music  If onfirst hearing a piece of music is entirely predictabledroning on in endless clichs then it lacks a certaincreative spark and is not enjoyable  Conversely ifthe listener continually finds himself disorientedwith each new note unable to identify any underlyingpattern or theme then the piece seems merelya random collection of sounds and is equally uninterestingSuch a composition would no doubt leavethe impression that the string section had suddenlycaught fire            Redundancy is itself a phenomenon worthy ofstudy independent of the study of language or musicThe physicist studies redundancy in the contextof order and disorder of physical systems  The disorderof a system is called its entropy   The laws ofthermodynamics tell us that closed systems tend tobecome more disorderly over time  One such closedsystem is the universe itself  We find that pockets ofheat in the form of stars and galaxies are spreadingout and cooling down over time  Thus we can imaginea time in the distant future when the universewill become almost uniformly cold and very fewtemperature gradients will exist which could serveto provide a source of usable energy such as thesun  Without being drawn into these difficult questionswhich require many concepts and tools developedin information theory suffice it to say that redundancyplays a central role in nature itself andnot just in language  As we have seen redundancyis not the evil one might imagine it to be at firstglance  Indeed it is necessary for the very existenceof language  But I repeat myself                              And as for that better mousetrap the Xterminator is humanethe mouse is trapped not killedandcan be reused  From the Philadelphia Inquirer   Submitted by

    The unification of Europe is a noble thoughtbut what are you going to do about the languagefrontiers  However bravely you sweep awaycustoms barriers and encourage Europeans to movefreely over the face of their continent they will continueto come terrible and humiliating croppers atthese invisible boundaries  My own experiencebears this out only too painfully            The first time I ever ventured onto the Continentfrom my home in the depths of Britain waswhen I went to work as a teacher on the Zugerberga hilltop in Switzerland many years ago  I got out ofthe train at Zug still halfdazed from a night tripacross France and what did I see in the sleepysquare but a small tram in the window of which wasa placard readingunmistakably Zugerberg hell I very nearly turned tail and fled without furtherinvestigation  I even entertained the thought thatthe placard might have been put there by the diabolicalpupils of the school I was going to who were notat all keen on having a new English teacher  I wasnot to know that since hell in German meansbright this was merely an intimation to the townsfolkthat although the town itself was plunged in fogthe sun was shining on the nearby heights            Other travelers have no doubt suffered similarshocks  Those who travel to St Moritz by rail forinstance may well be shaken when just before arrivingin their dream resort they stop in a stationwhere a big sign tells them St Moritz Bad  Ofcourse everyone knows that St Moritz isnt reallyso bad so they probably conquer their apprehensionsand go ahead  But what about Bad Ragaz oreven Bad Endbach  Many of those who visit countrytowns in Germanspeaking parts will be proudlyshown the local Rathaus   They may well shudder atthe thought that such a fine old building actually atown hall is rodentinfested  I feel even moredeeply for those expectant mothers who turning acorner on a small Swiss station in search of a publicconvenience have been faced by that one brutallaconic word Abort  After all wouldnt WC servethe purpose just as well            At this point the reader will notice that we arehere on delicate ground straight among words thatmay offend our most intimate sensibilities  When wemeet them at a certain distance we can usually manageto take the sting out of them  For instance if aGerman botnist called Fuchs gave his name to aflower which is therefore known as a fuchsia  wecan elegantly get round the issue in English by pronouncingit FEWsha  Or if there is a wellknownpianist by the name of Kunz  we can avoid cataclysmsin Yorkshire by calling him KOONDS  Butwhen you run into such things in real life headonand with no warning there is really no remedy allyou can do is face the inevitable with whatever fortitudeyou can summon  An evil fate of this kind befella friend of mine from Gloucestershire who wentto live in Germany near a town called Scheidt  thepronunciation of which proved to substantiate hisworst misgivings  In the early days of his sojournin the area he tells me his voice used to breakwith shame every time he went to a railway ticketcounter to ask for a return to Scheidt            But to get to my own experience  I had not beenon the Continent long when I wanted to buy somenylons for a girl friend  The German word for silkstockings escaped me but the English word hosepromptly suggested itself to my mind  So I went intoa shop selling ladies lingerie and asked for Damenhosen The girl behind the counter seemed slightlytaken aback and when she came and dangled somelacy panties before my eyes I was taken aback tooPerhaps she thought I was a transvestite and had tobe humored  In fact I was seriously embarrassed forI was still young enough to have a sense of shame            On another occasion I was in town with twoyoung Englishmen who had just arrived on the sceneand did not speak a word of German between themWe were feeling peckish although it was only midafternoon so we decided to go and have a snack in arestaurant  The waitress who spoke a little Englishrecommended a dish which happened to be in seasonIt turned out to be a paste made from sweetchestnuts which looked rather like a dish of wormsWe were somewhat intimidated by the look of it butwe ate itwithout enthusiasm but with the stiff upperlip we had imbibed so to speak with ourmothers milk  An hour or so later we still felt peckishso we tried another establishment  We decidedthat this time we did not want anything sweet butrather something a little more substantial  As a precautionarymeasure I consulted the menu and theremy eye fell on the vermicelles   I explained to mycompanions that this must be pasta a kind of Continentalmacaroni in those days macaroni was aboutthe only kind of pasta you ever saw in England ifwe mercifully forget the incredible invention ofspaghetti on toast  They were all in favor and fiveminutes later we got our snack it was that chestnutpaste again looking more like worms than everWe felt that we had been tricked by a malicious fateWe sat there unable to start on the stuff wishingthat we were in Timbuktoo where we could at leasthave had camels eyes            The same malevolent powers also operate in theopposite direction  An Austrian lady of my acquaintancewas interned in Yorkshire during the SecondWorld War  One day she and her companions wereallowed to go to the cinema in a nearby town  Whenthey came out they needed to go to the toilet sothey began to look round for a public convenienceThey had hardly turned into the high street whentheir search appeared to be successful for theyfound a door that bore the sign Closed   That theythought could only be the English for the Germanword Klosett   But they were disappointedthedoor simply did not open  It must have been aThursday afternoon for all down the street therewere Closed signsbut no means of getting in anywhereThey even began to suspect that the townspeoplewere playing a mean practical joke on themBy now they were nearly burstingwith indignationof coursebut there was nothing for it theyhad to wait till they got back to their internmentquarters  Continence after all is a virtue or so saythose who do not have it imposed on them            Fortunately these linguistic snares land us introuble only for a brief moment ignominious as thatmoment may occasionally be  Being saddled with awrong name is a more lasting curse  I was oncecalled in to help a man whose brother had died inthe United States so that as next of kin he had tohandle the correspondence  Knowing no English heobviously needed assistance  He was called Schittli which believe it or not is an absolutely good Swissname  His brother strangely enough was not calledSchittli Having emigrated to the USA he had discoveredthat the family monicker however respectablein Appenzell would never do in Pittsburgh  Hehad therefore had it changed to Hittli  which involvedthe sacrifice of only two consonants  Alas itwas not long before the shadow of a certain Adolffell over Europe  Hittli was so near to Hitler that thelikeness became for an immigrant decidedly uncomfortablePoor Hittli took the only course opento him and sacrificed a vowel  He died a Hattli             The slings and arrows of the spoken languagemay prove even more perfidious in writing  When Itook my first office job in Switzerland I had a secretarywho knew no French or English so that I had towrite letters in these languages by hand for her totype  One of the first happened to be to a FrenchVIP and she opened with full diapason Nous avonslhorreur daccuser rception de votre lettre Honour and horror are evidently very close inFrance  Another opening gambit read like this Nousvous remercions de vos linges du  juillet   Onyet another occasion I had to write to a colleague bythe name of Robert who had had the effrontery tocriticize me and I wanted to do so in a firm butstudiedly polite tone  Once again the catastrophecame pat at the very outset Dead Bob             Only

collapse                              Milestones Footrocksand Inchpebbles in theHistorical Developmentof Formal Logic                         The study of formal logic was begun in ancientGrease in order to make the machinery ofreasoning operate more smoothly  The principal figurein this development was Dr Arris Toddle whoinvented the Syllogism in Barbara as well as those inBetsy Patricia and Harriet  This form of reasoningruns essentially as followsAll men are mortalSocrates was a manSocrates was mortal                        However since Socrates was mortal he must havedied by now so he is no longer alive and thus is nolonger a man  It follows that he is now no longermortal and thus will live forever  This establishesthe immortality of the sole as well as that of theheel calf ankle and toe  A similar argument can becarried out for anyone at all except of course forBarbara herself who was not a man to begin with            A refinement of this form of argument workedout by Dr Ross C Knee is the Barbara of Sevillewhich underlies much of the Seville Rites legislationof the s  These important practices grew outof a popular mass movement composed by KingMartin Luther the only man ever to be awardedninetyfive masters degrees after writing as manytheses  and were inspired by the Seville Shepherdswho were led by Seville herself a woman with sixhundred ninetythree distinct personalities all butat most a very few of which were entirely unawareof the existence of most but not nearly all of theremaining others  As in the case of Barbara Sevillesreasoning can also be stated in the form of asyllogismAll men are mortalAt least two hundred ninetyfive of Sevilles distinctpersonalities are menSeville is suffering from a severe identity crisis                        However since the men are mortal the proportionof Seville that comprises them will gradually decreaseleading to here ventual recovery just in timeto die from other causes  This leaves Socrates thesole survivor again establishing the immortality ofthe sole            The next great development in logic was carriedout by the Muddyville School also known as TheSkull Assticks when they played rock music on theside to make a living These logicians specialized inthe counting of angels which they found more effectivethan sheep in anesthetizing their students  It isto these great minds that we owe the FundamentalTheorem of Formal Logic which reads as follows            Fundamental Theorem of Formal Logica  Exactly  angels can dance on the headof a pinb  Exactly  angels can dance on the headof a needlec  Exactly  angels can dance on the headof a twopenny nail                        Since angels tend to be of uncertain gender neitherBarbara nor Seville will have anything to dowith them so their status visvis mortality remainsan open question  This is in fact the most importantunresolved issue in all of formal logic because ofgreatly inflated land values and a rapidly increasingangel population both of which place dancing spaceat a premium            Logic lay dormant for many centuries after beingworked over so brilliantly by The Skull Assticksbut it was finally rescued from angelic oblivion byHerr Professor Gottlob der Friggin who provedthat the morning star is not the same as the eveningstar even though both are Venus This invalidatedthe previously unquestioned Principle of the Substitutabilityof Identicals which had been formulatedby Leibniz in his battle with Figby Newton for recognitionas the original discoverer of the infinitesimalcalculus This principle can be formulated as asyllogism as followsLeibniz discovered the calculusNewton is not LeibnizNewton did not discover the calculus                        However Gottlobs figgin work showed that this argumentwas invalid since Leibniz worked in themorning Newton worked in the evening and it wasreally Galileo that discovered the calculus whilelooking at Jupiter not Venus through his telescopeGalileo also disproved the principle that heavier objectsfall faster than lighter ones by dropping an appleand a watermelon off the top of a tower  It wasthis apple that gave Newton the idea of UniversalGravitation when it landed conveniently on hishead and it was Universal Gravitation that suggestedto Newton the concepts of the infinitesimalcalculus  Exactly the same thing happened toLeibniz except that he got hit by the watermelonand so was unconscious for several hours  This gaveNewton time to get to the patent office and file hisclaim for calculus before Leibniz could figure outwhat had happened            Gottlobs discoveries laid the foundation for atremendous spurt of work in formal logic from thebeginning of this century to the present day  FirstRussell N Whitehead managed to derive all knownmathematics from logical principles in contrast toprevious mathematicians who had derived it fromillogical principles  This led to the famous Gdeltheorem which says that all mathematics cannot bederived from logical principles  Gdel proved thistheorem by showing that every sentence in a logicallanguage can be encoded as a statement about positivenumbers  Since English is not a logical languageit follows that sentences in English can beencoded only in nonpositive numbers and thus thatEnglish can make only negative statements aboutmathematics  Since the same is true of every naturallanguage it follows that mathematics makes nosense whatsoever and thus that it can be ignoredfor all practical purposes  This led Al Tarski to thediscovery that logic itself depends only on theweather  as indicated in the following syllogismSnow is whiteSnow is whiteSnow is white                        Since snow is white is true if and only if snow iswhite and since snow is white is true ifand only if snow is white is true it follows that  snow is white is true is true is true if and onlyif  snow is white is true is true  These discoveriesresulted in the theory of models the clothing wornby whom gradually shrank to zero thereby enablingAbe Robinson to prove the existence of infinitesimalswith predictable consequences in the physiognomyof certain members of the audience  This reestablishedthe intersubstitutability of Newton andLeibniz as long as it not snowing and Venus is stillvisible            The most recent and in many ways the mostexciting development in formal logic is the new fieldof fuzzy logic in which precision is replaced withvagueness and truth with maybe and perhaps   Thiswas invented by Lofty Zappa who is also knownfrankly as the father of invention because of hiswork on the logic of necessity  Rather than takingstatements to be either true or false fuzzy logic assumesthat statements are true or false to somedegree so the Syllogism in Barbara for examplewould be reformulated as followsSocrates was more or less a manMost men are usually mortalSocrates was most likely mortal to degree                        Since the average lifespan in ancient Athens was years it follows that Socrates would havelived until he was  years old if he hadnot developed a taste for hemlock  Unfortunatelyhis addiction to this controlled substance led eventuallyto his arrest on charges of drug abuse therebyenabling Playdough to counterfeit all of his ideas  Itwas in critiquing Playdough that Toddle developedthe Syllogism in Barbara  but this was where westarted

When it istranslated as when an English translation followsthe French title it is rendered as Goodbye ChildrenThis translation is as good as any but quiteunsatisfactory  For that reason and because Englishis closely related to French lexically anyhow havingborrowed a great portion of its vocabulary fromFrench the title can be left in the original as a titlein Danish or Polish could not be            Snob appeal may be involved here  It is wondrousthe way French is able to maintain its positionas the language of style and status at least throughoutthe Western world  In such magazines as TheNew Yorker and Time French words and phrases appearwith much greater frequency than bits of anyother foreign language  The issue of The New Yorkerfor July   taken at random had in its Dancingsection on page  two whole sentences inFrench untranslated  The issue of Town  Countryfor September  had a fullpage advertisementfor Sea Island Cotton entrely in French except forthe American name of the company  John Updikesnovel S has two or three brief business letters inlikewise untranslated French  I suspect that Americanand British readers with some claim to internationalsophistication are flattered by the assumptionof some ad writers and authors that a little Frenchwill not be Greek to them            However the short phrase Au revoir les enfantswould resist translation even if it were desirable toput it into English  Only the first of its four wordsslips easily enough into English as till   But Englishis the only European language I know that has nocalque for the expression au revoir  probably becausewe have adopted this French phrase likemany others intact while other languages have thephrase calqued as hasta la vista a rivederci dosvidaniya do widzenia auf Wiedersehen etc  At anyrate goodbye really does not translate au revoirAdieu also borrowed intact into English would doas the French equivalent of goodbye  and vice versabut that equivalence gets us nowhere with au revoir except to point up the fact that goodbye does notmean au revoir             I once heard a Frenchman in Madrid tell a coupleof Spanish shop clerks a joke that illustrates thedifference between adieu goodbye and au revoir At the Rio de Janeiro airport the planes of variouscountries were taking off one after another and theterminal was crowded with passengers and withfriends and relatives seeing loved ones off  An AirFrance jet took off and the loved ones on theground waved and shouted Au revoir Au revoirThen an Iberia plane taxied away to shouts of Hastala vista  And then it was the turn of a jet flown by aBrazilian airline with a notoriously poor safety recordAs it taxied away to take off the crowd moreintoned than shouted Adeus  Adeus  Portuguesefor adieu             Since English lacks a calque for au revoir  itwould be technically possible to make one perhapson the model of Joyces or his Stephen Dedalusagenbite of inwit for remorse till the agenseeing But of course such bitterly pedantic wordplay wouldbe unthinkable on the lips of the plainspoken priestwhose words give the Malle film its title and some ofits poignancy  And if agenseeing is too farfetchedand pedantic so long is a shade too informal slangy            And what about the simple definite article in thetitle  Surely it should pose no problem  Au contraire I suspect it is the most meaningful and untranslatableword in the fourword phrase  It is notstrictly standard French before a common noun inthe vocative case but seems borrowed from thefolksy language of camaraderie the slang of streetbarracks and campus  One does not sing Allonsles enfants de la patrie  In modern Frenchnovels about military experiences however onemay find a soldier proposing to his buddies Allonsles gars  In such usage the plural definit articleseems to imply a sense of solidarity of togethernessof addressing not just any or all boys or kids orwhatever but of specifying a particular group  Furthersince les in this special usage has its origin inboyish slang it implies masculinity as guys might inEnglish  In the title in question les might be translatedby the pronoun you and the whole title as Solong you guys  This translation conveys the meaningof the French title all right but is neverthelessunacceptable because such jaunty informality wouldbe totally out of character for the priest whose warmyet solemn farewell at a tragic parting gives themovie its title            Nor does enfants always mean children exactlyThe New Cassells French Dictionary definesenfant in English as Child infant baby son ordaughter descendant citizen native  Law  offspringissue  Then some of the following examplesgiven in the dictionary show that in some contextsthe word does not mean child at all cest un bonenfant he is a good fellow lenfant prodigue theprodigal son  Moreover some of the older studentsaddressed by the priest in the movie are past childhoodthough in priestly parlance anyone even a nonagenarianmay be called a child  So perhaps childrenwill do here though arguably boys might be anuance better            It may be that French because it so rich in connotationand nuance is harder to translate than mostlanguages  English has a much larger vocabulary afact that has been adduced to support the argumentthat French is inferior to English  But the larger vocabularyof English is irrelevant in two respectsmuch of this larger vocabulary is esoteric exoticpedantic or otherwise as foreign to everyday Englishusage as Chinese and whereas vocabulary isquantified by words the expressive units of Frenchtend to be phrases such as chemin de fer joie devivre  and raton laveur   By the usual lexical reckoningone could say that French has no word for railroador raccoon             Phrases being more semantically complex thansingle words are usually harder to translate  Englishtoo has its untranslatable phrases composed of wordsthat are individually translatable  For instance

I pretendedto fill tumblers of icecold milk and to drinkthem with apparent delight  I beat the air with myarms and clucked like a hen and mooed deep andlong  But the features of the old old woman whohad opened the door of the farmhouse half way upthe mountain and who had answered my polite requestfor a few eggs and some milk with a steadyflow of Welsh remained blank  As blank as minehad been when she had been speaking Welsh  Mymiming must have been wanting as I got neither eggnor milk  But the humiliating thing was that I relativelybilingual and with a smattering of a few otherlanguages have been able to make myself understoodin most part of western Europe but was thoroughlycheckmated not sixty miles as the crow fliesfrom Manchester  I decided to learn Welshforthwith there and then without more ado            Of course it was not going to be plain sailing  Iknew that  Wemy wife our three children andIhad been invited to spend ten blissful days in anidyllic white cottage in the middle of a field near acouple of lakes in the depth of CaernarvonshireThe nearest village was a couple of valleys away ourneighbors were sheep and lambs  It was definitelyknown that a roadmender did sleep in a oneroomcabin near the abandoned slate quarry  These wereperhaps not the best conditions in which to learn theWelsh language but what I lacked in amenities Ithought I would make up in ambiance for therewe would be for ten days practically incommunicado            My only tutor was one of those paper napkinson which are printed some hundred brightly coloredpictures of objects and things in common use suchas bread cheese house sea sun chair etc withthe Welsh name above and the English underneathYou know the sort of thing  Very useful in its way nodoubt but rather limiting to

LD in   It was likereaching that peak in Darien  A whole new worldwas about to be revealed to me  And into this unknownland this strangely melodious language withits roots dating back to the time when the world wasyoung I set forth with my paper napkin and mypocket dictionary compiled in             As I read on picking out a word here and aphrase there the personality of Dr Richards beganto appear  The aims of a lexicographer these daysis undoubtedly to be as objective and exact as possiblewhen dealing with concepts as intangible asthe meanings of words  Dr Johnson himself wasroundly criticized for letting his prejudices interferewith his definitions  We do not go to a dictionary foropinions or for subjective judgment and the moreremote the personality of the compiler the betterDr Richards obviously entertained a different ideaof his mission            His interests quickly became clear  That he wasa theologian there can be little doubt and anyonewould have been able with the help of his dictionaryto plough through a sermon on predestination or adebate on the difference between transubstantiationand consubstantiation  This in a POCKET dictionaryyou understand  Dr Richards must also have beeninterested in demonology witchcraft familiarsrhabdomancy  You wish to know the Welsh forrhabdomancy   Well another time perhaps  Thenthere was Dr Richards interest in diseases  Farfrom simply giving us the Welsh for rheumatism  hegoes into details of the symptoms and I will spareyou a fiveline description of the scabs in a case ofblue jaundice   If you should catch blue jaundice inWales I strongly advise you to have Dr Richardssdictionary at hand  Incidentally since jaundicemeans the yellow disease how can it be blue  Butlet it pass            Dr Richards never stops astonishing us  Youwould think that the word byelaws was not onewhich in a pocket dictionary would be given muchspace  But wrong you would be  Dr Richards givesus a minitreatise on the application of byelaws inScotland in the th century which is not particularlyuseful if you are lost in a fog and on knockingat the door of an isolated Welsh cottage you arefaced by an aged gentleman who has no English            I fear that Dr Richards did not have us in mindwhen he set to work for he omitted to include suchwords as tomato bathroom cutlet cauliflower  andrailway station   Yet let no one say he was not a mundaneman for he gives us the Welsh for port sherrywhisky brandy burgundy claret  and even Rhenishwine   And do you know that there are ten words inWelsh for fashion   But none apparently for tomatobathroom cutlet  etc            It quickly appeared on perusing the WelshEnglishsection that Dr Richardss English wassomewhat idiosyncratic for he gives us an Englishtranslation of a Welsh word to render prospectiveI have pondered on this phrase and the only personI can imagine using it is the secretary of the localbranch of a political party who having handed theCommittee members a short list of wouldbe candidatesasks Which of these people shall we renderprospective            Then there is the word arfogwl which apparentlymeans a dried skin on a post with pebbles init with no further explanations as to why it shouldbe hanging on a post and why in heavens name itshould contain pebbles  I therefore went out to tryto find one in the hope that the object might revealits raison dtre  I was not successful and I mustwarn wouldbe searchers that I very much doubtwhether there is a dried skin with pebbles in it hangingon a post within three miles from Llanrust  Theyhad better look elsewhere            A closer study of the EnglishWelsh section soonbrought to light the fact that not only did Dr Richardsknow a large number of English words which donot appear in recognized dictionaries I consultedbut that clever man that he was he was able totranslate them into Welsh  Words like dishersion extillationrestagnate claricord contramure  and ofcourse discubitory   All these words look as if theymeant something  The word discubitory took myfancy neither Chambers nor Webster having beenable to enlighten me I consulted Dr Richards himselfby the simple process of looking up in theWelshEnglish section the Welsh word which DrRichards had given as the translation of discubitoryin the EnglishWelsh section  I looked up thereforethe word lledorweddle and was informed that itmeant discubitory  However there was an alternativedefinition partly lying down  This I tookto mean in a semirecumbent position  I had itnow of course  Discubitory means lying downwhilst propping oneself on ones elbow  This wordhas now taken its place in my vocabulary and I use itnow and then nonchalantly in conversation  To dateno one has asked me what it meant

thatthey differ in a number of respects and it is usefulfor those interested in language to have severaltypes available  The OED  for example has verylong and elaborate etymologies some of whichmight have been superseded presumably inOEDe  which means you have to have the latestedition  Then too the OED does not always transliterateforeign scripts which might put those whocannot read Chinese Arabic Cyrillic Thai etc at adisadvantage when examining cognates or loanwordsSome of the smaller dictionaries from theMWIII and the Random House Unabridged on downthrough the college and desk sizes contain etymologiesreflecting uptodate scholarship but theseworks may not be particularly userfriendly after allsurveys have shown that etymological information isthat least frequently sought by dictionary users so itill behooves publishers to devote a great deal of expensivespace to it  In contrast to these standardworks John Ayto has compiled a very commendableuserfriendly book which is eminently readableas is all of Aytos writing            I do have a few reservationsnaturally  Howcould a reader identify an Urdang review if it did nothave reservations  First I found the system of crossreferences inconsistent  In the front matter we aretold that if a related word is mentioned but no dateis shown for itthe word has its own articleThat is not consistently the case though it would betoo boring to cite examples  Second in the entryfor albatross  Alcatraz ought to have been identifiedas the former prisonisland it is still an island ofcourse and the generalization that ail is virtuallyobsolete except in the metaphorical use of its presentparticipial adjective ailing  fails to take accountof the common expression What ails youhimheritthem and fails to explain what is metaphoricalabout She is ailing   Thirdthough herewe might not be dealing with Aytos decision asmuch as the publishersit is simply not convenientto have a dictionary of etymology that excludes allbound prefixes and suffixes though these areglossed as required when they are part of an entryFourth I think it a mistake to merge under oneheadword words of distinctly different provenancesthat is homographs as in gloss   And finally thereare far too many typographical errors for a book ofthis sort under absent  nt after milleniumloo existance            Notwithstanding there are many cogent

                      The chief virtue of the book is that it presents agreat deal of information about word origins inhighly readable form  Indeed there is so much informationburied in the entries that the publisherwould have been well advised to prepare an index toafford users better access to the nether reaches ofthe language  Perhaps in a second edition            People often think thatat least by nowallthe words in the language have been successfullyand accurately etymologized  While that is trueabout the majority of words it does not obtain for allthe words and certainly not for many

Introductionis businesslike brief and to the point avoidingmuch of the repetitious academic maundering thatoften accompanies such works            As Thorne is an Englishman I trust him on BritishIrish Scots and even Australian slang thoughAustralians may take exception  The real questionis How accurate is his coverage of American slangHe says he relied on four people though whetherthey were informants or advisors or drinking companionsor all of the above is not made clear            Compared with American slang which isstrongly under the influence of New York and otherbig cities Hollywood and showbiz in general thereis little British slang that comes from Yiddish  Theother day I used the word megillah in conversationwith an editor from Oxford University Press and heat once asked me what it meant  My instantaneoussynonym appropriate for the context in which I hadused it was screed  which he of course understood Ihad to explain that megillah is Hebrew and probablyentered

illbehooves one to state categorically that ruinedbotched is not a viable definition I have never encounteredthe expression used in that sense on eitherside of the Atlantic  Although I have no

specific usage of the wellknowncolloquialism denoting anything resounding orimpressive                        The inference is that the colloquialism is Australianwhich it is not  The entry also emphasizes thelack of uniformity of style of the book with the dialectlocales of some entries shown as italicized labelsalongside the headword of others associated withspecific senses and of others buried somewhere inthe text  Style in dictionaries is not a nasty little detailit is a quick way of categorizing informationand if a label appears in an unfamiliar place itsplacement ought to convey

become  I doubt that it isaccurate to define gunsel as a callow youth a sensethat probably rubbed off from the character playedby Elisha Cook Jr in The Maltese Falcon though hewas referred to by

Word Origins  reviewed elsewhere in this issuewill not be happy to see his name misspelledAyton  Also in a section best described asWebsterbashing Bryson fails to mention JosephEmerson Worcester and his competing dictionariesin some ways superior to Websters and I cannotagree with the comment p that the simplifiedspellings advocated by Webster would probablyhave happened anywaythey didnt happen anywayin Britain where despite the fact that many ofthe forms cannot be justified etymologically or anyother way the conservatives continue to heap scornon American spelling  I think it misleading to describethe section A to Ant of The New English Dictionaryon Historical Principles the original title ofthe Oxford English Dictionary  as a slim paperbackbook it was the first fascicle to be published andwas not the first of twelve volumes  The OEDwas originally published over a number of years infascicles of various lengths which were sold by subscriptiona method that is alas no longer practisedThese are details I know but that is no excusefor not getting them right especially when theaccurate information is so easily accessible            I am willing to take Brysons word for many ofthe bits of information with which this bookabounds to wit Among the Xoxa tribe of SouthAfrica the most provocative remark is hlebeshako your mothers ears  the wisdom that Some culturesdont swear at all and the revelation that inFinland When you stub your toe getting up to answerthe wrong number at  am you muttershout Ravintolassa which means in the restaurantOne hesitates to consider what the restaurantsmight be like in Finland or indeed what the waiterssay when they drop a tray perhaps Hlebeshako            There is much to interest and amuse the readerin Mother Tongue  and I find it a pity that teachers donot use books like this to introduce students to thewonders and humor of language to reinforce what Ihope is their own enthusiasm for the subject in placeof the turgid texts they are stuck with            Laurence Urdang                              I sympathize with Dr Zellig Bachs tale of thehorrible Yiddish rendition of the Census Bureauform XVII The Scandalous Yiddish Guide of theCensus Bureau and I wouldnt be a bit surprised ifmany of the other foreignlanguage versions wereequally awful  But I suspect that Bachs imaginaryscenario of how such a mess came to pass is probablyoff the mark  Judging by our own frequent experiencewith government agencies federal state andlocal the most common cause of bad foreign languagepublications is simply the practice of consideringtranslation and foreignlanguage typesetting asif they were commodities and awarding the work tothe lowest bidderwho is often incompetent            Then of course since the agency has no capabilityto judge the quality of the work the bad stuffgets printed and circulated  Fortunately some governmentunits certain of which we are privileged tocount among our clients are smart enough to knowbetter and do produce firstclass work in foreign languagesby engaging reputable suppliers                              I noted the references to tweeter and boomer orwow and hum in Harry Cohens article JingoLingo XVI  I had expected to find tweeter followedby woofer and wow followed by flutter   Ihave no dictionary that records boomer as an audioelectronics term but two that record woofer   I suspectthat hum is used by those of us who cant tellwow from flutter             While reading OBITER DICTA in the same issue Ifound myself in total agreement about the poorquality of the manuals that accompany computerhardware and software  But while improving manualswould reduce the number of telephone calls theassertion that reduction by a factor of  could beachieved assumes that the users could actually beinduced into looking at the manuals  Those whohave actually answered telephone calls from userscan tell you that if patriotism is the last refuge of ascoundrel then the manual is the last refuge of thecomputer user  A call to customer support comeswell ahead of reading the manual even when itsgood and well indexed  We often have to bite ourtongues to lkeep from shouting fmanual            Your assumption that your programs spellingchecker contains about  words because itcontains about  characters is mistakenComputer programmers are cleverer than that  Thefirst spelling checker that I bought had a word listfile of approximately  characters  It used ahashing technique storing word roots suffixesand prefixes  In operation it would strip recognizedsuffixes and prefixes from words check for the wordroot and use rules stored in the program to determinewhether the suffixes and prefixes were addedcorrectly  According to the manual the file compressiontechniques used the  character dictionaryto list about  root words  Whenchecked against a word dictionary the programwas said to have achieved a  recognitionrate                              In the early s I designed a hyphenation programfor automatic typesetting based on a logic ofprefixrootsuffix combined with a table lookup foranomalies for instance before analysis of a wordending in ing  the word would be checked against alist including thing bring string  and other wordsthat could not be hyphenated  Examination of theatrocious hyphenation exhibited by many typographerstoday is demonstration enough of the lack ofinterest in such affairs  Recently Americanizing aBritish text using the American spelling checker inmy Framework III program I discovered that theprogram is ignorant of American preferred spellingslike labeled vs labelled traveler vs traveller thoughit catches travelling   What boots it to point out thatmany Americans are likewise ignorant of thosepreferences  It seems redundant to point out thatall offers I have made in the past to put AshtonTateon the right track regarding language and manualshave been ignored though it is hard to say whetherthat is out of their arrogance their ignorance ortheir inability to read my letters Editor                               I read with interest the account of your experiencewith the AshtonTate wordprocessing programFramework III  XVI   I was especially interestedin the results you got when invoking the SUGGESToption in the programs spelling checker  You wereat a loss to explain the rationale for the programsselection of rattans as an alternative for awakens             In the late s I worked as a clerk in themedical records department of a large medicalclinic  When I had the name of a patient but not hischart number I checked with the medical recordscorrection clerks  They sat at a computer terminalsand would key in some kind of alphanumeric codethat evoked many names  The name Wise  for examplealso evoked names like Weese Weiss  and Weisz but also such unlikely variants as Waage WachaWahoske Wick  and Woiak   When I became a correctionclerk myself I learned that the system behindthis namegrouping was a filing system calledSoundex  Soundex works mostly by ignoring thevowels in a name and assigning an alphanumericcode to the name based on the remaining consonantsThus Wise was given the Soundex code W                              I tried applying Soundex coding to the list ofwords in your article but it was inadequate to thetask so I created an elaboration of Soundex  Belowis a selection from the list of words in your articleaccompanied by a number code as will be seen thewords in each group have very similar codes  Myelaboration of Soundex works according to the followingrules  Target means the item to be codeda Change each d or t in the target to cb Change each ng cluster to mc If the target begins with kn replace knwith md If the target begins with h y or a voweldrop it and follow these rulese If the target begins with r or w replace itwith an lf Code the target according to Soundex rulesg Replace the initial letter of the Soundexcode with the appropriate numerical codefrom the Soundex code table                        Thus for example the target halogenating would gothrough the following changes while being codedhalogenating   targethalogenacing   rule ahalogenacim    rule balogencim      rule dlogenacim      rule d againL           rule f           rule g                        Because the system is completely based on rulesand ignores meanings any word can be added to

Infinitive phrase Noun clause Participial phrase Prepositional phrase Adjective clause                        Using the same constituentspecifying numbersas above to make it easier to verify my

been laid to restlong ago  Has some historian recently discoveredthat the story is true after all                              I heard this many years ago on at least oneother occasion from a very knowledgeable South Africanfriend who explained that he could not cite areference but regarded it as common knowledgeOccasionally I have asked historians and othersabout this without success confirmation or denialTwo reference librarians were at a loss as to how tobegin a search  It now occurs to me that perhapsyou know the story or at least that you could giveme a lead as to its origin                              A definite citation of course can be used to verify afact  Not all facts are verified or verifiable  Becauseevents that never occurred are naturally not documentedit is almost impossible to verify that somethingdid not take place  Yet rumors and commonknowledge however inaccurate are sometimes amisinterpretation of an event that actually occurredand therefore can be traced to a fact even thoughdistorted the best that can be wished for is to turnup something that might have given rise to the storylike the identification of the Parson Weems taleabout George
