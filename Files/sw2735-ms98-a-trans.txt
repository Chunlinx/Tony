                okay Jean um could you tell me what you what you think about uh gun control   well i think we have a lot of laws on the books right now that if they were kept and followed would take care of a lot of the problems we have   as as far as firearms go or as far as firearms going or is it just uh the   pardon yes the gun the gun control   gun controls yeah im not really all that sure on on uh what the federal regulations are but it seems like each state has their own or at  at least thats what my belief is is that each state has their own regulations   uhhuh   you know some require uh uh a permit and some dont some require waiting periods and some dont um   right uhhuh we require permits like if youre going to carry a pistol for protection or for whatever reason you you know have you to have a permit for that   right thats thats what it is up here its like that too you need uh as far as a rifle or anything like that no you can just go out and buy it um   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh i i just i just dont feel that uh a stronger restrictions is going to stop a person who really wants to have one for misuse i really dont personally feel that its going to help   no unless its a like one of those automatic weapons   well those we dont need     you know i can see there are uh gun collectors that you know go out and collect all these and there are people that go out and fire on ranges and things     uhhuh uhhuh   um if you want an automatic weapon just for that because you certainly   uhhuh   dont need it going out hunting   no no no   um then i think   somebodys whos into into shooting though like you say sharpshooters or uh that type of thing wouldnt be so bad but uh   yep i yeah i think that should be regulated   uhhuh   those types of weapons as far as a pistol   uhhuh   anybody and uh and their uncle can get a pistol anytime they want um   uhhuh uhhuh i dont think the laws are going to keep them from getting them if they really want one   no no what i   i just i really dont believe that   what i think should happen is uh any violent crime with a weapon with a with a pistol or or a rifle for that matter   uhhuh   i think they should prosecute to the fullest extent of the law   oh definitely definitely   and thats thats what theyre not doing now   uhhuh thats i say if they would use the laws they have on the books i think it would stop quite a bit of what goes on but theyre i dont know it it sometimes seems like theyre too lenient with some things but yet if a guy steals a loaf of bread for their family hes in worse trouble than they are   right they crucify him   yeah   um but yeah i dont know if its i dont know if its the judicial system like the judges that are too lenient   umhum   because there are precedents saying you know well its     uhhuh   he really didnt mean to do it it was a fit of anger or or uh he had too much to drink or he was on dope and he didnt know what he was doing   uhhuh uhhuh   uh i dont really buy that i mean   uhhuh   if he if he drank too much he knew he drank too much or or if he was on dope he knew he was he was what was going to happen when he when he took it   yeah yeah its kind of a cop out   yeah   uhhuh   but yet ive seen some jury trials where the people feel sorry for the whoever did whatever they did   oh you definitely   and they and theyre lenient they go lenient on them and then after they sit there and i read the paper and i say she you know   yeah yeah   um   i think a lot of people put themselves in the place in the place of the person that has done the crime and they think of how they would react and then they dont think anybody could do the things that this person is accused of doing   yep yeah   and i think that sometimes colors some of their feelings on uh   youre probably right uh a lot of cases too it is um in a fit of anger people do things that they regret for the rest of their life   uhhuh uhhuh right right   but yet there are also the others that commit crimes over and over and over again and   right right   theyre out on the street after a short sentence   uhhuh   those are the ones that you know should get the book thrown at them on   they should be kept there and overcrowding of course that has a lot to do with i think a lot of times with uh the type of sentence thats given you know whats available for keeping them   yeah   what   lets yeah um i grew up in a rural area and weve always uh weve always hunted ive hunted for years until i got older and then i i just hung my guns up and i just kind of   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   you know id rather go out with a camera now and and shoot the animals     i dont have a my my my husband and my one boy he hunted uh   yeah well we we passed a or the town passed an ordinance that its against the law now to to shoot a firearm off in the town and its its still a rural area and its still farms and orchards and   so uhhuh uhhuh   and we live right down by next to the reservoir so theres a lot of ducks and you know theres all kinds of wild animals   umhum umhum umhum umhum   and for years it was like a shooting gallery down there   uhhuh well some people have no sense at all in shooting  to know how far to be away from buildings and that to shoot i mean some of them use no s ense at all   right yep yep because we didnt but a neighbor of ours had uh uh a bullet came came through right right through the side of the house and it   uhhuh well weve had that happen in our area also umhum     so but since theyve done that since theyve limited hunting   uhhuh   its been uh the birds are back the animals are back its uh its peaceful   uhhuh uhhuh   so our town got together   uhhuh   so maybe uh communities have to do that if you   well i think it depends on the community now were rural also and our houses are not theyre not that close like we have a shooting range across the road from our home but its far enough away we have fields around it   its a regular oh but   and its its far enough away from you know houses and   yeah   that type of thing that uh   its a what is it like a rod and gun club   no its just our own personal   oh okay so its   we just have a a personal lot yeah yeah   its for you oh okay   now we do have a sportsmans uh club who has a an indoor shooting range and its very nice our our one boy was a sharpshooter he was interested yeah he was interested in that then uh   oh isnt that good yeah   did a   so what is he does he have to follow certain rules and regulations  because hes a uh sharpshooter or   uh no not really he doesnt do it now because hes not here he lives in Pittsburgh now and so he he really hasnt been doing too much shooting lately   yep   but he he really did enjoy it   but but he had to have a special permit to carry a gun from place to place   um i dont think they had to have not for shooting not for their rifles and that it would be just like uh going hunting you dont need a permit to carry you know youre not allowed to carry them loaded or anything like that   oh okay yeah i know right yeah   uh   so you just need a hunting license   no no i dont think so uh the rifles that they use like in their uh uh ROTC now i think they had to they i think they had to do a little bit more when they use them they also had a club at the college here   oh okay yep   that he shot in and   ah okay   they had a few more restrictions there     yeah so he was probably following whatever the protocol was for the military   right right   yeah so i kind of agree with you then that uh uh the only the only thing i would like to see them regulate is is the automatic weapons   yeah theres no theres really no call for for that that type of weapon   but as far as everything else uh if they   uhhuh   if they followed the rules and regulations and the laws that were already in place i think that uh uh that would suffice we wouldnt have to go any further we wouldnt have to put more regulations out there   uhhuh now the lady said they she wanted us to rate from one to ten as to how we felt on a one being uh   thats right a a total ban   yeah   on on   ten ten would be no regulations at all lets see no wait how was it   yeah right ten was no no restrictions whatsoever and one being was uh   okay   uh a total ban   yeah   you know or totally restrictive   yeah   i kind of think uh probably a six i would go with   i would go along with that a happy medium so to speak   uh thats yeah id like to see them restrict just those like i said before those new automatic weapons but the rest of it i dont think they need anymore   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah   okay so i guess we kind of weve solved that problem right   i dont know if we solved it but  it is a problem and it unfortunately uh       im not real crazy about guns myself but being from hunting families i tolerate them   yeah yeah well thats   and i like i like them to learn their safety rules and that and and i think that is good that they have to have a uh now here at least they have a hunters safety course that the the young people have to take before theyre allowed to hunt yes   have to take before they ah thats good that is   they they have to do that before they can get a license to hunt   yeah and any responsible person or any responsible hunter is going to is going to go through some kind of a a course like that um   umhum umhum
