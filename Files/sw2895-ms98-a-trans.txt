                do you have any special menus that you like to use when youre entertaining   well i dont entertain that much anymore unfortunately but uh   yes but we dream   if hum   we dream though   oh yes well i mean you know like for holidays the family gets together so uh i guess youd call that about the same i mean i dont have dinner parties but uh uh i have family gettogethers   yes well   uh and i i guess its about the same thing so uh   are you a traditional cook   well no no i in fact i love to find different things uh im always searching for recipes that are different uh some things are traditional okay uh we always have turkey for Thanksgiving but uh uh there but i always try to add at least one new dish   umhum   uh i find it uh interesting to   yeah   vary it   i do to   so that uh uh but uh uh well i you know it you can do a lot of things the meat is is pretty standard usually i mean you pick a different kind of you pick whatever kind of meat youre going to have and um   sure   you uh can do a a a few things with it you know but uh but i mean as far as salads or vegetables there are so many things that you can do these days that uh   then you can oh yes   it makes it quite a challenge and it depends on whose coming too   yes   uh for a holiday family gettogether i dont make any you know im not real picky about exactly what it is but if were just getting together uh you know for a family uh dinner then i try to keep it as uh fat free and as cholesterol free and you know all that other stuff as i can   yeah i have a soninlaw who is a wonderful cook and uh my daughter reads cookbooks and he cooks but uh for the last few years i have uh had something different for him every holiday uh for Christmas or Thanksgiving whichever one theyre with us and uh i think the two  that have been the biggest hits uh i think one of them came out of the Martha Stewart cookbook youre familiar with Martha Stewart her all of her culinary delights and it was it wasnt all that you know yummy and it it wasnt a lot to eat but it was interesting caramelized caramelized onions   right oh yes umhum oh interesting   and uh you cut them in half and turn them over with the cut you know dont peel them or anything and turn them over with the cut side down and you bake them like two hours and a half on about two seventy five or something like that   umhum   and then when you know until theyre kind of well not really burned they call them caramelized and then you uh you mix up this little uh mixture of cranberries and sugar and a few nuts and uh a little bit of liquid and then you bake that for about thirty minutes and then you its just a really pretty condiment really actually   umhum   and so then you just eat the insides you know the few layers of onions that didnt get hard or anything and then uh then that filling but that was interesting and another interesting one that he liked so well was turnips ive always had a neighbor or two that had wanted to bring me turnips well who not many people like turnips   right   but i did a casserole using half turnips half potatoes Swiss cheese milk and butter and just baked them and it is absolutely wonderful   hum   if and the secret is using half potatoes   right yeah i could see that would be then it wouldnt be such a an overpowering flavor you know it would be uh just just a flavor but not you know the real strong thats the only thing turnips have such a strong flavor to them now i love them raw but   and that Swiss oh i do too oh especially so many people like them to dip in vegetable dip too i think     yes now you know speaking of vegetable dip i was introduced to uh to to something by a girlfriend of mine recently that i never would have dreamed of because of you know usually when you think of a vegetable uh tray you think of uh uh broccoli or cauliflower and and celery and the the you know standard things have you ever tried using raw sweet potato   uhhuh no well im glad to hear about that   try try it i was she she i picked it up i thought it was carrot at first you know we were she just had a veggie tray and i picked it up and tasted i said gee this doesnt taste like carrot she said it isnt   uhhuh   so i took another one just to see if i could figure out what it was and i couldnt and she told me it was raw sweet potato and um it is it i do i do not like sweet potatoes cooked   uhhuh   i do not like them at all uh i really do enjoy them raw  it with this its its not a real uh strong flavor its just kind of light flavor   well ill be darned and youve eaten them do you know when i was growing up my mother wouldnt let us eat raw sweet potatoes she said they were poison   hum oh  my goodness   so so we just you know raw potatoes yes if she was peeling potato and we were you know shed wed want a piece and uh but she wouldnt never let us so i suppose that is a myth isnt it     right   oh yes uh um i hope so because of ive sure eaten a lot of it since i was first introduced to it uh   yes yeah youre still alive and kicking   yeah but uh uh people are quite surprised to find out its just not one of the things that you would think of of putting on the vegetable tray uh   no and it is colorful too   it is colorful adds a lot of color to your tray   well i have spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma and so ive had a wonderful time with Mexican type dishes the Santa Santa Fe influence as well as the TexMex and i have so many wonderful recipes and   oh i love that uhhum uh   my family here i were originally from this part of country   umhum   if i do any of those casseroles especially they will say um this is sort of spicy   yes i know its funny but see im originally from California and my my husband was from New Mexico and uh the first       uhhuh   ten years we were in Maryland my sisterinlaw mailed us care packages of chili peppers and uh things that you couldnt condiments that you couldnt get for Mexican cooking here Spanish cooking you know that uh uh and now of course i can get them all here   yes umhum   you know here in Maryland too because its become popular out here too and they have several Mexican restaurants but when we first moved here twenty years ago we c ouldnt find any kind of you know   finally the Taco Bell started springing up   except for yes uh well we have several uh       very well uh Chi Chi is uh very nice restaurants that uh serve uh uh real good you know Mexican food but but i know uh i have visited my sisterinlaw in New Mexico once or twice and um it is   yeah   its its always refreshing because its so she always fixes something different that ive you know not had so uh i need to try a few more recipes and  but youre right anybody that tastes it even the mild they are so surprised that its uh that spicy   uh umhum um yeah they really dont my friends and relatives really dont like it very well   humum not if its spicy  now you have to either go completely you know and let them add the uh like the salsa or the sauce to it um or um   uhhuh well it   well it depends on what youre making if youre making enchiladas its hard to do that but uh its well its hard to let them add their own you know just to make it spicy you can even the enchilada sauce is a little bit spicy   really umhum well its been fun talking to you   well its nice talking to you   and uh good luck in your uh entertaining or cooking or gettogethers or whatever and dream on       oh yes uh well you too  you too thank you umhum bye bye   byebye
