Resources David L Richardson Comptroller and TreasurerEdward H Faris Director of Information Management Leslie QRussell Director of Information Technology Michael A GenzDirector of Program PerformanceEXECUTIVE SUMMARYThe Legal Services Corporation is a private nonmembershipnonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia The Board ofDirectors of the Corporation is composed of  voting members whoare appointed by the President of the United States with the adviceand consent of the Senate By law the Board is bipartisan no morethan six members can be of the same political partyErlenborn Commission The Erlenborn Commission was authorized bya resolution of the Corporations Board of Directors on November  to study the presence requirement in the Corporationsstatutory restriction on the representation of eligible aliensSince  the Corporations appropriations act and its regulationon the representation of aliens have required that an alien bepresent in the United States to be eligible for legal assistancefrom an LSC grantee Neither the appropriations act nor theCorporations regulations define the term present in the UnitedStates The Commission solicited written comments from the publicand held two public hearings duly noticed in the Federal RegisterThe Report of the Commission is based on a thorough analysis of theapplicable statutory provisions the extensive record compiled fromthe comments and testimony regarding the circumstances under whichrepresentation of eligible aliens occurs and the practices of legalservices grantees relating to eligible aliensScope of alien representation Corporation grantees arepermitted to represent several classes of aliens including lawfulpermanent aliens refugees persons granted asylum and temporaryagricultural workers admitted under the HA program With thesole exception of HA workers LSC grantees may providerepresentation to aliens on the same subjects as is provided tocitizens The report refers to these classes as unrestrictedcategories The representation of HA workers however islimited to matters which arise under the provisions of theworkers specific employment contract in the areas of wageshousing transportation and other employment rights under thecontract The present in the United States requirement applies toboth the unrestricted categories and HA workersOf particular interest to the Commission was the situation ofseasonal agricultural workers a category that includes both aliensfrom the unrestricted categories such as permanent residentaliens and HA workers Seasonal agricultural workers frequentlyleave and reenter the United States thus the presencerequirement would have a substantial and direct impact on theirability to receive legal representation from LSC granteesThe record reveals that it has been a longstanding practice forLSC grantees to provide legal assistance to eligible aliens whohave left the United States at some point during representationThis practice has been followed without objection from theCorporation when conducting audits of LSC grantees or fromagricultural employers and growers associations involved in legaldisputes In addition there has been no formal regulation oropinion of the General Counsels office regarding the specificscope of the presence requirement A recent complaint to theCorporation about the activities of a subgrantee relating to alienrepresentation raised the issue presented to the CommissionStatutory Analysis Applying the principles of law governingstatutory analysis the Commission considered the presencerequirement in light of its plain and ordinary meaning its contextin a statutory scheme and the purpose and design of the statute asa whole See Part IIIA The Corporations appropriations actrequires that an alien must be present in the United States inorder to be eligible for legal assistance Construing the termpresent according to its ordinary meaning it is clear that thestatute requires the alien to be physically present in the UnitedStates at some point This conclusion does not end the inquiryhowever because the relevant question is not whether an alien mustbe physically present in the United States but when the alien mustbe present in order to be entitled to LSC representation Here thelanguage provides no express statement on when an alien must bepresent in the United States Indeed no single interpretation isclearly compelled by the statutory language For example nothingin the LSC authorization language keys representation to when thecause of action arises or specifically requires that the alien bepresent when the representation commences In particular thestatute does not expressly require that an alien be continuouslyphysically present in the United States throughout the period ofrepresentation in order to be eligible for legal assistanceThe factual record and the statutory scheme in which thelanguage arises on the other hand provide an important contextfor consideration of the legal question of when an alien must bepresent in the United States Consideration of the immediatecontext in which the language appears raises further questionsregarding the meaning of the presence requirement The statutesapplication of the presence requirement to legal permanentresidents for example is in some tension with the fact that thosealiens are legally entitled to leave the United States temporarilywithout affecting their immigration status See Part IICFurthermore HA workers by definition are physically present inthe United States only temporarily Reading presence in thestatute to require uninterrupted continuous physical presencewould mean that Congress without using such language intended todeny LSC representation to aliens who engaged infederallyauthorized travel that did not affect their immigrationstatus In the case of HA workers the reading would require theconclusion that Congress intended to provide HA workers withlegal services representation on claims arising from theiremployment contracts only for the very brief periods that theworkers are in the United States  potentially rendering thepromise of legal representation largely meaningless In short anexamination of the language of the presence requirement and thestatutory context in which it arises raises a number ofinterpretive problems and fails to resolve the question of when analien must be present in the United States in order to be entitledto legal services representation The Commission concludes that thestatutory language is ambiguous on this point These difficultiessupport further inquiry into relevant legislative history to helpdetermine the meaning of the presence requirementLegislative History The legislative history of the presencerequirement in the Corporations appropriations and the applicableHA provisions in the Immigration Reform and Control Act confirmthat Congress intended to provide meaningful representation toeligible aliens including HA workers on claims arising fromtheir employment contract and that Congress did not understand thepresence requirement to severely alter or restrict thisrepresentation See Part IIIB The Legal Services Act was adoptedto provide effective legal representation to low income personsThe presence language appeared in the LSC appropriations act aspart of an effort to expand LSC representation to aliens other thanlawful residents and does not appear to have been intended tolimit LSC representation to aliens who were continuously physicallypresent in the United States Similarly the express purpose ofSection  of IRCA was to secure the rights of H agriculturalworkers under the specific contract under which they were admittedto this country Such representation was intended to prevent theexploitation of foreign HA workers and to ensure that the wagesand working conditions of US workers would not be underminedFindings of Fact and Application of Law The record compiled bythe Commission supports inter alia the following findings offact See Part II Aliens in the unrestricted categories oftenlegally leave the country during the course of theirrepresentation See Part IIC Most HA workers are in theUnited States for brief periods of time and do not seek legalrepresentation until they have completed their contract oftenbecause of fear of retaliation by the growers See Part II Cand D Most claims made by aliens take years to resolve SeePart IIE Requiring legal services attorneys to monitor theirclients movements and formally withdraw whenever the client leavesthe country would create extraordinary burdens for the LSCgrantees the clients opposing parties and the courts See PartIIG Finally the private bar and other nonprofit legal servicesproviders are neither available willing nor able to take over therepresentation of these populations See Part IIFThis factual record provided an important context forconsideration of the legal question of the meaning of the presencerequirement Three possible interpretations of the presencelanguage were listed in the Corporations Federal Register notice an alien must be physically present in the United States whenthe cause of action for which the recipient provides legalassistance arises  an alien must be physically present onlywhen legal representation is commenced and  an alien must bephysically present in the United States any time the alien isprovided legal assistance from an LSC grantee Upon carefulconsideration of the findings of fact the language and purposes ofthe statute and the legislative history the Commission hasdetermined that none of these formulations fully responds to thepurposes of the statute or the intent of Congress Furthermore therecord demonstrates that the interpretations initially offered bythe Corporation in the Federal Register notice would contradictCongress clear purpose of providing meaningful legalrepresentation to indigent lawful aliens and lead to absurdresults See Part IIICFor example as applied to the unrestricted aliens suchinterpretations would preclude representation for permanentresident aliens who are evicted from their apartments or againstwhom divorce proceedings were commenced while the alien is legallyout of the country for brief periods to attend a family emergencyor funeral These interpretations would also invite exploitation byallowing litigants to simply wait until an alien temporarilydeparted the United States before cutting off workers compensationbenefits or initiating eviction repossession or divorce orcustody proceedingsIn regard to HA workers the record demonstrates thatCongress purpose of providing meaningful representation to theseworkers cannot be accomplished under the three interpretations inthe Federal Register Many of the contract rights of such workerssuch as reimbursement for return transportation workerscompensation the  guarantee and claims that a grower failed tomail the workers final paycheck often do not arise until afterthe worker has returned home In addition if the worker isrequired to be in the United States throughout the course of therepresentation the right to legal assistance would be lostaltogether By law HA workers must leave the country at the endof their contract period and most such workers are in the UnitedStates for only two to five months The factual record before theCommission demonstrates that the vast majority of the claims ofHA workers cannot be completed while the alien is in the UnitedStates The Commission recognizes that representation ofagricultural workers was a central element in the legislativecrafting of the HA program The Commission concludes that thisreading of the statute would essentially bar LSC representation ofthis class of aliens and leave HA workers without meaningfulrepresentation on their employment contract claims directlycontrary to Congress express purpose We decline to sanction sucha resultConclusion Together the language purpose and legislativehistory of the applicable statutes and the factual record beforethe Commission suggest an interpretation of the statute that wouldauthorize the following representationFor an alien in one of the unrestricted categoriesrepresentation would be authorized so long as the eligible alien ispresent sufficient to maintain residence or lawful immigrationstatus Under this interpretation LSC grantees who have begunrepresentation of a permanent resident alien may continue thatrepresentation should the alien be temporarily outside the UnitedStates Grantees may also initiate representation of aliens in theunrestricted categories who are temporarily outside the UnitedStates provided that they have been present sufficient to maintainand have not abandoned their residence or INA status LSC granteesmay not represent aliens in this category who have never entered orbeen present in the United StatesFor HA workers representation is authorized if the workershave been admitted to and have been present in the United Statespursuant to an HA contract and the representation arises undertheir HA contract LSC grantees are authorized to litigate thisnarrow range of claims to completion despite the fact that thealien may be required to depart the United States prior to orduring the course of the representation LSC grantees may notrepresent aliens in this category who have never entered or beenpresent in the United StatesI INTRODUCTIONThe Erlenborn Commission was established to evaluate the scopeof permissible representation for eligible aliens by LSC granteesSince  the Corporations appropriations act and its regulationon the representation of aliens have required that an alien bepresent in the United States to be eligible for legal assistancefrom an LSC grantee Neither the appropriations act nor theCorporations regulations defines the term present in the UnitedStates The Legal Services Corporation Board of Directors adoptedResolution  on November   providing authority toestablish the Commission with the express purpose of studying thepresence requirement for the representation of eligible aliensLSC grantees are permitted to represent several classes ofaliens including lawful permanent aliens refugees personsgranted asylum and temporary agricultural workers admitted underthe HA program With the sole exception of HA workers LSCgrantees may provide general representation to aliens on all thesame subjects as is provided to citizens These classes will bereferred to as unrestricted categories The representation ofHA workers however is limited to matters which arise under theworkers specific employment contract in the areas of wageshousing transportation and other employment rights The presentin the United States requirement applies to both the unrestrictedcategories and to HA workersThe Commission has gathered an extensive factual record TheCommission solicited comments from the public through a notice dulypublished in the Federal Register  Fed Reg   TheCommission sought public comments on the facts and circumstancessurrounding the representation of all eligible aliens who areaffected by the presence requirement It placed particular emphasison seasonalagricultural workers which includes temporary HA workers aswell as aliens from the unrestrictedcategories such as permanent resident aliens and specialagricultural workers SAWS The Federal Register notice asked thatcomments be directed to the following questions How long are seasonal agricultural workers typically in theUnited States The programs name is derived from the subparagraph of theImmigration and Nationality Act INA that defines the status USC  aHiia  an alien having residencein a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning who iscoming temporarily to the United States to perform agriculturallabor or services    of a temporary or seasonal nature See  USC  h  Seasonal agricultural work isdefined in the INA as the performance of field work related toplanting cultural practices cultivating growing and harvestingof fruits and vegetables of every kind and other perishablecommodities as defined in regulations by the Secretary ofAgriculture Id See  USC  aB An alien is eligible forclassification as a special agricultural worker if he or she hasresided in the United States and performed seasonal agriculturalwork in the United States for at least  mandays during thetwelve month period ending May  When does the seasonal agricultural worker normally seeklegal representationWhat are the common claims of seasonal agriculturalworkers seeking legal representationWhen do the claims of seasonal agricultural workersgenerally ripenHow long does it typically take to resolve seasonalagricultural workers legal claimsWhat is the established practice of LSC recipients inrepresenting seasonal agricultural workersWhat is the likelihood that private counsel is availableto represent aliens who are in the United States under temporaryvisas or who may temporarily leave the United StatesUnder what circumstances do seasonal agricultural workerscommonly leave theUnited StatesWhat are the implications of the presence requirement onrecipient attorneys professional obligations to theirclientsThe Federal Register notice identified a number of possibleinterpretations of the presence requirement  an alien must bephysically present in the United States when the cause of actionfor which the recipient provides legal assistance arises  analien must be physically present when legal representation iscommenced and  an alien must be physically present in theUnited States any time the alien is provided legal assistance froman LSC grantee This Report of the Commission identifies thecurrent interpretation used by LSC grantees and the impact ofalternative interpretations on all categories of eligiblealiensThe Commission held hearings at  Duke

Appropriations Act of Pub L No  tit V  a  Stat  emphasis addedA statutory term is to be interpreted based on its plain andordinary meaning in light of its context and the purpose anddesign of the statute as a whole It is a fundamental principleof statutory construction that the meaning of a word cannot bedetermined in isolation but must be drawn from the context inwhich it is used Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine DivAvco Corp v United Automobile Aerospace  AgriculturalImplement Workers of America Intl Union  US   SCt   citation omitted The plainness or ambiguityof statutory language is determined by reference to the languageitself the specific context in which that language is used andthe broader context of the statute as a whole Robinson v ShellOil Co  US    see also Bailey v UnitedStates  US    We consider not only the baremeaning of the word but also its placement and purpose in thestatutory scheme Moreover it is a wellestablished rule thatCongress is presumed not to have intended absurd results SeeUnited States v XCitement Video Inc  US   citing Public Citizen v United States Department of Justice US    cf Green v Bock Laundry Mach Co US    Scalia J concurring We areconfronted here with a statute which if interpreted literallyproduces an absurd and perhaps unconstitutional result Our taskis to give some alternative meaning to the language that avoidsthis consequence   Analyzed in light of these canons of interpretation theCorporations appropriations act requires that an alien must bepresent in the United States in order to be eligible for legalassistance Construing the term present according to itsordinary meaning it is clear that the statute requires the aliento bephysically present in the United States at some point Thisconclusion does not end the inquiry however because the questionbefore the Commission is not whether an alien must be physicallypresent in the United States but when the alien must be present inorder to be entitled to LSC representation Here the languageprovides no express statement on when an alien must be present inthe United States and other familiar terms of immigration law suchas continuous physical presence are not usedThe factual record and the statutory scheme in which thelanguage arises on the other hand provide an important contextfor consideration of the legal question of when an alien must bepresent in The statutory provision is implemented in the corporationsalien eligibility rule  CFR pt   The term United States is defined in the INA and Part as the continental United States Alaska Hawaii Puerto RicoGuam and the Virgin Islands of the United States See idh  USC athe United States As the Corporation has noted the statutorylanguage may be read alternately to require that  an alien mustbe physically present in the United States when the cause of actionfor which the recipient provides legal assistance arises  analien must be physically present only when legal representation iscommenced or  an alien must be physically present in the UnitedStates any time the alien is provided legal assistance from an LSCgrantee No single interpretation however is clearly compelledby the statutory language For example nothing in the LSCauthorization language keys representation to when the cause ofaction arises or specifically requires that the alien be presentwhen the representation commences In particular the statute doesnot expressly require that an alien be continuously physicallypresent in the United States throughout the period ofrepresentation in order to be eligible for legal assistanceConsideration of the immediate context in which the languageappears raises further questions regarding the meaning of thepresence requirement The statutes application of the presencerequirement to legal permanent residents for example is in sometension with the fact that those aliens are legally entitled toleave the United States temporarily without affecting theirimmigration status See discussion supra Part IICFurthermore HA workers by definition are physically present inthe United States only temporarily Reading presence in thestatute to require uninterrupted continuous physical presencewould mean that Congress without using such language intended todeny LSC representation to aliens who engaged infederallyauthorized travel that did not affect their immigrationstatus In the case of HA workers the reading would require theconclusion that Congress intended to provide HA workers withlegal services representation on claims arising from theiremployment contracts only for the very brief periods that theworkers are in the United States  potentially rendering thepromise of legal representation largely meaningless Thesedifficulties support further inquiry into the meaning of thepresence requirementIn short an examination of the language of the presencerequirement and the statutory context in which it arises raises anumber of interpretive problems and fails to resolve the questionof when an alien must be present in the United States in order tobe entitled to legal services representation The Commissionconcludes that the statutory language is ambiguous on thispointB Legislative History Origins of the Presence RequirementThe legislative history provides assistance in analyzing thepresence requirement The LSC Act of  as amended was adoptedto provide equal access to the system of justice in our Nation forindividuals who seek redress of grievances    to provide highquality legal assistance to those who would otherwise be unable toafford adequate legal counsel    and to provide legalassistance to those who face an economic barrier to adequate legalcounsel  USC    The LSC Act itself  Fed Reg   includes no restrictions on the provision of legal assistance byLSC recipients to aliens However in the early s Congressbegan restricting legal assistance to aliens by LSC recipientspursuant to provisos in the Corporations appropriations actsOriginally these provisos permitted the use of LSC funds for legalassistance to an alien if the alien was a resident of the UnitedStates and fell within one of the permissible alien categoriesall of which required that an alien was in lawful status Seeeg Fiscal Year Appropriations  Pub L No   Stat  Fiscal Year Appropriations  PubL No   Stat   and a long series ofcontinuing resolutions which included the residency requirementResidence is a term of art within the meaning of immigration lawand is not synonymous with physical presence In re Olan  FSupp  SD Cal  Resident aliens are allowed to enterand leave the United States temporarily without relinquishing theirstatus See discussion infra Part II C Thus prior to FY LSC recipients were authorized to represent aliens who werelegal residents of the United States regardless of whether thealien was absent from the United States during some part of therepresentationIn drafting the Corporations Fiscal Year FY appropriations act Congress for the first time replaced thelanguage resident of the United States with present in theUnited States Departments of Commerce Justice and State theJudiciary and Related Appropriations Act  Pub L  Stat   The legislative history reveals no explanationfor this change The phrase present in the United States appearsto have originated in proposed legislation that would have expandedthe categories of aliens eligible for LSC funded representationThe shift in language may have been based From before the  amendment until  the categories ofeligible aliens included  an alien lawfully admitted forpermanent residence  an alien who was either married to aUnited States citizen or was a parent or an unmarried child underthe age of twentyone years of such a citizen and who had filed anapplication for adjustment of status under the INA  an alienwho was lawfully present in the United States as a refugee or whohad been granted asylum by the Attorney General  an alien whowas lawfully present in the United States as a result of theAttorney Generals withholding of deportation and  an alienlawfully present in the United States as a result of being grantedconditional entry See eg Public Laws       The term residence is defined in the INA as the place ofgeneral abode the place ofgeneral abode of a person means hisprincipal actual dwelling place in fact without regard to intent USC a  The expanded list of eligible aliens included  spousesparents and unmarried citizens sic children of permanentresidents  Cuban and Haitian entrants as defined in paragraph or of  e of Public Law  as in effect on April   persons paroled into theUnited States and  alienseligible for derivative US citizenship under  d of theImmigration and Nationality Act HR REP NO  at  Spouses and parents of permanent residents could only be inthe United States if at all in temporary nonimmigrantclassification and therefore would not be residents of the UnitedStateson the recognition that aliens in some of the proposedcategories would not possess residence in the United States underthe meaning of the INA for example parolees and CubanHaitianentrants As noted above the requirement of presence isfrequently used in immigration laws to describe categories ofaliens within the United States who may not have establishedresidence The proposed legislation was defeated but the phrasepresent in the United States replaced the residence languagefound in earlier statutes The new language received virtually nodiscussion nothing in the legislative history suggests thatCongress intended to adopt new or more stringent restrictions onalien representation Statements in the Senate suggest thatCongress may not have been aware that the presence languagesurvived the defeat of the amendment In short the FY change appears to have been the result of the proposal to expandLSC representation to aliens who were merely present as opposedto lawful residents There is no evidence that Congress intended todeprive permanent resident aliens of continuous representation upontheir leaving the country Following the statutory change LSCissued no new regulations interpreting the language Congresscalled for no new interpretation and LSC grantee practice did notchange HA RepresentationIn  Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Actof  which expressly authorized

representation  including thepresence requirement  that had been included annually in theCorporations appropriations act Indeed Congress crafted theprovision in IRCA permitting HA representation to be consistentwith the language in the LSC appropriations act Thus IRCA deemedHAs to be permanent resident aliens a category eligible forLSC legal assistance  for the purposes of receiving legalassistance from the Corporation According to the comment fromRepresentative Berman provided to the Commission Congress wasaware of the presence requirement and intended that the requirementbe consistent with the provision of meaningful representation tothe HA workers under IRCAThose of us who actively participated in drafting section granting LSC the ability to represent HA workers and HAeligibility for such services were very much aware of thealienrepresentation restrictions in the annual LSC appropriationsbills Congress did not view the present in the United Stateslanguage in the appropriations bill as limiting the representationof HA workers to the time period during which they remained inthe United States The HA workers presence in the United Statesunder the temporary worker visa entitled them to LSCeligibilityApril Comments at  comment of Howard L Berman Member ofCongress HA workers were to be treated as permanent legalresidents for the limited purpose of legal services representationfor claims on their contractsThis legislative history suggests that Congress with fullknowledge that HA workers were only in the United States on atemporary basis intended that their rights under their HAcontracts be protected by being given access to meaningful legalservices Nothing in the congressional debate discussing the Section  of IRCA provided thatA nonimmigrant worker admitted to or permitted to remain in theUnited States under section aHa of the Immigrationand Nationality Act    for agricultural labor or service shallbe considered to be an alien described in section a of suchAct a permanent resident alien   for purposes of establishingeligibility for legal assistance under the Legal ServicesCorporation Act  USC  et seq But only with respect tolegal matters relating to wages housing transportation and otheremployment rights as provided in the workers specific contractunder which the nonimmigrant was admittedlimitation of legal services to rights under the HA contractever suggested that representation could last only as long as theHA worker remained in the United States Therefore we shouldchoose the interpretation of presence that effectuates theCongressional purpose to provide meaningful representation to HAworkers under their contracts  Continuing ResolutionIn the  Omnibus Continuing Resolution Congress revised therestrictions on alien assistance by applying the restrictions toall funds received by LSC entities Pub L No   Stat Congress also for the first time explicitly added HAworkers to the categories of aliens eligible for legal assistanceunder the LSC appropriations act although that assistance remainedlimited to claims under the workers employment contract The othercategories of aliens and the presence requirement were retainedOmnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act Pub L No   Stat  incorporating byreference Omnibus Consolidated Recissions and Appropriations Act of  a Pub L No   Stat  Nothingabout the application of the is present language to the aliencategories was alteredThe legislative history of the  revision contains nodiscussion of the present in the United States requirement and noindication that Congress sought to alter existing practiceregarding the representation of aliens See March Comments at comment of Alan Houseman Center for Law  Social Policy TheMcCollumStenholm bill on which the  appropriations werebased did not address the presence requirement and the statementaccompanying the introduction of that bill noted only that the billincorporated the provisions from IRCA into the existingappropriations provisions on representation of certain aliens Seeid Thus the  revision simply brought together in one placethe preexisting provisions regarding representation of aliens andapplied these restrictions to all funds of an LSC recipientNeither the language nor the legislative history of the statutesuggest that Congress intended to alter the application of thepresence requirementIn sum the legislative history of the presence requirementconfirms that Congress intended to provide meaningfulrepresentation to eligible aliens including HA workers on claimsarising from their employment contract and that Congress did notunderstand the presence requirement to severely alter or restrictthis representation The Legal Services Act was adopted to provideeffective legal representation to low income persons See AprilTestimony at  testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural LegalAssistance Program The presence language appeared in the LSCappropriations act as part of an effort to expand LSCrepresentation to aliens other than lawful residents and does notappear to have been intended to limit LSC representation to alienswho were continuously physically present in the United StatesSimilarly the express purpose of section  of IRCA was tosecure the rights of H agricultural workers under the specificcontract under which they were admitted to this country See HCONF REP NO   Such representation was intended toprevent the exploitation of foreign HA workers and to ensure thatthe wages and working conditions of US workers would not beundermined Finally nothing in the  legislation altered theeffect of the presence requirement on HAs or any other aliencategoryC Implications of the Presence RequirementThe factual record provides an important context forconsideration of the legal question of the meaning of the presencerequirement for representation by LSC grantees As noted abovethree possible interpretations of the presence language were listedin the Corporations Federal Register notice  an alien must bephysically present in the United States when the cause of actionfor which the recipient provides legal assistance arises  analien must be physically present only when legal representation iscommenced and  an alien must be physically present in theUnited States any time the alien is provided legal assistance froman LSC grantee Upon careful consideration of the language andpurposes of the statute and the legislative history the Commissionhas determined that none of these formulations fully responds tothe purposes of the statute or the intent of Congress Furthermorethe record demonstrates that the interpretations initially offeredby the Corporation in the Federal Register notice would contradictCongress clear purpose of providing meaningful legalrepresentation to indigent lawful aliens and lead to absurdresults Unrestricted CategoriesIn giving content to the presence requirement it is importantto distinguish between the unrestricted categories of aliens andHA workers The record before the Commission establishes thatpermanent residents and other aliens frequently leave the UnitedStates to visit spouses and children to address family problemsand to survive during long periods of unemployment in the UnitedStates The category of permanent residents includes commuteraliens who work in the United States but whose actual residence isacross the border in Mexico All of these aliens are legallyauthorized to leave and reenter the United StatesAs applied to the situation of unrestricted aliens the threeinterpretations of the presence requirement suggested in theFederal Register notice would lead to unintended and absurdresults Under an interpretation that the alien must be physicallypresent when the cause of action commenced or legal representationbegan an alien who was evicted from her apartment or against whomdivorce proceedings were commenced while she was temporarily out ofthe United States to attend a funeral or attend to a familyemergency would be barred from LSC representation LSC attorneysrepresenting commuter aliens who migrate daily would be placed inthe predicament of representing such aliens only in claims thathappened to arise during the portion of the day when the alien wasin the United States Under an interpretation that the alien mustbe physically present when the representation commenced an alienwho was temporarily outside the United States would be barred fromobtaining legal services representation on  Fed Reg   any matter during her absence These interpretations would alsoinvite exploitation by allowing litigants to simply wait until analien temporarily departed the United States before cutting offworkers compensation benefits initiating eviction repossessiondivorce or child custody proceedings or otherwise triggering thecause of action or a need for representation US agriculturalrecruiters in Mexico could willfully misrepresent workingconditions to permanent legal residents across the border knowingthe alien would be barred from legal assistance on herfederallyprotected MSWPA claimRequiring a permanent legal resident alien to be physicallypresent in the United States throughout the course of LSC legalrepresentation would also be unworkable and lead to absurd resultsThe record is undisputed that many of the kinds of lawsuitsinvolving permanent resident aliens and other unrestricted alienstake months if not years to reach a conclusion and thatpermanent residents and other eligible aliens regularly traveloutside the United States An interpretation that required thealien to be continuously present throughout the course of thelitigation would confront indigent aliens with the Hobsons choiceof either accepting representation or visiting their familiesabroadMoreover requiring legal services attorneys to monitor theirclients movements and formally withdraw whenever the client leftthe country would creating extraordinary burdens for the LSCgrantees the clients opposing parties and the courts Anattorney whose client had to travel to Mexico to attend herfathers funeral for example would have to withdraw from the caseduring the clients absence See April Testimony at testimony of Sylvia Argueta Mexican American Legal Defense andEducation Fund LSC attorneys representing alien clients living inborder communities would face the prospect that they could work ona clients case in the morning when the client was in El Paso butnot in the afternoon when the client was shopping in Juarez SeeApril Testimony at  testimony of Lynn Coyle Lawyers Committeefor Civil Rights Under Law Application of this interpretation tothe USMexico border would disrupt access of permanent legalresidents to the legal system in the poorest region of the UnitedStates See March Comments at  comment of Michael Wyatt TexasRural Legal Aid et al It also would provide perverse incentivesto opposing litigants to drag out legal proceedings with theexpectation that an alien might have to temporarily depart from thecountry or engage in other forms of procedural abuse See MarchComments at  comment of Keith S Ernst Attorney at Law MarchComments at  comment of Jose Padilla and Cynthia L RiceCalifornia Rural Legal Assistance April Testimony at testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal AssistanceThe private bar and other nonprofit legal services providers areneither available willing or able to take over the representationof these populations As one witness with extensive experienceorganizing private pro bono activities put it the likelihood thatprivate lawyers will take on clients who would be excluded from LSCrepresentation by the stringent interpretation of the presencerequirement is zero April Testimony at  testimony of JackLonden Attorney at LawThe legislative history contains no evidence that Congressintended LSC representation of legal permanent residents and otheraliens to turn on the accident of where an alien happened to be atthe moment the cause of action arose or the litigation commencedor to require the alien to be continuously physically presentthroughout the course of representation The Commission does notbelieve that Congress intended to force resident aliens to choosebetween temporary trips outside the United States and continuedrepresentation in pending litigation The Commission has not beenable to discern any congressional purpose that would be served bytying the right to representation on movements that have no effecton either the aliens lawful immigration status or her legal rightto pursue her claim in US courts The Commission is unwilling torecommend an interpretation of the statute that produces suchconsequences absent an express congressional intent that suchburdens be imposed HA AliensThe factual record before the Commission demonstrates thatCongress purpose of providing meaningful representation to HAworkers for claims arising under their employment contracts cannotbe accomplished under the original interpretations offered in theFederal Register notice Many of the contract rights that weremandated by Congress in IRCA  such as reimbursement for returntransportation workers compensation the  guarantee and claimsthat a grower failed to mail the workers final paycheck  oftendo not arise until after the worker has returned home Arequirement that the HA worker be physically present in theUnited States when the cause of action arises or the representationcommences thus would deprive HA workers of representation on manyof the most basic employment contract protections afforded byCongress directly contrary to Congress purpose As a practicalmatter this interpretation would also bar most other legalrepresentation for HA workers since the record clearlydemonstrates that due to their fear of losing their jobs theirisolation lack of resources and language skills andvulnerability HA workers often are both unwilling and unable tocontact a legal services office until after they have left theiremployment HA aliens are required by law to leave the countrywithin ten days of the termination of their employment andgenerally remain in the control of the employer during thisperiodThe interpretations could also create incentives for abuse Aninterpretation that the representation must commence while thealien is still in the United States would encourage employers tocreate even greater obstacles to access to legal services while theworkers are physically in the United States Employers whosuccessfully excluded legal services representatives from theirlabor camps or intimidated workers into not contacting legalservices during the course of employment could ensure a workforcewithout access to legal representation Under an interpretationthat the claim must arise while the worker was in the UnitedStates unscrupulous employers would be able to exploit the systemby for example failing to mail a final paycheck or  guaranteepayment after the HA worker left the country with knowledge thatthe worker would not be entitled to legal representation on theclaimAlternatively an interpretation of the presence requirementthat required HA workers to be present in the United Statesthroughout the course of the representation would eviscerate theirright to legal representation altogether HA workers bydefinition are required to leave the United States within a yearand the record establishes that most HA workers are physicallypresent in the United States for only two to five months Therecord establishes that with the exception of the most minor andundisputed claims none of the employment claims for which Congressauthorized representation can be completed during the brief periodthat the HA worker is in the country even if the claim aroseearly during the workers stay and the worker was immediately ableto contact legal services Many of the claims of HA workers arelegally complex and all take months if not years to litigate tocompletion The contradiction between this interpretation andCongress purpose of providing meaningful representation for HAworkers is patent The interpretation assumes that Congress tookfrom HA workers with one hand what it gave with the other Thelaw will not impute such a purpose to CongressThe factual record moreover demonstrates the absurdity of thisapproach As the record shows it is not uncommon for HA workersto contact legal services for the first time as they board the buson the way home and an interpretation that LSC representation isavailable only while the alien is physically present creates theprospect that Congress authorized legal services attorneys torepresent such HA workers only during the bus ride to the borderThe rule again would invite exploitation Employers could veto aworkers decision to seek legal representation by terminating theworker and immediately deporting her See March Comments at comment of Shelley Latin Virginia Farmworkers Legal AssistanceProject March Comments at  comment of Melissa A PershingLegal Services of North Carolina March Comments at  commentof Lisa Butler Florida Rural Legal Services Employers wishing toavoid paying workers compensation could deny coverage until theworker was no longer in the country or discontinue payments afterthe worker had returned home Opposing litigants and HA employerscould prolong the legal process simply by refusing to return legalservice attorneys phone calls or delaying provision of records towhich the worker was entitled to ensure that the HA worker leftthe United States before a dispute could be resolved See MarchComments at  comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services ofNorth Carolina March Testimony at  testimony of Garry GGeffert West Virginia Legal Services Plan In all of these caseslegal services would be barred from assisting the worker in thesevalid employment contract claimsIn short the record is clear that HA workers are unlikely toraise legal claims before the end of their employment contractthat they are required to leave the United States at the end oftheir contracts that many of their claims arise after theirdeparture and that legal proceedings cannot be completed beforethey depart Furthermore the availability of legal services forHA workers from nonLSC funded nonprofit organizations andprivate attorneys is extremely limited and government agencieseither lack the resources or the legal authority to enforce thestatutory rights of these workers The Commission recognizes thatrepresentation of agricultural workers was a central element in thelegislative crafting of the HA program We conclude that areading of the statute that would bar representation of an HAworker based on the fact that he or she has left the United Stateswould leave HA workers without meaningful representation on theiremployment contract claims directly contrary to Congress expresspurpose and we decline to sanction such a resultIV CONCLUSION THE MEANING OF THE PRESENCE REQUIREMENTTogether the language purpose and legislative history of theapplicable statutes and the factual record before the Commissionsuggest an interpretation of the statute that would authorize thefollowing representationFor an alien in one of the unrestricted categoriesrepresentation would be authorized so long as the eligible alien ispresent sufficient to maintain residence or lawful immigrationstatus Under this interpretation LSC grantees who have begunrepresentation of a permanent resident alien may continue thatrepresentation should the alien be temporarily outside the UnitedStates Grantees may also initiate representation of aliens in theunrestricted categories who are temporarily outside the UnitedStates provided that they have been present sufficient to maintainand have not abandoned their residence or INA status LSC granteesmay not represent aliens in this category who have never entered orbeen present in the United StatesFor HA workers representation is authorized if the workershave been admitted to and have been present in the United Statespursuant to an HA contract and the representation arises undertheir HA contract LSC grantees are authorized to litigate thisnarrow range of claims to completion despite the fact that thealien may be required to depart the United States prior to orduring the course of the representation LSC grantees may notrepresent aliens in this category who have never entered or beenpresent in the United StatesAs discussed above this interpretation comports with thelanguage of the presence requirement in light of Congress objectand purpose The language and legislative history of the LSCappropriations acts and the HA statute make clear that Congressintended to provide meaningful legal representation to aliens inthe designated categories and there is no evidence that Congressconsidered the presence requirement to severely restrict thisinterpretation To the contrary the presence requirement wasinserted into the statute for the apparent purpose of expanding LSCrepresentation of legal aliens Moreover as interpreted by theCommission the presence requirement sustains Congress clear goalsince the early s of restricting LSC representation to alienswith lawful statusThe Commissions interpretation also comports with theconsistent practice of LSC grantees and the understanding ofgrowers and of Congress As noted above LSC grantees haveregularly provided legal assistance to eligible aliens who haveleft the United States at some point during the representation LSChas never taken action against a recipient which continued torepresent alien clients after the client had left the UnitedStates Until recently critics of legal services recipients whohad knowledge of the alien representation practices of legalservices recipients never questioned the legality of a recipientsrepresentation of an alien after the alien had left the UnitedStates It is well settled that a history of practice under astatute can aid in its interpretation particularly when Congresshas amended the statute without disapproving of the administrativepractice NLRB v Hendricks County Rural Elec MembershipCorp US    In this case the practices of LSCrecipients of growers and of Congress all support theCommissions interpretationFinally the Commissions interpretation of the presencerequirement is fully consistent with the overarching purpose of therelevant congressional statutes The Legal Services Act was adoptedto provide full and effective legal representation to low incomepersons In enacting the LSC Act Congress declared the need toprovide equal access to the nations system of justice forindividuals who seek redress of grievances and said attorneysproviding legal assistance must have full freedom to protect thebest interests of their clients in keeping with the Code ofProfessional Responsibility the Canon of Ethics and the highstandards of the legal profession The protections of the HAstatute were adopted inter alia to ensure that the employment offoreign workers would not undermine the wages and workingconditions of US workers and Congress provided legal servicesrepresentation to secure the rights of H agricultural workersunder their employment contracts The record before the Commissionis undisputed that LSC entities cannot provide full and meaningfulrepresentation to HA workers and to many other eligible aliensunder the alternative constructions of the presence requirementSee March Comments at  comment
