              hi   well i still dont trust them im sorry     you dont   i probably never will   i dont i dont think they have enough control to really uh       to really do anything against us i think i dont think theyre as strong as we think they are personally but yeah but i see what i see your point because you know they they feed us propaganda   uhhuh   and we never know what theyre thinking   thats right i dont trust maybe i guess its because of the way what happened over there with their own people how they threw him out of power and you know just a big uproar but then you know me and my husband always talk about it because theyre running out of money   right sure   you know and what are they going to do when they run out of food are they going to just attack us and take it  it makes you wonder   right   because you know we already we have enough problems over here that we dont need  to be trying to help everybody else which that that gets on my nerves too but   right well i think taking you know when we        took that uh went to war with Iraq i think we that was kind of a uh display of power   yeah   and i think we showed i think the Soviet Union knows what we have and knows that were pretty serious and if they ever tried to do anything we would we would be on the offensive   yeah but i dont i think they have just as much see but i dont know i i think that they have better like we you know when we go over in Iraq and Iran thats different country but i think see thats why they dont have anything in the Soviet Union they spent more money on um what do you call um military power than anything they have more of a expense of military than we do   yeah but are they going to have the backing from the people you know   well now see thats another problem is they have it in their own thing with all this uh what do you call it uh breaking up of the Soviet Union right now i doubt if they had a help of anybody in their country   right right because theres fifteen different republics   theyre having so many right now  its like whoa  so i dont know if they would have   yeah       you know but it just depends on when   right   they do it so i guess it would depend on what what state that theyre in   right   when they do it but i still wouldnt trust them not i would trust them only so much   well right i dont i dont even think we should you know i i dont think its a matter of trust even anymore i mean its just       okay you lay this down well lay this down but that doesnt mean we were not were going to stop watching you and making sure youre not   umhum   you know   doing what you supposed to do   right   but i think thats what theyre trying to do is to get us to do everything you know and them not really do anything because whos checking them   i dont know     you know i think that not only if we check them theyre not going its just like coming over here in the United States the government dont tell you everything   i know it   they feel they dont have to which i agree   right   because if you tell everybody everything everybody in the world would know because theyd put it on TV   right   and that wouldnt do us any good so     right i just a you know that thats another thing that scares me is our country   theyre so into TV   you know what are we doing   umhum   what are they actually telling us and after you know what happened the other day with that uh CIA guy you know   umhum   how much is what all the wars were getting into and all this you know the messes were were involving us ourselves with   that we really dont that we dont know about   right  is that true or you know is it was Panama really a threat   how much of it is true and how much and how much of it is propaganda   right   you know what are what are what are we supposed to believe   right   but i dont i dont trust the government here more than i trust you know to a point   thats the thing im having a hard time with   but then just like im not going to trust another government just because   right   theres no way especially when theyve been such a oh a power to us you know a force that we have to watch constantly a threat but yet now theyre going to be our friends   right umhum   no thats like Little Red Riding Hood to me   huh   you know letting the wolf in and saying oh thats okay   yeah really     were going to sit here but were not were going to watch each other and i think whoever wins the the wait is probably the one   well if it just keeps on going and nobody ever does anything thats fine with me   yeah as long as i dont care about that they can do whatever they want but i dont want it to get to
