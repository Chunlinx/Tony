                                 Remembering the Holocaust                           A FineTunedInstrumentalization                                       Editors note What follows in an exchange between Peter Novick authorof The Holocaust in American Life  and James Young one of theparticipants in last weeks  in which Novicks book was discussed Bothletters are reprinted with the authors permission                        DearJames            I am appealing to James at leisure to overturn thejudgment of James in haste I apologize for the fact that as with manyappellate briefs detailing the grounds for the appeal will require a fairamount of space            In your exchange with Philip Gourevitch about mybook The Holocaust in American Life  you wrote the following apropos ofwhat you termed the socalled lessons of the Holocaust or why we recall theHolocaust at all I would suggest contra Novick that not everyinstitutional memory of the Holocaust is a deliberate instrumentalization of ittoward cheap and selfinterested ends You add that I am actually quite goodat ferreting out many of the instances where this is indeed the case            Im not sure what the word institutional meanshereie how an institution remembers Holocaust memory of course becomesinstitutionalized in curricula in a canon of Holocaust literature morediffusely institutionalized in popularparticularly JewishconsciousnessLets turn to instrumentalizationa word which appears to carry a strongnegative charge for you As you know I never myself use that word or itscognates concerning collective memory The reason made clear more than oncein the book is that I think collective memories that really take holdalways do so because they serve a present or continuing purpose That isto say memories take hold to the extent that they areif one wants to use thewordinstrumental for some purpose As you will recall I make a partialexception for certain forms of religious or civicreligious commemoration atthe very beginning of my chapter on lessons Remembering the Holocaustespecially for Jews needs no pragmatic justification It is an act of pietyanalogous to reciting the Mourners Kaddish on the anniversary of a relativesdeath to the remembrance of war dead on Memorial Day In the introduction Ipoint out that historically Jewish memoryeven religious memoryhas beenselective Events that seem to contemporaries to point up a useful contemporarylesson are incorporated into collective memory those that dont seem to teachuseful lessons recede though they may be recovered later as perceptionschange about what lessons are useful And a fortiori this is true of secularmemory Thus for me  to say that a collective memory is instrumentalis to say nothing that isnt implicit in its being a collective memoryFor me  to say that Holocaust memory is instrumentalized says nothingworth saying and certainly nothing invidious or discreditable            For you and othersinstrumentalization is invidiousand discreditable By not explainingwhy it is invidioussimply taking this for grantedand saying that Itreat Holocaust memory in America as all instrumental you attribute to methe view that American Holocaust memory is somehow discreditable I think weought to explore how you use the word and thus the view youre attributing tome Are you saying that memories in general or memories of the Holocaust inparticular are instrumentalized when they are used for unworthy  orat least inappropriate purposes Lets consider those purposes for whichthe memory of the Holocaust has been invoked which are the ones I discussmost in my book These include both Jewishspecific and generalpurposes                           To rouse the conscience of the world about perceived threats to the JewsHitler missed in Israel               To reinforce Jewish solidarity so that having survived Hitler Jews willnot disappear through assimilation               To warn Jews to watch out for early warning signs of rising antiSemitismin Americasigns that were ignored in Germany               To urge that the United States intervene against atrocities abroad whichare said to resemble the Holocaust               To teach tolerance and brotherhoodespecially in schools                        Can we agree that these are the lessons of theHolocaust to which I devote the most space in the book Which of them do youthink unworthy or inappropriateand why I wouldnt myself describe them thatwayand in the book I dont To be sure in invoking the Holocaust for theseto me worthy and appropriate purposes those doing so were often led toexcess for example exaggerating Israels peril or American antiSemitismBut that was my point  As I wrote in the book Once one starts usingimagery from the Holocaustthat most extreme of eventsit becomes impossibleto say anything moderate balanced or nuanced the very language carries youalong to hyperbole But the ends for which the Holocaust was to useyour word instrumentalized seemed to me then and seem to me now both worthyand appropriate            Or perhaps for you instrumentalization hingeson motive  Perhaps you believe the Holocaust was invoked for these endscynically or insincerely This may in isolated instances have been truebut I cant recall ever either saying or implying that this was the caseCertainly overall I repeatedly underlined the sincerity of those whohave invoked the Holocaust Indeed I extend this to some of the lessmainstream invocationsthose that many perhaps including yourself thinkunworthy or inappropriate As you may recall I underlined the good faith ofthose who saw an analogy between the denial of the humanity of the fetus andthe Nazi slogan life unworthy of life I am myself conventionallyprochoice but I would think it a dubious procedure to make that thecriterion of when it was illegitimate to invoke the Holocaust reserving themantle of legitimacy for causeslike humanitarian intervention or thepromotion of brotherhood and toleranceof which I approve If you differ withme on this it would have been appropriate for you to say Novick isexcessively tolerant of invocations of the Holocaust which I and many othersthink quite intolerable But you didnt say that You said that I believe thatevery institutional memory of the Holocaust is a deliberateinstrumentalization of it toward cheap and selfinterested ends            Lets turn to cheap and selfinterested Thereare indeed invocations of the Holocaust to which Id apply this description Ina section devoted to miscellaneous ways in which the Holocaust had enteredAmerican discourse I listed a few cases in which I thought this was somentioning Hillary Clinton Woody Allen and a handful of others To this onemight add the single paragraph I devote to the origin of the WashingtonHolocaust Museum which as you wrote in your Holocaust Memorials inHistory  was proposed by thenpresident Jimmy Carter to placate Jewishsupporters angered by his sale of F fighter planes to Saudi Arabia In alltwo pages of the  pages in the book            You write that I am quite good at ferreting outinstances of instrumentalization of the Holocaust toward cheap andselfinterested ends Ferret that I am I indeed accumulated quite acollection of such instances along with instances of what you elsewhere termthe Holocausts commodification There was Judy Chicago selling Holocaustjewelry to raise money for her stupid and vulgar painting cycle on thesubject There wasmy personal favoritethe travel agency advertising aJewish Singles Weekend the high point of which was a visit to the WashingtonHolocaust Museum Of these or the many other similar examples Ive collectedthere is no mention in the book  The reason that I didnt mention themwas that to do so seemed to me a cheap shotconcentrating on the ephemeraland the inconsequentialthe scummy froth atop the waves of any discourse            There are real differences between us ininterpreting the rise of Holocaust memory in the United States As analternative to my approach in which the growth in Holocaust memory is to beexplained by the contemporary purposes it serves you suggest a focus on theJewish tradition of remembering catastrophes These traditional reasons yousay explain its significance for many Jews at a preconscious level whetherwe like it or not I think there is something to this which is why Idiscussed it albeit briefly in the book For various reasons I dont thinkthis explains much about the evolution of American Jewish memory of theHolocaust Still yours is certainly an arguable position which we can discusssometime If youd said in                   Slate                that you thought I didnt talkenough about this that would have been a reasonable comment But you went waybeyond thatcounterposing your traditionalcultural hypothesis to my allegedview that every institutional memory of the Holocaust is a deliberateinstrumentalization of it toward cheap and selfinterested ends Is that theonly possible alternative to your view            I can suggest a possibility about how such anunjust and demonstrably false characterization of my views came to appear inyour message to Philip Gourevitch That possibility has to do with therapidfire email exchange format of                   Slate               s Book Club in whichit appeared You wrote in response to an email by Gourevitch postmarked justtwo hours earlier You were in fact offering it as youll see if you go backto the original not as a considered characterization of my views but as a wayof introducing your own traditionalcultural explanation            But of course once made and available forexcerpting it became a highly quotable characterization of my viewsThe conversational illusion that email promotes seduces us into the kind ofcareless hyperbole common to conversation In real conversations araised eyebrow can be enough to make us backtrack Something like this happensin private email exchanges I cant count the occasions on which I saidsomething in a message that my correspondent challenged In the next messageId find myself saying something like Of course youre right I overstatedWhat I should have said meant to say was  But in your email exchangewith Gourevitch your characterization of my views wasnt challengedAnd unlike hyperbolic remarks in private exchanges buried in the innards ofour computers this one went out to Godknowshowmany thousands ofeavesdroppers Can you have any doubt that given your reputation as afairminded and circumspect commentator on these matters your characterizationwill be widely quoted as an authoritative summary of my views            If you want it to be soquoted youll of course let it stand If on reflection you want to withdrawwhat I hope youll acknowledge was a hasty and careless characterization youcan do so here             Peter Novick                        Professor of history            University of Chicago            Dear Peter            Given the narrowness of both my hastycharacterization of your position visvis instrumentalization and of yourown objection to my characterization Im glad to be able to come back and saynow that my words were unfair to your much more complex approach to the usesof the Holocaust It was especially unfair to put a word in your mouthintrumentalization which you have taken pains to avoidand for very goodreasons Im sorry            At the same time I wouldnt characterize my ownposition as reflexively knee jerk against instrumentalization in that I findevery memory institutional or otherwise instrumentalizes to some degreeWhich is partly why you wisely dispense with the term            In this it would be a little too easy to blame therapidfire format for my misstating of your approach to theinstrumentalization my word not yours of the Holocaust I takeresponsibility apologize for my haste and accept your raised eyebrow As aformat I think                   Slate               s Book Club can provide just the kind offresh firstresponse to books and ideas that the editors had in mind But alongwith these rewards come risks in such a rapid exchange something both thereviewers and readers need to keep in mind            The conversationcontinues  Until next word I send            Very best wishes

toprovide a realistic definition of affirmative action and does not address theissues that would provide a context for it            Affirmative action allows that given twocandidates of equal qualifications an institution may favor the candidate thathelps it achieve its affirmative action goals The legitimacy of these goalscomes not only from notions of social justice but also from the desire tooffer a more effective educational environment a more hospitable workplace ora more effective school system In public schools for example theeffectiveness of offering students role models with similar ethnic or racialbackgrounds is widely accepted            But the defect in Brus article is not that hefails to recognize these benefits or even disagrees with them but that henever gets to how this reasoning is implemented in affirmative action programsin a manner that is quite different from what goes on with racialprofiling            Racial profiling as practiced in New Jerseysimply singles out people of color for harassment by police It is a convenientway to select drivers for traffic stops that happens to accord with the racistnotions that seem to flourish in law enforcement            Affirmative actioncelebrates the cultural diversity of our country and seeks to create a moreinclusive economy and public life It recognizes that talent and ability aredistributed across the population and that it requires extra effort to avoidexcluding parts of the population that have traditionally been excluded Racialprofiling is merely a way for racist police officers to express their bigotryat the expense of our civil rights It doesnt stop crime and it doesnt buildcommunity That Michael Brus can find no difference between these practicesorthat he is willing to attribute it all to the fudge factorshows he doesntget it He does us all a disservice by offering up this superficialcomparison             Rick Pressler                        NewBrunswick

much much smaller programs with the same or more features includingbackward compatibility with older products It is rushed lazy or incompetentcoding that takes the easy ways out            These
