                    Background        Patients on dialysis have more coronary artery disease        CAD and CADrelated mortality than the general population            Elevated lowdensity lipoprotein LDL cholesterol        level is an independent risk factor for patients with end        stage renal disease ESRD     The        hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A HMGCoA reductase        inhibitors statins have been associated with decreased        allcause mortality in dialysis patients in a        registrybased study    and clinical trials are underway        to confirm this benefit             Mortality benefits of statins has been attributed to        lower lipid levels but recent reports indicate that        statins may reduce cardiovascular risk by other mechanisms            and may also reduce cancerrelated mortality            Consensus is growing for statin use in all ESRD patients        with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes     If used        this way over  of all dialysis patients might be        eligible for statins     Despite an acceptable safety        profile      fewer than  of dialysis patients were        prescribed statins according to USRDS and Canadian studies            even in known coronary heart disease            Despite differences in the pattern of dyslipidemia and        cardiovascular disease in ESRD patients compared with the        general population current use of statins focus on        treating elevated LDL cholesterol levels National        Cholesterol Education Program NCEP guidelines recommend a        target LDL cholesterol of  mgdl in highrisk groups            Pharmacists are becoming more involved in managing a        variety of chronic diseases         For lipid        lowering a team approach is more effective in the        ambulatory care setting than management by a physician             but there are no published reports on using this        approach in a dialysis population Here we describe the        effectiveness and feasibility of our multidisciplinary        lipid management program using the specific skills of        pharmacist dietitian and nephrologist in hemodialysis        patients        Walter Reed Army Medical Center WRAMC is a bed        tertiarycare military hospital with  chronic dialysis        patients Prior to implementation of our program two        formulary statins simvastatin and cerivastatin were        available A hospitalwide switch to these statins was        mandated by the Department of Defense Pharmacoeconomic        Center to reduce cost and provide uniformity A Statin        Formulary Conversion Clinic switched all patients to        cerivastatin preferred agent or simvastatin between        JanuaryApril      HD patients were given        simvastatin during the conversion due to dose adjustment        recommendations for cerivastatin in patients with renal        insufficiency and lack of experience with this drug in        ESRD Consequently there were several dialysis patients        taking nonformulary statins when our HD lipid management        program began because they had failed to reach goals on        formulary statins        Our program was designed as an ongoing lipid management        program directed by the clinical pharmacist assigned to        the Nephrology Service The clinical pharmacist received        approval from the hospital credentials committee the        pharmacy  therapeutics committee and the director of        dialysis to prescribe and make dosage adjustments and order        laboratory tests as per a lipid management guideline The        WRAMC Human Use Committee approved a month retrospective        review of the program in April                     Methods                  Guideline development          A guideline for management of hyperlipidemia and          conversion to formulary statin in HD patients was          developed jointly between the nephrologists clinical          pharmacist and renal dietitian before program          implementation Table  Patients were converted at the          start of the program or whenever they initiated          dialysis Only simvastatin and atorvastatin were included          in the guideline Atorvastatin was prescribed for          patients who failed simvastatin                          Inclusionexclusion criteria          All WRAMC chronic hemodialysis patients were eligible          Exclusion criteria included age   years acute          renal failure pregnancy or nursing use of cyclosporine          tacrolimus or gemfibrozil elevated liver associated          enzymes LAEs and allergy to statins All           hemodialysis patients met criteria for inclusion in          September  when the program was implemented An          additional patient who initiated dialysis during the          study period was included for a total of           patients                          Laboratory monitoring          Blood tests were routinely drawn every  weeks for          monitoring of anemia calcium and phosphate control          LAEs nutritional indices and dialysis adequacy The          pharmacist ordered a nonfasting lipid profile for each          patient in accordance with the guideline eg every           weeks every  months or yearly depending on monitoring          requirement The lipid profile included total          cholesterol TC LDL cholesterol triglycerides and          highdensity lipoprotein HDL cholesterol Blood was          analyzed in the WRAMC clinical chemistry laboratory using          the Roche COBAS Integra  System Roche Diagnostic          System Somerville NJ Roche Precinorm and Precipath          reagents were used for quality control for HDL and LDL          cholesterol results Biorad Liquicheck Level  and          Level  Biorad Diagnostic Group Irvine CA were          used for quality control of TC and triglyceride          measurements Calibration was done daily A nonfasting          lipid profile was acceptable for LDL cholesterol and TC          measurement because the assay measured parameters          directly If the nonfasting triglyceride level was            mgdL the physician was notified and a fasting          triglyceride level was ordered at hisher discretion                          Patient counseling and referral          After review of each lipid profile the pharmacist          provided verbal instruction statin information handouts          at drug initiation or change and a Personal          Cholesterol Management Report to each patient This          reported the patients own lipid profile result and goal          values as well as the new statin dose or dose to be          continued This report also explained the importance of          cholesterol control and listed common side effects of          statins At the time of each report the pharmacist          explained the lipid profile results asked about side          effects and reviewed the patients drug regimen for          medication compliance and new or potential drug          interactions The pharmacist also gave the patient a new          prescription with refills to last until the next          scheduled lipid panel Patients needing dietary          reinforcement were referred to the renal dietitian          Adverse reactions or potential drug interactions were          brought to the nephrologists attention                          Documentation and data collection          The clinical pharmacist documented all interventions          and referrals using an Excel spreadsheet Microsoft          Redmond WA Individual reports were generated that gave          lipid profile and LAE results any adverse drug reaction          or drug interaction dosage adjustments made and the          date of the next scheduled lipid profile This report was          placed in the patients HD chart after each lipid          profile A copy was given to each nephrologist          Lipid data was tabulated monthly by the pharmacist and          submitted to the nephrology service quality improvement          coordinator the medical director of dialysis and the          chief of nephrology for ongoing program evaluation Data          submitted included the number of patients followed          number of patients at LDL cholesterol goal average LDL          cholesterol and total cholesterol number of adverse drug          reactions and potential drug interactions identified HDL          data was not analyzed or included as part of the          guideline                          Statistical analysis          Data was tabulated in Microsoft Excel and analyzed          using SigmaStat SPSS Chicago IL Fisher exact test          was used for categorical variables and paired Students          ttest was used for continuous parametric variables          Wilcoxon signedrank test was used for continuous          variables that were not normally distributed A pvalue          of   was considered statistically          significant                            Results        Patient demographics are shown in Table  After         months  of  patients  had reached target LDL        cholesterol Figure  compared with  patients  at        the start of the program p   Mean LDL cholesterol        decreased  from    to    mgdl p          and mean total cholesterol decreased  from           to    mgdl p          Eight adverse drug reactions were identified in         patients Four patients  experienced musculoskeletal        symptoms  of which had muscle aches and weakness hand        arm and back muscles Creatine phosphokinase CPK levels        were normal in both cases Drug therapy was not interrupted        in either case and other etiologies for the symptoms were        pursued The other  patients reported shoulder soreness        thought related to exercise and leg cramping thought to        be due to the previous days dialysis CPK levels were not        obtained and the symptoms spontaneously resolved after        several days        Two patients  experienced an increase in LAEs A        fold increase in serum transaminases occurred in one        patient who was initiated on simvastatin  mg qd during        the program The drug was discontinued One patient had a        mild transient increase in alkaline phosphatase from         IUL to  IUL when starting statin therapy The drug        was not discontinued and the level returned to baseline        within  months        Diarrhea or gastrointestinal upset was reported in         patients  Relationship to the statin was unclear        One patient was switched from simvastatin to atorvastatin        with slight improvement In the second patient symptoms        resolved when acetaminophen with codeine was        discontinued        Eight potential drug interactions were identified        Physicians were alerted to monitor for myopathy and changes        in international normalized ratio INR in  patients        taking warfarin because of potential for cytochrome P        A competition Other drugs with cytochrome P        interaction potential were identified including verapamil         patients and diltiazem  patient Other drug        interactions of a differentunknown mechanism included        digoxin and levothyroxine  patient each No drug        interaction resulted in an adverse event or discontinuation        of therapy        Fourteen patients  were on statins at the start of        the program  of whom were receiving nonformulary        statins  cerivastatin  pravastatin Four patients        were on simvastatin  mg qd  patients were on        simvastatin  mg qd At  months   were on        statins Of these  patients were on simvastatin  mg qd         patients were on simvastatin  mg qd and  patients        were taking simvastatin  mg qd One patient each was        taking atorvastatin  mg qd and  mg qd Two patients        were initiated on statins during the period studied one of        which was discontinued at  months due to increased LAEs        During the month period  patient died from        cardiovascular disease Her LDL cholesterol and TC were not        elevated  mgdl and  mgdl respectively Three        patients received renal transplants        Table summarizes the interventions made by the        pharmacist All patients received medication teaching and        compliance assessment at each encounter Most patient        encounters resulted in continuation of current therapy        including those who were at goal LDL cholesterol with        nonpharmacological therapy Statins were stopped in         patient because of low LDL cholesterol level  mgdl        The renal dietitian was consulted  times for specific        dietary counseling relating to cholesterol control and        compliance        Overall nutritional status remained stable Median        albumin at study entry was  gdL range           gdL vs  gdL range    gdL at  months p                             Discussion        This study shows that improved LDL cholesterol control        can be achieved in chronic HD patients using a        multidisciplinary pharmacistdirected lipid program        Hemodialysis populations may be ideal for this program        because of convenient blood sampling and frequent provider        contact Program costs included the minimal cost of patient        pamphlets and the cost of additional pharmacist time We        estimated that  additional hoursmonth were required        for pharmacist interventions documentation and compiling        reports The program did not incur additional laboratory        costs since lipidmonitoring guidelines were those of the        NCEP Overall the program was well accepted by nurses        nephrologists and patients        Side effects were minimal during the period and several        potential drug interactions were avoided Saltissi et al           recently reported the tolerability and effectiveness        of simvastatin in doses of  mg in lowering LDL and        nonHDL cholesterol in dialysis patients Although the        majority of our patients required simvastatin  mg to        reach LDL goal simvastatin in higher doses and        atorvastatin were used and well tolerated with dose        changes made in a timely fashion undoubtedly contributing        to program effectiveness It is unknown whether a longer        treatment period with these doses would have produced more        side effects One complicating factor of statin therapy in        HD patients is the high prevalence of hepatitis B and C        making it difficult to differentiate hepatitisinduced        increases in LAEs from those due to the statin This was        not an issue in our study although several patients were        positive for hepatitis Although CPK levels were not        measured at baseline in patients with musculoskeletal        symptoms this value was found to be normal Of note the         patients who did not reach LDL cholesterol goal were not        those who experienced side effects requiring        discontinuation of therapy LDL levels in these patients        were near goal and ranged from  mgdl        Limitations of the study include the small number of        patients and lack of a control group Since patients began        the program after physician only lipid management one        presumes by the improvement in lipid levels and number of        patients at LDL cholesterol goal that the team approach was        more favorable That  of patients were on statins and         were at goal LDL cholesterol at the beginning of the        program can be attributed to the close monitoring by        nephrologists in a fellowship program and the pharmacyrun        statin conversion clinic Even so these results improved        after implementing the multidisciplinary approach        Although compliance was not documented by pill count        the pharmacist with access to computer databases assessed        drug adherence by refill frequency patient interviews and        lab results In addition to increasing compliance        including patients in therapeutic decisionmaking may be        costeffective     The patient handouts with lipid        results were well received and may have improved patients        compliance and interest in lipid therapy but we did not        formally assess patient knowledge of hyperlipidemia goals        treatment and side effects nor document refill        frequency        Some studies suggest that dialysis patients with low LDL        cholesterol levels have increased risk of mortality vs        those with higher LDL cholesterol levels     LDL        cholesterol and conventional cardiac risk factors are        insensitive predictors of CAD in this population            and may reflect the high frequency of malnutrition           and established cardiovascular disease     In our        study albumin remained stable as LDL cholesterol levels        declined        Although the guidelines for lipid therapy in HD patients        are extrapolated from the general population current        recommendations are to treat highrisk patients to a target        LDL cholesterol of   mgdl Most dialysis patients in        the United States do not meet these targets Tonelli et al           measured statin use in dialysis patients but not        whether target LDL cholesterol was achieved Admittedly        lipid lowering and its benefits are less well defined in        renal failure explaining why nephrologists may not be as        aggressive in statin prescribing     However the        anticipated shortages of nephrology manpower        nephrologists nurses physicians assistants dietitians        may make it more difficult in the future to achieve        therapeutic goals     Methods to help promote        appropriate use of statins and other drug therapy would be        beneficial Pharmacists are not routinely assigned to        dialysis units however Manley et al    showed that        every dollar spent on pharmaceutical care in ESRD results        in a savings of  A recent American College of        PhysiciansAmerican Society of Internal Medicine position        paper speculates that pharmacist participation in patient        care beyond patient education and hospital rounds will be        time consuming for physicians     In reality        pharmacist participation in the collaborative management of        conditions such as hyperlipidemia through programs like        ours may free nephrologists time for other activities and        improve patient outcomes while still maintaining physician        control of therapy Yet maintaining good communication        documentation and quality assurance is essential        The treatment of hyperlipidemia is readily suited to the        algorithmic multidisciplinary approach used in the present        study Moreover similar programs could be employed for        management of other ESRD complications such as        hyperphosphatemia and anemia further improving outcomes in        dialysis patients with the least possible impact on        staffing and resources        Despite editorial speculation that nephrologists are        late to the party in adoption of cardiovascular risk        reduction measures     underutilization of proven        therapies is not unique to nephrology The National Academy        of Sciences Institute of Medicine reported that our health        care delivery system continues to suffer from many        deficiencies such as use of betablockers in only  of        patients with myocardial infarction     The percentage        in dialysis patients is similar     Setting targets and        achieving them are quite different things Undoubtedly new        methods for assuring the implementation of proven or        therapies are needed The present study adds new        information on the process of improving statin use and        other therapies that could improve outcomes in dialysis        patients                    Conclusions        Text for this section                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions
