                                 What Lincoln Bedroom            Your task today is to studythe adjacent photograph carefully then to locate the notorious LincolnBedroom This is neither a trick question nor an implausible request TheLincoln Bedroom this is a hint is in the White House and thats just whatyou are looking ata photograph of the White House interior taken by NationalPark Service photographer Abbie Rowe in             AbeLincolns room has of course become Washingtons most infamous place to sleepin under the Clinton administration surpassing in moral infamy even DickMorris room at the nearby Jefferson Hotel Many unworthy people have beenallowed to spend the night with Abes memory fatcat campaign contributors andthe presidents Hollywood buddies among them It has become a case of HistoryDefiled            Ken Bode moderator of PBS journalists roundtableWashington Week in Review  spelled out the case for defilement rightafter the story broke that bigtime campaign money would get you bookedovernight with Honest Abe This is the room Bode told viewers where Churchillplanned the strategy that won the war the room where Europes fleeing crownedheads found refuge Bodes implicationand it underlies all the countlessportentous references by the press corps to the rooms classless guestswasclear This is political sleaze at its lowest with Clinton putting a price tagon the presidency and auctioning off our national integrity and memory in theprocess            Now backto the photograph and to our search for that room You will by now havenoticed that the White House interior is filled with a mesh of steel girdersholding up the exterior and that the sorts of things that are usually said tomake up a rooma floor a ceiling doors a complete set of wallsaremissing            Where are they Well by the time this photowas taken most of these things were probably in a landfill in northernVirginia thats where muchthough not quite allof the original White Houseinterior went around midcentury The fact is that the White Houses guts barelypredate Eisenhower This doesnt get Clinton off the hook but thats not ourtext More interesting are the rules of the Washington memory game The ParkServices pictures of a totally gutted White House have become a kind offorbidden imagery evidence of something that none of us seems to want toremember happened because it seems to snapby our own handa rare link toglory Some pictures are allowed to speak their thousand words because we likewhat they have to say some pictures are silenced This is one            It ishardly a secret that the White House interior became a structural replica underTruman It was about to collapse The floor in Margaret Trumans room hadactually broken under the weight of her piano and Harry Truman himself wasdirected to sleep in the comparatively sound Lincoln Bedroom if indeed it wasLincolns bedroom he may have used it only as a study lest he find himselfone morning in the Red Room downstairs            The place was closed for about a year and a half Workthere was widely reported and thousands of pieces of the presidentshouseold bricks and bits of woodwere openly sold as souvenirs There aresome significant cues to remembering all this especially the attempt onTrumans life by Puerto Rican nationalists that occurred at Blair Housewherethe Trumans had to live during the reconstructionand cost one Secret Serviceman his life Giant memorial plaques are affixed to the fence in front of BlairHouse telling this story to anyone who hasnt heard it            Nor arethe Park Service pictures documenting the work all that rare Our ownphotographfeaturing a man bulldozing new basements that will house amongother things the executive atomicbomb shelterwas reproduced fullpage

renovation down tothe number of old bricks  trucked to Mount Vernon for reuse there            Yet the myth of White House continuity keepsresurfacingJacqueline Kennedys famous television tour doubtless played arole in establishing it When it was revealed a while back that FranklinRoosevelt had installed listening devices in the Oval Office a workman fromthose days told reporters how hed drilled the necessary holes in the floorunder FDRs desk adding in a phrase that was reported without comment thatthose holes were probably still there Of course the many thousands of WhiteHouse visitors every year line up to see where John Adams wife hung thelaundry where Lincoln lay in state and where Churchill sleptnot to seerestorations of those locales            McCullough writes that by the standards of latterday preservation thedumping of the White House interior represents a needless and tragic lossStill it is obviously a historic place and not just because the famousexterior remains as do the mantelpieces chandeliers and paneling that werelater reinstalled The Lincoln Bedroom for example contains none other thanLincolns own ornate bed if indeed he ever slept in it questions have beenraised about that too the one for which Calvin Coolidges wife labored twoyears to make a sufficiently large quilt On the other hand the PresidentsBox at Fords Theatre contains the chair in which Lincoln was sitting whenBooth shot him and no one would argue that Fords is anything but a replicaFor that matter Lincolns church on New York Avenue was rebuilt itself as anearreplica some years ago too rather a lot of Lincolns city isarchitectural Potemkinism            Beds chairs and pews are where history rests its agingbottom in Washington Indeed the capital has been having a continuing debateabout its pastwhat to revere and what to demolishfor years now and hasdestroyed a good many places with real claims to historical value places asold as the White House with bricks from the same brickyard The decidingfactor in what stays and goes apart from charm is often the same Who isassociated with it Where does it rank in the Great Man Theory of Tour BusHistory Indeed as the capital ages its history is increasingly becomingwhatever associative past you can conjure up as ornament reward orweapon            Lincolns association withthe idea of the room makes the room historic even if theres not much thereSo secondarily does Churchills But in fact Churchill was reportedly ill atease in the Lincoln Bedroom he is said to have often moved himself across thehall in the course of the night Why Because while there was an unrenovatedLincoln Bedroom there was also said to be a Lincoln Ghost Truman himselfencountered him he wrote in the form of mysterious knocks on the door andreceding footfalls Dutch Queen Wilhelmina one of wartime Europes refugeecrowned heads fainted upon meeting Abe or so she said But then she is alsoreported to have heard Andrew Jacksons ribald laughter coming from her bed inthe Rose Bedroom            Abes spirit has been prettyquiet since the midcentury restoration But no matter By now weve turned theWhite House itself into a kind of clanking ghost of presidents past its veryrooms suffused with the great spirits of those who slept there Once conjuredit throws its looming shadow over the unworthy and undeserving who daretrespass Well might they tremble
