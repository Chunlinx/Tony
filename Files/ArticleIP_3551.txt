like some advice pertaining to thedreaded topic of roommates My roommate just in the last two weeks hasdeveloped a habit of going out and coming in late Im a light sleeper andIve been suffering from her nocturnal excursions We had decided before theselast two weeks to room together next yearuntil yesterday when I found anote from the roommate saying maybe we should not proceed as planned due to ourdifferent sleeping habits Since then she has either not been in the room orhas come and gone so quickly as to leave no time for discussion of this matterI might add that our housing papers are due in five days and its disturbingto me how irresponsibly she is handling the situationwhich stemmed from hersuggestion in the first place                                       Pleasehelp Thanks so much

not have the ring of truth Rather thanlost dreams of Riley the dilemma you describe reminds one more ofRipley            It ishard to imagine a tycoon emeritus at the mercy of a wife and daughter who parkhim at home while they travel the globe Giving you the benefit of the doubthowever and assuming that this problem is genuine Prudie suggests unless yousigned everything over to the women that you stop being a wimp and takecontrol of your money your time and their frequent flyer miles            Prudie skeptically                                             DearPrudence

after we dated on and off for five years I ended the relationshipbecause of his alcohol problem I find myself having to fight off the urge tocall himand sometimes I give in and call Then I feel guilty Does my callinghim mean I unconsciously want to get back with my ex                                       Feeling Guilty inWis                        DearFeeling            Prudiesympathizes having herself once or twice become attached to thealcoholimpaired There is some kind of magnet that draws women to troubledmen Do try to fight the urge to reconnect with Jim Beam Perhaps by recallingthe

kissing but there is such a thing as theappropriate kiss for the appropriate occasion My problem is thepseudopassionate hello kiss with heavy tongue action Am I the only one put offby this Have mores changed when I wasnt looking And the big question How doI handle this without making an enemy for life                                       Not ThatIrresistible                        DearNot            Interestingly this happenedto Prudiebut only once The shock was so great she found herself downing toomuch white wine this was at lunch as an antiseptic since Prudie did not knowthe gentleman nearly well enough to be familiar with his health history            You areentirely right to find this revolting unwelcome intimacy outr Mores have notchangedyou have just managed to connect with some clods It would beperfectly correct to pull back and make a show of surprise and displeasure Asfor making an enemy is a person who would do this worth having as afriend
