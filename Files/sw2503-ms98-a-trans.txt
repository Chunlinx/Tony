        hi Wanet how are you     ah doing fine where you from   im from New England Massachusetts   okay im from Berkeley California   wow this is quite a quite a long distance   ah certainly is   do you have any pets   no used to used to but  none none right now   how come uh you dont have any now you get tired of them   well i i live in an apartment building and and uh and and it its just just not feasible you know id love to have a dog you know   yeah ive got a little doggy uh that ive had quite uh quite a long time in fact she just turned sixteen years old New Years Eve   ah   and uh   is she   i beg your pardon   what is she   shes uh uh uh a poodle of a toy poodle a toy poodle  and shes   ah ah my got my mom a teacup poodle not too long ago     this is a little bigger than a teacup   yeah   and uh its funny how uh how i i uh i got acquired this animal uh when i was uh married my uh exwife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed uh the woman needed someone to babysit and uh this is what she had told the kids and she even told me that and after the two week period was up uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks its uh you become attached you become attached to it   oh for sure oh yeah   so ive had this dog now for for sixteen years and shes been a lot of company uh shes uh however getting a little old and things are starting to fail um i i live alone now and she stays in the house all day while i go to work  and uh shes been holding herself pretty well the uh up until uh you know recently where shes been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is  and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home       but shes shes usually pretty good   yes well my my mother has one its uh its uh teacup and uh its made such a difference for her but you know just i i i you know the way my moms presence countenance it its just just for having a puppy but you know having this dog shes had it for i guess three years now   uhhuh   oh possibly four but uh it was it its its really made such a difference from her i really would like to im a disabled person so im unable to to really take care of a pet and if if that   uhhuh   werent so i would certainly certainly have one i just i just it frustrates me sometime not being able to have a dog   um well you might wanna get yourself uh an animal that doesnt require much attention like a cat   yeah oh yeah well yeah uh i i i typically am not a cat person       have a friend that uh has on occasion um brought her cat over for me to keep for you know time to time and and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen and uh uh it would sleep on my chest       you know its just it is just a great cat but   yeah well my my personal preference is is a dog uh i dont know that uh that id ever want a cat oh i like cats i just wouldnt wanna  own one uh theyre not uh theyre theyre affectionate but they yeah i dont know i cant seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog   yeah well you dont own cats yeah you they they own you   yeah right   or or you know grant you with their presence you know   yeah right that your supposed to appreciate them well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in evenings she my dog greets me at the door i dont know that a cat would do that uh   yeah i used to have a  that that could read me better than any human being in my life   yeah   i could just walk in the door and she knew whether to to to quietly come up to me or to just run and and knock me over       i mean she really could pick up on my mood  the way i walked in the door it was uncanny   yeah yeah hm i i think um you know were able to read each other pretty well because uh  she knows when im upset and i know when shes not feeling good too so i know like when she has an accident i know shes not doing it on purpose   yeah   when she when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me   yeah     uh and and you know some people might not believe that but uh but i do   oh hey sure oh absolutely   like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did yeah   really yes well i had that that cat that i mentioned ill be one morning and you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you you you you feed this cat something something and and you make sure that it can get to its litterbox well   uhhuh   some reason during the night the the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and and uh did not feed it right away it decided that it was going to protest and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it           all right have i got your attention now   oh yes animals have a way of talking   well it did i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day   i i dont know that id uh that id trade my dog in for the world uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me and i took her to the uh to the vets because she wasnt eating and and uh she wasnt able to jump she you know lost all her activity  and uh she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that uh she wasnt she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working hospital dog hospital animal hospital so i took his suggestion and i  uh took the the dog to a hospital a dog hospital and they said that theyd keep her there for three days well she ended up staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care i mean it cost me over five hundred dollars   ouch   plus the the uh  the vet sent me a bill for what he did and uh and then she recouped she was okay for a couple of years and then she got sick on me again and i brought her to a different vet this time and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything and uh he gave me the medication the same medication that i gave her the last time and she was okay and shes been okay ever since its been about two years now   uh well thats great it really is i  im glad you she was able to pull out of it uh  and so cheaply the second time   yeah well the see the problem is if if the if someone wouldnt have came up to me and said its gonna cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive what do you wanna do i probably wouldve had second thoughts but what they well what they do is is they say well its gonna cost   yeah of course you would   you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and and you know and it creeps up on you you dont know that you know  you really you you dont know what its gonna cost until its all over   i     uh to give you an example my mom uh had an elderly cat who uh who evidently evidently got old uh and uh the cat got sick so she took the cat to the vet and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died and you owe me this bill and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the cat  so it cost her three hundred dollars um and she didnt get the cat back so you know they had to pay for all the the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses       and uh you know she just brought the cat in because he wasnt feeling good   so that that was a kind of a surprise  at least at     really jeez yeah you kind of wonder what really happened   yeah well even the you know they they claimed they did the best that they could and then the cat uh died so now im looking for another cat for them um i ive ive got a little kitten uh thats still uh oh it just being born right now so another five or six weeks ill be bringing the little kitten over to uh to my folks   my goodness     well that that that that will make their day   yeah it i think it will because theyre both in their in their seventies and uh the cat uh although its a little bit of work for them sometimes turned out it turns out to be a a pleasant experience for them uh i think that they enjoy that   only work initially   yeah   for cats anyway you know well listen its been a pleasure talking to you   yep well same here   and you take care   okay  bye now   yeah maybe  maybe well talk again sometime   okay what is that sound   thats my buzzer at the door   oh okay ill let you go   okay thank you   right
