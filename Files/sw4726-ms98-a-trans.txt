        im ready if you are     okay um where uh where do you stand uh   well i think that people should be allowed to have them especially if they go hunting which my son goes hunting he goes deer hunting he goes duck hunting   on oh you   uh hes read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old   umhum umhum   and i just think that uh as far as thats concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with you know as far as just having handguns around to   right right   to have them i dont believe that you should have handguns around   right yeah yeah yeah i agree too i um its its as far as uh the ban goes and everything i dont think its possible uh to completely ban guns theres just too many   well no theres too many sports people out there that that do do these things   right and i  yeah right i mean yeah that thats true and i mean the the technologys not that hard i mean you could make a gun you know from simple you know   yeah well i suppose you could uh   you know if if you really wanted a gun you could you could make one um   umhum and i think if they want one theyre going to get one you know   oh yeah sure thats true   the bad guys are you know like i say if they want a gun theyre going to find out or somehow to get one   umhum yeah yeah its yeah i mean theres yeah theres theres no way to stop uh stop anybody from getting a gun um i think there should be more control as like uh like maybe waiting periods and things like that you know uh   well i agree with you on that because i know uh in fact i had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time and for a rifle theres no waiting there wasnt anyhow now there might be now   umhum yeah   but there wasnt anything for you know rifles and things like that i guess it was just handguns that there was a some kind of a waiting you know a two weeks while they checked you out or something   umhum sure yeah right   but uh most of these people thats got these guns thats going around you know robbing people and shooting people   umhum yeah uh i i know my friend is uh really into guns and uh uh we have went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know they come through town and everything and i mean they just have i mean they have anything youd want i mean you know you know uh you know anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and   umhum umhum   and theres i mean theres nothing you can just go buy one and take it home and you know its easier than getting uh like a video membership card at you know a video store yeah   i i see now i know they were having a gun show uh about a month ago and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show   uh yeah yeah you just go and uh buy the gun and uh   theres no restriction though you dont have to wait or nothing then huh   no well except for the the pistols and i im not sure how they do that i know they used   yeah i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you have go pick it up   umhum umhum right yeah i think thats   which i think they have to do on rifles and things now too i think there is something something like that anyhow here out here in California i think there is now  but   umhum yeah yeah im not sure im not really sure but what uh the the gun laws in uh Pennsylvania Pennsylvania are like   umhum  no  we dont have guns because we dont go hunting or anything like that but like i say my son hes   no umhum   hes always had a like a i think his first little rifle we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old   umhum   but hes always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it he goes to the pistol range and uh and the rifle range to shoot them he likes to go to that uh shotgun thing where you shoot at those um   oh yeah the skeets you mean   yeah right he likes to do that you know  but uh   umhum yeah   i dont know i think they should try to control it and everything you know but as far as just banning it completely there thats not going to happen   i dont yeah i dont i dont think it can happen either it i just dont i dont see and i i think uh hadnt thought about this before but if you do that if they would uh   umhum   uh decide to ban guns it would just open up a a market you know a black market for them   yeah right right   and so you know they they would just all the profits would go to you know   now i do believe though like in California if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has i think theyre liable now for it   yeah oh the   they can be you know put in jail and everything the whoever owned the gun   oh  the owners responsibility yeah   you know now when they have kids around youd think that they would be locking them up or you know   yeah yeah yeah thats thats true um you know i had i had a friend who was a uh a policeman in a in a in a local borough just a small uh one of the little neighborhoods you know one of the small towns uh near Pittsburgh and uh she said  that uh   umhum   you know he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that but i mean you know youre you know people make you know they forget or you know you know kids get in the way kids the way kids are you know i mean they can       you know   well they can get into almost anything anymore   right yeah
