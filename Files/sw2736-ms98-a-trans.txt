            well what what kind of car did you just buy a car or are you in the market to buy a car or   actually im real close to being in the market to buy a car ive got uh a couple older cars theyre both over ten years old   uh umhum   and uh theyve served me well but i kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer   uhhuh yeah   uh ive got three children at home two  fourteen year olds and a twelve year old and so i need to make sure ive got one that i can fit       all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers its kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time   umhum yeah i i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem       but no no car was big enough for that   well uh ive kind of been leaning towards a Caravan   uhhuh   uh now i know that that uh theyve gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years but uh i like the Dodge products and uh been uh couple times ive had a opportunity to rent one   umhum   uh ive been really pleased with its performance and with the size and because if you get the seven passenger version  you can put some space between the kids   yeah yeah     and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus its got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store   umhum which is the one that has modular type seats you know which one im talking about they have the commercial on TV where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around   umhum exactly correct yeah if you want   is that is that the Dodge Caravan that does that or   yes yeah it uh the Dodge Caravans will do that uh you can take the uh uh usually theres a uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets   uhhuh   and then if you get the and then theres a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back   uhhuh   so its very versatile you can move the seats all around thats the only thing you cant do is take that three person across seat and move it forward   yeah uhhuh well the one that i cant remember one it is but its the if its the Toyota or or one of the other ones i dont know if its one of the Americans or the import ones where uh they actually have like um some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out i mean theyre really easy to pull out   uhhuh   um and you can uh move them around and stuff and it it to me that that would be real good for us uh my husband and i uh like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is its an older van and were were thinking about buying another sedan   uhhuh   um probably next year um right now motorcycles is takes precedence since that thats what my husband really wants right now   yeah   but uh next year well probably buy a new car and were looking at uh possibly the Honda Accord um thats kind of uh as far as far as the interior its got the luxury interior but doesnt it doesnt really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have which is one of the things that we were looking at you know finding something thats thats fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want   uhhuh yeah i think thats getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money youve got to spend then you start looking around at at what you can buy with it where before i think you   yeah   you looked at the car you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it   uhhuh     or how you could afford it   yeah well i think its going to be a lot easier now i just heard that they  lowered the prime lending rate so i think its going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it   yeah   i think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient   yeah i know theyre trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession   yeah   and dropping the prime is probably one of the things i just bought a new house so i got a a uh nine and a half percent interest rate   uhhuh   not sure i could do much better today but uh that is also effecting buying a new car     yeah i can imagine you got to kind of work work that into your budget that balance that and the house payment and of course uh is if you buy a new car youre going to are any of your kids driving age yet   well that and there uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of July so   are so are they twins   yeah theyre twins born on the bicentennial youre going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto July fourth seventy six   oh wow     so uh uh ive still got another full year and three months before theyre going to be behind the wheel of a car so Americas safe for another fifteen month   uhhuh   and uh after that now i may keep the uh one or both of the two cars i i currently have for them to drive you know theyre theyre theyre small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel safe feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive   uhhuh uhhuh   you know what i mean it i dont get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the Honda theyre just   well the the Hondas have been have been very safe in in accidents uh more so than a lot of the American cars as a matter of fact i just heard something today on on the news about   uhhuh is that right   those uh automatic seat belts that are attached to the door um theyre questioning the safety of those now   uhhuh right   saying that and they showed uh a simulation where there were they had a dummy in the car and the door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out on top of him   jeez   so theyre saying theyre not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but theyre really not as safe as they as they uh appear to be so um im kind of concerned about that as far as you know what the seat belts   well   uh i dont know if Marylan d has a uh a seat belt law but they do have one in Texas and youre youre required to wear them   yes definitely the thing is that theyre i think its a two part seat belt though theres the uh door belt and then theres one a lap belt   exactly but ninety uh probably about well i dont know about ninety but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably dont wear the lap portion of it i know my brother doesn t and he has one in his car   then make sure you smack him around then           so i mean it it kind of gives you a false sense of security you think oh ive got one portion of my seat belt on um but if your door comes open you know its not going to do you any good   yeah   so that that thats a concern of mine as far as uh what ill be looking at with with buying a new car um im not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door i think i would feel better with them attached to the actual car the inside where theyre normally attached to like behind the door   yeah yeah the uh the supports um a good source of information ive found has always been these uh used car manuals   uhhuh   because you can flip through the used car manuals and theyll give you a list of all the problems that the cars had in the past   hum   and you can look at the uh the track record on a car over the year and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where theres fewer problems and you get an idea on how well   yeah yeah yeah   the the next cars going to be now as long as they arent changing the model you know like when the uh Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car as long as they arent   yeah yeah the the Le Mans is like that too uh we used to have a Le Mans when i was in in high school um and it was a big car i mean it was like the uh the Grand Prix   uhhuh   and in i think around nineteen eighty um they changed the model and it like went went to half the size   yeah sure   literally i mean it got chopped in half and it wasnt even the same car anymore didnt even remotely resemble the old car   uhhuh yeah i remember when that happened so unless theyre really changing the model um yeah chances are that its probably going to have the the fewer mistakes than it had the year before   yeah well everybody that ive talked to whos ever had a Honda loves them and my husband had a Honda   uhhuh   uh and it was a lease car and he had to turn back in uh a year and a half ago uh and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it and it was great um and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because we didnt feel the at at the time the residual was like sixty five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for   yeah   um a four year old car   yeah i agree   so so we ended up just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and and got out of the lease um one thing that i that i am curious about is um reading information on air bags do some of the vans i think i dont know about the Dodge Caravan but some of the vans now now have um driver side air bags   uhhuh   which i think is a good idea   yeah
