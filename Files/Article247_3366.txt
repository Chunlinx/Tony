                                 Blair Witchs Lessons for Hollywood                        When in its third week of release indie sensation The Blair WitchProject took in an incredible  million at the box office and set arecord for the largest perscreen gross in motionpicture history the majormovie studios responded by commissioning studies to explain to them why this film was crushing all their hundredmilliondollar spectaculars Letshope that at the top of their list the authors of these studies say Lesson Blair Witch was a really good movie            Im exaggerating of course Quality alone isnt enough to propel a film togreat boxoffice heights as the recent failures of Out of Sight andRushmore demonstrate But in the hubbub about the marketing of TheBlair Witch Project  which has been tremendous its important to keep inmind that there really is no simple formula by which hits happen and thatattempts to reduce popular success to that kind of formula are bound to leadyou astray In this as in so much else Hollywood is like the French at thebeginning of World War II ceaselessly preparing to fight the last war andalways getting blindsided by the next one            What we can see in the endless analyses of Blair Witchs success ishow malleable the supposed truths of marketing and distribution are Forinstance the biggest Hollywood trend in distribution in recent years has beenthe megaopening so that films like Austin Powers and Wild WildWest each opened on more than  screens It was the rare multiplex thatdidnt have these movies playing on multiple screens and these movies weresupported with multimedia marketing campaigns that drilled themselves into yourhead Oversaturation has its perils of course but part of the thinking hereis that the massive opening guarantees an impressive first weekend gross evenif not necessarily an impressive perscreen performance and that it allowsfilms with sketchy word of mouth to make a lot of money off the initial buzzAdd to that the idea that a massive opening is a kind of PR event in itselfand youve got an argument for ensuring that consumers wont be able to goanywhere without thinking about Austin Powers                            Blair Witch  by contrast had a strictly limited release playing tosellout crowds in big cities in its first week opening at a few more selecttheaters in its second week and expanding to just  screens in its thirdThat release schedule helped build the buzz for the movie made it seem likethe hot ticket to get call it the Ill only go to a club if there are a lotof people who cant get in principle and ensured that the distributorsdidnt overreach themselves in terms of their advertising Now this kind ofslow buildup seems like the smart strategy            Instinctively the path Blair Witch trod does seem to make moresense Though surprisingly few people in marketing will admit this hits arerarely made Theyre almost always genuine bottomsup phenomena Just go backand look at the advance buzz on Titanic to see how the massive successof that film came completely out of left field And catering to thatgrassroots mentality by allowing word of mouth to do its work can be anexcellent approach especially when you combine it with a brilliant use of theInternet which is the finest tool for wordofmouth ever created            And yet its worth remembering that Austin Powers  which was theanti Blair Witch in its marketing was a huge hit And if Wild WildWest hadnt opened the way it did I doubt it would have made  millionGiving that film time to build would not have worked            The banal point is that marketing and distribution campaigns really do needto be specific to the films theyre intended to promote The more complicatedpoint is that studios need to recognize just how much of what happens to theirfilms is out of their control Which means that instead of building the MaginotLine of marketing they should worry about the stuff that is in their controlsalaries overhead and quality Remember what happens when you build a bettermousetrap
