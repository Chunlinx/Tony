                                 China Loves Americas Bombs            According to the South ChinaMorning Post of Hong Kong Monday the minimum requirements of evenmoderates in the Chinese Politburo are that Washington issue a full apology forthe bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade pay adequate compensation andallow China a bigger role in resolving the Kosovo conflict But hardlinerswho include generals of the Peoples Liberation Army are calling for anoverall scaling down of USChina relations unless NATO agrees to stop itsoffensive against Yugoslavia the paper said In a report from Beijing onemergency weekend meetings of senior Chinese cadres the paper noted that thePLAs Deputy Chief of Staff Gen Xiong Guangkai insisted that the embassystrike had been a deliberate attempt by the United States to trample on Chinesesovereignty Noting that the Chinese government has reserved the right to takefurther action the generals said they would do their best if that actioncontained a military component Quoting a Beijing source the paper saidgovernmentorganized protests would continue at least through this week Italso predicted that Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng and Prime MinisterZhu Rongji will now reverse some of the concessions they granted to US tradenegotiators            According to a report from Beijing Sunday in the Straits Times ofSingapore Chinas Liberation Army Daily  the mouthpiece of the PLA hadbeen much impressed by Americas bombing methods in Yugoslavia before theembassy strike Only last week it urged China to change its defense strategyso as to master US precisionbombing techniques In an article published lastweek the Liberation Army Daily said We have to use the Kosovo crisisto raise the alarm and work towards hightechnology warfare create newwarfare techniques and training methods The newspaper said Beijing has notdone enough research on longdistance precision missile strikes The Balkancrisis will accelerate Chinas military modernization drive it said TheStraits Times said that because of the Kosovo conflict and the UnitedStates promise of a new theatremissile defense system for Taiwan the PLA isexpected to intensify the development of intermediate or longrange missilesand military communications technology            In aneditorial Monday China Daily expressed its stalwart moral support for theprotests that are blazing across the country against the USdirected NATOatrocity Insisting that the attack on the embassy was deliberate theeditorial said it was too smart to be explained as a mistake in targetidentification or a technical error It asked Then what is the reason thatcan convincingly explain Natos provocation  Is it because of our countryspersistent opposition to their barbarity In its editorial Monday the South China Morning Postdeplored the blind arrogance of NATO in believing it can drive a man likePresident Slobodan Milosevic to capitulate through airstrikes alone and itsaid that the orchestrated protests in China are understandable But it alsosaid that claims that the bombing was no accident are simply ludicrous sinceNato stood only to lose by its action Calling on the United States and NATOto undertake a damagelimitation exercise in earnest it said the mostimportant thing is for the United States to make a proper and public apologyNot words of sadness but a formal expression of apology            Thepapers in European NATO countries generally agreed that the bombing of theChinese Embassy was the worst thing that could have happened They widelycredited it with having destroyed all hope for the peace principles agreed into Germany last week between the G countries and Russia There was bittermockery too of reports that the CIA was using old maps of Belgrade from atime before the embassy was built The Times of London published a headline Monday readingCIA planners failed to check phone book and a map with an arrow pointing atthe Russian Embassy and the words Note to CIA  Deligradska Ulica Belgrade Having been the most hawkish in Europe throughout the war the Britishpress has started to show small signs of defeatism On Sunday for example theliberal Observer  which previously supported the bombing as aprelude to a successful ground campaign called Sunday for it to be scaleddown deciding that a land war is no longer a practical possibility Withoutit compromise may allow us to achieve most of what we want it concludedhopefully            Butthe SundayTimes urged escalating NATOs attacks to maximum pitch redoubling itsefforts to avoid civilian targets pushing ahead with plans for the use of landforces and keeping the diplomatic pressure on Milosevic to agree to terms Iteven said that the fact that the embassy bombing has focused the attention ofthe UN Security Council may be no bad thing The Sunday Telegraph also urgedNATO to intensify the war effort saying that the problem with NATOs conductof the war is not that it is employing too much force It is that NATO has notused enough force to persuade the Serbs to behave in accordance with theminimum of humanity Accusing NATOs political leaders of pusillanimity itsaid NATOs equation seems to be simple half a million Kosovars are notworth one NATO pilot            TheDaily Telegraph Monday took the same line criticizing President Clintonfor his studied ambivalence during his visit to Europe and saying that itsuggests that he is still looking for a settlement on the basis of bombingalone Describing the attack on the Chinese Embassy as a crass mistake theTelegraph said it made Clintons aim harder to achieve than before withthe result that the air campaign will be prolonged as Kosovo is emptied ofethnic Albanians and the support of Western public opinion for Alliance actionwanes In such a quandary does the fear of taking casualties land you Unlikethe Telegraph and the Times  which seem to have given up hope ofa land invasion the liberal Guardian said Monday that the Chinese reaction to the embassybombing showed that American interests are intimately bound up with the speedyresolution of the Kosovo crisis Speed cannot now mean more bombs it saidSpeedy resolution could denote  greater willingness by the Americans to acton the ground            InParis Le Mondewarned in an editorial Sunday that because of Chinas attitude a UN force inKosovo might no longer even have a NATO core if the Russian and Ukrainianpresences in it were too strong Deploring this prospect it said the essentialaim of getting the Kosovo refugees back to their homes could only be achievedif the Kosovars have confidence in the force Its composition mustnt seem tothem like a compromise favorable to Belgrade   Le Monde said forif the hundreds of thousands of Kosovars chased from their land cannot returnthere freely to reconstruct their future the allied forces will have lost thewar            In Spain El Mundo Sunday describedNATO SecretaryGeneral Javier Solana and allied commander Gen Wesley Clark astotal incompetents And it said that the heads of government who appointedthem have taken on a grave responsibility by making themselves accomplices oftheir imbecilic smart bombs thus delegitimizing the noble aims with whichthis intervention was undertaken In La Repubblica of Rome Sunday the papers foundingeditor Eugenio Scalfari wrote We wanted an intelligent militaryintervention but we have had the stupidest intervention imaginable and heproposed that NATO should definitively stop describing its war aims ashumanitarian so as to protect itself from ridicule Scalfari describedClinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair as unconscious extremists whowere militating against peace as effectively as the extremists of Israel and AlFatah The latter are clearheaded the former probably unaware which isalmost worse
