                                 The New Courtney            Courtney Love used to saythat Alanis Morissette had killed alternative rock with her carefully craftedbrand of faux angrygirl rock Id argue that Courtney put the nail in thecoffin herself Oscar night Two years ago the widow of Kurt Cobain and Queenof Grunge threw a postOscar party in a yellowing thriftstore gown and tiarathe embodiment of rockstar glamour This time as the star of The Peoplevs Larry Flynt  shed had her famously scraggly hair blown out into avariation on the straight little Anna Wintour bob Her face applied bycelebrity makeup artist Kevin Aucoin had lost that jolie laide quality thatused to make her so compelling And she was wearing a tasteful dress by GianniVersaceVersace a man who built his empire dressing the very samepasttheirprime stars Sting Jon Bon Jovi Elton John in opposition to whomalternative rock arose She presented the award for best makeup of all thingsand played it completely straight talking in the measured midAtlantic accentthat her new friend Sharon Stone seems to adopt when she wants to soundcultivated Sulky Barbra Streisandwho refused to sing her Oscarnominatedsong because she herself hadnt been nominated for anythingcame off as abigger rebel than Courtney that night            There arerockworld observers who never considered Courtney a rebel who dismissed heras a marginally talented opportunist who married well and whose stock roseprecipitously after her husband committed suicide The daughter oflongdivorced parentsa mother who is a New Age therapist and a father who wasa Grateful Dead hangeronCourtney left home while in her teens and blew ameager trust fund traveling the world She lived in London Minneapolis LosAngeles and Alaska and always managed to hook up with powerful figures suchas film director Alex Cox She worked as a stripper She pursued Cobainrelentlessly convincing a record label that was wooing her to fly her to aNirvana show so she could meet him By the early s before anyone in themainstream knew who she was she was already such a legendary social climber onthe indierock scene that an Olympia Wash band called itself Courtney Lovejust to get on her nerves            All this deepened the luster of her image In an age inwhich agents and publicists once again monitor a stars movements asreligiously as they did in the swhen Rock Hudson was forced to marry hissecretary to forestall rumors that he was gayCourtney was an imperious andslightly unhinged anticelebrity physically incapable of keeping her mouthshut Once at a concert in Los Angeles she turned to the industryheavy VIPsection and threatened anyone who fucked with her former manager JanetBillig who had just been named vice president of Atlantic Records She punchedKathleen Hanna of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill backstage at Lollapaloozaand referred to her as ratface She was kicked off America Online for makingremarks that were too unladylike A few years ago she chased another rivalsingersongwriter Mary Lou Lord down Sunset Boulevard after Lord showed upuninvited at the after party for one of her shows            But herfansthe primarily female vaguely cerebral postboomer listeners like me whomade her band Holes album Live Through This go platinum that is sell million copiesadmired Courtney in the face of evidence that she wassomething of a trial She was a lessthanfit mother with a drug habitwhich was unfortunate she has since stopped using drugs The backlash againsther on that score still seemed misogynous How many drugaddled male rock starswith children have been taken to task for the same behavior Not KeithRichards not John Lennon not Aerosmiths Steven Tyler who didnt evenacknowledge his daughter Liv Tyler until she was in her teens Leaving behind atrail of babies conceived with groupies has long been a key to guyrockmystique            Like Madonna Courtney had a brain and was notafraid to use it But Courtney seemed much more real and more pertinent thanMadonna whose strength and sexuality appear by comparison cold andcalculatinga powersuited s enterprise with little range forcontradiction I want to be the girl with the most cake Courtney sang onLive Through This  It was a perfect expression of the kind ofcutandpaste feminism young women I know practice which makes room forselfdestructiveness and fashion magazines and La Perla lingerie and furyOnstage shed prop her leg up on the monitor and wail into the microphone likeany guy Offstage shed announce that she had got a nose job lost weight anddyed her hair blond because she knew that that was what it was going to take tomake people pay attention to her It wasnt just idolatry we felt it wasanxiety memories of the times when she was so strung out at a show that shehad to be carried offstage by her manager while the crowd shouted slut andwhore Three years ago when Hole played its first New York show afterCobains death every rock critic in town showed up to see if shed pull itoff She did            In orderfor The People vs Larry Flynt to qualify for insurance coverage duringthe shoot Courtney had to prove her sobriety by peeing into a cup once a weekOne can understand her desire then to continue proving to the world thatshes no longer a loose cannon And a girl is certainly entitled to makeherself over In fact now that mainstream artists like Sheryl Crow haveadopted the trashedout slutty look it was probably canny of Courtney torethink her style And there may not be a lot of room for subversion at theAcademy Awards where Cuba Gooding Jr gets a standing ovation just forgleefully evading the second acceptancespeech rule            Afriend of mine who knows Courtney says shes still thesame old feisty cuss once the cameras are off but that just means shesgetting good at separating her public and private personas at being the kindof slick movie star whose opinions stay within welldemarcated boundariesUnder this new regime we have a Courtney who amazingly has nothing she wantsto share with us about Gloria Steinems oldschoolfeminist attack on the movieand on Larry Flynt with whom she has become friends A Courtney who toldPremiere this fall The welcome that I get from grownups in the filmindustry is so nice Im used to going to the mall and having a kid in blacklipstick scream at me I love you I didnt kill myself because of you OrYou suck But a grownup in his s in a suit being nice I melt            If Courtney abandoned Holetomorrow to be an actress it would be a shame but not a tragedyshes a goodactress too Its not as if shes sold out because any majorlabel rock starwho claims to have managed not to is selfdeluded But while shes obviouslynot a talent on the order of Pablo Picasso or Norman Mailer she does have anoutsize nasty personality and women arent offered that spectacle very oftenIts odd to watch a woman who named her daughter for the notorious Hollywoodrulebreaker Frances Farmer purring at a pat on the head from the Hollywoodphonies she would formerly have laughed at But as she herself once sang Ifake it so real I am beyond fake It may be that the artificial constructionthat is the new Courtney is the realest Courtney yet
