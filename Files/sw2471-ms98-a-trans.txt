        well we havent really heard that much in the news lately about uh US involvement in Latin America since uh all this Middle East crisis began so i havent really paid that much attention like since        back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on um Iraq and the so the last thing that i remember hearing that much about is the IranContra scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency can you think of anything else thats happened recently   no i would agree with you we havent had too much but uh historically weve always uh almost been like a big brother to in and to the Latin American area and uh almost used them i i i feel um i think something will have to be done down there very soon about uh   umhum   about Mexico and and uh some of the other areas but with the Persian Gulf as you said its just uh been very quiet i i keep pretty close tabs on the paper and you dont hardly see a unless its there and were just not seeing it   well the only uh references that i have seen lately has been uh  in part of the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things and and they made references to in the past   umhum   how we have given arms to uh Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America and that those might turn around and haunt us someday i mean not not to this large scale as Iraq but that whenever we give arms to people   well its umhum   as as we did and as we sold arms to  pardon me to Iraq when we wanted them to fight Iran and then uh and then it turned around and   umhum umhum i i agree were the largest munitions producer in the world and so um theres a lot of money to be made there and its uh be very difficult to to cut it back to a level where it should be and and then it will come back to haunt us it seems to come in cycles   umhum  and i know when i spent the time that ive studied in Mexico uh since Spanish was one of my majors in college  that uh there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America   umhum   about uh like you say using them you our interest there is you know what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them and that we werent normally very interested in them and they have in other in most Latin American countries they   right   there are a lot of the kind of problems that weve fought for in other countries you know that they have corruption and and they dont have um i mean theres just very few really modern cities   right and the probably the biggest biggest problem down there is thats where the thats the drug entry points in their economies   umhum   of several several of the countries especially Columbia is so built on the on the on the drugs that uh our our little war on drugs has really been laughable its just a you know such a small amount and it does it just it um cuts off just a trickle and uh if if we cant get a handle on that through some through some uh method i dont know where where thatll be another big problem   well thats right because thats just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have uh have to have that for farming  and they dont look at it so much as you know   right right and as long as were the largest uh consumer then uh this is the market   umhum thats right   if we can cut back the usage then uh maybe itll have to go someplace else   and i think its really very sad that north of the border you know the United States and Canada is so different from the South from South America and Central America theres really a disparity between the um   umhum umhum yeah   what you i would call civilization of the countries you know   right yeah were just so much wealthier and uh and uh there has to be resentment built up and thats where uh leaders can use uh use that whenever the opportune moment arises   umhum yes its really kind of sad and that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and   yeah   uh Israel and the Middle East Arab countries and and when we have when we have a lot of problems right right in our own back door   thats right our own hemisphere but weve thats been uh thats been the way its always been   hm  so i guess weve kind of neglected Latin America   so uh very much so except when we need them you know when they found oil in Mexico then we got very friendly with them again   right recently yeah fairly recently well thats really sad i hadnt thought about that in a long time   yeah hm   well i guess then i will go but i made me stop and think a minute about   okay sure did   not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis i know that its not settled but  there are other areas that we could focus our attention on well thank you you have a good day byebye   always yes maam you too dear bye
