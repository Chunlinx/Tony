                okay so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess   um a lot well the last movie i saw but it wasnt my choice was the Ninja Turtle movie   obviously you have kids   thats right yeah but my preference is the one we saw before that was Silence of the Lambs   i havent seen that one yet   thats an excellent movie   um the last movie i saw was uh Sleeping With The Enemy and i uh see im not a big Julie Roberts fan but i was a lot   oh was that good i heard oh okay   i was i was a lot more impressed with her than i though i would be it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be so yeah it was a pretty good movie   well thats good yeah Silence of the Lambs kept me on the edge of my seat   i im ready to go it just its you know hasnt worked out that way yet you know its uh it looks good you know   right yeah it is right and i do   if you like thrillers anyway  in fact people ive talked to said that they hadnt slept real good for a while afterwards so  so   oh really oh i love them like that im not i mean i i like all ranges of movies but   yeah uhhuh   i like that where they run tense i really enjoy they keep me guessing the whole time its really it was really interesting   uhhuh uhhuh well what other movies have you seen then lately   oh   other than the i assume you were talking about the new Ninja Turtles movie   yes the new one of course   is that any good i mean im sure im going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives and shes got two boys that i took to see the first one so im sure im going to see the next one here real soon     oh it really was i didnt see it the first one my husband said it was um about the same lines   oh well then it wont be too bad you know it wasnt impressive necessarily but it was better than it could have been   so yes right right and um i was impressed with the fact that um it wasnt that childish you know what i mean it wasnt my daughters five i mean she understood everything she goes to almost all movies with us except you know R rated and uh   yeah   she really enjoyed it but it was on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids didnt understand that adults did and i liked that   right right yeah i think thats important if youre going you know if youre going uh kids are going to uh parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi you know   right thats right thats right its pretty good but we take her to just about   semi for them too so yeah   every movie and she uh she does really good weve taken her from real young and she does real good like i said we dont take her to Rs so if and when we ever get a babysitter like we did with Silence of the Lambs we go see it   uhhuh uhhuh i was about to say youre not going to take her to that one im sure do you take her or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to   oh no no yeah yeah um   what was the last comedy you saw   oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw huh huh huh good question  good question we dont get to go that often but im       something on the tip of my tongue and i cant think of which one it was um noise gosh i cant remember i   the last uh in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw i said that wrong the last movie i saw was The Hard Way with Michael J Fox well that really wasnt too bad it   uhhuh but that that sounds good   there were you know hes supposed you know hes this actor right and hes hes playing a a cop well hes hes hes hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the the stuff i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop   uhhuh right oh okay   you know i mean there there were times when he was like hed be running with a gun or whatever he didnt look like a cop when he did it and i was so impressed with that because   uhhuh thats neat cause that the part was hard to do that   you know you oh yeah because i mean everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever and uh i thought he did such an excellent job of not   right yeah   going that far now by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was trying to trying to get it but he wasnt there yet but you could tell   right yeah right   like i said i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job i think they did a real good job of that and um James Woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop i mean you know he just yeah   uhhuh yeah i like him   yeah and there were there were some definite um should i say tense moments with him in there so   probably the last comedy we saw now that i think about it is Home Alone   yes i i i had seen it before Christmas but i took a date to it uh about a month ago so i i ive seen it the second time not too long ago so   yeah uhhuh it was really cute   i really enjoyed it of course the bad thing about it was uh uh the the second time i saw it i didnt really enjoy it as much and i was kind of surprised at that i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over but before maybe its just the idea of my reaction the first time i laughed so hard i was hoarse     yeah uhhuh uhhuh   i really was i was hoarse getting out of there and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didnt have it i mean it just wasnt as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time i dont know but   yeah right yeah maybe so maybe so   yeah i mean it was it was a great movie though i loved the movie   yeah i did too im looking forward to this summer uh Naked Gun Two and a Half is coming out   i love those movies   i do too i mean they are just slapstick it you have to see those twice to catch everything   oh yeah well you have to see them more than that i i i still catch things in Airplane that i didnt catch   yeah yeah those yeah i do too   i its amazing i love those movies i really do   so im looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do well we  we try to go   yeah oh yeah   a couple of times a month i guess to see a movie it its just getting so expensive   uhhuh oh isnt it though you know but thats at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper thats exactly what i was going to say i keep not doing it until after im there and then all of a sudden im saying i wish id bought these things   right but normally we dont think about it until  right i know because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the three of us yeah   easily yeah yeah and then if you want popcorn and stuff its just i mean uh its incredible     i dont understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both you know popcorn is not that expensive so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and Coke   no no its nowhere near that expensive and it its just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style i mean its as simple as that   yeah we just keep breeding them   yeah and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them you know yes oh yeah oh that was that was an excellent movie   i guess so now have you seen Dances With Wolves did you love it i havent seen were waiting for the video   no dont dont that needs the big screen it really and truly does because to get the feeling   no really oh uhhuh   of like when the buffaloes are when theyre chasing the buffaloes and everything youve got to be where you feel it you really truly do i would i mean   uhhuh oh really oh   i would i mean i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too but im glad i didnt i really and truly am i mean that movie that was one movie i came out impressed   really uhhuh   i really and truly did i mean i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars none at all normally im one of these people that i dont like one one movie taking all the honors i wanted him to win best   thats good i heard that yeah yeah   best actor on top of it like i said i wouldnt given the supporting actresses either one but even though they were okay the girl in it   yeah oh yeah   uh they uh somebody made an interesting observation now that i think back on it id say yeah i cant believe that either she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times you know what i mean you know   oh gosh  yeah yeah   it was just too perfect at all times that was a mistake that they made they shouldnt have done it now the best the supporting actor he was good   yeah   but from what i heard the guy who got it was better so i you know i can see that but oh   yeah do you think my daughter would like it   oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side but um its its   or just oh okay she doesnt mind when we cover up her eyes   okay no problems it its just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides so theres you know theres   see thats the one that is the honest to God the one reason i dont want to see the movie is because i love buffaloes for some weird reason  and i know theyre fake   yeah but well and and of course and well yeah that and plus i mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt so i mean they are killing buffaloes in it but they dont stress that very much they really dont and i think its an excellent movie for if if she enjoys   okay okay   movies i think itll work pretty good yeah   oh thatll be good we really need some my husband keeps wanting to yeah and i heard the videos even going to be longer they did a lot of stuff that they cut out   its its its a long movie oh yeah i may have to see the video i hadnt even thought of that   yeah thats true they said yeah they said theres a lot that had been edited because of the length   uhhuh uhhuh   and that they wanted in so theyre going to put it in the video and that way you can watch it at your leisure   yeah well yeah i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said there are certain things you cant do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea   yeah thats true yeah yeah   because i mean when you rent a video videos of course are not cheaper either and um and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they they make bundles of money off those things   true yeah i know it isnt that ridiculous we have cable which helps a lot   oh i do too yeah but not enough yeah im getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch Nick at Nite   yeah we keep holding out you know
