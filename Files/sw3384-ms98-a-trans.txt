        okay do you work   yes i do   i think thats the main change what do you think   well i think thats a big part of it and i i think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home and i almost think with our society and and inflation and the cost of things its anymore its almost couples have to work outside the home   one right thats right   but but yeah i think thats a big change  id like to not work what about you   well ive worked all the time up until just about a year ago   yeah   and i just uh physically i wasnt able to and i mean i love my job but i have four children and thats real hard you have children i assume so   umhum yes i have two and thats been a big deciding factor because i mean i never wanted to be a career woman but as long as i was was you know was going to work i was going to do as as much as i could as well as i could etcetera and   right right right   i i wanted to stay home when i had kids well i have two i have a four year old and a three year old and we would like two more but i its like we talked uh i dont want two more unless i can quit and stay home and take care of them which is something right now financially it takes both people to work   oh right oh its real hard its real hard i mean even i   yeah its full time work   yeah it was so hard for me to work full time course my kids are are a little older but then you then you give up the money you know   umhum yeah you do theres saying course you know everything you give up something but i just i the kids are so wonderful  but i do think thats one of the major changes you know my mom i remember her being home   yeah thats yep   uh you know she made breakfast in the morning for us and if she worked it was part time and it was work that was done while we were at maybe at school and she was there when we got home you know and   fine yep i know yeah well ive decided now in fact im just im substitute teachers aid which is a a far cry from my travel agent career you which i loved   uhhuh   but im im there in the same school as my children my two littler ones   umhum   and im home when theyre home in fact ive had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store and im just really hesitating because ive i enjoyed my the first summer home ever spent seventeen years with my kids   yeah oh oh   i mean where i didnt have babies or day care or working as a travel agent and it was wonderful my kids and i we just had a ball course their their ages theyre seventeen almost seventeen fifteen almost well sixteen fourteen eleven and nine and were just running every direction and   yeah see and i think oh oh but see its such an important time to be home   it is yes   you know and that was important to me an thats my you know my husband was raised uh his his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked and hes like well you know whats the big deal about being home for your kids   always were what yeah   well as our kids are getting older you know he sees it more i said Russ you dont understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed mom at school you know she was there to help or she was there to take you and you and and i want to be able to do those things so   right right i think that you know its good you know sometimes ill have the cookies ready when they come home and and a lot of my boys uh my older boys junior high friends will come over in fact everyday ive got boys hanging around   yeah     and its wonderful  im real close to the schools and you know were just i im very happy to be staying home   i think thats wonderful  so where do you see us changing in the future   but again i miss the money i dont i  working   well see that was one of the things she the the question i think is you know what changes do we see and im  im not sure i i see it going anywhere i think theyre still gonna have to work   right that we are because its so expensive if we want the extra clothes the extra car the extra  thing is when a woman does work   right   then theres the clothes to buy and then theres the gas and then theres the lunches and then the day care you must pay a fortune in day care yeah   umhum umhum the day care eats me alive you know i pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty a month for two kids  theyd eat you alive   oh my gosh yeah for two its almost hardly worth it for you to work till they get in school then you work summers unless youre a teacher are you a teacher   i know you no im not and i would love you you you talked about having the summers off and i thought oh that would be so wonderful and i love the little preschool they are in its wonderful you know so i feel good about them being there but its still not the same     huh umhum no its not the same   its just not   i i dont see things changing really and and its terrible for divorced women   umhum   you know who are forced to work who maybe dont have a college education thank goodness i have mine and i could get a real good paying job if i wanted to you know do in fact i still have offers you know please come back and well pay you this   umhum hm please come back to work sure   yeah yeah and its been a real tough decision but im very happy to be here with my kids my kids weve seen a remarkable difference in now that im home   thats wonderful thats wonderful   yeah im real and im but ive been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis  yeah yeah i know   well i like that well were working on it im hoping in about three to five years ill be able to stay home and my kids of course will be in school then but ill be there mornings ill be there noons ill be there afternoons and all i feel like thats good and i can work part days in my husbands business you know so that   right yeah well oh thatd be great right i think the the other thing that that has changed for women because we are working is were having less children   he can afford for us to do that you know
