                                  No Pain No Gain            Once upon a time there wasa densely populated island nation which despite its lack of naturalresources had managed through hard work and ingenuity to build itself into oneof the worlds major industrial powers But there came a time when the magicstopped working A brief overheated boom was followed by a slump that lingeredfor most of a decade A country whose name had once been a byword for economicprowess instead became a symbol of faded glory            Inevitably a disputeraged over the causes of and cures for the nations malaise Many observersattributed the economys decline to deep structural factorsinstitutions thatfailed to adapt to a changing world missed opportunities to capitalize on newtechnologies and general rigidity and lack of flexibility But a fewdissented While conceding these factors were at work they insisted that muchof the slump had far shallower rootsthat it was the avoidable consequence ofan excessively conservative monetary policy one preoccupied with conventionalstandards of soundness when what the economy really needed was to roll theprinting presses            Needless to say the inflationists were dismissed bymainstream opinion Adopting their proposals argued central bankers andfinance ministry officials would undermine confidence and hence worsen theslump And even if inflationary policies were to give the economy a false flushof artificial health they would be counterproductive in the long run becausethey would relax the pressure for fundamental reform Better to take the bittermedicine nowto let unemployment rise to force companies to purge themselvesof redundant capacitythan to postpone the day of reckoning            OK OK Ive used thiswriting trick before The previous paragraphs could describe the current debateabout Japan I myself am of course the most notorious advocate of inflationas a cure for Japans slump But they could also describe Great Britain in thesa point brought home to me by my vacation reading the second volume ofRobert Skidelskys biography of John Maynard Keynes which covers the crucialperiod from  to  The volumes title incidentally is JohnMaynard Keynes                The Economist as Savior             Skidelskys book believe it or not is actually quiteabsorbing Although he was an economist Keynes led an interestinglifethough to tell the truth what I personally found myself envying was theway he managed to change the world without having to visit quite so much of itImagine being a prominent economist without once experiencing jet lag ornever taking a business trip where you spent more time getting to and from yourdestination than you spent at it And anyone with an interest in the historyof economic thought will find the tale of how Keynes gradually painfullyarrived at his ideasand of how his emerging vision clashed with rival schoolsof thoughtfascinating Click for an example            But the part ofSkidelskys book that really resonates with current events concerns the greatdebate over British monetary policy in the s Like the United StatesBritain experienced an inflationary boom fed by real estate speculation inparticular immediately following World War I In both countries this boom wasfollowed by a nasty recession But whereas the United States soon recovered andexperienced a decade of roaring prosperity before the coming of the GreatDepression Britains slump never really ended Unemployment which hadaveraged something like  percent before the war stubbornly remained above percent There is an obvious parallel with modern Japan whose bubble economyof the late s burst eight years ago and has never bounced back            Almost everyone who thought about it agreed that Britainslongrun relative decline as an economic power had much to do with structuralweaknesses an overreliance on traditional industries such as coal and cottona classridden educational system that still tried to produce gentlemen ratherthan engineers and managers a business culture that had failed to make thetransition from the family firm to the modern corporation Keynes never oneto mince words wrote that the hereditary principle in the transmission ofwealth and the control of business is the reason why the leadership of theCapitalist cause is weak and stupid It is too much dominated bythirdgeneration men Similarly everyone who thinks about it agrees thatmodern Japan has deep structural problems a failure to move out of traditionalheavy industry an educational system that stresses obedience rather thaninitiative a business system that insulates big company managers from marketreality            But need structuralproblems of this kind lead to high unemployment as opposed to slow growth Isrecession the price of inefficiency Keynes didnt think so then and those ofus who think along related lines dont think so now Recessions we claim canand should be fought with shortrun palliatives by all means let us work onour structural problems but meanwhile let us also keep the work force employedby printing enough money to keep consumers and investors spending            One objection to that proposal is that it will directly domore harm than good In the s the great and the good believed that anessential precondition for British recovery was a return to the prewar goldstandardat the prewar parity that is making a pound worth  It wasbelieved that this goal was worth achieving even if it required a substantialfall in wages and pricesthat is general deflation To ratify thedepreciation of the pound that had taken place since  in order to avoidthat deflation was clearly irresponsible            In modern times ofcourse it would on the contrary seem irresponsible to advocate deflation inthe name of a historical monetary benchmark though Hong Kong is currentlyfollowing a de facto policy of deflation in order to defend the fixed exchangerate between its currency and the US dollar But orthodoxy continues toprevail against the logic of economic analysis In the case of Japan there isa compelling intellectual case for a recovery strategy based on the deliberatecreation of managed inflation But the great and the good know thatprice stability is essential and that inflation is always a bad thing            What really struck me in Skidelskys account however wasthe extent to which conventional opinion in the s viewed high unemploymentas a good thing a sign that excesses were being corrected anddiscipline restoredso that even a successful attempt to reflate the economywould be a mistake And one hears exactly the same argument now As oneordinarily sensible Japanese economist said to me Your proposal would justallow those guys to keep on doing the same old things just when the recessionis finally bringing about change            In short in Japan todayand perhaps in the UnitedStates tomorrowbehind many of the arguments about why we cant monetize ourway out of a recession lies the belief that pain is good that it builds astronger economy Well let Keynes have the last word It is a grave criticismof our way of managing our economic affairs that this should seem to anyonelike a reasonable proposal
