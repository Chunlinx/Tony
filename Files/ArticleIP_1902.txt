                                 A Penny for Your Thoughts            Transactions involvingmoneysay the purchase of something at a storecost money The cashier mustbe paid the cash register bought the bookkeeper hired etc Honest mistakesand dishonesty also take a toll These expenses can be expressed as a cost pertransaction The higher that cost the larger the transaction has to be inorder for it to make financial sense            Computersare very good at counting money and keeping records so they have been used fordecades to manage transactions Today when your credit card is run through thelittle machine at the checkout counter computers handle the entiretransaction Nobody is going to look at that little slip you sign unless aproblem develops            What is the cost of a transaction done purely by computerA recent estimate put the cost at less than onemillionth of one cent pertransactionie  transactions can be done for  Digitalcashwhere the value is stored on the card you carry and theres no need tocheck your credit against a faraway databasemay be even cheaper            Regardlessof how its done transaction costs will continue to plummet as computers getmore powerful Low transaction costs are a wonderful thing if youre in thetransaction business Theyre wonderful for consumers too making it cheaperand easier to buy things and creating new things to buy All this is especiallytrue now that the Internet provides a direct connection between sellers andmillions of consumers            In a normal situation you could end there Butthis isnt a normal situation This is the Internet where any legitimate ideais immediately taken to ridiculous limits Thats because there are plenty ofwouldbe Internet visionaries competing to outdo each other both inphilosophizing and in trying to sell shares in their startup companies to thepublic The magic words on the Internet if inserted into nearly anysentence seem to protect it from normal critical scrutiny            So it iswith cheap transactions which tend to go by the sexier name of micropaymentsystems Press reports about micropayment schemes extol their virtues inbreathless wonder Micropayments it is said will revolutionize the economicsof journalism on the Net a topic Ive opined onbefore People will pay some small feelike  centsto read an articlerather than buy a whole magazine for  Or what the hell they can pay bythe paragraph sentence word orwhy not push it to the extremethe bitWouldnt that be wonderful            No actually it wouldnt Micropayments might be importantin some limited areas but most of the hoopla is very poorly thought out Tosee why consider Slate which recently decided to remain free to users fornow But imagine that several years hence Slate is trying to decide amongmicropayments subscriptions and remaining free Lets consider what effectthese choices will have on a couple of typical users or readers as theyused to be calledtellingly the computer industry shares with the drugindustry the habit of referring to its customers as users            Joe Avidis what we in the computer industry would call a heavy user Joe reads everybit of every issue of Slate Jeff Accidental rarely reads Slate on purposebutevery now and then he follows a link from another site into Slate Somewherein the middle is Tom Average who reads Slate just as much as the average userdoes            What price should we set for the micropaymentIf we set the price so that it will yield the same total revenue as asubscription then Tom Average will pay the same amount either way JeffAccidental will save a bundle by buying occasional articles instead of havingto buy a subscription But its tough luck for Joe Avid Heand everybody elsewho reads more of Slate than its average readerwill pay more than a normalsubscription would cost In customerservice circles this is known asscrewing your best customer Thats OK in the sex industry but not so greatin others because it tends to alienate the loyal supporters who form the coreof the business It is though standard practice in the printmagazineindustry which gives new subscribers a bargain rate and rewards steady renewalby raising the price            Theproblem for Slate and other Internet sites comes from having to charge forusage when what theyre selling is intellectual property with a flatproduction cost Slate doesnt get used up by being used It costs virtuallythe same amount to produce no matter how many people use it and no matter howheavy the use            The Random House Unabridged Dictionary is priced at and has  entries Of these I have looked up maybe  of them since Ibought a copy a couple of years ago If I could pay based on usage RandomHouse would have to charge me  for each word I looked up to bring in the samerevenue Hardly a micropayment Five bucks per look up would bankrupt frequentusersScrabble players or copy editors for example            But Ididnt really pay  to use  entries Its much more accurate to say thatI paid for the option to use any of the  entries that I might needSimilarly I subscribe to magazines to get an option just in case I want toread any of the articles The editors for their part arrange to have them allwritten just in case I do            You could argue that Joe Avid is so hooked onSlate that we can afford to put him over a barrel at the micropayment rateeven though it means that he will pay a lot more Similarly when dictionariesare all online Random House could hold up the worlds Scrabble players andcopy editors Unless that is there is competition that offers an exoticbilling option known as the subscription or flatprice deal It wont take agenius competitor to come up with this plan Charging a usagebased fee forcontent sounds fairbut it is artificial because your costs are fixed Aflatrate competitor would present an attractive proposition to Joe Avid andanybody else with heavierthanaverage usage            So whatabout a hybrid plansubscriptions for heavy users and micropayments for therest This is another way to say drop prices because heavierthanaverageusers will buy a subscription while lighterthanaverage users will choose thea la carte plan Dropping prices can sometimes make senseespecially when ashere you can drop them for only your least eager customers The airlines arespecialists in maximizing revenue and filling seats by charging differentamounts to different people            But this raises another question If lowering the pricegets you more customers why not lower it all the way to zero and get thegreatest number That is why not rely on advertising Advertising is ineffect a funny kind of micropayment system Advertisers pay on the basis ofhow many people see their ad For most media this is measured statisticallyvia surveys because statistical estimates are an even cheaper way to recordtiny transactions Theyre not exact but the overestimates and underestimatesaverage out over time Besides if the transactions are really small who caresif you miss a few Ad rates amount to a few cents per customer impressionwhich is in the same range as micropayments And of course the customer ends uppaying indirectly But it feels different to users If imposing micropaymentsor other explicit user fees loses you many users youll decide to stay freeand collect your micropayments through ads            Micropayments are great if you use them for a product or service with certainproperties It must be one where you can get away with usagebased pricing andwhere there is a strong rationale for making it cheap yet not free Putanother waymicropayments make sense only when they match the fundamentaleconomics of the product or service better than other ways of chargingProducts that get used up as they are used naturally have this property If thebasic economics are usagebased then the payment can be too This class doesnot include journalism or indeed most intellectual property Yet this iswhere micropayments are most often suggested            That isnt quite the end of the story Onesituation where micropayments will work is where there are no heavy users orrepeat customersor where you dont mind screwing your best customers Filmsare a good example The movie industry always starts a film with a highusagebased pricing model or so per ticket This price is high enough todiscourage many people from seeing the film That doesnt matter because aftera run in the theaters the film will be released to homevideo rental and payper view where it costs  to  and nobody counts how many people are in theroom There it picks up a few repeat customers but mostly new ones The priceis brought lower on premium cable like HBO which is a flatrate cost to theuser and it eventually hits zero when the movie appears on broadcasttelevision where ads support it            Technically speaking this is a repeated auction Were more familiar with whateconomists call an English auctionprices start low and rise as people bidHowever there is also the Dutch auction where prices start high and go loweruntil somebody bites Movies are sold to the audience via a very slow Dutchauction where each phase between price drops can last weeks or months Bookpublishers do the same thing with two stageshardcover and paperback            Movies get away with this because they dont generally haveheavy users or repeat customers Most people see a film once or at leastdont see it again for many months Some films inspire hardcore fanatics whosee them repeatedly but these viewers are so few in number that movie theatersdo not cut them a special deal The real savior is the repeated Dutch auctionwhich lets theaters be cavalier about pricing the movie beyond the reach of alarge set of customers because theyll get another crack at them later            Most Internet content doesnot have these special properties Sites need regular repeat visitors Theircosts for the most part are not usagebased So micropayments will play avery small role in selling Internet content Most sites probably will wind upbeing free supported by ads User fees will also exist but for any contentconducive to repeat use they will be based on a flat rateeither asubscription to a site or a membership that lets you get to a set of sites Apenny wont buy much even on the Web
