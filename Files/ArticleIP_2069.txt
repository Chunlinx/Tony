shortage in Christmas  Part of theshortage was pure perception Shoppers hold mailorder firms to a higherstandard than department stores when it comes to keeping things in stockbecause the catalogs afford them a photo and item number for every parkaturtleneck and blazer ever placed in inventory When those same shoppers shopat a department store they have no way of knowing that it has sold all of
