                uh the clothing i guess that uh i wanted to talk about is the different uh uh types of wardrobe that one might need to have in the kind of job or well i think that you probably have a fulltime job if youre a college student       a fulltime do you consider that fulltime   i consider a fulltime college student i dont consider it really a job but i guess in a way it would be  i never really thought about it     well do you um do you have a kind of wardrobe i suppose you do that is suitable for almost all the year or do you change quite a bit during the seasons     um oh my everyone pretty much well like in the winter everyone more more susceptible to the sweatshirts and you know the big heavy sweaters   uhhuh   and basically everyone wears jeans but in the summer everyones basically in shorts and sometimes we still do wear sweatshirts with our shorts you know   uhhuh sure   so um i would just say the only difference is you know like long sleeve and short sleeve between summer and winter   yes yes um what year are you in college   im a senior   okay well uh what i might uh suggest since i have had a working career at the present time im not working but it was so helpful to me you do plan probably to work when you receive your degree   yes   yes  and what are you receiving it in     finance   finance well my husband is a financial person   uhhuh uhhuh   uh but when i worked i tended to uh be confused a lot at first and tried i would get things out of the closet and oh that wouldnt do and this wouldnt do i just seemed to have more clothes than i could wear   uhhuh   or that i wanted to wear and i went and had that uh Color Me Beautiful thing done   uhhuh     and uh in fact i did it really that part just for fun because i have gotten her book before are you aware aware of that book   no     well it uh tells you what colors really are best on you   uhhuh   and uh what season you are winter spring you you heard people talk about that   yeah um ive had one of those things done for like makeup and stuff   okay Well i did it uh primarily for clothing because um i have dark hair and kind of sallow reddy complexion and um those beige good looking cashmere beige suits that i wanted so badly were horrible on me   umhum   and so when i got this color test done for clothing i found out that thats probably the worst color i can wear       so i started buying only those colors that were good for a winter and im a winter   uhhuh   and um so after about uh and and i was working and i added a few things to my wardrobe uh in the colors that i out that i already to the colors that i already had that i could wear plus i bought some and do you know it made traveling and working so much more simple   uhhuh   because and i i did away with all those colors that like the beige blouses i couldnt wear i can wear white but i couldnt wear beige   uhhuh   so i got rid of all those i mean i hated to get rid of those suits and pantsuits that were a hundred and fifty     knowing how much money you spent on them   really but i didnt look people would say have you been feeling well lately when i would wear those beige       suits   uhhuh     so it made it so much more simple for me to have everything pretty much in one color family For instance i wear burgundy well   uhhuh   and uh purple and hot pinks well very often those can be combined combined and navy blues and whites       so when i travel for a week i really would only have to take one pair of shoes a suit several blouses an extra shirt or two   uhhuh   and it was so much simpler if you will think about that   yeah well see um im im a cool person they call they and they i think thats relates to the same thing as the winter   uhhuh   and the summer is the warmer colors and i i pretty much wear the same colors you just described i wear a lot of navy blues   uhhuh   um i wear a lot of like a magenta or a hot pink color you know and and in those shades   yes exactly uhhuh   um i wear a lot of greens though too   uhhuh uhhuh   you know just the the darker greens i dont like wearing the light greens   uhhuh   and uh black and maroon and you know i wear the darker colors yeah   yeah yes well now when you start have you started interviewing for jobs yet   no i havent   um well when you start interviewing for jobs and if you do put in some quite a bit of money in your clothing keep that in mind because those those pieces of clothing will do you probably for several years   oh yeah i already started buying suits and ive already you know ive bought the suits that i always wear colors in so   yeah uhhuh uhhuh well thats thats very smart   uhhuh   well i i have we exhausted our subject         ive talked so much why dont you uh uh tell me uh what kind of if you had an interview tomorrow what would you probably wear   uhhuh what would i wear   uhhuh   i have um this suede suit its a double breasted coat with a skirt and i have a number of different blouses i could wear with it one blouse that looks really nice with it is a real deep red blouse   uhhuh sounds pretty well i read an article in the uh Charlotte paper yesterday from one of the fashion experts here   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   who said that stockings um are also not given enough emphasis uh it choose we dont choose them uh quite so well and it says that suntan really doesnt g o with everything   uhhuh yeah   and try to get one of the experts uh where you buy uh nice stockings to tell you the color to wear with outfits   umhum   uh uh in fact she doesnt give white a real high grade   no i dont even wear white stockings with this just because its just too much white with the white shoes and everything   its too white isnt it yes   uhhuh i wear i wear the tan   uhhuh uhhuh   you know or the nude or whatever you want to call it yeah   yeah or i think uh i dont know what is that a white white suit or is it a kind of creamy white   its really different its not quite its its not what you would call really an offwhite and its i dont think its a real white white either you know   well it probably looks good on you then but since its not very offwhite   uhhuh   well anyway i thought that i it was the first time i had ever read an article on stockings or or panty hose or whatever you call them these days and   umhum   but it did say that uh uh they really pretty much needed to be uh they need to look good with uh the skirt and the shoes and you count you think of it as a total outfit   umhum yeah   but it said also they find that navy skirt and navy stockings and navy shoes are very boring   yeah that would just be too much  oh gosh   uhhuh    well its been fun talking to you   it was nice talking to you too   and i hope uh it would be nice im getting to talk to some of the same people   oh really   yes and i i understand we need some more guys to talk to so you might uh leave a message if you know any guys that want to do this   oh okay   okay you have you have a nice day byebye   okay thank you you too byebye
