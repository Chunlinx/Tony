                                 Now Is the Summer of Too Much Content                           Now Isthe Summer of Too Much Content                        Steven Brill complainsimplausibly that the press doesnt pay enough attention to itself The enormousattention devoted to the premiere of his magazine of press criticismBrills Content  somewhat undermines the magazines founding premiseThat subtlety shouldnt cause him too much distress because the presssfascination with itself is a bonanza for its selfproclaimed scourge Do notlook for articles in Brills Content exposing how the media wereenslaved by Steve Brill like the article in the premier issue exposing themedias alleged enslavement by Kenneth Starr No if Brills Content he hasevery reason to be            Far be itfrom                   Slate                of course to complain about a ludicrous excess ofpublicity attending the arrival of a new magazine Weve been there too Andwere embarrassed to say that the current issue of                   Slate                doesnothing to alleviate the symptoms of Brill Overkill Brill Brills Content and thecontents of Brills Content have been at least touched upon during thelast few days in the following                   Slate                departments Todays Papers The WeekThe Spin In Other Magazines of course Chatterbox  PunditCentral Explainer TheBreakfast Table and StrangeBedfellow Ohand Readme Every aspect of the phenomenon has beensummarized analyzed criticized We feel this has been a useful trial run forfuture                   Slate                coverage of the outbreak of a major war                           Slate s coverage of Brillorama is notwildly consistent JacobWeisberg accuses Brill of breaking the basic rules of journalism William Saletan accuseshim of cleverly obeying those rules while offending journalistic ethical valuesall the same Weisberg and Seth Stevenson disagree about whether the magazines centralfailure is boredom or sanctimoniousness Susan Estrich asserts that Brills big scoop is no big deal whilearound her we analyze it in detail scroll past David Brooks posting to readhers            Still theoverall take of all our coverage is fairly negative That is not intentionalPerhaps Brills Content will devote a future article to explaining whyit so often just seems to turn out that way We have nothing against BrillsContent  In fact we wish it well And no publication should be judgedirrevocably based on its first issue Basicallylets be bluntwell do orsay whatever it takes to be on good terms with journalisms growliest attackdog  Good doggie Down boy Stevie wanna biscuit  And if it meanshaving all the writers who criticize him this week killedwhy consider itdone Its just a small gesture from                   Slate                to help the worldsleading press critic do his job of ensuring the highest standards of honestyaccuracy and freedom of thought in the press            The truth is that Brills reputation as anattack dogcherished above all by Brill himselfis not completely deservedAt his previous publication American Lawyer  he more or less invented agenre of article that might be called the puff piece in the form of a hatchetjob A typical American Lawyer article might reveal that Attorney X is amean nasty unscrupulous son of a bitch wholl do anything to win a caseAttorney Xs business would soar as would his selfesteem AmericanLawyer s famous exposs of top lawyers salaries Brills indignanteditorials about overlavish summer intern programs accompanying complex chartsthat compared the number of opera tickets and restaurant dinners offered byvarious firms  all had the natural effect of increasing the excesses hecomplained about            Overall by the veryattention it devotesthe breathless prose the endlessness of the articlesthe huge photos of men in suits standing in front of shelves ofbooks American Lawyer has made the law seem more important and evenglamorized it Now Brills Content will do the same for the media wherewe already suspect we might be glamorous He will flatter us by the verystandards he accuses us of failing to meet by turning our peccadilloes intomoral crises by the very gloss on his publication thats all about us andabove all by giving us an excuse once a month to write about ourselves            So goodluck Steve and let us know if theres anything we can do Some softwareperhaps Fresh salmon Straight cash Nothings too good for the guy whosgonna make us journalists take a long look in the mirror
