        so have you heard about Saturns     ive heard some about Saturns i dont know a lot about them i havent been over uh to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonights paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the i guess the Japanese cars   ooh thats great actually thats kind of the type of car that i im thinking about we might get Saturns you cant go to a dealer unless you go to a a Saturn dealer   umhum   yeah this this offshoot of GM     yeah   and uh supposedly theyve got great customer   satisfaction from what things ive heard   hm yeah ive heard a lot of people like them uh yeah i dont know whether whether i would buy Saturn or not at this point im kind of my card and uh desires tend to be pretty picky and so uh   well like what   well lets see i like i like cars that are designed with with human beings in mind and thats not just the driver and the passenger but thats the person whose working on it because i do almost almost all my own maintenance and uh       those types of things and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh finding a car car anymore thats thats fairly easy for me to work on it just not very easy its not very almost unlikely at this point   yeah   and uh   yeah ive got a sixty five Mustang and i and i do the work on most of the work on that myself     ooh umhum   and when i look at modern cars and stuff like  i just say i will never do that with the modern cars its not worth my time you cant get in there you cant do anything   yeah   and its so complicated too i look at it and i say boy you know i id have to almost go take a class or something like that   well ive got an eighty three Saab   umhum   and uh i find that for a normal you know everyday things its really very easy to work on and so uh now im kind of spoiled i used to have an old uh Chevy uh with a three fifty in it and uh i really liked working on it   uhhuh yeah     ah cause it was pretty easy too it was about a nineteen seventy so im kind of uh biased in that and you know i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore   yeah   and thats kind of thats thats probably one thing id look at i think another thing id look at is safety   yeah thats one of the things that my wife and i have thought about actually the car one of the cars wed most like to get would be the new ninety one Ford Taurus because theyre actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags   hm thats a real nice car i think   yeah   ive driven some uh Tauruses over the last couple of years when ive been on business trips uh as rental cars and ive always been very impressed   uhhuh   with the Tauruses its a really nice car i think its very its a stylish car both inside and out its comfortable to drive uh reasonable performance and this is out in California  where where they dont make a car thats got reasonable performance anymore   yeah   uh ive been real impressed with that you you and i didnt realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now   ninety yep then or excuse me the ninety twos the ninety twos had dual air bags this newest model you could get them with duals   umhum well i think that thats excellent thats excellent because   yeah but the thing is is that its twenty thousand dollars actually my my wife and i are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next       year and a half or so so were actually been looking around and thinking about things wed like to get like a   oh   oh i dont know what do you call it a dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that you know year old ninety two or something like that   umhum umhum sure   see if we can   those are yeah that thatd be a good deal to go with   and the other thing were looking at is the Saturns too because they looked really nice   okay umhum what do you what do you looking for in in those what attracts what attracts you to the Saturns or or or of course weve already talked you know the Taurus is safe but what what kind of things are you looking for   well the the Saturns you can get air bags in them i dont think you can get dual side air bags but one of the things the two things that im really   umhum     id say the most important thing is a car thats not gonna fall apart that doesnt have problems   umhum   you set down you look at consumer reports we been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the US auto   yeah   makers when you do that because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest US cars   umhum   and the other one is are the Saturns   umhum   so those two things and then you know we kind of want a four door   okay
