                    Background        Impaired pulmonary function is a strong predictor of        cardiovascular and allcause mortality in the general        population independent of smoking        The factors        that influence pulmonary function are not completely        understood and oxidant exposure could play a negative role              Support for this hypothesis comes from studies        that report a positive association between antioxidant        vitamin status and lung function        Several        studies have indicated that alcohol exposure may contribute        to oxidative burden and therefore it may be linked to        impaired pulmonary function through oxidantantioxidant        mechanisms        However while alcohol itself        can act as an oxidant wine has antioxidant properties                      An early report by Cohen et al    did not show an        effect of total alcohol intake on lung function but a        number of crosssectional studies subsequently have shown        high alcohol intake to be negatively associated with lung        function and positively related to the occurrence of        respiratory symptoms          However        several recent studies failed to show a negative        association of alcohol intake with lung function or        respiratory symptoms       Thus the evidence is        contradictory and oxidants or antioxidants associated with        different alcoholic beverages may be responsible for these        conflicting results        Only one study has        investigated the association between beverage specific        alcohol intake and pulmonary function In that study Cohen        et al    did not find beveragespecific effects on        pulmonary function However there is evidence that        alcoholic beverages could differ in their effects on lung        health due to differences in their constituents from a        study linking beverage specific alcohol intake to lung        cancer risk     In addition no study has investigated        lifetime alcohol intake and white and red wine intake        separately in relation to pulmonary function Therefore        the goal of this study was to describe the relation of        beverage specific alcohol intake with pulmonary function        FEV          and FVC in a general population        sample In order to investigate whether effects of recent        alcohol intake differ from long term effects we considered        both recent as well as lifetime beverage specific alcohol        intake in this analysis                    Materials and Methods                  Study population          In brief we utilized New York State Department of          Motor Vehicles and Health Care Finance Association lists          to randomly select participants aged  years Of the           initially contacted eligible subjects            female and  male participated  percent The          following exclusion criteria applied to the current          analysis race other than Caucasian or AfricanAmerican          n   missing information on diet n   missing          information on height weight smoking status laboratory          values or

missing          information on alcohol intake n   The remaining           participants  women and  men are included in          this report The excluded participants for whom          information was available were comparable to the included          participants in regards to gender and race We did not          find a statistically significant difference between          included and excluded participants for age height and          weight but as a result of the higher prevalence of          asthma and COPD excluded participants had lower values of          FEV            and FVC                          Interview and Examination          The examination included an inperson interview about          lifestyle habits a selfadministered questionnaire          anthropometric measurements and spirometry Between           and  am we obtained spirometric measurements from          participants standardized according to  American          Thoracic Society guidelines     To derive forced          expiratory volume in one second FEV             and forced vital capacity FVC          prediction equations we used multiple linear regression          with values obtained from lifelong nonsmokers who did not          report a history of chronic lung disease for men n            and women n   separately We chose the model          that explained the greatest fraction of variability R           in lung function          We obtained the following equations for men          predicted FEV      age years             height m   race          predicted FVC      age years             height m   race          and for women          predicted FEV      age years             height m    race          predicted FVC      age years            height m    race          with race as a dummy variable Caucasian            AfricanAmerican   We then calculated FEV            and FVC in percent of the predicted          value FEV             and FVC adjusted for age          gender height and race for all participants                              Alcohol intake          We obtained information about alcohol intake with a          computer assisted inperson interview              Interviewers underwent extensive training and          standardization Alcohol consumption was assessed for the          past  days and during participants lifetimes               We defined participants who reported consumption of          less than  drinks during their lifetime as lifetime          abstainers never drinkers and those who reported  or          more drinks during their lifetime but never consumed          alcoholic beverages in the past  days as former          drinkers noncurrent drinkers          We asked participants who drank during the past           days which of four major types of alcoholic beverages          beer wine wine cooler and hard liquor they had drunk          at least once Participants defined their usual drink          size in ounces for each beverage they drank using bottles          of various sizes and sample glasses with drink sizes          marked on the side to improve the accuracy of their          estimates Participants were then asked how often they          drank during the last  days and those who drank less          often than once a week were asked how many drinks they          usually had on a day when they drank alcohol Respondents          who drank once a week or more often were asked about          their pattern of drinking  how many Fridays in the past           days did they drink how many drinks did they usually          have on a Friday when they drank and what beverages          did they drink These questions were repeated for          Saturdays Sundays and weekdays We also asked          quantityfrequency questions for times participants drank          more than usual This data was used to estimate the          number of drinks consumed of each beverage over the past           days which was then multiplied by drink size to get          beveragespecific ounces of alcohol consumed We then          calculated beveragespecific grams of alcohol using the          following conversion factors    and           grams of alcohol per ounce for beer wine wine          cooler and hard liquor respectively          We used the Cognitive Lifetime Drinking History CLDH          to obtain information on lifetime alcohol intake                Prior to the interview participants completed a          lifetime events calendar on which they recorded the date          and their age when significant events in their lives          occurred This calendar was used during the interview to          help them remember what they were doing during different          periods of their lives and whether drinking alcohol was          involved Participants reported how old they were when          they started drinking alcohol regularly  at least once a          month for six months and when their drinking patterns          changed This information was used to define intervals          during their lives when drinking patterns were fairly          homogeneous For each interval participants were asked          questions on drinking pattern comparable to those asked          for the past  days and asked to estimate what          percentage of the drinks consumed during that interval          came from the specific beverages consumed during that          interval This information was used to estimate          beveragespecific grams of alcohol consumed in the          interval and these estimates were summed across          intervals to arrive at lifetime totals Total alcohol          intake was expressed in kg during participants          lifetimes          We have previously demonstrated construct validity of          the questionnaires In a study involving  subjects              we compared the average daily volume of alcohol          consumed during the  months prior to the interview          as estimated from the alcohol questionnaire with those          estimated from two different food frequency          questionnaires FFQ the Health Habits and History          Questionnaire and the Harvard Semiquantitative Food          Frequency Questionnaire FFQs have been shown to produce          valid estimates of alcohol intake with correlations of          about  In this study the CLDH compared favorably          to the FFQs with correlations between  and  and          therefore we can infer reasonable validity Because the          FFQs query intake over a one year period we did not          estimate  day intake in that study Furthermore the          repeatability of the CLDH over an average two week period          was excellent r   indicating that this          questionnaire performs well in measurement of short term          alcohol intake                          Statistical methods and analysis          We examined the distributions of the continuous          variables for all relevant variables to determine if they          were normally distributed and calculated mean values and          standard deviation SD We also performed descriptive          analyses separating drinkers by beverage types consumed          and compared drinkers of specific beverages but there          were only few participants who consumed one type of          alcoholic beverage exclusively For the analyses related          to alcohol intake we used recent intake last  days          and lifetime alcohol intake with ounces converted into          metric units To investigate the association between the          alcohol intake variables we calculated Pearsons          correlation coefficients For both total and white and          red wine separately we observed weak correlations r            with beer and liquor intake for recent and lifetime          total intake The correlation between red and white wine          intake were high for both recent r   and lifetime          r   intake However the correlations between          recent and lifetime alcohol intake were only weak to          moderate ranging from r   for liquor r   for          total alcohol r   for wine to r   for beer          intake These correlation coefficients did not differ          significantly between men and women          The principal analysis we used was multiple linear          regression analysis including all  subjects The          total and beverage specific alcohol intake variables were          not normally distributed and therefore we performed a          logarithmic transformation Transformation was based on          Ig alcohol intake  where alcohol intake resembles          current or lifetime beverage specific or total alcohol          intake respectively The dependent variables were FEV             and FVC and the independent          variables were the specific alcoholic beverage          Previously we found that weight eosinophil count          education smoking status and cumulative tobacco smoke          exposure in packyears of smoking predict FEV             with the largest variance          explained and therefore we included these variables in          the baseline model     Because eosinophil count was          not significantly correlated with FVC only total pack          years of smoking smoking status education and weight          were included in the baseline model predicting FVC In          addition we previously reported that several serum and          dietary antioxidant vitamins were correlated with          pulmonary function      Therefore we included          serum antioxidant vitamins in the regression models for          FEV             vitamin E vitamin C          luteinzeaxanthin cryptoxanthin and retinol and FVC          vitamin E vitamin C cryptoxanthin and          luteinzeaxanthin          To define statistical significance we used the          conventional level of p   However we determined          that interaction terms would be important if the level of          significance was p   We investigated interaction          by including interaction terms of beverage specific          alcohol intake smoking status never former current          gender and other covariates and stratification but we          did not observe statistically significant interactions          We also examined the regression models for          multicollinearity Significant collinearity was present          only for the analyses that included both white and red          wine intake For the analyses we utilized the Statistical          Package for Social Sciences and SPLUS                            Results                  Demographic characteristics spirometry and alcohol          intake          Table shows the characteristics of the study          participants included in this analysis Mean age was           years and based on mean body mass index participants          tended to be overweight The study population included          slightly more women than men approximately  percent          were former smokers and  percent were current          smokers There were few never drinkers of alcohol and the          majority of participants consumed several alcoholic          beverages presently For both recent daily alcohol intake          and lifetime alcohol consumption we observed the highest          intake for beer followed by liquor and wine On average          participants had consumed larger quantities of white wine          than red wine Mean alcohol intake from wine coolers was          low and therefore we did not further investigate this          beverage                          Demographic characteristics and spirometry by          recent beverage specific alcohol intake          Table shows the characteristics of participants by          recent beverage specific alcohol intake Beer only          drinkers were younger than other participants but those          in the liquor only group had a higher BMI than those in          the other groups The beer only group included          predominantly men while the groups of wine only liquor          only and recent abstainers included more women than men          The education level was highest in the groups with only          wine intake and with mixed drinking pattern Cumulative          tobacco smoke exposure was highest in the beer drinker          group and lowest among wine drinkers Recent average          alcohol intake was highest among those with a mixed          drinking pattern and lowest in the wine only group          Nutritional status indicators showed that wine drinkers          had the highest levels of serum antioxidant vitamins          Both mean FEV             and FVC corrected for age          weight and gender were highest among participants who          consumed various alcoholic beverages or wine only                          Regression analysis of recent alcohol intake on FEV           and FVC          Table summarizes the results of multiple linear          regression analysis for recent total alcohol and beverage          specific alcohol intake after inclusion of all covariates          in the baseline model Multiple linear regression of FEV             revealed independent associations          with alcohol intake from wine for both FEV             and FVC when variables were          entered separately The association attained statistical          significance only for white wine when we entered red and          white wine intake variables simultaneously Even after          inclusion of other beverage specific alcohol variables          alcohol intake from wine was at least borderline          significantly related to FEV             and FVC Alcohol intake from beer          and liquor showed little or no association with lung          function                          Regression analysis of lifetime alcohol intake on          FEV  and FVC          Next we explored the association between lifetime          beverage specific alcohol intake and lung function Table          shows the results of multiple linear regression analysis          for lifetime total and beverage specific alcohol intake          after adjustment for other covariates Cumulative alcohol          intake from both red wine and white wine was          significantly and positively related to both FEV             and FVC when these variables were          considered separately Similar to the results for recent          alcohol intake the association was stronger for white          wine compared with red wine Total alcohol intake and          alcohol intake from beer and liquor were not correlated          with pulmonary function Alcohol intake from wine was          significantly associated with lung function even after          inclusion of alcohol intake from beer and liquor The          association of alcohol intake from white wine persisted          even after inclusion of other alcohol variables in the          regression model but red wine was not significantly          related to lung function data not shown There was no          statistically significant association between lifetime          wine intake and lung function after we included recent          alcohol intake from wine in the regression models                          Other models examined          We did not observe a statistically significant          interaction between smoking status and alcohol intake          Because of the possibility that alcohol intake was          particularly harmful in those with heavy alcohol          consumption a subgroup of the population that consumed          predominantly large quantities of beer and liquor and          because an association between light drinking and lung          function could be influenced by heavy drinking we          investigated whether the correlation between lifetime          beverage specific alcohol intake and lung function were          similar in the group with lower alcohol intake For this          analysis we included participants below the median of          total alcohol intake In this subgroup of the study          population mean lifetime intake was  kg for total          alcohol  kg for alcohol from white wine  kg for          red wine  kg for beer and  kg for liquor Using          multiple linear regression analysis with adjustment for          the known covariates alcohol intake from white wine          remained the strongest correlate of FEV             and FVC data not shown The          regression coefficients  confidence intervals CI on          FEV             for wine intake were              in those below the median and              for those above the median          When we performed regression analysis separately by          type of recent alcohol intake there was a trend that          among those drinking various beverages recently wine          intake was positively associated with lung function The          regression coefficient on FEV             for wine intake was   CI             For comparison it was   CI             in those who drank only wine  of          those drinking various beverages did not drink wine                            Discussion        In this crosssectional populationbased study we        observed that both recent and lifetime alcohol intake from        wine showed a positive association with pulmonary function        but total alcohol intake was not significantly associated        with lung function The association between lung function        and white wine was slightly stronger than that for red wine        but these two variables were highly correlated and residual        confounding by healthy lifestyle factors might explain the        difference        We did not detect a significant association between lung        function and total alcohol intake Some but not all        previous studies have shown a negative association of        alcohol intake with pulmonary function                   Taken all studies together total alcohol intake        might not be strongly associated with pulmonary function        but the underlying reason for the conflicting evidence may        at least in part be related to the failure of studying        beverage specific alcohol in most of these studies Our        study supports this latter hypothesis The results suggest        that among all considered alcoholic beverages alcohol        intake from wine both recent and lifetime intake has the        strongest relation to FEV          and FVC Alcohol from beer and liquor        is not significantly related to pulmonary function        Evidence suggests that alcohol may increase oxidative        burden        However while alcohol could        potentially act as an oxidant there is a large body of        evidence that wine has antioxidant properties               Our data indicate that these antioxidant properties        might exist and could have positive influence on lung        function To our knowledge only one other study has        investigated the effects of beverage specific alcohol        intake on pulmonary function Cohen et al failed to find a        protective effect of wine intake on pulmonary function            These authors classified participants into categories        of light moderate and heavy drinkers based on the amount        drinks per occasion and frequency rarely occasionally        weekly and daily of consumption of alcoholic beverages        Thus due to the use of a categorical variable Cohen et al        had less power to detect an association     In        addition the authors analyzed pulmonary function as the        ratio of FEV          FVC only and consequently focused        on an indicator of airway obstruction Therefore the        results are not directly comparable to those of our        study        FEV          and FVC are highly correlated in        populations without significant degree of airway        obstruction Thus results of the analysis between        antioxidants and FEV          or FVC will be similar unless in a        population free of reported lung disease very strong        effects on airway narrowing or airflow limitation are        present This study shows that both FEV          and FVC are associated with wine        intake and this leaves us with little evidence for a strong        effect of alcohol intake on airway narrowing        We found that both recent and lifetime alcohol intake        from wine was positively associated with lung function        This finding is important because the correlation between        the recent and lifetime alcohol intake was not strong It        could also indicate that the effects are not related to        recent intake of antioxidants from wine only but that        longterm intake may exert positive effects on lung        function In general we did not find independent        additional effects of lifetime alcohol consumption after we        included current alcohol intake Thus the results indicate        no independent effect of lifetime alcohol intake beyond        current intake        Our analysis also suggests that wine intake may be        associated with other healthy lifestyle characteristics        table  Participants who drank only wine tended to be        lighter more educated smoke less and appeared to have a        healthier diet However our findings persisted even after        adjusting for known covariates related to pulmonary        function ie smoking weight micronutrients and        socioeconomic status Nevertheless although we adjusted        for several lifestyle variables in our regression analysis        the association of wine intake with pulmonary function may        be due to residual confounding by healthy lifestyle as        reported previously               If our findings are real the observation that the        association with wine intake was slightly stronger for        white wine than for red wine is surprising because it has        been suggested that red wine has greater health benefits        than white wine and this may be due to greater antioxidant        capacity     Other research has indicated that both        white and red wine have beneficial health effects and        similar antioxidant properties     The total        antioxidant capacity of wine and the relative antioxidant        properties of white and red wine vary depending on the        assays used and no consensus has been reached There is        strong evidence that the antioxidant properties of wine        are at least in part due to activity of different        flavonoids and other compounds     In addition white        wine contains several phenols with antioxidant activity                    Alternatively it is conceivable that the stronger        association of white wine with pulmonary function compared        with red wine may also be due to confounding by other        healthy lifestyle factors Approximately  of the        participants reported both red and white wine intake during        their lifetime Compared with those who drank red wine but        not white wine total pack years of smoke exposure was        higher in participants who reported white and red wine        intake together  versus  pack years p          and thus residual confounding by smoking andor other        lifestyle factors could again explain our findings Because        of the limited sample size in the subgroups of wine        drinkers we were unable to provide strong data in groups        who only consumed either red or white wine        Our results did not change significantly when we        restricted the analysis to participants below the median of        total alcohol consumption In this restricted sample mean        alcohol intake from specific beverages differed little and        alcohol intake from wine remained the strongest correlate        of lung function even after adjustment for other beverage        specific alcohol intake This finding indicates that if        those with the heaviest alcohol intake were excluded the        pattern of association between beverage specific alcohol        intake and lung function was similar and could support a        true positive effect of wine on lung health        Because cigarette smoke is a major source of oxidants we        would expect a stronger association of wine intake with        pulmonary function in smokers if wine has antioxidant        capacity that prevents smoking induced oxidative damage We        failed to observe a statistically significant interaction        of beverage specific alcohol intake with smoking However        we should interpret this finding with caution because of        the limited sample size of current smokers        Our study has several limitations First the        crosssectional design and following from this design the        uncertainty about the causeeffect relation represent a        weakness of our study However we obtained a lifetime        drinking alcohol history using an instrument with good        testretest reliability     an approach that has not        previously been used A second limitation is the limited        power to perform more definite subgroup analysis by smoking        status or in groups who consumed a single beverage type        only A third limitation is the moderate participation rate        and as a consequence the restricted generalization of the        results to the general public        The strength of this study is the detailed evaluation of        information on covariates including smoking and dietary        habits that have shown a relation to lung function        However we cannot definitely exclude residual confounding        of health lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking Wine        drinkers and in particular white wine drinkers may differ        from the rest of the population in other lifestyle factors        that we did not include in this analysis Drinking        patterns such as alcohol consumption with or without food        could also play a role Since there is no information on        the relation of white and red wine intake with lung        function and few studies have analyzed beverage specific        alcohol intake in relation to lung function this study is        important in that it suggests the importance of beverage        type in assessing the relation of alcohol to pulmonary        outcomes                    Conclusions        In conclusion we found a positive association of recent        and lifetime wine intake with lung function Contrary to        the expectations based on the findings from in vitro        studies showing that red wine has higher antioxidant        potentials we found that white wine was the only wine type        significantly associated with lung function Wine drinking        in general was associated with healthier characteristics        and better life style habits Our findings appear        independent of the potential confounding effect of numerous        and well measured factors ie smoking weight        socioeconomic status dietary antioxidant intake however        we cannot exclude the potential of residual confounding        Other unmeasured factors or errors in measurements in the        factors included in the analyses could be responsible for        the observed associations In particular we have to note        that among the different types of wine consumption of        white wine was associated with healthier characteristics        and better life style profile than consumption of red wine        In the absence of a biological plausibility for this        differential effect of red and white wine on lung function        we are concerned about the potential spurious nature of the        observed associations However flavonoids and phenols are        antioxidants found in wine products that have been        implicated to play a role in lung healthfunction and may        explain the observed associations Further studies with        detailed information on potential confounders and in social        and ethnic settings were the correlates of drinking habits        may differ from those reported here are needed to confirm        our results and help clarify whether there is a        relationship between the use of specific alcoholic        beverages and lung health                    Abbreviations        CI Confidence Interval        CLDH Cognitive lifetime
