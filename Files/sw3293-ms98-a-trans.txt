        okay well uh what what do you all do for camping     well we dont do so much now but when uh i i was uh a child we went regular old camping tents and and everything like that and then with our children we did uh we had a popup tent camper   uhhuh umhum   and we used that to go camping   where do you go   we uh years ago we lived in Oklahoma and we went to uh Lake Ardmore i mean Lake Murray all the time but when we did it with our children we lived in uh Tennessee and we went up into the Smokeys   oh uhhuh oh   which was just absolutely fantastic   oh i bet it was around Gatlinburg or somewhere out in there   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh and along the uh   ooh   theres a ridge that goes down from Tennessee through uh Georgia and into Alabama and uh i think it was called the   umhum   uh White Cloud or White Mountain and went up on it   well now did you all sleep in sleeping bags and did it get real cold at night or   it got real cold but the uh camper had uh       beds in it you know when we had that one and uh so we just you know we had our bedding we didnt have to go with sleeping bags but the  when i was a   oh yeah   uh teenager and growing up that was sleeping bags and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or you know ground and uh that got kind of rough sometimes   uhhuh uhhuh well we only did that once now since weve been married we just go um we go real often to Colorado to the mountains but well stay in cabins   oh do you oh uhhuh   and you know we call it going camping but were really not  but the one time that i did go camping when i was about i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family we drove to uh up by Cosa Cosa Springs Colorado and went about seventeen miles back in the back where you couldnt even get a forest ranger if you tried and to the the tent for a week   oh uhhuh oh   and at night it was so cold you thought youd never feel your feet again and the smell and the stars were just five feet above you you know they were just right there and it was the most     oh just beautiful   bonding most wonderful time we enjoyed it but about the fourth day i thought if i dont get a hot tub and shave my legs im gonna die  and i had   yes  yes i understand that   i i i got enough of it right then so when we can go to a cabin as long as weve got running water  im a little bit better off   but yeah my husband and i he he says his idea now of roughing it is the Regency Hyatt and i i agree with him our children are are grown but i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the TV   i understand i agree with him too well thats true umhum   and the phone and we got just strictly by ourselves we uh some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us and you know and we could you know get back in touch with each other   uhhuh well that thats  and they cant believe that they could survive it and then once theyre there they they think its kind of cool   oh i know i know oh they just you know they just thoroughly enjoy it you know or enjoyed it   yeah yeah and we hiked we would hike all day and  mom did the whole uh pork and beans and you know the slice slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all of the little stuff that we just were so amazed she knew how to do you know couldnt believe   umhum yes yes yes like i know that you know breakfast we would you know wed have these big breakfast cooked over this little Coleman stove and   oh yeah with bacon oh yeah   yes and would just absolutely taste wonderful   and and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast so we usually had a bite apiece  one one   yes  or one yes yes but i know that we you know as a teenager growing up and going to Lake Murray there would be oh maybe twenty twenty five of us because it would be all of my mothers family you know and all my cousins and it   oh my goodness well now is that hot camping is that where youre youre hot like on a beach i mean is that   oh no no we were in the we were in the woods you know   because a lot of our friends will well a lot of our friends in east Texas will go to east Texas in the summer and camp and im thinking how could you stand it you know just   well we didnt notice it back then but that was back before airconditioning was so prevalent you know prevalent and all   yeah yeah yeah thats true we did a lot   and uh you know and it it always rained on us i dont care what weekend we went and when it was it always rained on us     but i like that and see especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain and youd get your book and just kind of cuddle up and i thought that was fun   uhhuh uhhuh cuddle up umhum well i dont know i remember one time uh some cousins were in a tent and it was married cousins and they they had the tent and this you know  frog strangler that we used to call him came through and       they were had put their tent over kind of i dont know what it wasnt a creek bed it was like kind of like a little little uh gully or trench or something and the water rushed down and they said they looked down and there went Buds boots you know there went several things floating down this water you know we just used to have balls you know   uhhuh oh no oh no golly   it was it was more fun you know and as i said it just rained every time and then my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller and we went up there but it was never quite the same thing you know     well yeah well i yeah i understand that too because some of the places we in fact the the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit it loses its flavor   yes yes it does it really does um   so  well ive ive gotten in the mood to go now  yeah   yes yeah even i would kind of like to go and i know if i go home and say oh lets go camping my husband says youre crazy  i enjoyed talking to you too thank you byebye   i youre crazy  well listen i enjoyed talking with you okay have a good day byebye
