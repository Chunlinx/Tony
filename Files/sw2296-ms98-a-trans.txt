              well do you exercise regularly Judy   um i try to ride the stationary bicycle everyday about five miles   umhum   and i love to walk so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and and walk what about you   well um i uh exercise regularly i work at a university and i swim almost everyday   uh very good   upwards of a mile but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit uh my daughter lives in Arlington and when i go to visit her  i love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike oh gosh you can ride a bike  practically all the way to southern Virginia   umhum   or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i dont do that regularly but Washingtons a great place to do that   uhhuh yeah there are there are lots of bike paths i know my son is a biker and he hes done the whole C and O canal i think its a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts   umhum   and so uh but that that somehow takes organization for me its much easier just the stationary bike you know its at home i can i can do some of my reading     right   um but   do you live in the District   no i live in Maryland   uhhuh because i think therere so many parts of the District where its not very safe to get out and walk   right right and thats it um at work we have a a nice campus so im able to um take advantage of of the environment here um   umhum   the neighborhood also i mean were  within walking distance of of stores and shops so i do now i think um basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it   well its uh its really both im certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape and uh and most of the time i enjoy it sometimes i dont but i feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i dont wanna is also worth something   umhum right i think pretty much youve summed up my my my motivations also   and i often find that even when i dont feel that much like exercising like ill be really tired and ill start swimming and ill actually and ill actually get energy and ill be have much more energy when im done than when i started i mean i just feel great that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim   oh well thats great thats great   thats really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure God im ready for bed   umhum   and you exercise and then its sort of its painful for a while but by the time you get done youre feeling really terrific   right  and actually in in summer i like to swim we dont have facilities for swimming in winter but um and and thats true when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool im much much more awake im ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening   yeah yeah   so   so are can i just ask you are you Canadian   no im not   Philadelphia   no   im trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel thats probably gonna drive the TI people crazy you say out instead of out you say out   oh really    no i dont know that but i i must say that um   did you know that   when when i did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent   hm   and its probably because i i was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California and at and at that point that was sort of a limit but but since then ive been abroad a lot so   hm i see   its a mixture   i know this isnt on our topic but where did you grow up in California   in Santa Barbara   oh okay because i grew up in North Hollywood California i went to UCLA and all that   oh i see umhum well very good and i think weve probably know know each others exercise habits and um it was nice talking to you   yes well same here thanks for calling bye   oh okay bye bye
