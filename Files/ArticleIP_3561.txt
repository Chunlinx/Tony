police to complain about hisplaying a radio too loudly He owns a radio he just never plays it he saysOnce he dropped a weight while exercising and the neighbor called the policeto complain about the excessive noise The police were nonplussed and said theneighbors were overly fussy but the complaints and the police visitscontinue                                       My bewildered associatedrafted a longish letter of apology for giving the neighbors offense I offeredto write a more appropriate letter for him He accepted my offer and willdeliver the letter at the earliest convenient moment But first Id like youropinion of my note I had him declare in the note that he was really perplexedabout why he was being singled out for complaint Was it not possible that thewhite neighbors didnt like him for things he has no control over beingblack If that should be the case perhaps counseling by a state agency mightbe appropriate and he would be willing to participate                                       This is everything Iknow I wouldnt have stuck my neck out on this but my coworker is really anice guy I couldnt bear to see him apologizing for things that neverhappened Hes always cheerful never swears dresses neatly works quietly Idont know what your office is like but the rest of us cannot be describedthat way                                       I amnot a social agitator but I am in favor of justice Did I do the right thingsuggesting he play the race card                                       Helpfully Hopeful orHopefully Helpful                        DearHelp            It is good of you to helpyour friend and coworker It is Prudies guess however that bigots will notvoluntarily go into counseling with a state agency            The introduction of what youcall the race card is appropriate seeing that the deck is obviously stackedbecause of your friends color It is always a last resort to play hardballbut in this case a call to the AntiDefamation League or the American CivilLiberties Union might be helpful            Prudiesoffice by the way is populated by cheerful people who are neatly dressed anddo indeed work quietly As for never swearing Prudie takes the Fifth            Prudie combatively                                             DearPrudie                                                      I too am sick of all thecontroversial opinions and hype regarding Viagra but I must challenge your commentsand those of all the others out there voicing concern that it is becoming arecreational drug creating ersatz libido etc                                       I am a yearold malewho for the past several years had a very mediocre sex life I was the guy inthe joke Call him oatmeal Three minutes and hes done I was also in denialuntil five times in two weeks my wife suggested I try Viagra Ive been on itfor three weeks and my wife and I are both much happier She has since confidedthat sex was the one part of our relationship she was not happy with                                       Prudiethe unfortunate misconception that everyone is hyperventilating about is thatthis drug does something other than help those that need it Its not anaphrodisiac its not going to turn wannabes into young studs The only peopleits going to do anything for are those with erectile dysfunction Besidesthose looking for a recreational sexual drug arent going to go to a doctor andclaim they cant get it up their egos wouldnt let them If they do obtain iton the black market they are going to find that it doesnt do anything for themthey cant already do without it It only helps those who need it To quoteElizabeth Dole Its a great drug                                       Sign me No ErsatzLibido Just No Longer Frustrated                        Dear No            Prudie wrote in the column towhich you refer People of good will cannot begrudge those in genuine needPrudie is a person of good will and you apparently were in genuine needWhile Prudie is sincerely happy for you and the missis your breakfast cerealreference suggests another difficulty altogether but well leave that alonefor now Alas you are mistaken about men and women not trying to useViagra to achieve a little extra oomph Prudie herself knows two women who havegot their hands on it and a close friend whos a physician reports that allkinds of men without impotence problems are requesting prescriptions Youmisgauge the number of men who are not thinking with their egos            And wasntthat an unfortunate remark by Elizabeth Dole It seemed like bragging onceremoved dont you think            Prudie steadfastly                                             DearPrudie                                                      Since it is stated thatPrudie responds to questions about manners personal relations politics andother subjects heres one about politicssort of                                       I readthat Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has gone on record saying thathomosexuality is not only a sin but just another problem like alcoholism sexaddiction and kleptomania He addedI guess to prove his goodness bonafidesthat hes never cheated on his wife What do you think of allthis                                       WonderingPhiladelphia                        DearWon            Prudie thinks Sen Lottbelongs in the Ignorance and Bigotry Wing of the Betty Ford Clinic The senatoris of course entitled to apply his own interpretation of the Bible to hispersonal life But when it comes to dictating to others it always amazes mewhen peopleparticularly politicians and preacherssubstitute their owninterpretation of the Bible for medical and psychiatric findings            WheneverPrudie hears rigid unsound and ungenerous dictums for some reason sheautomatically thinks of Jimmy Swaggart            Prudierighteously
