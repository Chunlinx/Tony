                                 Clinton and Communion            On March  the RevMohlomi Makobane a Catholic priest in Soweto South Africa gave HolyCommunion to the president of the United States a Jesuiteducated SouthernBaptist who worships at his wifes Methodist church in Washington DC            Thepolicy of the Roman Catholic Church is that except in extreme circumstancesonly Catholics and sometimes Eastern Orthodox Christians are invited toconsume the consecrated bread and wine at a Catholic Mass Makobane wascriticized for his action as was Bill Clinton who was judged to havecharacteristically grabbed something to which he was not entitled CardinalJohn OConnor of New York used his Palm Sunday sermon to declare the episodelegally and doctrinally wrong and added this grace note Some undoubtedlybelieve that if one has enough prestige or money anything goes            Clinton isnt the first Protestant politicianto have been warned he would never eat Communion in this church again Severalyears ago Clintons  rival Sen Bob Kerrey DNeb a Congregationaliststopped taking Communion at a Catholic church after the Catholicsonly policywas called to his attention And the presidents British soul mate PrimeMinister Tony Blair an Anglican was reported by British papers to havecomplied with a request that he no longer receive Communion at his wifesCatholic parish The Catholic Churchs scruples about intercommunion cut bothways The Republic of Irelands President Mary McAleese a Catholic waslectured by the hierarchy after she took Communion at an Anglican cathedral inDublin            Ageneration ago a Protestant president of the United States who took Communionat a Catholic ceremony would have had to worry about censure not from Catholicsbut from coreligionists appalled at the spectacle of a BiblebelievingProtestant participating in the popish superstition of the Mass Its ameasure of the selfconfidence of the American Catholic hierarchy that the flakin the Clinton flap came from the other direction            Did Clinton and Makobane pull a fast one Notreally Their supposed transgression is a common occurrence at AmericanCatholic churches and the logical outcome of the ecumenical movement energizedby the Roman Catholic Church itself            Returning to my childhood Catholic parish for Easter Mass a couple of yearsago I was struck by the thought that the service a term never applied toCatholic worship in my altar boy days in the early s would havescandalized past pastors Not only was the Mass in English celebrated by apriest facing the congregation but at Communion time the sacrament wasdistributed in both species wine as well as bread by ministers of bothsexesthough some older parishioners after receiving the consecrated waferfrom priestly hands avoided the female eucharistic minister a laywomanoffering the chalice            Conservative Catholics call thisProtestantizing the Mass But ecumenical crosspollination has led to atleast as significant a Catholicization of Protestant worship Onceinfrequently celebrated in many Episcopal and Lutheran churches Holy Communionis increasingly the principal act of worship on Sunday EpiscopaliansLutherans and some Methodists have rediscovered rituals ornaments andclerical vestments the rags of popery of Protestant polemic discardedduring the Reformation The result is a consensus Communion ceremony that mightbe called Catholic lite            Yesdifferences in interpretation remain and after the Clinton Communioncommentators ritualistically recited the theological boilerplate I learned inparochial school Catholics regard the Eucharist as a sacrifice while forProtestants it is a mere memorial Writing in the Washington Times Robert Alt contrasted the Roman Catholic belief in transubstantiation wherebythe bread and wine while maintaining their ordinary physical qualities aresubstantively transformed in the Eucharist into the body blood soul anddivinity of Jesus Christ with consubstantiation the Methodist and Lutheranteaching that the bread and wine and Christs presence existsimultaneously            The nature of the Eucharist was a definingissue in the Reformation Two issues loomed large the nature of Christspresence in the bread and wine of Communion and whether the Eucharist was asacrifice offered for the forgiveness of sins Reformers objected to the latteras a derogation of Jesus Christs redemptive death on the cross and atheological close cousin to the selling of indulgences But these oncebrightlines have become blurred            Fourcenturies later partly due to new scholarship about the Jewish roots of thesacrament a panel of Anglican and Catholic theologians released an AgreedStatement on Eucharistic Doctrine This  document affirmed the truepresence of Christ in the Eucharist effectually signified by the bread andwine which in this mystery become his body and blood As for the TwordThe word transubstantiation is commonly used in the Roman Catholic Church toindicate that God acting in the Eucharist effects a change in the inner realityof the elements It should be seen as affirming the fact of Christspresence but not as explaining how the change takes place Despite thisfudge the new Catechism of the Catholic Church retains the term            As for the divisive issue of whether the Massis a sacrifice for the remission of sins the statement affirms that Christsdeath upon the cross  was the one perfect and sufficient sacrifice for thesins of the world However the Eucharist is a memorial Greek anamnesis inwhich the atoning work of Christ on the cross is proclaimed and made effectivein the life of the church            This anda similar ecumenical agreement with Lutherans have not been embraced asauthoritative by the Vatican Nevertheless they have affected not onlyCatholic academic theology but also popular teaching and practice These daysthe Eucharist is likelier to be described as a meal albeit one graced by thesaving presence of Christ than as a propitiatory sacrifice            Many Protestants have no doubt that Jesus isreally present in the Communion distributed at Catholic Masses And they rejectthe notion that they are ineligible to partake of a gift that ultimately comesfrom God not from the pope or OConnor Anglicans are particularly aggrievedby the noProtestants policy Preaching recently in Luxembourgs Catholiccathedral the Most Rev George Carey the archbishop of Canterbury noted thatit hurts to be denied the Lords Supper by a fellow disciple of Jesus ChristCarey urged the Roman Catholic Church to adopt the openrail policy followed byAnglican churches            Thanks to Vatican II andone of its littlenoted consequences an ebbing of American antiCatholicismCatholics unselfconsciously socialize with other Christians and attend theirchristenings weddings and funerals On the same Palm Sunday that saw OConnorchastising Makobane for sharing Communion with Clinton I wandered into StJohns Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square opposite the White House This isthe historic Church of the Presidents though Bill Clinton was not inattendance that day I was edified by the hospitality extended to tourists atCommunion time Inviting nonEpiscopalian Christians to partake the priestexplained This is Gods altar this isnt the Episcopal Churchs altar IfCommunion is a meal it is rude not to reciprocate
