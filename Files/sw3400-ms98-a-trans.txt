                all right uhhuh   okay what uh what was your name   Patricia and yours is Charley right yeah   Patricia okay Charley yeah   well i i listen to the radio whenever i can i watch TV TV news at night but im really a big reader so i read that paper from front to back but i dont think either of the papers i get here in the Metroplex are that great   oh yeah uhhuh   especially the Star Telegram i get that one its its not the highest  quality i dont think and i get the Dallas Morning News and its kind of fading no not the Morning News i get the Times Herald what do you get   yeah um i read the um Dallas Morning News we weve moved here about six month or no eight months ago   i think oh whered you move from   North Carolina   oh   and so i tried the Times Herald first and then i tried the tried them both and i ended up back with the Dallas Morning News   yeah i think its the better of the papers   yeah i dont i dont and i pretty well read it uh i kind of i mean i go through the whole paper i dont read every   uhhuh   Karen would you not roll around here please run on run on from out here       uh i dont uh i i pretty well look at it all the way through every day and then i listen to i listen on i have a forty five minute drive so i listen to the news on National Public Radio   yeah i do too oh yeah i love that i think thats so good once youve listen to that you cant believe the regular radio news   yeah yeah and they have a lot of um early breaking stories before before anyone else does so i kind of like that   huh it uhhuh yeah i like i like that too   yeah and i guess uh im getting used to the Dallas Morning News i didnt like it as much as the paper that from where we moved but uh   oh i dont think any of our papers in the area are great papers you might have had a really excellent one   yeah   but you know you have to get a local paper or you wont know whats going on thats why i get the Fort Worth one which i didnt do for years before we moved over here but   yeah   its the only way i could find out what was going on in my own city of Arlington so i had to subscribe to it finally   yeah we used to live in Fort Worth and we got that paper that was like a number of years ago and i liked it i of course uh that was probably fifteen years ago   oh really oh yeah well the editorial page is pretty good of course they you know its all things they get from other places   yeah   but uh im not really thrilled with with the paper   do you listen to National do you listen you say listen to National Public Radio   yeah i listen to that quite a bit when i can   yeah i listen to it i guess uh well every day on the way in and every day on the way home   yeah you really get a whole story you know the news on television is probably i think the worst source   yeah   because its like eight minutes of top news out of the whole half hour by the time you take all those you know the ads and the sports and the features and the the cute little talk you know   uhhuh yeah i dont know i guess um i used to watch TV news but i dont hardly ever watch it any more uh   uh ill catch the ten oclock sometimes or if theres a story that im really interested in ill ill try to   yeah ill turn it on if theres a how about Nightline do you ever watch any programs like that   oh i love Nightline yeah i like that   yeah i like that too but its its hard sometimes to stay up for me that late   yeah it really is if you have to do something early where do you work do you work at TI No you dont work at TI do you   no i work for a mechanical contractor um   where where where do you have to drive to   uh Farmers Branch from Plano so takes about forty five minutes   oh yeah you go against all that traffic i guess on LBJ or something   yeah well no i go kind of a back way but it still it takes forty five or fifty minutes   oh yeah well my husband drives from here in Arlington to TI on Central  well yeah he listens to a lot of news  but   yeah well thats a good drive yeah well do you read any uh do you do read any magazines or anything like that   yeah um well just Time as far as news i mean we get a lot of magazines but that thats the only news one that i get   yeah yeah do you read it pretty regular   oh yeah oh uh well i didnt like it this week it was just all about California and i dont dont care that much about  uh did you get it this week   no i dont we dont take we dont take many magazines occasionally ill ill see one somewhere and look at it but um i dont uh seems like it takes too much time or something   the whole issues is oh uhhuh well thats true no we do get Time and um i i read it pretty well you know i especially read the political news uh um i like to keep up with that but um   um uhhuh   like you said i think the best source of all is the Public Radio  and Nightline well Nightlines great especially when something exciting is going on you know   yeah uhhuh   then i then ill really make a point well you know it used to come on at ten thirty which was better but then they put that silly Entertainment Tonight   yeah so it comes on at eleven now yeah so im still used to North Carolina time it was um oh it was eleven up there i think   right oh was it   yeah but thats still thats awful late   yeah i know i wish it would come on earlier but obviously the sitcoms make more money or they you know or they wouldnt have it on at eleven  but uh   uhhuh   uh well i guess weve exhausted that subject  well who do you thinks going to run for President next year since youre up on all your news         guess weve got Bush again but   yeah uh i dont know whos going to run on the Democrat side um   right   uh   Patrick Buchanan supposedly was thinking of running against Bush or he just announced today   is that right   i dont know if hes announced or hes thinking about it but it was on the news   huh well thats kind of a futile effort probably wouldnt wouldnt you think yeah   well i would think but it uh it might scare Bush a little
