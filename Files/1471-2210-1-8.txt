                    Background        The mitogenactivated protein kinase MAPK family        consists of three commonly recognized subgroups the        extracellular signalregulated kinase ERK the        cjunNterminal kinase JNK also known as the stress        activated protein kinase SAPK and the p kinase While        many actions have been associated with activation of the        ERK pathway two particular functions of interest to our        laboratory are mitogenstimulated growth    and smooth        muscle cell contraction     Of the three MAPK pathways        activation of the ERK pathway and the intracellular        signaling pathways associated with ERK activation are the        best delineated Known activators include reactive oxygen        species      growth factors     and agonists of        Gprotein coupled receptors      The two other MAPK        pathways the JNK and p pathways have been implicated in        a variety of similar cellular functions Known activators        of the JNK and p pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells        include reactive oxygen species      mechanical strain             hypoxia    and a variety of cytokines and        growth factors The mechanisms of many cellular functions        of the JNK and p pathways are not yet clearly defined        The JNK pathway is involved in apoptosis     arginine        vasopressininduced increases in smooth muscle actin in        vascular smooth muscle cells    as well as in        phosphorylation of transcription factors cjun ATF and        ELK and phosphorylation of NaKCI cotransporter            The p pathway has been implicated in apoptosis            neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury    as well        as angiotensin llinduced contraction in vascular smooth        muscle            Recently it has been noted that the JNK and p        pathways can be activated by Gprotein coupled receptor        agonists notably angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle        cells      In cardiac myocytes both the p and JNK        pathways have been activated by endothelin ET and the                  adrenergic receptor agonist        phenylephrine     The ability of the JNK and p        pathways to be activated by the same agonists of Gprotein        coupled receptors which activate the ERK pathway led to the        investigation of HT as a possible activator of the JNK        and p pathways HT acting         via the HT         A receptor is a known activator of the        ERK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells      In        these studies we tested the hypothesis that HT would        activate the JNK and p pathways in rat aortic vascular        smooth muscle cells                    Results                  The ERK pathway          In agreement with previously published studies from          our lab HT caused a concentrationdependent activation          of the ERK pathway figure  This activation occurs          maximally at five minutes of stimulation and returns to          basal levels by thirty minutes     This time course          of activation is consistent with that of other Gprotein          coupled receptors                          The p pathway          The p pathway has demonstrated a different time          course of activation           via G protein coupled receptors          than the ERK pathway     Using the time point           min at which angiotensin II demonstrates maximal          stimulation of the JNK pathway we performed a          concentration response curve    M to HT in          vascular smooth muscle cells Western analysis using          phosphospecific antibodies was used to measure activation          the p pathway A total or nonphosphospecific antibody          was used to ensure equal loading of p protein After          thirtyminutes of incubation with HT    M          there was no enhanced phosphorylation of p figure           bottom In contrast incubation with anisomycin           ngml induced significant phosphorylation of p fold          above basal These data suggest that HT does not          activate the p pathway in rat vascular smooth muscle          cells despite the ability of other agonists to activate          the pathway in these cells                          The JNK pathway          Figure shows that thirty minutes of incubation with          HT    M resulted in a trend towards a modest          increase in phosphorylation of the p JNK isoform This          trend however was not statistically significant In          contrast anisomycin  ngml induced significant          phosphorylation of the p JNK isoform  fold above          basal Both the p and p bands were analyzed by          densitometry data for p not shown However          incubation with HT did not produce statistically          significant activation in either band when compared to          vehicle These data suggest that HT does not          substantially activate the JNK pathway in vascular smooth          muscle cells However the data obtained with anisomycin          provides evidence that this pathway can be activated in          these cells          To confirm that thirty minutes was an optimal time          point for observing HTinduced phosphorylation of JNK          we next performed a time course of JNK phosphorylation          after exposure to HT in rat vascular smooth muscle          cells At no time point  min  min  min and           min did HT  M enhance JNK phosphorylation above          basal levels figure  These data fail to support a          role for HTinduced activation of the JNK pathway in          vascular smooth muscle cells          To demonstrate that a Gprotein coupled receptor          agonist could activate the JNK pathway in our vascular          smooth muscle cells we incubated the cells with          angiotensin II    M for thirty minutes          Angiotensin II    M produced a significant          increase in the level of JNK phosphorylation figure           The authors speculate that the differences in the level          of phosphorylation of the p JNK isoform in the vehicle          treatment group maybe due to differences in the JNK          expression over time in cultured cells The cells used in          these experiments were of a later passage than those used          for the HT incubation studies These data in addition          to that obtained with anisomycin demonstrate that in          these vascular smooth muscle cells the JNK pathway can be          activated          Due to the trend toward increased phosphorylation of          both the p and p JNK isoforms by HT we next          performed JNK activity assays to determine whether HT          had any significant effect on kinase activity This assay          was chosen to ensure that the western analyses used were          sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in the          activation of the JNK pathway There was no significant          difference in the levels of activity at any concentration          of HT    M after thirty minutes of          incubation in vascular smooth muscle cells figure  In          contrast anisomycin  ngml  min produced a          significant increase in JNK activation approximately          fold above basal These data in combination with the          above findings do not support a role for HT in the          activation of the JNK pathway in vascular smooth muscle          cells                            Conclusions        HT is an activator of the ERK pathway in vascular        smooth muscle cells In contrast HT appears to be unable        to activate the JNK and p pathways in vascular smooth        muscle cells No observable changes in activation as        measured by phosphorylation status were seen at any of the        HT concentrations    M or time points  min         min  min and  hr examined The data from the kinase        activity assay also demonstrated no activation of the JNK        pathway by HT        The mitogenactivated protein kinase family is        associated with many cellular functions The ability of        HT to activate the ERK pathway is consistent with HTs        role as a mitogenic stimulus and vasoconstrictor Several        vasoactive Gprotein coupled agonists including        angiotensin II and endothelin have also been shown to        activate the ERK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells             These same hormones also activate the JNK and p        pathways These agonists have different time course and        concentration profiles for activation of the different MAPK        pathways ERK activation by angiotensin II and HT occurs        at relatively lower agonist concentrations and within five        minutes of stimulation  The activation of p and        JNK pathways by angiotensin II and endothelin occurs at        higher concentrations of agonist and requires a longer        incubation with the stimulus       There are data        which also suggest that different signal transduction        pathways are utilized for the different pathways              This differential activation of MAPK pathways is most        likely due to the role that each plays in the cell The ERK        pathway is associated with growth where as the p and JNK        pathways are stress response pathways        In light of data for the other Gprotein coupled        receptor agonists the inability of HT also Gprotein        coupled receptor was initially surprising While HT has        never been shown to increase activation of either the p        or JNK pathways it has been linked to ERK activation The        HT         A receptor is the primary serotonergic        receptor which couples to activation the ERK pathway in        vascular smooth muscle cells     HTs inability to        activate the JNK and p pathways may be due to a lack of        coupling of the HT         A receptor signaling pathway to the        components in the JNK and p pathways        It has recently been suggested that Gprotein coupled        receptors with PDZ domains SHcontaining domains and PTB        domains participate in proteinprotein interactions with        partners other than Gproteins such as Grb and JAK        which may allow these receptors to bypass the Gproteins        and utilize other signaling cascades  This ability of        Gprotein coupled receptors to modulate the signal cascade        used independent of Gproteins suggests a broader range        of interaction with signaling components This may provide        one explanation for the HT activation of the ERK and its        lack of effect on the JNK and p pathways        Another possible explanation for the differential        activation of the MAPK pathways by HT may relate to the        varied roles HT in different cell types and the multiple        receptors which mediate these roles When examining the        physiological role of HT in other cell types in regards        to apoptosis and cellular responses to stress HT is        generally antiapoptotic       In particular in        neuronal cells the HT         A receptor is upregulated under        conditions of cellular stress and is antiapoptotic             The antiapoptotic effects of HT maybe due to        scavenging of reactive oxygen species    as well as        stimulation of the ERK pathway which results in inhibition        of a caspaselike enzyme     There are no currently        published studies examining the role of HT as an        antiapoptotic factor in vascular smooth muscle cells It        may be that under stressful conditions such as a disease        state or a loss of nutrients which occurs in a state of        ischemia the smooth muscle cells upregulate a new        complement of HT receptors       These new        receptors maybe involved in activation of the ERK p and        JNK pathways but the studies presented here do not        directly address this issue They do however support the        conclusion that the HT         A receptor does not activate the p        orJNK pathways in rat vascular smooth muscle cells                    Methods
