                are you in the new car market right now   no im not uh and i wont be for a while its kind of called not having the money but  i always like to look at whats out there are you looking at cars right now     im not looking right now but i have been considering what i would purchase uh in the near future   what have what are you thinking about   um well im getting in the in my mid thirties now im looking more for a uh kind of a luxury sedan i guess im driving a two door coupe sport coupe right now and im getting a little tired of it   umhum so youre looking at uh luxury luxury cars a little bit bigger   yeah a little bigger and   have you looked at uh the Buick Riviera   i havent uh really been out looking at cars uh uh its something i would possibly consider   it is well i happen to drive that one just because i think it looks nice and um i owned a Buick for a while and it it performed real well   uhhuh   um um i dont i have a lot of friends that have bought cars recently and it just seems like theres and epidemic um a million people who that buy Honda Civic uh Honda Accords its like everybody buys a Honda Accord   right   and i really dont know what makes them select that over any other car   i dont know ive been told to check out the uh Acura Legend first though and i guess theyre made by Honda as well   thats oh are they i didnt know that i didnt know that   its the uh luxury line of the Hondas i think   uh and i uh ive read some articles too about oh i think the last one that got me going i dont know much about it at all but those little Geos   uhhuh   theyre kind of cute and they get excellent gas mileage i mean theyre like the top rated gas mileage car out there   yeah i do need something that gets a little better mileage than what im getting getting right now   umhum   i get about thirteen miles per gallon   whoa     now ive been uh leaning more towards looking at uh Mercedes Benzes say four or five years old   oh that sounds nice   not the new cars but uh ones that are more affordable   umhum   they tend to be very reliable and uh people that uh own them uh typically have them serviced on a regular maintenance schedule i think theyre kept in uh better condition than uh most other cars     i agree with you there i have uh a friend who has one and you know another thing is is they dont age they always look the same so you really dont know what what year it is uh   uhhuh yeah they dont change style very often i like that   they dont and uh they you know theyre a quality car they   uhhuh if you were to buy uh a new car right now what factors would do you consider uh looking at to make you decision   well i would definitely have to look at price   uhhuh   uh and i would look at what i could afford uh i definitely would chose a car on on what appeals to me as far as looks but itd have to be dependable uh   i find that price is always the governing governing governing factor uh regardless of what else youre looking at so   it itd have to be   its difficult to buy something thats out of your price range something that you cant afford   exactly and there theres such a range of prices prices in the car market that if you dont start by narrowing it down by that factor i mean that really gets you into just one little slot and then there are many many options to go to go to from there uh id one thing that always interests me is whether or not to buy an American car or a foreign car   uhhuh well i yeah i drive a Pontiac right now and ive had very good luck with it uh no problems im just changing my preference for what type of car id like to drive in the future   umhum so youre going to uh something a little bit bigger and and having better gas mileage too   yeah eventually id like to do something like that   uhhuh   get out out of uh uh driving this uh teenage teenage automobile   well you make me laugh because right now i what i did is i i acquired a car through my folks which is a nineteen eighty four LTD and my teenage daughter hates it because its an old persons car   sure well there are cars that teens absolutely will refuse to drive   oh well absolutely and uh its its a nineteen eighty four car and it has eighteen thousand miles on it actual miles so its kind of thing like im going to drive this car until it dies       you know i mean its just too good to and then maybe when i go out and look in in the car market ill be able to get what i really want and   uhhuh do you prefer buying uh cars new from uh dealerships or uh buying used cars from individuals     oh i think im going to fall in to the category of most women uh in saying that i feel better going to a dealership because i dont know anything about a car mechanically   right but dont you feel intimidated by talking to a car salesman   oh that was an experiment i did last year was i went and and talk and drove a few cars and talked with the the salesman and i found that uh i had matured a little bit in that they dont intimidate me at all   okay well thats great if they can make you feel at ease thats pretty good   uh oh they well they they make you they dont make you feel at ease but ive come to the point where i know that im the one they charge and that they cant you know   right   talk me into something um i think theyre intimidating to both men and women   they certainly are and they try to take advantage of uh the consumers ignorance towards automobiles   and exactly and once you once they sense that you really like something then youre really in trouble   yeah if they sense that youre really interested and thats the car for you theyre when theyre negotiating position is that theyre going to get as much money out of you as they can   umhum exactly   with as many options piled on   yeah the uh i had also had a  had a nineteen eighty four uh Bronco too which uh my exhusband had purchased i paid it off and and when i acquired this LTD i thought well im going to sell this car while i can get some money out of it yet so i was the selling a car and that was interesting because i had to kind of research well what is it worth um and kind of understand what someone would ask me about it   sure well you tend to do a lot better on selling a used car as an individual placing an ad in the paper as opposed to trading it in at a dealership   oh yes absolutely and yet at the same time its its a matter of like selling anything else you have to find someone who wants that pa rticular item   sure well ive found that any car that runs is basically in demand   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh you can go pretty much by the blue book value or by uh comparison uh listings   thats what i did is i kind of did a little bit of both Blue book is kind of a dream its kind of like if you can attain it youre doing well   yeah umhum   but if you go by what the other cars are listing for then you can rest assured that youre going to get right in that ball park Honda so   yeah uh yeah i agree with you on that   how so how soon do you think youll be purchasing a car   well im not sure im im just uh kind of thinking about it and havent really made any uh decisions or commitments on it   do you think of colors at all when you   well i drive a black car right now and ive always liked black but uh i maybe uh interested in other colors uh im not really interested in yellow or white   uhhuh   but ive always had a preference for red   uhhuh   and black and uh well its just something id have to think about depended on it depends on which uh what cars are available   thats right would you order it or would you uh   oh no i would uh go to the want ads in the paper and uh find one that would meet my uh needs   uhhuh well that sounds exciting       it really does so   well maybe maybe sometime soon i dont know probably not this year i think i need to concentrate more on getting a paint job for the car that i have right now   uhhuh   and just keeping it in uh good operating condition   well that sounds like a good plan you might as well just you know get it enjoy it for one more year and get it in good shape shape for selling it or trading it in   yeah well thats the point it isnt costing me any money right now its running uh very well and i havent had car payments for seven years i enjoy that immensely   uhhuh my goodness what type of car do you are you driving   im driving a nineteen eighty Trans AM   uhhuh   the only trouble i have with it is with insurance companies   oh im sure   they dont want to insure it   uhhuh because it has such uh   just because its a sporty model   powerful enough right right   has nothing to do with driving record i have no accidents or tickets and uh  theyre very reluctant uh yet even to insure that car   uhhuh i can understand that theyre i mean theyre just very difficult to work with and they can they can see a potential for a problem even if your record is good   yeah well my insurance agent told me that uh when when i uh bought a new car or when when i more specifically when i bought my Honda  to give him a call       because then he would he would make me a good deal on an insurance policy   well thats good   but i havent really no intention of buying a Honda   they dont really appeal to me that much i   it uh well its its more like an economy car   right right   and uh id be looking more of uh more for a luxury sedan something with a little more status   you seem to put a lot of um image into your selection of a car which lots of people do   i really dont consider it to be a status symbol uh its just im interested i know people who have cars of that nature and uh they tend to hold their quality   thats true   and hold their value   uhhuh uhhuh   uh and theyre just very attractive automobiles as far as im concerned   and i liked what you said also about when people have cars that are uh that are quality cars
