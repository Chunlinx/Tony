                                 Braver New World            Are we in Aldous HuxleysBrave New World already            I suppose that many peoplewho watched the TV version of Huxleys novel NBC April   must haveasked themselves this question Huxley visualized a society in which thepopulationexcept for the few mastersis kept under control not by fear ofpunishment but through the reinforcement of desirable behavior by rewards andthe nonviolent manipulation of the environment and of the thoughts andfeelings of individual men women and children In the novel everyone has freeaccess to an unlimited supply of a drugsomathat induces a feeling ofhappiness People are constantly brainwashed with the thought that they deserveto be happy Sex is readily available without complications Babies areproduced in vats There is no love between individuals no families nodevotion to anyone or anything to compete with devotion to the State            All thisbrings up thoughts of Prozac and Viagra the sexual revolution the constantbombardment of product advertising and the political imposition of spin onevery issue Hence the question Are we there already            When Huxley wrote his book published in  he placedthe Brave New World in the  th century But in  he wrote alittle book called Brave New World Revisited  in which he expressed thethought that we were getting there much sooner than he had earlier imaginedand that indeed we would be far into it by the end of the  thcentury He advised his readers to read that book against a background ofthoughts about the Hungarian uprising of  and its repression            Two forcesled Huxley to advance the date at which his society would arrive They werepopulation and technology He foresaw that the worlds population wouldincrease enormously by the end of this century He thought that the greatincrease in population would cause economic misery around the world creatingthe need for a dictatorship to maintain order and control future populationgrowth Technological change would require the concentration of production inthe hands of huge institutions controlled either by Big Business or by BigGovernment Within these institutions the technology would require workers toperform more and more as robots But the main contribution of advancingtechnology to Huxleys world was the facility it provided for manipulating theminds of the population Television would greatly enhance the ability of theauthorities to bring their message constantly into every home Littlenewspapers and magazines with dissenting opinions could not surviveeconomically The population would be constantly immersed in soap operas andsports on television effectively diverted from any thinking about societyMindaltering drugs would be increasingly available cheap and withoutdangerous side effects            In  Huxley saw all this already happeningor just around the corner What he would say today we cannot know He died in But it seems to me that the main lesson or at least one of the mainlessons from Huxleys  essay is how wrong a brilliant mind can be            He wasright about the growth of population But that growth did not produce aneconomic crisis with incomes declining and government control needed tomaintain order World per capita income is higher than ever and still risingIn what were the two most populous poor countries China and India theimprovement in the economic conditions of life has been especially noticeableThis improvement of economic conditions was not brought about by an increase ofcentralized control Government control of economies is diminishing everywhereThe greatest economic crisis since Huxley wrote occurred in the most controlledstate the Soviet Union and led to the dismantling of controls            Moreover technological change did not lead to acentralization of production in a few giant institutions The trend has beenthe reverse Improved information technology has facilitated the efficientinteraction of independent units through the market without central controlAnd technology has not changed workers into robots On the contrary technologyhas created mechanical robots and calls upon human beings to do what robotscannot do            Thecentralized manipulation of human minds through modern media that Huxleypredicted and feared is not happening either He did not foresee cabletelevision let alone the Internet People have access to more varied sourcesof information than ever before Moreover television is turning out to be anineffective medium for influencing human emotions Huxley describes the rousingeffect that Hitler could have on a hundred thousand Germans listening to him inperson in moonlight in an amphitheater If he had delivered the same speecheson television to millions of people sitting at home in groups of two orthreeeating popcorn getting up to go to the bathroom and channelsurfingwith their remote controlthe effect would have been very small Certainly TVexposure of our great authorities has not increased respect for them or ourwillingness to follow their lead And the effect of advertising whichconcerned Huxley greatly as an instrument that a dictator might use has turnedout to be trivial We may buy red or black cars rather than green or brown onesbecause of television but we dont buy cars because of television            The use of mindaltering drugs has probablyincreased as Huxley foresaw although probably not to the extent that heforesaw He thought that the use of these drugs would make the populationindifferent and willing to accept control by political leaders But first therewould have to be seizure of control by some group that was not indifferentToday we neither have such a group nor the atmosphere for its emergence Ofcourse we do have people who want to be in office but once in office theydont want to be in control Anyway what causes indifference to politics todayis not drugs but politics which seems less and less relevant to our lives            There isa trick in Huxleys argument that makes it difficult to refute Unlike thepeople in the Gulag Archipelago  the masses in Huxleys world do notknow they are not free They have been drugged and brainwashed into thinkingthat they are doing exactly what they want not what some dictator wants themto do So if we say that we are free how can we prove that we have not beenprogrammed to say that by a Master who is manipulating us into thinking thatPerhaps he put soma into our drinking water            There is however an answer to that The masters of theBrave New World would not allow a movie version of Brave New World to beshown on television The movie reveals what such a society could be like andwhat a horror it would be The heroes of the movie are a man and woman whoescape the system with their baby and are going to live like a traditionalfamily As long as Brave New World is shown on television we will knowwe are not in it            I describe the Brave NewWorld as a horror and Huxley thought of it as that also He was writing awarning not a prescription There may be people who do not look upon it ashorrible It is a society in which every want is fulfilled But as ProfessorFrank H Knight used to say what people want is not only to have their wantsfulfilled but also to have better wants People in the Brave New Worldsatisfy the wants they have but are prevented from having some good wants likewant for love and family and deprived of the opportunity to reach for new andbetter wants
