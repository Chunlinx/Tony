                okay you have three boys i had two boys and two girls   right   my youngest is college age but he is so hes still around occasionally but um hes hes twenty two and in his last year of college but uh we were very active with them when they were young  whatever they were in gymnastics or soccer or baseball or basketball whatever we were always involved in the parent club and coached some and went to all the games and and course in Plano thats a big deal wed even where we lived in Albuquerque before theres a lot of parent involvement in childrens lives how about where you are   thats good well i try i try to as much as possible um my oldest is nine he plays plays soccer and is getting ready to start playing football   oh oh my   and uh im behind him a hundred percent on that and   right   and my my middle one is five hes playing soccer and Tball   oh dear   my youngest is two and he wants to do it all so   yeah  hes learning from the big brothers huh  thats neat though and sometimes those that see their older brothers do it turn out to be pretty good because they pick up skills   yeah thats thats right   seems  naturally you know just they start so young just kicking the ball and are are you pretty involved with with their uh   thats true i try to be as much as i can   do you coach them or go out to parent nights   oh no i i uh go out to as many games as i can get to   uhhuh uhhuh   its kind of hard hard hard with me just because im in the restaurant business and i have to work weekends but my wifes there all the time and   oh   mean thats thats one of my thats my downfall on my side of that that that aspect   umhum umhum   which is i thinks a lot of peoples too just in general   right   is that is there that everybodys working you know the the dads away at work and then the then the wife goes away to work and kids are stuck with sitters and theyre not involved in there as much with their their with their kids they let somebody else raise their kids   right right right it well thats seems to be a a pretty current trend i i work in the schools and i see a lot of kids that   what   obviously are looking for a family and usually find it within a group at school rather than at home because their parents are off working or uh usually you know a lot of times its a single mother trying to raise and of course i i deal with adolescents so thats where it fourteen fifteen thats where it really starts coming out this lack of of uh family life   what do you what do you what difference do you see in those kids that than ones with a mother and father in the participation   well uh they look for their security and their uh selfesteem uh outside of the home and usually in the wrong groups   really   and and uh   acceptance   right and they find that theyre very easily unfortunately uh the kids who make them feel the most welcome   right   when new students come into school are the kids that are are uh on drugs or party a lot on weekends and things like that and and uh   yeah wrong side of the fence   theyre the first but they are the first ones that will come up and say you know you want to sit at my table in the cafeteria and let me help you to your classes and things like that and and uh   right   when youve got a a child thats just coming from a situation a move is a terrible thing on a child its its just such a traumatic especially if theyve lived for any length of time   oh sure i mean the   in in the first place and they come up here and no friends and here are these people just throwing themselves and before you know it youve got a a kid involved in things you dont want them involved in and   it   and most of the time the move is made and then mom and daddy go right back to work right away and the kids coming home to an empty house or theyre coming home to take care of little brothers and sisters and and uh youve got these ready made friends just ready to go   that thats right   and and uh i you i dont know what the answer is because i am a working woman and and i dont like to say if the women would stay home any more than i like to say if the men would stay home and and its   right well youre fortunate that uh your kids are grown and i mean did did you did you work when your kids were growing up   right when when my youngest was in third grade i went back to work but i stayed home up until then when by that time my oldest was   right   oh shes about six years older than he is so she must have been in about uh tenth grade i guess my oldest was and i had one in tenth and one in ninth and one in eighth and then this third grader and and uh   right   but i went to work for the school district where i was home in the summer i had two weeks off at Christmas i got left school at three four oclock every day and was home to take them to anything they needed to go to in the afternoons   did you work in the school or in the administrative end of it   uh no in the schools i i uh i did work some summers but it was never my work never took uh first place if if my kids needed me or needed to go somewhere thats where i was   it   right just did you work at the same school that your kid was going through   and um i when my youngest was in elementary school i worked at in his elementary school for three years   right   and uh but i had an understanding with the principal that under no circumstances was i to be treated any differently i dont want i said i dont want teachers coming to me in the middle of the day when they couldnt get to anybody elses mother in the middle of the day that that it would be handled the same way they handled dealt with other parents other kids it it gets real easy when a mother is in a school or a father even for a teacher to every time some little thing goes wrong to run and pretty soon all youre hearing is negative things so it you know and those things need to be dealt with in the classroom by the teacher and not tattled necessarily   right right well it puts you it puts you in an awkward situation puts the child in an awkward situation   but it it it worked well it worked well with me and i and i told the principal i said if if uh my student my child does something that you feel deserves licks or some other discipline have at it  you know im im i have always   right   wanted them to respect rules and teachers and and uh i dont want them to think that im going to come riding to the rescue where every time something happens but   well they need to i mean any any child as far as that goes theres that theres that certain theres that  that fine line between A and C you know that you have you need to ride and all kids do they they need discipline   right well i think unfortunately what what were seeing in the very few of the instances is that uh for the parents who cannot be there to parent during the day their idea of parenting is to come riding to the rescue and take their childs side without knowing the whole story or even when they do know the whole story   right   its its either another students fault or its another its a teachers fault or its its anybodys and they consider that being a good parent and that what when really what the child needs is their attention more of the time and its   well thats usually what gets them in trouble to begin with not enough attention not enough attention like you were saying they go off into the wrong groups and get hooked up with the wrong people so   umhum umhum umhum it it its and its its difficult i understand i i know a lot of single women that are working two jobs just to keep a roof over the kids head and keep food on the table and i dont know how these women are supposed to have time to to parent its its i dont i dont know what the answer is to it its its really sad i there may not be i but it it beats being it beats being homeless  you know and   you dont know if there is one there may not i mean its just an ongoing ongoing problem right
