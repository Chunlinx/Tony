            im ready okay   you have an opinion about civil stuff      well you know when to me when youre talking about juries theres theres two types of juries youve got the civil juries and then youve got the criminal juries now the criminal juries   right   my understanding of those where a person has done some crime and youre trying to determine that they need to go to jail or not and then if he does for how long the civil jury does it matter of   umhum   you owe me some money or you think that i owe you some money and we cant get it resolved so we go to the jury and were ask were gonna ask that jury to uh make a decision as to who owes who and for how much   yes   im sorry i have a problem with that   oh i do too   because first of all  im a working person and i need to get paid for my day of work and if the our juries only pay us seven dollars and fifty cents for a full day of work i think its wrong that two people have a dispute they had a little car wreck and maybe one owes the other guy five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars whatnot and theyre going to call me away from work for seven dollars and fifty cents to make a decision as to who owes who and how much to me that is what we pay our judges to do   okay youre youre youre selfemployed so youre not   i am selfemployed thats right   reimbursed by anyone   im not going to be reimbursed by no one   okay uh yeah that thats interesting point i i im not an enthusiast for juries particularly and i think especially in in civil cases i doubt doubt the effectiveness of it i hadnt thought about it from terms of the cost point of view to providing the jury i think we may be the only major country today that still uses juries in civil trials   you know that one ive never heard of but that you may be right i was i wish id you know ive ive never heard that before   im pretty sure Britain has has uh given up juries in civil cases   but i mean isnt isnt that what we have the elected officials who supposedly is unbiased who cant arent they supposed to have a head on their shoulders to make these decisions   well probably judges would be the people you  decision about whether to use juries or decision   no decision as to whether or not as far as civils concerned   i mean i i i think it would be better to have them have judges trained professionals deciding such things   true   um i dont know theres any Constitutional way to do that other than to change the Constitution   youre probably right but it thats still my as far as im concerned i just think its wrong to use a jury for the civil matters now you can talk about criminal matters   umhum   uh ive got no problem with that one because you know here youre talking about uh has a person fit into society has he followed the rules of society ive ive got no problem at all with using your peers quote quote       and helping to make decisions although wed have problems as to who qualifies to be on that uh jury and i think some of the the manipulative rules that they use to say that all the rich and famous cannot be on a jury but all the poor dregs can be you know it doesnt it doesnt make sense     uh no i dont think i guess different states have different rules on that   well it it it what amount to if youre if youre rich if you got money   i   and your really high on society somehow another youre going come up with a one of these excuse that the the the judge gonna say yeah youre excused you dont have to be here but if you are some poor old uh blue collar worker who you know uh just trying to eke out a living and uh i work from eight to five and you know for some reason hes not gonna find an excuse to get out and so we typically find our juries made up of some of the dumbest people rather than the smarter people     this is because because of  not who initially comes in but whos selected out of the panel uh okay certainly both sides   right   pick criteria by which they wanna wanna judge juries and and uh veto lots of those and i suspect       that uh well see  likely to get off that way although it itll vary   true   um i mean i guess traditionally juries are supposed to do findings of fact as opposed to findings of law and deciding   but then they but then they also have to make the decision as to how long that person should serve   well that that varies by state and locality as to whether the   okay and and there most juries dont even know what the hell they even talking about   uh there is a little basis for comparison   and then when you get someone who says okay this person should be convicted for thirty years two years later theyre on probation because the jury doesnt know and in in the state of Texas i dont think you are allowed uh the jurys not allowed to be told how soon that person would be off on probation only thing that they can do is determine how long they should be put in jail not knowing what the rest of the rule is which i think is unfair   well i guess i feel much more comfortable with with judges either
