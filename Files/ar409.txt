                    Introduction        Synovial tissues isolated from patients with rheumatoid        arthritis RA display biologic properties that differ from        normal synovium and there is a rapidly expanding        catalogue of biochemical and molecular changes that        underlie this phenotype     We have investigated the        feasibility of using Moloney murine leukemia virus MoMLV        based vectors to constitutively express cloned genes in        primary human fibroblastlike synovial cells FLS with        the longterm objective of defining the contributions of        specific signaling pathways and inflammatory mediators to        the destructive phenotype of FLS in RA        Prior studies have suggested that MoMLVbased vectors        transduced FLS with relatively low efficiency               We designed experiments to determine if viral titer        influenced FLS transduction by concentration of retrovirus        In these experiments we used a modified MoMLV vector        pRET designed to improve transcriptional stability in        primary cells We also employed the enhanced green        fluorescent protein EGFP as a virally encoded transgene        to optimize a rapid and efficient superspeed centrifugation        technique for concentration of viral supernatant Viral        particles were concentrated to  colony forming units        cfuml by superspeed centrifugation at          g for four hours Up to  of        primary human FLS were transduced         in vitro following a single exposure        to concentrated viral supernatant                    Materials and methods                  Cell Culture          Murine fibroblast NIH T cells amphotropic PA          packaging cells and Phoenix E ecotropic packaging

Grand island NY USA  Uml penicillin           gml streptomycin and  mM Lglutamine The FLS          cultures were established from synovial tissues obtained          during joint replacement surgery in RA patients              The FLS were cultured in DMEM plus  heatinactivated          human AB serum BioWhittaker Walkersville MD USA           fetal bovine serum penicillin streptomycin and          Lglutamine The FLS were used between the third and          tenth passage                          Construction of retroviral vector and producer          cells          The EGFP cDNA was PCR amplified from pEGFP          Clontech Palo Alto CA USA and subcloned into pRET          a modified version of the MoMLVbased MFG retroviral          vector designed to optimize gene expression in primary          cell lines The pRET incorporates longterminal repeats          from the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus     and a          point mutation in the primer binding site     A          vector expressing the human cyclooxygenase COX cDNA          was constructed in the same backbone pRETCOX          Amphotropic viral producers were established in PA          cells see Supplementary Material                          Concentration of viral supernatant by superspeed          centrifugation          Fresh medium was added to subconfluent producer cell          monolayers collected  hours later and filtered           M prior to use Centrifugation was performed at C in          a Sorval RCB centrifuge using SS or GSA rotors          Following centrifugation the supernatant was aspirated          and saved for analysis The viral pellet was resuspended          in fresh medium by gentle pipetting                          Quantitation of viral RNA by slot blot          hybridization          Viral RNA was quantitated using a slot blot          hybridization technique See Supplementary Material for          full details                          Quantitation of retroviral titer by flow cytometry          based expression analysis for EGFP          We developed a flow cytometry assay to rapidly measure          the titer of infectious viral particles Fig  This          assay takes advantage of the fluorescent properties of          the EGFP transgene A total of    NIH T cells were          transduced with serial dilutions of supernatant The

at             cellswell FLS were cultured with viral supernatant          plus protamine sulfate  gml for  hours Cells were          analyzed for transgene expression  hours after          infection                            Results                  Concentration of viral supernatant          To determine if viral titer influenced the          transduction efficiency of FLS we optimized a superspeed          centrifugation protocol for concentration of viral          supernatant Prior studies reported improved transduction          of primary cells with retrovirus concentrated by          centrifugation at            g for  hours       We          systematically evaluated different centrifugation          parameters to minimize the time required for maximal          concentration while preserving viral infectivity A          virally encoded EGFP transgene      was used to          monitor viral concentration and infectious titer We          concentrated viral supernatant fold in as few as four          hours by centrifugation at            g  with complete recovery of          infectious viral particles This data is presented in the          Supplementary Material Supplementary Figs s s s          and s                          Retroviral transduction of primary human          synoviocytes          Concentrated virus was tested for its ability to          transduce primary FLS As shown in Figure and Table           concentration of viral supernatant increased FLS          transduction We found that    of FLS expressed          EGFP following transduction with unconcentrated          supernatant compared with    for X          concentrated supernatant            P   compared with          unconcentrated supernatant and    for X          concentrated supernatant            P   compared with          unconcentrated supernatant          To provide confirmation that improved transduction of          FLS was associated with an increase in the intracellular          expression of a virally encoded transgene FLS were          transduced with a vector encoding human COX          pRETCOX The expression of COX was measured by          western blot on whole cell lysates     A substantial          increase in net COX expression was observed following          transduction with both X and X concentrated viral          supernatant Fig                             Discussion        We are characterizing molecular pathways involved in        synovial pathophysiology by overexpression of biologically        relevant transgenes and dominant negative inhibitors in        FLS The limited expansion potential of FLS combined with        the low efficiency of existing methods stimulated a        systematic examination of various transduction techniques        to identify a rapid and efficient method for stable genetic        modification of FLS In this manuscript we report a        retroviral vector system and transduction protocol with the        capacity to express a viral transgene in  or more of        primary human FLS after a single exposure to virus We have        subsequently used this methodology to successfully express        a panel of transgenes in FLS L Crofford and K McDonagh        unpublished observations We believe this approach will be        of value to investigators addressing similar mechanistic        questions in FLS        Previous studies exploring the use of recombinant MoMLV        vectors concluded that FLS were relatively resistant to        transduction        limiting enthusiasm for this        approach The basis for this resistance was unclear but        could be attributable to many factors including vector        design viral titer or biologic features inherent to FLS        Our experiments differ from prior studies of retroviral        gene transfer to FLS in several important respects that may        impact on the observed results First our viral backbone        is a modified MoMLV vector that incorporates genetic        elements myeloproliferative sarcoma virus longterminal        repeats and B mutation associated with resistance to        transcriptional silencing following proviral integration in        primary cells      While we did not perform a detailed        comparison of EGFP expression in FLS using the modified and        unmodified vector backbones preliminary experiments        suggested that the modified vector was superior J Yang        unpublished observations A similar modified MoMLV vector        has been used to stably express EGFP in human marrow        stromal cells     another fibroblastlike primary cell        type A second distinction is the use of EGFP as a        transgene whereas prior studies relied on lacZ or        betagalactosidase The expression of EGFP is readily        detectable in living cells by fluorescence microscopy or        flow cytometry and expression can be monitored serially        over time in a single culture In contrast to staining for        lacZ which is often complicated by background staining        from endogenous galactosidase activity there is no        significant background staining with EGFP We do not know        if analysis of EGFP expression is more or less sensitive        than analysis for lacZ expression although we believe it        provides more reproducible and quantitative data due to the        absence of background staining        Using this vector system we observed a low         ex vivo transduction efficiency           of FLS with unconcentrated supernatant titer of         cfuml that was roughly comparable to prior reports        Centrifugal concentration of viral supernatant by  to        fold significantly increased the efficiency of viral        transduction with  or more of FLS expressing EGFP in        several independent experiments using FLS lines from        separate donors Concentration of supernatant to viral        titers exceeding  cfuml appeared to have the greatest        quantitative impact on improving transduction efficiency        Increasing viral titer to  cfuml yielded an additional        increase in transduction efficiency in some but not all        experiments This observation suggests that factors in        addition to viral titer may limit the maximum number of        transduced FLS observed using these culture conditions        Lentiviral vectors have the capacity to transduce        nonreplicating cells     and may represent an        alternative to MoMLVbased vectors for some        applications                    Conclusion        We report a retroviral vector system and transduction        methodology that achieve stable transgene expression in        primary human FLS with efficiencies of approximately         These results establish the feasibility of using widely        available retroviral gene transfer techniques to study the        biologic impact of overexpression of specific regulatory        and inflammatory molecules in primary FLS                    Supplementary material                  Supplementary Introduction          Synovial cells play a central role in the          pathophysiology of inflammatory arthritis Much of our          understanding of this biology has been derived from the          study of primary fibroblast like synovial cells cultured          from arthritic joints after arthroscopic biopsy or          surgery Stable genetic modification of primary synovial          cells is an approach that may be useful in defining the          roles that specific signaling pathways or inflammatory          mediators play in the joint destruction associated with          rheumatoid arthritis As our understanding of this          biology improves investigators have also proposed that          gene transfer to primary synovial cells could be          developed as a therapeutic approach to the treatment of          patients with inflammatory arthritis               Recombinant retroviral vectors are widely used in the          laboratory and in experimental clinical applications to          introduce new genetic material into the host genome in a          stable form Retroviral packaging cells routinely yield          viral supernatants with titers in the range of  to           cfuml or higher and titers of up to  cfuml may be          achieved in some cases Physical methods to concentrate          viral supernatants have been pursued with mixed results          Ultracentrifugation can be used to physically concentrate          MoMLVbased retroviral particles but viral infectivity          is impaired secondary to damage to the envelope protein          Pseudotyped retroviruses containing the vesicular          stomatitis virus G protein are more robust and can be          concentrated more than fold by ultracentrifugation          without significant loss of viral infectivity However          because of the toxicity of the vesicular stomatitis virus          G glycoprotein only transient methods of virus          production have been described  S S   Bowles           et al previously reported a          superspeed centrifugation technique for concentration of          recombinant retrovirus     A MoMLV based recombinant          retrovirus was concentrated over fold by

determined by fluorescence          microscopy The successful transinfection of pRETCOX          into PA was confirmed by G selection These          polyclonal populations of PA producer cells were used          as the source of viral supernatant for subsequent viral          transduction and concentration experiments The presence          of replication competent retrovirus was excluded by PCR

using a    nm bandpass filter to          detect the signal on FL to determine the percentage of          cells expressing EGFP In all cases serial dilutions of          viral supernatant were tested

quantitation of            residual viral particles The viral pellets were            resuspended in a thirtieth of the original volume of            the supernatant As measured on NIH T cells by flow            cytometry viral titer increased fold after four            hours of centrifugation and appeared to plateau after             hours of centrifugation at    cfuml            Supplementary Fig  There was a proportional            decline in the viral titer of the postcentrifugation            supernatant Even following concentration for as long            as  hours the infectivity of the recombinant virus            was preserved            To confirm the viral titer derived by expression            analysis we performed slot blot hybridization analysis            on viral RNA in the postcentrifugation supernatant and            the resuspended viral pellet Supplementary Fig             Following centrifugation at              g for four hours most retroviral            RNA was

centrifugal force            To further optimize the concentration procedure we            examined a range of relative centrifugal force RCF            The time of centrifugation was fixed at four hours and            the RCF was varied in a range from  to              g  Following centrifugation the            viral pellet was resuspended in a hundredth of the            original volume Viral titer was quantitated by            expression studies in NIH T cells Supplementary Fig             and slot blot hybridization analysis Supplementary            Fig  We observed a progressive rise in viral titer            as RCF was increased from  to              g  At a RCF of              g  the titer of the resuspended            pellet reached a plateau value of    cfuml            Further concentration of viral particles was not            achieved by increasing RCF above              g  Viral particles were not            detectable by expression assay or by slot blot            hybridization analysis in the postcentrifugation            supernatant at an RCF of              g or higher The expression data            also suggested that centrifugation at a RCF as high as                         g for four hours did not affect            viability of the recombinant retrovirus                                      Supplementary Discussion        The FLS are the principal cell type of sublining        synovial tissue Proliferation of FLS is observed in RA a        debilitating condition that affects as many as  of        adult individuals worldwide Primary FLS cultures can be        established following arthroscopic biopsy or surgical        resection of synovium from the joint Protease digested        synovial tissues placed in culture rapidly yield        fibroblastlike cells After three passages these primary        cultures are depleted of macrophagelike type A        synoviocytes  S   Doubling time is stable between the        third and the tenth passages but marked reduction in        proliferation rate occurs in later passage cells  S                 Retroviral mediated gene transfer is a commonly used        technique to stably introduce genes into primary cells The        titer of retroviral supernatant is one of several factors        that influence transduction efficiency A variety of        strategies have been employed to physically concentrate        retroviral particles in an attempt to further increase        viral titer and improve the efficiency of target cell        transduction Centrifugation of retroviral supernatant is a        potentially attractive approach to viral concentration        because of the wide availability of centrifuge equipment        the simplicity of the technique and the theoretical        potential for rapid processing of large sample volumes        Concentrated recombinant retrovirus generated by        superspeed centrifugation of retroviral supernatant has        been used to improve the transduction efficiency of primary        cells including hepatocytes    and endothelial cells            In these prior reports concentration was        accomplished by centrifugation for  hours at a RCF of                 g  We used a recombinant retrovirus        encoding the green fluorescent protein to optimize a        protocol to rapidly and efficiently concentrate retrovirus        by superspeed centrifugation Our studies indicate that the        time necessary to recover essentially all viral particles        can be reduced to four hours by increasing the RCF to                 g  The protocol does not appear to        adversely affect the infectivity of the viral preparation        as the functional viral titer on NIH T cells closely        matched the titer that was predicted by the degree of        concentration Although it has been reported that        centrifugation may result in concurrent concentration of        noninfectious viral particles or inhibitors of viral        transduction  S   we have been able to substantially        increase the transduction efficiency of primary FLS using        concentrated viral supernatant produced by our protocol        This optimized technique may be useful in generating high        titer retroviral supernatants from production lots of        relatively modest titer We anticipate that this method        will be effective in concentrating other pseudotyped MoMLV        vectors and lentivirus based vectors though additional        testing will be required to evaluate its suitability for        each vector system        While our studies were not initiated with the objective        of developing a therapeutic protocol these results may        also have implications for clinical studies The         ex vivo genetic modification of FLS        has been proposed as a potential approach to the treatment        of arthritis  S S   In these studies FLS are cultured        from synovial tissue obtained by synovectomy transduced        with retroviral supernatant         ex vivo  and injected into another        joint of the same individual Approval for these clinical        studies was based on         ex vivo transduction data in        preclinical animal models  S S   Essentially all data        on transduction efficiency of FLS was derived using        retroviral vectors that express lacZ or betagalactosidase        Although most authors have obtained         ex vivo transduction efficiencies of        cultured FLS in the range of  some have reported        transduction efficiencies up to  Preactivation of FLS        with tumor necrosis factor  however may increase        transduction efficiency levels to over   S
