happily withoutnotice this week Six months ago the president was impeached During theFlytrap hullabaloo commentators promised that the country would spend yearspondering the meaning of this impeachment They could not have been more wrongIts been half a year since impeachment and four months since acquittal but itmight as well be a generation for all that America has thought about itAmericans dont gossip about it pollsters dont poll about it pundits dontpund about it the torrent of Nexis articles has dried to a trickle and eventhe mythical Washington dinner party is devoid of impeachment talk            Even the senators Ihave been talking to say they havent thought about it at all They had anactive desire to rid their memory of it The level of traumatic amnesia isquite remarkable says Ross Baker a Rutgers University political scientistwho studies impeachment            Flytrap followed the increasingly typical pattern of themodern media event It was exaggerated beyond reason while it was unfoldingAmerica overdosed on it As soon as it ended the sand castle washed awaysupplanted by the next big thing See also the Gulf War Supposedly thedefining event of the postCold War world the Gulf brouhaha disappearedmoments after the fighting stopped and left no lasting impact on Americanpolitics            Impeachment may beforgotten but its not gone It lingers sourly but not in quite the waysanyone expected There were two consensus predictions about how Flytrap wouldchange American politics It would make Clinton a lame duck and murdercongressional Republicans at the polls in  But the presidents approvalratings remain high and he has been able to prosecute a war almostsinglehandedly And Democrats have all but surrendered the idea thatimpeachment can be a campaign winner They fundraised off impeachmentimmediately after the trial but Democratic Congressional Campaign CommitteeChairman Rep Patrick Kennedy has abandoned his plan to make impeachment thecenterpiece of Democratic House campaigns People are not so focused onimpeachment that they would come into the voting booths in November  andsay Aha he was for impeachment and vote against him says Democraticpollster Mark Mellman            Impeachment continues to distort politics but not asitself It is Masked Impeachment Sublimated Impeachment The HouseRepublicans seething with rage at the lech in chief are the most potentexample They didnt trust Clinton much before Flytrap Now they dont trusthim at all and they yearn to nail him once and for all During the Kosovocrisis which Republicans privately called Clintons war GOP opposition tointervention stemmed as much from a desire to beat Clinton as from anyprinciple The House Republican effort to undermine the war was a continuationof impeachment sniffs one White Houser            Flytrap also bears someresponsibility for Washingtons paralysis The personal rancor fomented byimpeachment blocks bipartisan cooperation Republicans and Democrats on theHouse Judiciary Committee remain at each others throats The president stillfurious at the Houses indictment of him doesnt work with House RepublicansAnd Democrats who want to run against the donothing Republicans in  arehappy to stall major legislation Impeachment of course is hardly the solecause of paralysis Some Republicans are content to delay big legislation tillGeorge W Bushs presidential inauguration Kosovo intruded during the fewmonths when major bills could have been considered And the GOP majority is sothin and fractured that passing contentious legislation was almost certainlyimpossible even if there had been time            Impeachment has also frozen the Senate but for a lessominous reason Unlike the House which finished impeachment in December theSenate lost the first two months of its current session to the trial Thismassively delayed planning and billwriting a traffic jam that still has notcleared            Impeachment is twistingthe presidential race too Al Gore born to suffer for Bill Clintons sins isbearing the cross for Flytrap Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center citesGores poor ratings in headtoheads against Bush as evidence that the veep isa victim of Clinton fatigue And the only discernible reason Bill BradleyaGore clone in both middleroad policy and stump awkwardnessis polling percent of Democratic voters is that he is independent of the Clinton scandalmachine            Impeachment so haunts Gore that he has designed his entirecampaign around neutralizing it Had Flytrap never occurred Gore surely wouldbe running on the ClintonGore economic boom Instead he has placed familyvalues and personal morality at the heart of his platform and the first act ofhis campaign was to schedule a series of interviews in which he denouncedClintons behavior            The Republican presidential campaign is beingshaped by the Iword as well AntiClinton rage benefits House Republicans inthe conservative districts they represent But antiClintonism is not a tenablenational strategy Party leaders have anointed Bush because he is mercifullydisconnected from Flytrap In Bush they have a candidate who can preach thewinning message of Flytrap morality good lechery bad but isnt associatedwith the screeching House impeachers who are so unpopular nationwide            Impeachment may be in the words of pollster JohnZogby the Great Unmentionable Politicians will make it a hidden foundationof their strategy will imply and suggest and insinuate Republicans will hintat Democratic immorality Democrats will poke at Republican obsessivenuttiness The points will be scored obliquely but almost no one will risk theword itself
