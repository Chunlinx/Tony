                                  Remembering Herb            A reviewer once said that I was the master of theDont Know school of economics wrote Herbert Stein in his last bookWhat I Think  And then he added I dont know that I am the master ofit but I surely avow membership in it more openly than most other economistsdo            That mixture of wry humor and openness to furtherargument endeared Herb to the many friends and admirers who mourn his deathtoday at the age of  His embrace of dontknowism was real I have alwaysbeen mystified by international finance since I took a course in it at theUniversity of Chicago  years ago he wrote in a                   Slate                exchange a year agoalmost but not quite embarrassing me out of adisquisition on the International Monetary Fund and the sad state of theRussian and Japanese economies But his reticence was not grounded in falsemodesty Herb well knew how keen was his intellect and how sharp his wit Andespecially in his earlier years he did not suffer fools gladlyat least ifthey were stubborn in their foolishness Most peopleeven those who readeditorial and oped pagesdo not want to encounter opposing views he mournedin What I Think  They want to be massaged not informed            But mindmassages werenot for Herb He recognized perhaps better than most of his economistcolleagues how complicated and fastchanging the world can be And so he kepthis mind open to new facts new ideas whether about    or what producesthem for most people has very little to do with politicians            Unfortunately one of Herbs alltime great pieces ofparody written for the Wall Street Journal  on whose Board ofContributors he sat for more than two decades is not available on the Web Butanyone with access to back copies of the Journal should consult TheFull Marriage Act of  in which Congress having expressed its rankedpreference for marriages made in heaven arranged by the participants arrangedthrough the personals column of New York magazine or arranged bymothers undertakes to provide spouses of last resort            Herb was as ready for newadventures as he was for new ideas How many economists of Herbs distinctionaccomplishments and years would for example undertake to write for an onlinemagazine startup Yet even before                   Slate                moved from Kinsleyspaceto cyberspace Herb signed up to moderate the magazines  And how fewerstill would be those with the daring and the sense of humor to top off thattaxing experiment with an even bolder venture                    Slate               soriginal adviser to the public on matters of morals manners andmacroeconomics was in fact none other than Herbert Stein former adviser topresidents Herb did it anonymously of course though a sharpeyed readermight have guessed from the drawing of Prudence that accompanied the columnif they hadnt already been tipped off by the tone But Herb enjoyed it somuchand he did it with such flairthat I dont think he would mind myrevealing the secret            And he did enjoy it One cure for unrequited lovePrudence reminded a lovelorn reader is requited love There are other curesalso such as devotion to the study of the Finnish language To a readerworried about being bad at small talk Prudence counseled You are making toomuch of this What everyone wants in a conversationalist is not a good talkerbut a good listener You could be Oscar Wilde and no one would go home from aparty saying Gee Oscar was witty tonight Many would go home saying GeeI was witty tonight  In the day of automatic door unlockers should a manstill walk around a car to unlock the door for the woman he is escortingAbsolutely Prudence replied noting the opportunity thus afforded for sweetlykissing her on the cheek Modern gadgets will not do all that and real mendont want them to Something has to be left for the men to do As for the shyadviceseeker worried about the possibility of having to kiss a girlPrudence replied If that situation arises you will have no problem Perhapsyou will have to kiss her because she has kissed you In that case yourspontaneous unpondered reaction will be to kiss her back Your problem willnot be hesitancy about kissing but addiction to it            Herb was deeply saddened by the death of his wifeMildred a few years ago He wrote about his loss only indirectly in what wassurely the most popular of his It Seems to Me  columns in                  Slate                 Why he asked as he watched husbands and wiveswalking up the hill to the Kennedy Center for a performance is this basicwoman so valuable to the man whose hand or arm she is holding And in hisexploration of the question it was clear that he had in mind the wife withwhom he had walked up that hill to the Kennedy Center many times            Herb once set down a list of  sayings that youwont find in Bartletts but that resonated with him The authorsranged from Milan Kundera and Dante to  whom he served as chairman of theCouncil of Economic Advisers He also included an aphorism of his own Ifsomething cannot go on forever it will stop Sadly that was true of Herbhimself
