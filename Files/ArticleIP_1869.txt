                                 NRA President Charlton Heston            By my reckoning CharltonHeston has played a CIA director two prophets Moses twice and BrighamYoung two saints Thomas More and John the Baptist an admiral two generalsas well as six captains and three majors a cardinal Richelieu two kingsMacbeth and Henry VIII and three presidents of the United States AndrewJackson Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelts voice            So theNational Rifle Association which elected Heston president this week can beforgiven for mistaking the actor for a real commander NRA leaders believe thepatriarchal Heston will polish the gun lobbys lousy public image whilegalvanizing its redmeatandgunpowder members Hey Moses is on our sidegloats NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre            At  Heston does remain an awesome presencetallgrandfatherly astonishingly handsome his voice as magnificent as everPresident Heston has already employed that godly bass to great effect His NRAspeech produced a thats being played and replayed on newscasts Hestonsascendance seems to be filling some conservatives with whatif regret Whydidnt he run for office when he was in his prime            Hestons fans are fallingvictim to Celebrity Identification Disorder the same malady that causes peopleto write letters to soap opera characters Heston periodically says I am notMoses but his admirers dont quite believe it Hes been associated withextraordinary men for so long that they assume he must be one            In factHeston embodies a very different more mundane but still admirable ethos Thedefining quality of his career is competence not genius He was never aromantic lead but he was Hollywoods superstar during the epics brief heydaySince the late s however he has enjoyed the most workmanlike career of anyactor in Hollywood He has made a prosperous living by playing with slightvariation the same role for  years the hero with a stick up his rearend            Heston is the Volvo of Hollywood actors neverbrilliant never awful always reliable He has appeared in more than movies countless TV films dozens of plays He is always first on the setHes unfailingly polite to coworkers and respectful to directors He nevermisses work because of illness Appropriately modest he credits his success tohis physical equipment rather than his talent his height and good health aswell as that voice that jaw and that nose Hestonresearches his roles assiduously memorizing Old Testament passages to playMoses and reading all Michelangelos letters to play him            Unlikemany actors of his generation Heston has cheerfully adjusted to seniorcitizenship He accepts lesser parts in bad movies  Call of the Wild and worse television  The Colbys  a shortlived dreadful Dynastyspinoff He has become a hiredgun narrator the guy you buy when you needGods voice Hestons signature characters Moses BenHur El Cid always tookthemselves seriously but Heston doesnt He has played selfmocking parts inWaynes World  and Bud Light ads He is a pro a hack the guy whosehighest value is that he gets the job done            Offscreen too Heston leads an unremarkable life He hasbeen married for  years and is extremely close to his two children He livesquietly on a wellarmed Los Angeles estate eschewing parties for historybooks and his journal author of three memoirs he is an excellent funnywriter            And hisactivism is a steady hobby rather than an obsession Hes an enthusiast butalso a dilettante In the early s he was a staunch civil rights advocateIn the early s he advised Ronald Reagan on National Endowment for the Artsfunding He has condemned the nuclear freeze movement obscene rap music andoverpopulation In every case Heston has been effective without beingmonomaniacal His rhetoric admittedly is not always restrained He denouncespolitical correctness with frothatthemouth language that would be hilariousif it werent so nasty Click for a couple of examples            Heston has even had moderate instincts aboutgun rights Until recently he hasnt spent much time pushing the SecondAmendment After Robert Kennedys assassination in  he endorsed strong guncontrol legislation and as recently as last year he declared that AKs areinappropriate for private use Hestons softness on gun rights was anissue in his NRA election but he has quieted critics by backing off hisearlier statements and hewing to the NRAs official line He recently said thata Washington state initiative to require trigger locks was written bySatan            All thisis to say Those who liken him to Reagan misunderstand Heston It is an easycomparison Both are Democrats who converted to conservative RepublicanismBoth are actors who involved themselves in politics Both served as presidentof the Screen Actors Guild Both are marvelous speakers            But here is the critical point about Heston He nevergrabbed the ring He declined invitations from Democrats and Republicans to runfor the Senate in California and resisted efforts to draft him into the presidential race He was an actor is an actor and will always be an actorHis life is comfortable and he sees no reason to change it            Its truethat Heston the activist has accomplished more than most private citizens everhope to But he has never done what his characters would have Theextraordinary man the man who believes he can change the world hungers forthe power to do it and pursues that power relentlessly Reagan had that hungerand changed the world Heston has all the physical equipmentbrain voicegood looksbut not the hunger            Thats why the NRA presidency is the perfect job for himIts a ceremonial position a grand title with few responsibilities attachedHe will not actually run the NRA His job is to give speeches to be a symbolto act presidential And theres no one who acts presidential better thanCharlton Heston                           If youmissed Hestons NRA
