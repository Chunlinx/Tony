                                  Geek Love            Linux will change theworld Linux will do my homework my dishes my laundry The hype reminds me ofsimilar hype a couple of years ago about Java which never did floss my teethBut setting out to demystify Linux I fell in love Geek love I hasten toadd Its not for everyone            Unlike Windows andIBMs OS and Apples MacOS Linux was written by a person not a facelessmonolith like the company I work for This person was Linus Torvalds Linux isalso different because it is based on the founding principles and software ofthe Free Software Foundation whose name describes its mission Linux isderived from an operating system developed by FSF called GNU The proper namefor Linux is GNULinux GNU is a variation on the Unix operating system and theacronym GNU standsdisconcertinglyfor  GNUs not Unix Are you still withme            The FSF crew preaches that all software should be OpenSource by which they mean that any user should be able to view and change theunderlying code be it for the operating system or for applicationsMicrosoft Apple and other companies consider their code top secret Opensourcers also advocate free distribution of software To the FSF the issues offree software are at the very foundation of creating a cooperative society Iam a wee bit skeptical I enjoy getting paid to write software and I suspectthat many if not most Linux enthusiasts are being paid by someone to writesoftware Its nice that they can play with Linux for free but if all softwarewere free how would they eat            When pushed the FreeSoftware Foundation defines free as a matter of liberty not of price Manypeople pay for GNULinux but the underlying mechanics are freely available toanyone who wants them Companies that sell Linux offer the support andmaintenance that people have come to expectand charge for them            But software development religions aside what is anoperating system like Linux doing As the name suggests it controls thefundamental operation of your computer things like how to read documents froma disk and send them to a printer As you may have heard the demarcation ofwhat is and isnt in the operating system can be a touchy question Somecompanies maintain that an operating system contains any goddamn thing theywant to put in it thank you very much Other folks say that an operatingsystem is just the core functionality or in computer parlance the kernelnecessary to run the chips in your machine            Linux is definitely thesecond model When you turn on a computer using Linux you get no bellswhistles or windows You just see some lines of text and then a blinkingcursor So are we just back to DOS Well no You can add a graphical interfaceknown as Xwindows which looks amazingly like Windows complete with a Startbutton Once you start Xwindows youre back in familiar territory You can useyour mouse to open documents and applications such as WordPerfect I even rana Web browser A big practical disadvantage of Linux is that there isnt muchapplication software for it But thats because so few people use it Itwouldnt be fair to count this as a negative in weighing Linuxs intrinsicmerits And so of course I wont            To begin my experiment I had to get a machine runningLinux So I started searching the Web for information After getting lost on afew Web sites I completely wimped out and went to Barnes  Noble Thesoftware may be free but theres big money in books on how to use it I made ascientific decision based on weight and purchased Red Hat Linux Secretsfor  which included Red Hat softwares  version of Linux on aCDROM            Back at the office I didthe hard stuff I hijacked a Pentium  with  megs of memory andrepartitioned its hard drive into two parts Repartitioned is a fancy way ofsaying divided Thus instead of one big hard drive I now have two littleones using the same physical disk Linux has a utility program that helped medo this because it knows youre going to want to keep running Windows too Itdid involve some complicated thinking about disk cylinders but it worked            I then fruitlessly tried to get Linux to boot up First Itried to get it to load directly from the CD that came with the book Then Ispent another hour trying to get the Linux boot disk I had created toacknowledge the existence of the CD drive Finally I copied the entire CD ontomy hard drive and started the install process I had to create two more floppyboot disks            I had to repartition mydrive again within Linux to create swap space for the operating system forthose keeping track I now have three partitions on my hard drive I had toformat both drives I then had to remember where on my hard drive I had put theinstall files Then it got started Linux found my various devices such as mymouse and graphics card It configured both relatively painlessly It wasntcomplete plug and pray I still had to select my items from lists and it wasgood that I generally knew what types of hardware I was running but it workedFinally I got a blinking cursor at the Linux prompt I then launched XwindowsTo complete the setup I got the browser configured and read                  Slate                After installing Corels WordPerfect I was even able towrite this column on Linux in Linux Lexicographical curiosity The word Linuxis in the WordPerfect spellcheck dictionary but not in Microsoft Words            After spending a day with Linux I concluded that it runsgreat It helped that I know Unix but the system does work I have basic Webbrowsing capabilities and a word processor I also configured and set up theWeb server so I could in theory power all of                   Slate                off thismachine In fact Linux is definitely cool as a server But if you want toreplace your desktop machine forget it            What makes Linuxenthralling from a techheads point of view is that it is based on Unixstandards that have been around for decades Companies from ATT to SunMicrosystems to Apple to IBM to Silicon Graphics have produced varieties ofUnix for their business customers While these varieties are generallyincompatible with one another all this codewriting has resulted in afarflung community that understands the Unix beast Linux developers stand onthe shoulders of these giants thus Linux has a lot of intrinsic testing behindit That makes it what techies call robust meaning resistant to breakingdown Enthusiasts claim that Linux can run for years without requiring you torestart your system On my machine I can claim only a week of running withoutrestarting but that is pretty darn good It also has a solid multithreadingand multitasking model meaning that one errant program cant bring the wholecomputer to its knees This is a feature Linux shares with Windows NT but notwith Windows             In terms of performance Linux ran about as quickly asWindows  though much faster than Windows NT Server on my lowend Pentiummachine For a completely unscientific example there was little difference inbasic file operations such as copying and pasting and WordPerfect ran just asfast as it did on a comparable Windows machine            Should you switch toLinux In my opinion if you are a typical computer user there is no practicalreason to do so The best reason is psychological Linux is a workablealternative to Windows and thus it allows you to vote with your PC If youhate Microsoft you can use Linux It has all the basics necessary to get youthrough your computing life if you are willing to ignore some rough edges hereand there For instance you wont have much trouble importing data from wordprocessing and spreadsheet files But if you crave a huge variety of softwareapplicationgames personal information managers graphics programs financialsoftware reference worksyoud be better off buying a Mac or a Windows PCSome experts predict that the dawning of the Web means that your operatingsystem may be less and less important anyway Many of you have used Linux anddont even know it because many of the Web sites you frequent to check theweather or buy airplane tickets are powered by Linux            Now I must confess my doubts about the Open Sourcemovement Do all those software developers writing open source code for Linuxhave the incentive to fix problems as they arise andmore importantto helppeople upgrade and keep old code running Perhaps the greatest technologicalfeature that Windows possesses is that it can handle programs as old as thefirst DOS applications Linux will never do that            Some critics say thatLinux will fracture into a dozen different incompatible versions just as Unixdid Linux champions insists that the community will prevent such a Tower ofBabel disaster I suspect that a schism will eventually divide the happy Linuxcommunity as equally creative innovators disagree on the operating systemsfuture            Furthermore as in                   Slate                software companiesspend a surprising fraction of their resources testing software not writingit In my experience this is the ultimate problem with Open Sourcedevelopment not enough formal engaged testing Developers want to write codethey dont want to solve all the niggling little problems that users come upwith            But if the thought of a free operating system is soexciting that youre willing to pay  and invest hours for the privilegeby all means give Linux a try
