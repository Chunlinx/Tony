                                 Buy This Ad Agency            Nike announces its slashing million from its marketing budget and plans to reevaluate all its adcampaigns over the next six months Ad agency Wells BDDP which came up withthe legendary I Cant Believe I Ate the Whole Thing campaign for AlkaSeltzerand convinced Braniff Airways to paint its planes a fluorescent fuchsia goesout of business after losing  million accounts at BristolMyers and Procter Gamble Levis puts its account up for review after a year of decliningsales even though its current awardwinning ad campaign is simply some of thebest television on television And Budweiser announces that real people aregoing to start appearing in its ads again though thankfully the lizards andfrogs will not disappear entirely            In otherwords its been a typical couple of weeks in the advertising industry of thes            Actually its tempting to say that the state of perpetualturmoil that characterizes advertising today has characterized the industrysince the modern era of advertising began sometime in the early s Afterall the underlying theme of just about everything honest written about the adgame is fearfear that your creative powers are going to dry up all of asudden fear that youll be stuck doing handcream ads the rest of your lifeand fear that the client will pull the account In Frederic Wakemans novel The Hucksters  the hero played by Clark Gable in the filmversion is a toughguy creative whiz who gives up on advertising as soon as herealizes that hes genuinely afraid of losing the big soap account And in thes legendary s adman Jerry Della Femina wrote simply Most account guyslive with fear in their hearts So it may be a mistake to think thatadvertising in the s is more chaotic and stressful than its ever been            On theother hand it may not be a mistake For while the peculiar way advertisingagencies do businessany client is allowed to fire an agency with just days noticehas not changed in the last  years the willingness of clientsto take their business elsewhere has Even in the late s the averagebusiness stuck with its ad agency for nine years Today the length of tenurehas shrunk dramatically and even longterm clients feel free to put theiraccounts into review which essentially requires their current ad agency tocompete against a host of newcomers Its like an actor being forced toaudition over and over again in order to keep a part            In just the last two years Kodak Miller LiteUnited Airlines McDonalds Apple Computer BristolMyers PG Hertz andToys R Us as well as a host of others have switched agencies At the sametime companies have started dividing up their advertising budgets Instead ofa single agency offering souptonuts services one will do the media buyingand another will do the creative The creative budget is often parceled out aswell Wieden  Kennedy for instance handles Nikes shoe advertising andhas given us the genuinely terrific I Can campaign that Nike is now thinkingof killing But Goodby Silverstein  Partners handles Nikes apparel andwomens sports advertising and has given us the FIT campaign with endlessshots of the skin of athletes such as Michael Johnson and Gabrielle Reece Bigclients in other words are not necessarily as big as they once were            In some ways this probablyisnt a bad thing though youd have a hard time convincing most ad execs ofthat The reason advertising is governed by fear after all is that mostagencies rely on just a few clients to bring in the lions share of theirrevenues If General Motors knew that onetenth of its sales and oneeighth ofits profits came from two companies you can bet GM would be constantly worriedabout keeping those two companies happy Insofar as fragmented budgets makeeach individual client less important to an agencys overall financial healththen its better for the agency though it does mean that more energy has togo into finding new business            Thatsearch is needless to say a difficult one at a time when there are literallythousands of ad agencies in the United States alone and more importantly whenthe creative differences between agencies have narrowed considerably Perhapsthe most curious thing about advertising today in fact is that agencies thatspend all their time helping companies build strong brand names and distinctcorporate identities have a very difficult time building brand names forthemselves            This wasnt always the case To take only the most famousexample when Doyle Dane Bernbach came up with its brilliant ads for Volkswagenin the early s no other agency would have made those ads An Ogilvy Mather ad looked one way usually a very boring and uptight way and a DDB ora Mary Wells ad looked another And this was arguably true even through thes TBWA ChiatDay and Wieden  Kennedy certainly exaggerated theirradicalism as advertising people are wont to do but the  Apple adand the original Just Do It ads for Nike did look qualitatively differentfrom what had come before            Today itsfar harder to tell agencies apart Look at the I Can campaign the Reebok adsfor Kobe Bryant and the Surrealistic Levis ads The same people could havemade them More troubling from the perspective of the advertisers themselvesWatch a sneaker ad with the sound off It will be next to impossible to discernwhich companys shoes are being pushed Advertising in that sense is feelingthe impact of commoditization just as other industries are But where companiesin other industries can resist commoditization through technologicalbreakthroughs better assembly lines andironicallypowerful branding adagencies seem at a bit of a loss            What wed all like to believe of course isthat an advertising agency is ideally placed to resist commoditization becauseits main asset is the imagination of its staff something that cannot beduplicated As one hopeful exec told Advertising Age recentlyCreativity is the anticommodity But while creativity may exist it doesntnecessarily exist over and over again And at a time when ad people all seem tobe drawing from the same palette of colors and styles creativity anddistinctiveness are oddly enough not synonymous            In a sense the advertisingindustry is reluctantly moving toward a business model much closer to thesocalled freeagent economy than to the traditional idea of a corporation Asadvertising budgets become more fragmented its easy to imagine a situation inwhich ad agencies serve primarily to orchestrate production teams bringing inart directors and copywriters for specific ad campaigns rather than keeping awhole staff on hand When agencies lose major accounts they often fire nearlyeveryone involved with the account How much longer can it be before agenciesdecide that operating on a freelance basis is simply more efficient            What keeps the older modelintact in part is the importance of relationships to the businessAdvertising is still a world where gladhanding and drinking with clients isimportant to keeping their accounts But the studio system in Hollywooddisappeared while studio execs remained important as deal makers and the samecould happen in advertising As clients grow increasingly less committed totheir ad agencies the economics of the business will have to change In hisimmensely tiresome memoir Confessions of an Advertising Man  DavidOgilvy wrote If you can make yourself indispensable to a client you willnever be fired No doubt But for the ad agencies indispensability turned outto be a hard sell
