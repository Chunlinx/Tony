                                 Sorry Excuse            Bill Clinton has beenroundly denounced for his apology tour of Africa House Majority Whip RepTom DeLay RTexas implied the presidents expressions of regret about slaverywere almost treasonous Heres a flower child with gray hairs doing exactlywhat he did back in the s Hes apologizing for the actions of the UnitedStates  It just offends me that the president of the United States isdirectly or indirectly attacking his own country in a foreign land PatBuchanan wrote that Clinton had groveled in Africa Robert Novak called theapology for slavery ridiculous Others have charged that the presidentscontrition regarding the US failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda in  wascheap and hypocritical since it was a considered decision not as he impliedsome kind of oversight and there is no reason to suppose the United Stateswill decide differently if it happens again            Fairpoints Not really Once again loathing for Clinton is making it hard forpeople to see straight These objections conflate complaints about thispresidents personal shortcomings with the question of how any president shouldrepresent the United States abroad Ought Clinton have gone to Africa andsimply not mentioned slavery Should he have noted it but offered no view Canany world leader travel to Rwanda in  and not discuss genocide To do sowould be heartless and insulting Its hard to believe that even a primitivesuch as DeLay thinks the president should play emperor never explaining orapologizing for his countrys actions Then again that was George Bushsposition I will never apologize for the United States of America I dontcare what the facts are he said during the  campaign after a UScruiser had mistakenly shot down an Iranian plane killing  civilians            Its not just Clintons sympathetic promiscuity thataccounts for the recent boom in the atonement Apologies for national failingsboth domestic and foreign are in fashion not just in the United States butalso in Britain Japan and elsewhere One reason is that honesty has becomeless costly since the end of the Cold War The Soviet Union no longer has anenormous propaganda apparatus trained against us Now the nations of the Westcan admit wrongdoing without the fear that they are giving ammunition to theenemies of freedom            But whenare national apologies sensible Offered casually or indiscriminately they canlook like sops to constituencies rather than expressions of genuine regret Nonation should want to turn into David Brock I dont think Clinton has reachedthe point where saying hes sorry is an empty gesture but he may be flirtingwith it Two of his apologies in Africa meet the test A third one doesnt            The best case for apology is a great andindisputable national misdeed Ronald Reagans apology to World War IIeraJapanese internees falls into this category as does the Vaticans apology tovictims of the Holocaust So also do Clintons comments in Uganda aboutslavery The objectionsthat Africans too dealt in slaves that slaves camefrom West Africa not Uganda that American blacks not Africans deserve theapologyare nitpicking Heres what Clinton actually said Going back to thetime before we were even a nation European Americans received the fruits ofthe slave trade And we were wrong in that To say that white Americanswrongly benefited from the slave trade doesnt imply that white Americans wereexclusively responsible            On theother hand an apology can be justified without being required or evendesirable Clinton has decided for a variety of reasons that a domesticapology for slavery isnt a good idea This does not require him to observe ataboo on the topic abroad            Somewhat more troubling was Clintons apology for notintervening to prevent the Rwandan genocide Heres what he said            The internationalcommunity together with nations in Africa must bear its share ofresponsibility for this tragedy as well We did not act quickly enough afterthe killing began We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safehavens for the killers We did not immediately call these crimes by theirrightful name genocide We cannot change the past But we can and must doeverything in our power to help you build a future without fear and full ofhope  We owe to all the people in the world our best efforts to organizeourselves so that we can maximize the chances of preventing these events Andwhere they cannot be prevented we can move more quickly to minimize thehorror            Thisapology seems insincere because Clinton did not offer any realistic sense ofthe obstacles to humanitarian military action involving the United States Atfirst Clinton may have wished at some level to intervene in Rwanda Bosniaand Haiti But for practical and political reasons he determined interventionwas possible only in Haiti then later in Bosnia This was after the debacle inSomalia remember and at a time when his popularity was at low ebb Clintonsjudgment that he was in no position to send troops to Rwanda may not have beencourageous It may not even have been correct But like a decision not to risksaving someone from a burning building it is not morally culpable            So why apologize I would defend Clintonsapology as a statement of aspiration He delineates specific actions that hemight plausibly have taken short of sending in the Marines And there is reasonto think that with more political capital no reelection looming and aheightened sense of horror he would behave differently            What acountry should not apologize for is a basically sound foreign policy AndClinton unfortunately did that as wellthough it drew less attention than hisother comments In his Uganda speech before the part about slavery Clintonsaid            In ourown time during the Cold War when we were so concerned about being incompetition with the Soviet Union very often we dealt with countries in Africaand in other parts of the world based more on how they stood in the strugglebetween the United States and the Soviet Union than how they stood in thestruggle for their own peoples aspirations to live up to the fullest of theirGodgiven abilities            The president speaks here as if the battle againstcommunism were an overheated World Cup match rather than itself a struggle fordemocracy and human rights Even when Realpolitik led the United Statesto side with dictators and oppressors it was in the service of maximizingdemocracy and human rights in the world at largea goal we in fact achievedEvery Cold War decision to put US interests ahead of peoples aspirationsin individual countries may not be defensible but the general policy is one weneednt apologize for And by the way the Cold War did not always defineAmerican policy in Africa Well before the fall of communism Congress passedcomprehensive sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa We didthis even though the white South African government was a staunch US ally inthe Cold War while Nelson Mandelas African National Congress had extensiveCommunist and Soviet ties            As it happens that subjectcame up during Clintons stop in South Africa when Mandela publicly refused toapologize for the ANCs Realpolitik alliances It is debatable whetherfriendships with Libya and Cuba actually serve South Africas interests todayBut Mandela is right not to apologize for having accepted help from variousmalefactors including the Soviet Union during the liberation strugglewhenactual support from the United States came very late Like the US in the ColdWar the ANC made reasonable choices under circumstances in which moral puritywasnt an option
