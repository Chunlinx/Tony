        okay so what do you think   well i believe in capital punishment um and i i think the way that i understand the laws right now they are only for certain crimes um im not sure exactly what they are i think rape and uh   uhhuh   capital murder   yeah         the person gets killed you know   oh yeah that would be a capital crime yeah   yeah something like that but my problem with capital murder capital punishment is they dont carry it out   yeah i agree they   so if theyre going to have it to me they ought to do it   i agree they uh   you know they people people been sitting like they had on  or  Hours one of them they had them on the man was twenty years waiting on death row   uhhuh   see that dont make no sense   yeah i think that we waste a lot of money keeping people in prison   yeah   that uh is not necessary   and now i think they ought to increase it to all these drug dealers   yeah have you ever been on a jury     huhuh   i havent either but and i you know i i have real strong beliefs in capital punishment but when it comes right down to it yeah i im wondering though   theyre not going to do it thats my biggest problem is even if you give them the death penalty they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it and theres you know   right but what if theyre not guilty     huh   what if theyre not guilty   what do you mean what have been   what if they truly are not guilty and theyre convicted anyway   thats the whole system though isnt it   yeah see thats what   there are a lot of people that arent guilty thats in jail   yeah   but you know uh i i i dont know about if you if they was like capital murder and then if they were married then what would you do   yeah i dont know you know like i said said i do believe in capital punishment but if i were sitting on a jury and had to make the decision  i wouldnt want to have to be the one to make it   yeah   and i do agree that they keep people that we spend too much money keeping people in prison the jails are overcrowded if theyre going to do well you know lets do it   uhhuh   do it and get it over with   i dont know if i could i could probably it depends on the crime my problem would be that like people to me the like the child people the people thats killing kids   uhhuh   uh the ones messing with old people   yeah   those type of people now i i have no pity for them   yeah   you know but just like if a man and wife is fighting and he kills her that he shouldnt die because it might been accident or you never know what you know what what they done went through together should i say   yeah but i dont know if they if  they if uh the death penalty     i dont think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway   yeah yeah i dont think they give it to just   i think they just put them in jail and let them think about it   yeah  for a long time   so i dont know   uh i definitely think anyone that kills somebody should be in jail i dont think everybody that kills somebody should die   yes die because it all depends   so under the circumstances   theres a lot of circumstance sometimes i even feel like and up in another state i think it was Ohio where they dont have uh selfdefense laws and i think thats wrong   is it i im from ive lived in Ohio and i didnt realize that   yeah they had them on the news this lady her husband she was seven ill never forget it because she was seven months pregnant and he hit her in the stomach and then tried to cut her throat   um oh my gosh   well she shot him and she went to prison she you know she killed him but she lost her baby and then they sent her to jail so thats not right   um huhuh   they shes nothing should have happened to her at all he shouldnt have hit her in the stomach i dont care   well see he shouldnt have been trying to slit her throat anyway     but he did both   yeah well i wonder why did they say why   well he was he he she was abused woman he was he was a a what do you call it abuser he would he would beat his wife all the time   oh so there was a history of that   oh yeah   so shes not going to get to have her baby   she no she lost the baby   oh okay   he hit her in the stomach with the shovel   oh   its just you know things like that that you know i dont think those women or even a man because a man they had a woman man that his wife shot him but he didnt die   uhhuh   and uh they put her in jail now i dont think anything should happen to him but i think she should stay in there because really she just did it because she wanted to get out the marriage and she wanted all his property   uhhuh   see i think thats wrong too but i dont   cheaper than a divorce   no she she wouldnt have got no property see there was no grounds for divorce she was she wanted out cause she had a boyfriend and it was weird but uh the capital punishment i dont know actually what they give the death penalty for   yeah um   the only thing i i know they give it for is shooting a killing a cop or you know assassination of the President and and something big you know   yeah i think capital crimes uh capital crimes and i want to say kidnap i dont know why kidnapping sticks in my mind but um   uhhuh i dont know   yeah i think they should give it to them but i dont think they should keep them waiting in jail and let having us pay for it for twenty years   no if they going to give it to them i think they should go ahead you know okay maybe a year or you know like that two years whatever but twenty years ten years on death to me thats worse for them too   yeah   theyre not they dont know when they going to die they know they got the death penalty but that dont mean nothing not anymore   well i i assume that you live in do you live in Texas     uhhuh   i think Texas is very uh one of the leading states i mean i think Texas executes more people than just about any other state     i dont know they dont they dont put it on the news or they dont broadcast it because you know the i guess they dont just dont   well they they they they dont sensationalize it anymore they used to make a big deal out of it every time it happened   uhhuh oh yeah all the people for right uh life or something   and i think now that it happens more frequently than we know that its just not sensationalized as much at least in Texas because i hear every once in a while ill hear something on the news   yeah yeah   i   but i think they going to have to do something to make people wake up like on especially the drug dealers you know the the not the little penny ante ones on the corner i dont think they ought to get in trouble i mean i know they ought to get in trouble im not  they ought to get in trouble but not not death because see they you know were to me what they ought to do if they can find the big man   but they ought to get yeah i was   because see thats where its coming from to me it its coming in here some kind of way i dont care what anybody tells me people tell me i said if the government really want to i think its all government something to do with the government i really do   they   because if you can stop uh Cuban cigars from coming you cant buy anything Cuban in the United States so why cant they stop anything illegal   yeah hum   you know if they really wanted to i think they could they just dont want to put theres too much money peoples been bought out you know and thats whats wrong with some of the kids on the street   yeah     they you cant blame just like the man says he can make two five hundred dollars a day for just taking a bag somewhere   uhhuh     and his mom is not getting that much money   hum   you know if you think you think about all the kids in the ghetto my mom would probably kill us but       but uh you know its something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think thats the whole thing theyre not scared they know theyre not going anywhere   yeah well yeah i mean when when you think about it yeah when you think about how many people die from drugs you know ultimately     uhhuh innocent people not just the drug people im talking about innocent people when they have they little drive by shootings and and and see because im from Los Angeles   oh yeah um   see originally ive been in Texas twelve thirteen years but originally in LA they people die all the time just from being in the way at the wrong place you know see you know but i think something should be done for them   yeah um yeah   so   i agree   but i dont know too much about the death penalty   i think that that they have much i like that theyve changed it to lethal injection rather than you know the electric chair or gas   yeah but they dont use that no more   no they dont   they use the the injection thing or whatever it is   yeah i think thats a lot more humane than uh than the electric chair than the than the gas or the gas     uhhuh its funny because i had listened to a comedian talk about the death penalty you know about people saying they they dont have nobody to do this and i said well if somebody killed my husband just because ill pull the switch ill even do you know to me if if that person can forgive them fine but what is that man going to do next is he going to go out and kill somebody else   kill  right   you know how many times is it going to take for this man to kill people before you kill him   yeah   now you know sometimes i can understand maybe if they robbed something they didnt mean to do it okay but how many times you going to go by that how many times you going to this person keep killing so i dont know   uhhuh yeah   i guess if you stay out of trouble you dont have you worry about it but     well its like you said though sometimes people just get caught up in it innocently but   uhhuh so i think it just i think it depends on the circumstances and how many times that person has been in trouble i mean really big trouble   yeah yeah   you know so   yeah     but thats all i got to say   okay   and it is nice talking to you all righty   well its nice talking to you ill have to start doing this again some more  i i dont know what ive tried it several times with   oh its fun i call
