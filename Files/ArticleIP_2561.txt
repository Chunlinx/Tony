                                 Herb Steins Unfamiliar Quotations                         By HerbertStein                            words postedThursday May  to be composted Thursday May                         I love tobrowse through Bartletts Familiar Quotations  It may be lazy of me butI like to taste the plums of many authors whose full puddings I cannot digestFor example I cannot make anything of TS Eliot in his entirety But I knowthat I am in the presence of genius when I read the following lines from TheWasteland                            O the moon shone bright onMrs Porter                                       And on herdaughter                                       Theywash their feet in soda water                        Of course some of thesenuggets are ambiguous Thus we have Swedish Count Axel Oxenstierna writing inthe  th century Behold my son with how little wisdom the worldis governed For a long time I thought that this was a complaint that theworld is not governed with more wisdom Recently I have come to think it meansthat not much wisdom is required to govern the world            Asrecompensesmall though it befor the pleasure I have got from Bartlett I amsetting down a few quotations with explanations where necessary that haveresonated with me and are not included in that book                                        If youmeet a madman who says that he is a fish and that we are all fishes do youtake off your clothes to show him that you do not have fins                        Milan KunderaRisibles Amours              I love this in part because Iam proud that I translated it from the French which in turn was translatedfrom the Czech But I love it even more because it has saved me so muchtrouble In the past when I encountered some outlandish inanityoften abouttaxesI would sit down at my keyboard and write an answer I am still temptedto do that but since I encountered that quotation I have resisted            You mayask How will I know if he is a madman The answer is Dont worry youllknow And if you are in doubt assume he is mad and leave the refutation toothers You have plenty to do in the world without having to worry aboutdebating people who may be mad                                        Neverwaste any time you can spend sleeping             Professor Frank HKnight in class at the University of Chicago             Clearenough aside from these questions What qualifies as wasting time and whatshould you do if you cant sleep I recently encountered a somewhat differentquotation from the poet Baudelaire                           To kill that particularmonster time is the most ordinary and legitimate occupation of eachperson                        It isinteresting that Knight should have used the word waste which is thegangland term for kill Perhaps the reconciliation here is that sleep is thebest way of killing time                                        Honestymay not be the best policy but it is worth trying once in a while             Richard Nixon in ameeting             This may seem the ultimatein cynicism but the second half of the quotation about trying honesty once ina while seems foreign to many politicians among others                                        Surelythere is something unlovely to modern as against medieval minds about markedinequality of either kind income or power            Henry C SimonsEconomic Policy for a Free Society              Whatfascinates me about this sentence is the word unlovely It is a candiddeclaration that feelings on this subject are feelings not matters ofefficiency or justice but matters of taste of aesthetics of emotions                                        There isa great deal of ruin in a nation                        Adam Smith in a letterto a friend who after the battle of Saratoga was lamenting that the revolt ofthe colonies was going to ruin Britain late  th century            This is acomfort when one is listening to politicians or editorialists describing theruin that will follow if their pet policies are not adopted                                        Ifsomething cannot go on forever it will stop             Steins Law firstpronounced in the s            This proposition arisingfirst in a discussion of the balanceofpayments deficit is a response tothose who think that if something cannot go on forever steps must be taken tostop iteven to stop it at once                                        If aplank creaks in the floor he Ernesto IV snatches up his pistols andimagines that there is a liberal
