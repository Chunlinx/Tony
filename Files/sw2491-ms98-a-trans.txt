           we built our home in what was a brand new subdivision in nineteen sixty five and we were the fourth lot in this subdivision to be built on   umhum   uh finally just last year the last home of the last lot was sold and the home a home was built on it so the subdivision is now full but were in a community of five thousand people   oh thats pretty nice i did mine i built my own home in nineteen sixty one   oh   thats pretty much about the same time and i i built on two acres of land in a town called Cumberland Rhode Island   yes umhum   and it was its uh its just a private uh piece of property i mean theres no you know theres no other well theres other houses in the area but at that time there were just individual homes scattered throughout   umhum   the town and i guess the town of Cumberlands probably got thirty five thousand people in it or so   umhum   which is right on on the Massachusetts Rhode Island state line thats thats why i work in Massachusetts its only its only a twenty minute ride   umhum   and uh i did the whole house myself as a matter of fact i had the foundation poured the concrete poured and the rest of all the building i did entirely on my own which was quite a project uh i dont   umhum would you do it again  oh i see well we wouldnt have done it the first time so   no  no i i i dont think so uh i i would i would probably i would act as a contractor and subcontract everything out i think   umhum   i but i would not physically do the work because i worked every night after after working all day in the in the plant and then weekends all your weekends were tied up and it took me about oh a little over seven months to finish it which i thought was pretty good   did you finish it   yes i i completely finished the house   so you do not have any place that has a mop board off or a a piece uh we have a friend who uh rents rents homes redoes homes and rents them   no uhhuh   and he never quite has finished any one of the houses that hes done i mean theres always just one little detail that   well i i had uh when i moved in i did not have my garage built and my breezeway and the concrete stairs upstairs the stairs the stairs were were made out of wood and the reason i did that it was getting late in November and the winter was coming   umhum   and i just i ran out of time really and i i waited until the house was completely finished in the interior and the exterior exterior of the house short of the breezeway and the and the attached garage   umhum umhum   and i did that and the driveway the following spring which uh i needed a break from the work and i i needed a break to get a little more money ahead stuff like that so i waited   sure   oh probably November December until March or April i guess around April and then i went ahead and built the breezeway and the garage because i thought it was too cold to be pouring concrete outside in the winter time   umhum umhum did do you find that uh the area has changed since you built your home or has or has the area mainly it are the rest of the homes in keeping with the decor or in the style of yours   uh sure yeah they they that area has managed to maintain itself very well the people are   umhum   real proud of their homes and theyve managed to take care of them   umhum   but i noticed now that several of the homes where the elderly folks that live there have either gone on or or moved or whatever   umhum   and their children are now living there okay   umhum   and they just dont team seem to tend as much to them as their parents did does that make sense   umhum well its a little bit surprising because uh the older we get my husband retired a little over a year ago and   umhum   we still of course are maintaining our home and he keeps up the painting and and all of this and we did remodel we have a large uh den i suppose it is kitchen den combination and we did remodel that after   oh i yeah yeah ive done the i   after uh he retired but as far as doing anything uh major to it we at this point would rather travel and i uh   ive done the same i did the same thing but what im saying is that some of the people that i know they have moved on to Florida or retired you know similar to your you know your situation   umhum umhum   but their homes have passed on to their uh children or or to younger younger families and they dont seem to maintain it as well as the original people did i or or like you would or i would and perhaps its just its   right oh yeah umhum   you know some of them homes were given to them and some of them the young people had to buy and perhaps they dont have the money to spend on them   yes somehow we dont think of a gift as being quite as dear to us as something that weve had to work for i mean   yeah yeah i think youre right i think youre right   uh we i i look at our home though and i think well gosh you know if we dont do this then the next person who owns this home for instance is going to probably remodel the kitchen put in new cabinets that kind of thing you know after oh twenty six years uh things get a little scuffed up and its not something that im not interested in the mess anymore   sure sure yeah   uh the style of our neighborhood uh were certainly not the smallest home and were not the largest home but it has maintained itself in that the homes that were built afterwards uh have come up some of them are a little smaller because at one point they wanted to put some two thirty five housing in   what is what is two thirty five housing im not familiar with that term here in Rhode Island   well it it its a law it was quite some time ago when the neighborhood was very new and we had some very very restrictive covenants uh in the subdivision and they were attempting to put seven houses in an area that was originally set aside for five   oh okay   and i think the two thirty five came because they could people could get into them for a down payment of something like two hundred and thirty five dollars   i see   and of course we were involved with an attorney and were able to stop that before it got off the ground and so the some of the homes on that side of the street are a little bit smaller but they were   umhum i built a i built a three bedroom Colonial home with one and a half baths up and down   uhhuh   and a and an attached two car garage and a breezeway and it was a its a pretty substantial home i   yeah uhhuh   i i i like the roominess of it uh and and i actually the only thing ive done other than you know wallpaper and painting paint over the years in the in the interior is i did refinish all the kitchen cabinets and i put a kitchen in the basement   uhhuh um umhum   which was probably the best move i ever did   umhum   okay and uh   we have a rock base here and its very difficult   excuse me Verna for just a second can you hang on just a second okay   sure   okay theres your report okay and thats everything would would you give this to Barbara Rashad for me please would you carry that over okay if you want to hang on a minute you got a minute okay hang on a minute and ill ill uh finish up with this lady  yes maam   we have a rock base here and its very difficult to put in a basement our home is all brick and with the two   yeah are you are you on a flat on a slab like   no no were build   you do you have a basement   no we do not have a basement because we would had to have built up instead of down because uh theres the rock is so close to the surface here that its difficult to to do basements so we didnt do that but um   i see okay   we have an attached two car garage and etcetera typical family the family home   well it sounds it sounds it sounds like you have  it sounds like yeah sounds like you have a real nice home and its uh it sounds like what part of Indiana or is is   were uh two miles were between Indianapolis and Chicago on Interstate I sixty five and were just now being found by the north end of the state and getting a lot of   okay   you know there were homes on the market for ten years that sold in the last year because theres a lot of people coming down from   is your real estate market uh slowed down there like it is here in the northeast   it just it just went crazy this last year everything sold absolutely everything i mean we had someone come knock on our door the other day and offer us a price which i thought was absolutely ridiculous for our home the problem is theres nothing else to buy   it did is that right you know well if you sell it for that sure if you sell it for that price whatever you have to buy is going to be inflated by that same amount so theres really not an advantage to it   that yeah well and our children are all here and we want to stay here so   sure   we have no reason to sell so nice talking with you sounds like youre busy   well okay Verna yeah well im in my office and i have someone here with me and uh its really been a pleasure i enjoyed it and uh if you ever get to New England look me up   thank you byebye   thank you maam
