        okay   so uh what are your camping experiences like   lately they havent been much but as a child i used to go camping a lot with my my parents we would uh we lived in Mississippi then and wed go out and camp for the weekend and fish and   uhhuh   but we camped like in tents not in uh  the mobile home or the   oh yeah you roughed it   right  thats what i consider really camping   basically yeah i the only really camping experiences uh ive had i guess was probably with the Cub Scouts or the Boy Scouts when uh i was younger uh we used i remember one time we went to uh   uhhuh   uh theres a lake called Lake Lanier here in Georgia that we went to and we camped out on the island and we kind of   got familiar with that lake   yeah we setup we set up all our you know we we canoed out to some island and uh that was a lot of fun set up because we were all we were isolated from everyone else but um   uhhuh   thats pretty much i havent been  lately i have ive ive wanted to lately but theres a id like to i need to get some equipment first and i dont really have the money for it now ive ive been looking into like buying uh uh a tent of some sort but theyre really expensive like the good ones   they are uhhuh   so thats kind of put a cramp in my camping style so late lately ive just kind of for outdoorsy type stuff ive pretty much been you know one day trips where ill ill maybe drive up to Alabama somewhere like in a northern Alabama im into rock climbing a little bit so so if one of my roommates has some ropes ropes and stuff and sometimes we go up there and   oh thats neat   climb around on the rocks and stuff but usually its a one day affair its not a overnighter type thing but id like to id like to really get into that kind of thing   yeah well lately about my only halfway experience with camping is we uh my husband races cars   uhhuh   and in fact we come to Atlanta for about ten days every year and and thats part of my camping experience is we camp out there a little bit sleep in our van or  what have you for a few nights and um   oh yeah   yeah   kind of cook out of it and what have you but     the last the last true camping experience i had is when uh i drove across country with a friend of mine he lives he goes to school out in California and we drove his car out there and uh we drove you know we took kind of a scenic route we went through uh uh the Grand Canyon and   oh sounds nice   and uh someone one of us had a tent but not all of us had sleeping bags and it was kind of a it was late summer but it get it got it got really cold at night a lot colder than we thought it would so the sleeping bag was just big enough to   umhum   was just small enough so that it didnt actually cover everyone so it was kind of uh a wrestling match for the  for uh you know warmth so we we we we roughed it until about four in the morning and we were all just freezing so we got up and got in the car and uh drove on we were on a kind of a schedule tight schedule anyway so we couldnt stay too long but we drove on that morning to uh Las Vegas so  i think that was probably my last uh true camping experience   yeah well well whenever i mention camping anymore to my husband he says im too old for this  he says i i like my luxuries anymore but i think id still like to you know do a little camping that       like i say i it brings back memories of my real young years and uh   yeah   he said hed lived on a farm too long and that was too much like camping anyway true camping     well this time of year  its gets really beautiful down the springtime in Georgia with all the dogwoods and   i bet   theres all kinds of its real north theres really some real beautiful spots to to hike and stuff in north Georgia you know up in the kind of getting up the mountainous you know the the   uhhuh well i know when the leaves change there too would be a pretty time except you cant really depend on your weather   yeah it sure is thats true like today its its pouring it it takes the leaves around here i mean its beautiful when they uh when they change it it seems like it happens so fast that if you dont get there at the right time youre gonna miss everything   umhum and the first year we came up there the leaves were changing and since then weve been coming about a week or so too early  but uh i would think that that would be a really nice place for camping   yeah theyre getting theyre getting started early this year ill tell you that much the so the dogwoods are already starting to bloom      have they oh well that is really nice well im sure there are a lot of camping places around here but we get so wrapped up in everyday life we dont get take time to go out and enjoy them um in the spring when the bluebonnets are pretty here i think thats our biggest deal theres just fields of bluebonnets and   umhum thatd be nice   what we call Indian paint brushes its its really nice   i havent been through that part of the country so i dont really know what i dont really know what its like over there   mostly nothing
