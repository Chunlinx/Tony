                                 Jan              Welanded at Charles de Gaulle Airport a couple of days before Christmas One dogone infant nine books on how to get along with the French and  pieces ofluggage three of which had already gone missing We drove for  minutes inheavy traffic the baby howling the wife attempting to hide her exposednursing bosom from the driver and the dog scratching her bottom across thefloor of the minivan At length we arrived at our new home on the Left Bankwhich wed never actually seen except in photographs It was a small clusterof roomsize houses in a tiny garden tucked away at the back of a courtyard ofan old apartment building We piled out of the car and rushed to the frontdoor a small teeming peristaltic bundle of needs and hopes and anticipationsThe door failed to open The key mailed to us by the landlord did not fit thelock            Forthe next  minutes we sat in the cold dark Paris courtyard and waitedmainly because we couldnt think what else to do We were being punished forour sins we had wanted to dance now we were paying the fiddler It had beenfun when people asked us where we lived to say Well thats hard to saysince at the end of the year were moving to Paris They were all envious orpretended to be which was just as gratifying For the past six months we hadbeen playing our new role People Who Are About To Live in Paris  Nowhere we were in Paris itself We knew no one We spoke so little French thatit was better to claim we spoke none We had no purpose And that I shouldhave reminded myself was the point            About months ago my wife Tabitha and I were on an airplane when I began tocomplain about adulthood One of the many things I dislike about being agrownup is the compulsion to have a purpose in life People are forever askingwhy you are doing whatever you happen to be doing and before long you succumbto the need to supply an answer The least naturally ambitious people can haveambition thrust upon them in this way Once youve established yourself as amore or less properly functioning adult it is nearly impossible to just gosomewhere and screw off            Fivemonths pregnant with our first child Tabitha pointed out that the feeling ofbeing weighed down by adulthood wasnt likely to improve anytime soonParenthood loomed There was a time when I suspected this wouldnt have mucheffect on me I figured that the chemical rush that attended new motherhoodmight get me off the hookthat Tabitha would happily embrace all the newunpleasant chores and Id stop in from time to time to offer advice Shed dothe play by play Id do the color commentary Five months into the pregnancythat illusion had been pretty well shattered by the anecdotal evidence Onefriend with a truly amazing gift for getting out of things he did not want todo wrote to describe his own experience of fatherhood Remember that life youthought you had he wrote Guess what Its not yours anymore            At anyrate since a door in our lives seemed to be closing we went looking for awindow As we sat on the plane one thing led to another and before long wehad spread out on our laps the map of the world at the back of the inflightmagazine We had no idea where we would wind up we just knew we were goingsomeplace foreign My vague desire to live in Africa got swapped unfairly Ifelt for my wifes even vaguer one to live in Asia Whole continents vanishedfrom our future in an instant After  minutes we had shrunk the world to twocities Barcelona and Paris A few days later we were at a dinner party Theman across the table an old friend mentioned that his sister had this oldcharming place in Paris occupied by tenants she couldnt stand There it wasOur bluff was being called We agreed to rent the place sight unseen            Now weare in Paris in the cold and the dark homeless and friendless andtonguetied Unbelievably I hear myself asking Why on earth did we come Justthen an elderly woman hobbles into the cobblestone courtyard and makes for thedoor nearest ours Our new French neighbor A distant memory lifts myspirits            Fifteen years ago when I arrived in London to live outside the United Statesfor the first time in my life I was fitting the key into my new front doorwhen an elderly woman called to me from the neighboring garden My name isAmanda Martin she said in an ancient voice and Ill be your friend ifyoull have me Just like that Amanda Martin had taken me into her life Ihad a friend Shed turned  that year The queen had sent her a telegram tocongratulate her When you know someone with that kind of standing in societyyou somehow feel you belong too Assimilation is just another word foracquiring a bit of the local status            I eyeour new old French neighbor with longing And even though I know that themoment history looks as if it is repeating itself is exactly the moment it isnot I feel a little leap in my spirits I walk over open a door for her andsay bonjour  She doesnt even look up just keeps taptapping on by withher head down and right into her apartment As she closes her door the odor ofstove gas wafts into the courtyard A voice behind me says She so old sheforgets to turn off her gas burners when she goes out I turn around Therestands a young man wearing a black stocking cap a navy pea coat and a grimexpression He looks like something dreamed up by Dostoevski yet he soundsperfectly American He motions to the door closing behind the elderly Frenchwoman One day shell come back here light a match and this whole buildingwill be a crater            Heputs his hand in the pocket of his pea coat I have your key he says
