                    Rationale        The volume and diversity of expressed sequence tag EST        data in the public databases makes them an important        resource for gene identification genome annotation and        comparative genomics The value of EST data is enhanced        when the sequences are clustered on the basis of sequence        overlap to reduce redundancy In some cases these sequence        clusters can be used to generate a consensus sequence that        represents a virtual transcript Examples of electronic        transcript data resources include UniGene   TIGR Gene        Indices    DoTS   and STACK   Each of these        resources differs in the methods used to reduce the        redundancy in EST sequence data and in how the data are        represented For example UniGene uses pairwise sequence        comparisons to group and partition EST and other transcript        sequences from GenBank into geneorientated clusters with        no consensus sequence The other three resources TIGR Gene        Indices DoTS and STACK cluster sequences from ESTs and        known transcripts and then assemble the members of each        cluster to produce a consensus representation of the        transcripts The algorithms andor parameters used to guide        the clustering and assembly process for the virtual        transcript resources are similar but not identical These        resources also differ with respect to the number of species        for which EST assemblies are available For example the        STACK database includes only human sequence data DoTS has        both human and mouse assemblies and TIGR Gene Indices        maintains separate electronic transcript databases for over         species In contrast to computational approaches to        transcript analysis and representation the Mammalian Gene        Collection MGC   and the RIKEN Mouse Encyclopedia        projects   are systematically generating fulllength        cDNA clones with the aim of having at least one fulllength        clone reagent and sequence for every human MGC and mouse        MGC RIKEN gene        The Mouse Genome Informatics MGI database          provides integrated access to genetic genomic and        biological data for the laboratory mouse The MGI database        represents an integrated platform to which several related        projects contribute including the Mouse Genome Database        MGD   the Gene Expression Database GXD   the        Mouse Genome Sequence MGS project   the Mouse Tumor        Biology MTB database   and the Gene Ontology GO        project   MGI provides access to gene annotation and        nomenclature mapping nucleotide and protein sequences        mammalian gene homology gene expression phenotypes        allelic variants and mutants and strain data The        information in the MGI database is updated daily by        professional scientific curators who extract relevant data        from the scientific literature and other sources MGI staff        curate associations between genes and nucleotide and        protein sequences in collaboration with other database        groups including SWISSPROT   RIKEN   and the        National Center for Biotechnology Informations LocusLink           Genes in MGI are given unique permanent accession        ids to facilitate stable crossreferences with other        databases even when such information as gene name        functional annotation and so on changes over time          Table shows a summary of some of the MGI database        content        The utility of both experimentally and computationally        derived transcript resources are greatly enhanced when the        transcripts are associated with well curated biological        knowledge about the genes with which the transcripts are        associated   However manual curation of        computationally derived transcript data is not feasible        because the underlying data for these resources are        constantly changing Therefore we have developed a        semiautomated curation process to create and update        associations between constantly changing electronic        transcript databases and the genes represented in the MGI        database Associations are based on GenBank sequence        accession identifiers shared between MGI genes and        transcript clustersassemblies Although associations        between the genes in MGI and the electronic transcripts        could also be made on the basis of sequence similarity the        use of shared accession ids is faster and avoids        inconsistencies in sequencetogene associations that arise        from highly similar sequence among members of multigene        families                    Transitive associations between MGI genes and        assembled transcripts        To establish associations between MGI genes and the        Institute for Genomic Research TIGR mouse gene index        tentative consensus sequence TCs or DoTS mouse transcript        assemblies DTs we used GenBank sequence accession        identifiers GB that are associated with genes in the MGI        database and are also component sequences of transcript        assemblies as bridges All genetotranscript associations        are represented as a set of graphs Figure  Nodes of the        graph are members of a group of interrelated MGI genes and        transcript assemblies and each edge is a group of GenBank        sequence accession identifiers that are shared by the        related MGI gene and the transcript assembly        We first generated a set of GenBank sequence accession        identifiers that have trusted associations that is they        have been manually curated with mouse genes represented in        MGI A daily report of the associations of MGI markers and        GenBank sequences MRKSequencerpt is available from the        MGI public FTP site   We removed sequences associated        with more than one gene object in MGI for example large        cloned inserts containing multiple genes to avoid        confounding multiple genes to sequence associations After        this filtering step the relationships of MGI genes to        GenBank sequences were maintained in a dictionary data        structure MGIGB with MGI accession numbers as keys and        GenBank accession identifiers as values        A second dictionary GBMGI GB as keys and MGI as        values was generated by reversing the keys and values of        MGIGB A report with all DT identifiers and their        constituent GenBank sequences accession identifiers        musDoTSrelaccessionsPerAssemblydatgz file Release          August  was downloaded from CBILs website                 A report containing TIGR Mouse Gene Index TC identifiers        and their constituent GenBank sequence identifiers was        generated from TIGR Mouse Gene Index Release  October          Geo Pertea personal communication This report        was used to create two dictionaries TCGB TC as keys and        GB as values and GBTC GB as keys and TC as values to        map TCs to GenBank sequence accession ids There were many        more GenBank sequences mostly ESTs in the TIGR Mouse Gene        Index than in the MGI database because the TIGR Mouse Gene        Index was built on all available GenBank sequences and MGI        curated only a subset of them mostly mRNA and RefSeq        sequences Only GenBank sequence accession identifiers        that appear in the MGI database were retained in TCGB and        GBTC because those sequences will bridge the transitive        associations between MGI genes and TCs Sequences        associated with more than one TC were removed        Two of the dictionaries described above MGIGB and        GBTC were used to link MGI genes to TCs on the basis of        shared GenBank sequences A dictionary MGITCviaGB MGI        as keys and TC as values was used to maintain the        genetotranscript associations and their supporting        GenBank sequences For each GenBank accession identifier in        MGIGB the related TC identifier in GBTC was retrieved        and added as a value to the MGI accession identifier key        keeping the GenBank accession identifiers as a line of        evidence in support of the link When more than one GenBank        sequence supports the same MGItoTC link all were        attached to the same TC Figure ashows examples of links        from MGI genes to TCs with the supporting GenBank        sequences Of MGI genetic markers with GenBank sequences          out of  of were linked to one or more        TCs in this analysis The majority of MGI markers with no        TC associations have only one GenBank sequence which is        either singleton mRNAEST sequence with no TC accession        number assigned or DNA sequence excluded from building TIGR        Mouse Gene Index Table summarizes the associations        between MGI markers and TIGR Mouse Gene Index TCs        Two other dictionaries TCGB and GBMGI were used to        link TCs to MGI genes in the same way A dictionary        TCMGIviaGB TC as keys and MGI as values was used to        maintain links from TCs to MGI genes and the supporting        GenBank sequences Figure bshows examples of links from        TCs to MGI genes with the supporting GenBank sequences          out of  of TCs excluding singletons        were linked to one or more MGI genes        The same approaches were also used to associate MGI        genetic markers to DoTS DTs A report with all DT        identifiers and their constituent GenBank sequence        accession identifiers was downloaded from CBILs website        Release   August  The        musDoTScontainedIdsdatgz file can be downloaded        from this site   The report lists both DoTS assemblies        excluding singletons and singletons We included only        assemblies in our analysis Statistics of associations of        MGI markers and DTs are shown in Table  The analysis        linked   out of  of MGI markers with        sequence information to   out of  of        DTs It is not surprising that only about  of DTs or TCs        can be associated with genes in MGI because the majority of        the assemblies are composed solely of EST sequences and the        MGI curation processes focus primarily on collecting and        curating associations with genomic and mRNA sequence data        There are a total of  DTs including singletons with        mRNA sequences and  of them have MGI associations        The remaining  DTs with mRNA sequences might represent        alternative transcripts of MGI genes known genes not yet        represented by MGI or novel genes We will evaluate the        component sequences of these DTs and incorporate them into        MGI database over time through manual curation                    Classification of the relationships between MGI genes        and transcript assemblies                  Onetomany associations between genes and          transcripts are related to transcript diversity          The TIGR Mouse Gene Index and DoTS databases are          transcript orientated That is the sequence clustering          and assembly process seeks to generate distinct          assemblies for every form of transcript The MGI database          is genecentric and associates transcripts from the same          locus to a single gene object in the database Therefore          in many cases there are multiple TCsDTs associated with          a single gene in the MGI database The average numbers of          DTsTCs per MGI gene among the onetomany associations          were  and  respectively          Multiple TCsDTs associated with a single MGI gene          often represent alternatively spliced transcripts For          example           Ncam neural cell adhesion          molecule  in the MGI database MGI was          associated with five TCs TC TC TC          TC TC and with five DTs DT          DT DT DT and DT           Ncam is known to exist in three          prominent protein isoforms encoded by at least four          different transcripts generated from alternative splicing            At least eight distinct mRNAs have been identified          by a variety of analyses and  potential transcripts          have been proposed   These onetomany associations          caused by alternative splicing andor alternative          polyA addition sites see below were confirmed by          mapping the TCs or DTs to the mouse genome assembly using          BLAT search at the University of California Santa Cruz          UCSC genome browser   Figure ashows how these          virtual transcripts align to the           Ncam gene on mouse chromosome                    Multiple TCs or DTs could also represent products of          transcription from alternative promoters andor          polyadenylation sites of a single gene For example           Dtna dystrobrevin alpha in the          MGI database MGI was associated with five TCs          TC TC TC TC TC and          with five DTs DT DT DT          DT and DT The           Dtna gene has three promoters that          are active in tissuespecific manner   Figure          bclearly shows multiple transcripts from three promoters          of           Dtna gene on mouse chromosome           Experimental results suggested that           Ncam contains more than one          polyA addition site and produces transcripts with          different  untranslated regions   Figure          ademonstrates that multiple virtual transcripts with          different  ends align the           Ncam gene on mouse chromosome                    Another explanation for onetomany MGI gene to          DTsTCs associations is multiple sitespecific          recombination or DNA rearrangement that occurs normally          in certain cell types For example the           IghVS immunoglobulin heavy          chain S family locus in MGI MGI  was          associated with four TCs TC TC TC          and TC and with three DTs DT          DT and DT All above TCsDTs and          sequences associated with           IghVS were mapped to the same          locus on chromosome  using the UCSC genome browser          data not shown The sequence differences of           IghVS transcripts are readily          explained by normal DNA rearrangements VDJ          recombination   Another example is that           HEb histocompatibility  class          II antigen E beta in the MGI database MGI was          associated with four TCs TC TC TC          and TC and with two DTs DT and          DT The           HEb gene contains a          recombination hotspot which has a predominant role in          generating different recombinants through meiotic          crossingover within the I region of the mouse major          histocompatibility complex MHC   All above TCsDTs          except TC and DT were mapped to annotated           HEb gene on chromosome  using          the UCSC genome browser data not shown TC and          DT were associated to           HEb through one GenBank sequence          AK which was mapped to chromosome  Further          analysis indicated that AK was incorrectly          associated with           HEb           Nonbiological explanations may also explain some of          the onetomany associations among genes and transcripts          in our analysis For example lowquality sequence data          or problematic sequences that are not filtered out before          clustering and assembly can cause errors in the sequence          assemblies Another possible explanation is that          nucleotide and protein sequences are occasionally          associated with the wrong gene in MGI This will always          be a challenge to the database community when both          completeness including as much data as possible in the          database and accuracy associating every sequence to the          right gene are goals Fortunately nonbiological          reasons for onetomany associations between transcripts          and genes only account for a small percentage of the          whole dataset based on our experience of ongoing internal          quality control and manual check of portions of the data          in this analysis                          The manytoone associations between genes and          transcripts are evidence for overclustering or gene          redundancy in MGI          In the analysis reported here   out of           of MGI genes with sequence information were          involved in manytoone gene to TC transcript          associations and   out  in manytoone          gene to DT transcript associations The average numbers          of MGI genes per DTTC were  and  respectively          First some of the manytoone associations are due to          sequence clusters that contain mistakenly grouped similar          sequences from closely related genes paralogs For          example sequences from  members of the          defensinrelated cryptdin gene family were clustered into          one TC TCH and to one DT DT  These          genes share similar structure and sequence Their mRNAs          are distinguished by a nucleotide  untranslated          sequence UTS encoded completely by the first exon            Second genes adjacent to each other in the same          chromosomal location were occasionally clustered together          and assembled into one sequence because their transcripts          overlap each other For example the  end of           Stk serinethreonine kinase           MGI is in very close proximity to the  end of          a functionally unrelated gene dos downstream of           Stk  MGI  and it seems          that overlapping transcripts of the two genes are          produced   Both           Stk and           Dos were linked to one DT          DT because sequences associated with both genes          were clustered and assembled together Third there are          rare cases of polycistronic transcripts in mammalian          genomes For example           Snrpn small nuclear          ribonucleoprotein N MGI  and           Snurf            SNRPN upstream reading frame MGI           are expressed as bicistronic           SnurfSnrpn transcript   and          both of them were associated with one single TC          TC and one single DT DT in our analysis          Finally manytoone associations can be caused by          uncorrected gene redundancy one gene represented by          multiple entries in the MGI database The majority of          the redundant records are the result of genes in MGI that          are represented solely by EST sequences As these          redundancies are identified in MGI they are          corrected                          Manytomany associations between genes and          transcripts could be the result of any combination of          manytoone and onetomany associations          In the analysis reported here we had  MGIDT and           MGITC manytomany associations There were            out of  of MGI genes with sequence          information and  DTs involved in manytomany MGI          gene to DT transcript associations and   out           of MGI genes with sequence information and           TCs in manytomany MGI gene to TC transcript          associations The average numbers of MGI genes per DTTC          were  and  respectively and the average numbers          of DTsTCs per MGI gene were  and  respectively          The majority of the manytomany associations had only          two MGI genes and two DTsTCs The group with the largest          number of MGI genes in MGIDT associations included eight          pairedIglike receptor A genes            Pira Pira Pira Pira Pira          Pira Pira Pira  and two DTs DT and          DT  DNA blot analysis indicated the presence          of multiple pairedIglike receptor A genes in the          genome and cDNA sequencing analysis suggested           frequency of overall nucleotide variations   The          group with the largest number of MGI genes in MGITC          associations included six eosinophilassociated          ribonuclease            Ear Ear Ear Ear Ear and           Ear  and RNA guanylyltransferase          and phosphatase            Rngtt  and four TCs TC          TC TC and TC The mouse Ear family          has at least  members  functional genes and           pseudogenes   The genes within this family share a          common genomic structure that is conserved with primate          Ear genes The mouse Ear gene family forms four unique          clades            Ear genes form          subfamily A The members of each clade share a high          degree of sequence identity Transcripts from           Ear were overclustered          into one TC TC TC was associated with           Ear because of shared EST sequence          AA and associated with           Rngtt because of shared GenBank          sequence AK Sequence analysis indicated that          AA encodes           Rngtt instead of           Ear  Further analysis suggested          that a typographical error in the publication            caused the reported EST sequence associated with           Ear to be AA instead of          AA This manytomany association can be resolved          into one manytoone association six Ear genes to          TC caused by overclustering and one onetomany          association one MGI gene           Rngtt to three TCs caused by          transcript diversity The group with the largest number          of DTs in MGIDT associations included  DTs and three          immunoglobin heavychain genes            Igh IghVJ and           IghV  The group with the largest          number of TCs in MGITC associations included  TCs and          three immunoglobin heavychain genes            Igh IghVJ and           Igh  The complexity of the          manytomany associations demonstrates the challenges of          creating links between genes and electronic transcripts          and highlights the caveats that users of these resources          must keep in mind                            Comparison of DoTS and TIGR Mouse Gene Index                  For the onetoone MGIDT and MGITC associations          the number of shared sequences between DT and TC pairs          linked to the same MGI gene varies          Our analysis reported  MGIDT and  MGITC          onetoone associations A total of  MGI genes had          both TC and DT onetoone associations Among these all          except eight pairs of TC and DT had one or more GenBank          sequences in common see Table for details There are           MGI genes whose associated DT and TC pairs had          exactly the same component sequences The assemblies that          were identical in the number of component sequences were          generally small clusters Of the assemblies associated          with the  MGI genes described above  had only          two component sequences  had three to five component          sequences  had six to ten component sequences and           had more than ten but less than  component sequences          Most TC and DT pairs associated with the same MGI genes          have one or more sequences in common The number of          shared sequences between DT and TC varies widely ranging          from one to more than  The maximum number of shared          GenBank sequences is  between DT and          TC both associated with MGI gene           Svs seminal vesicle protein          secretion  MGI  These pairs generally have          very different numbers of component sequences ranging          from only two to more than a few thousand sequences TCs          generally have larger numbers of sequences per cluster          than do DTs The maximum number of component sequences          for DT and TC are  DT and  TC          respectively                          For the onetomany MGIDT and MGITC associations          DoTS and TIGR Mouse Gene Index did not consistently          cluster the GenBank sequences          There are  MGI genes associated with multiple          DTs and  MGI genes with multiple TCs And  MGI          genes had both MGItoTC and MGItoDT onetomany          associations We considered all TCs or DTs associated          with the same MGI genes as different forms of transcripts          and grouped them together We compared the identity and          grouping of the component sequences between the TC group          and its corresponding DT group We included only the          sequences curated in the MGI database in the comparison          because they are mostly highquality mRNA sequences and          should be reliably clustered There were only  pairs          of the TC group and DT group associated with the same set          of MGI curated GenBank sequences which were also          clustered in the same way The remaining pairs differ          either in their set of associated GenBank sequences or in          the way of sequence clustering          The differences between the two electronic transcript          databases are likely to be due to the different criteria          used by the two groups for clustering and assembly of EST          and mRNA sequences One possibility is different degrees          of trimming poorquality sequences from the ends of ESTs          CJS personal communication Less trimming in DoTS          build might result in more assemblies than TIGR TCs In          testing fewer larger assemblies were generated when          trimming was not limited Limited trimming was chosen in          attempt to preserve better representation of          differentially processed transcripts in DoTS build The          comparison of the two databases using curated data from          MGI as a reference provides some measures to evaluate and          improve computational methods                            Utility of the analysis        The association of MGI genes with electronic transcript        assemblies supplies biological context to the        computationally assembled transcripts and allows        researchers to access these data from biological as well as        sequence perspectives The curation process described here        permits us to rapidly build highconfidence associations        between MGI genes and electronic transcript sequences The        results reveal the complications that can arise from the        clustering process as well as errors in the MGI database        The assessment of the results will provide measures to        evaluate and improve the ESTassembly protocols and to        check the quality of gene representation in the MGI        database                    Access to the links between the MGI database and the        TIGR and CBIL electronic transcript databases        Only associations
