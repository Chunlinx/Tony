        where is your favorite place to go     well we havent traveled outside the United States that much um we usually take family type vacations were looking forward to one in October to Disneyworld in Florida     oh thats great have you ever been there   a have a nine year old  when when both of my kids were much younger and this time were gonna be going with just one daughter and shes nine so it ought to just be a ball     oh thats a perfect age for Disneyworld   uhhuh i think so too   oh thats great yeah so weve been there a number of times and uh were going next year we have a business trip every fall well we go on a lot of business trips i   oh wonderful so you travel a lot   i dont work well we do we go my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position hes in they dont care if i go along   uhhuh   so its great i just kind of join up when its something interesting and uh Disneyworld is the one for a week next year   sure umhum   and itll be at this time of the year and this year were leaving um uh matter of fact were leaving next Saturday for New Orleans   oh thatll be fun too yes we went years ago we havent been lately and i know theyve changed it a lot and upgraded everything but we used to have a lot of fun there   have have you ever been there well you know we went there once in fact we had been in Dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said lets go to New Orleans so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a a project hes going to be and then i said well ill go along i hope its swimming season because it wasnt a tremendous thing not amount of things to do that i wanted to do there     uhhuh yeah if you dont like the night life and the antique shopping there isnt much there but that can be fun   it well and and thats probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned   umhum   and im kind of anxious for that but um yours to Disneyworld sounds  a little bit better       did you know that next week theres several TV shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary   no i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows   well and with a daughter nine it is just shes old enough to really grasp the meaning behind   yes be excited about all of it   uh if so uh well if youre working then youre probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go   well not really uh were doing the same thing tying it in with my husbands business trip and i just save vacation for things like that and uh just travel whenever we can   oh thats well i really i think travel when i heard my topic today i thought okay thats my favorite thats my favorite because     how easy right   and really at our point of life our children are grown and um it has just worked out really well with this um       position hes in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where hes going   umhum   whether or not i decide to go along but i do do like to travel and its um i dont mind the pool life at all during the day and i like to sightseeing and i love to shop   sure    umhum umhum  so thats perfect what more could you ask for   so its thats right but if this   and then get to pick and choose the places   well and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas um that i would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas um probably once every maybe year and a half   ah    uhhuh   and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so ive just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental   umhum umhum   and theyre recommending that you use those because they dont know the future of Continental and i said now that we have all the miles we better start using them   right its kind of shaky thats true it really is   uh so we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip um when we normally go that way we like to go to California at the same time because we really dont get out there as often as you could probably from Texas   umhum our last big trip we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and and uh back through Silverton and Durango and oh it was fun it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it our   i think thats a good trip and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent   umhum right   now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the what i would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to Colorado to Denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through Utah   umhum   and as far west as Las Vegas and then we returned through uh New Mexico that you just mentioned and it was oh it was just great   umhum oh theres so too much to see really you just   oh i i think thats thats the way to
