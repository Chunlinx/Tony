                                 I Dream of Julia            Imagine that youre a modestly ordinary fellowinvited to a humble dinner party that you ask if you can bring a date andthat you show up with Julia Roberts Hi this is Julia Where do we put ourcoats Jaws drop people fall all over themselves buddies goggleeyed takeyou aside How did you manage that  What a shallow empty andpathetic reverie having ones worth enhanced by a gorgeous celebrity And howirresistible            The scene described above is the heart ofNotting Hill  except that Julia Roberts is called Anna Scottgreatactress magazine cover girl object of worldwide idolatry and scrutiny Themodestly ordinary fellow meanwhilethe owner of a struggling travelbook shopin the eponymous London neighborhoodis impersonated by Hugh Grant who hasmade a specialty of teasing ordinary modesty into extraordinary adorablenessThe film directed by Roger Michell from a script by Richard Curtis  FourWeddings and a Funeral   is a brainy weave of satire and fantasy itwould take a neurosurgeon to unwind its trenchant observations of ourcelebrityinfatuated culture from its masturbatory Peoplemagazineworthy pipe dreams In this I suppose Notting Hill isremarkably in tune with the Zeitgeist             The movie isnt simply afantasy of a commoner winning a princess however its also a fantasy of aprincess publicly electing to be with someone below her station Since HughGrant doesnt fall below too many stations this goes down more smoothly thanit would if he were say Danny DeVito But if Grant speaks through jawsaristocratically locked his William Thacker is meant to embody a scruffydownwardly mobile lifestyle as a consequence of his integrity he must share aflat with a cretinously vulgar couch potato called Spike Rhys Ifans and facea stream of dim customers who refuse to accept that his bookshop carriesneither Dickens nor Grisham            The script gives Grant a series of deadpan oneupmanshipswhat saves him from seeming like an utter snob is his habit of drawingattention to his own foolishness with a lovably selfdeprecating stammer WhenAnna Scottwith her sunglasses and strong dont touch vibeappears fromamid his shelves to ask about a particular guide to Turkey his recitationdribbles off hopelessly Theres also a very amusing incident with akebabamong  many  amusing  incidents His look of panic may betranslated as Oh God dont I sound like a prat Kiss me How can sheresist those floppy locks that sheepish grin                           Notting Hillspins such comic awkwardness into scenes of amazing charm Summoned to thestars suite for an impromptu date Thacker finds himself in the middle of apress junket for her latest film and ends up posing as a journalist fromHorse and Hound a bit that at once lampoons the idiocy of celebrityinterviews and forces the pair into a witty and sexy collusion You also geta taste of the world from which Anna is fleeing when Alec Baldwin unbillednever funnier shows up as her equally famous boyfriend radiating narcissisticentitlement as he paws his celebrated squeeze and bids Thackerforced thistime into impersonating a room service waiterto adios those dirty dishesScenes in the heros middleclass milieu skirt the sentimental One friendGina McKee is confined to a wheelchair to remind us that life is full ofunhappy as well as happy accidents But the movie recovers its high spiritswhenever Emma Chambers appears as Thackers raucous toothsome sister whoblurts out when she meets Anna that the two could be best friends            The screenwriter Curtis began his career with thehilariously acrid BBC sitcom Black Adder before writing The TallGuy  and Four Weddings and a Funeral a movie that irked mepossibly because Grant passed up the alluringly neurotic Kristin Scott Thomasfor the vapidly bovine Andie MacDowell possibly because its dizzy romanticbadinage was interrupted for easy pathos involving a fatal heart attack andother realworld calamities Curtis is ingenious in his slapstick farce andspoof mode less assured when the emotional ante is upped In NottingHill  he hasnt really thought through the character of Anna Scott He mustknow how lucky he is that Julia Roberts arrived with so much astoundingbaggage            A friend of mine once worked for a big movie starWhen I asked if that star was a nice guy he looked at me the way StephenHawking might if you asked whether a black hole was a nice place Uh  Isuppose hes nice said my friend Hes nice for a star But when youre astar and you go to restaurants for instance the waiters and owners fall allover you and send you drinks and food and eventually you take that kind ofattention for grantedand pretty soon you expect everything to revolve aroundyou and then you get upset when it doesnt            Stars he concludedsometimes bestow their favors graciously but theyre never nice Being astar precludes niceness            The best thing to be said about the Anna Scott ofRobertsan actress certainly capable of playing niceis that she isnt nicefor a second In fact Roberts seems to welcome the opportunity to be as flatand guardedas shut downas possible while still giving an ingratiatingperformance According to a profile in Vanity Fair  Roberts protestedthe scripts depiction of Annas distraught reaction to the release of a nudevideo She argued that Anna would have learned not to let tabloid scandals getto her because that way lies madness The director reminded heras one mighta small childthat she was playing Anna not Julia but I side with theactress here Whatever depth this character has is the upshot of Robertsattempt to communicate something about her own celebrity to say that it hasmade her overdefended and that its a constant battle to stay human in theface of so much attention            Roberts began her careerwith a supernatural amount of charisma and sometimes wobbly technique She wasa skittish thoroughbred who needed to be handled ie directed with care Asshe has become more selfsufficient she has become more interesting Shewasnt afraid to embrace the more heartlessly grasping side of her character inMy Best Friends Wedding  and her turn as a strange Medusalikeseductress on a recent Law  Order was a tour de force I missedher in last years Stepmom my raccoon had hepatitis She doesnt needher Pretty Woman laughing shtick to hold your attention She trusts herfeatures which are huge and nearly clownlike in their dimensions but whichsomehow coalesce into a heartstopping symmetry Is it my imagination thoughor have those lips become even more pillowy Leave them alone Julia InNotting Hill  Roberts takes rejection with a frozen smile Thusshielded she has never looked so exposed Her Anna is such a cauldron ofunresolved impulsesrage petulance fear deceptiveness promiscuitythatits no wonder that the filmmakers had to tack on a corny toopat coda thatspells out the couples happilyeverafterhood Theres no way we couldotherwise picture a stable future Roberts has left the movies cozy romanticfantasyland in a pile of jagged shards            N otting Hill opens with an superfluous voiceoverthat sets the scene and makes certain that the audience is oriented Incontrast Bernardo Bertoluccis Besieged  from a script that thedirector wrote with Clare Peploe has no narration and little dialogue Theintent is to keep the audience disoriented It works maybe to a fault Thefilm opens in Africa where the husband of Shandurai Thandie Newton is seizedby soldiers for insolence toward the countrys authoritarian ruler When weencounter the young woman again she has taken a job as the livein domestic ata huge and crumbling Roman townhouse belonging to an English loner named JasonKinsky David Thewlis All day this gangling bugeyed oddball plays Scriabinon his grand piano while Shandurai dusts vacuums sews irons and laundersThen he sends a ring down the dumbwaiter to her basement room by way ofproposing marriage            I frankly dont know what to make ofBesieged  which attempts to forge a complicated relationship between itsprotagonists through pure cinema and has won admiration for being allusiveelusive elliptical and other words that begin with a and e enigmaticambivalent evocative etc In one sequence Kinsky struggles to compose apiece while Shandurai vacuums The camera swings from side to side withShandurai and her vacuum cleaner then from side to side with Kinsky and hischords as he becomes increasingly inspired Is this satire or does Bertoluccireally mean to suggest a higher communion I fear the latter And areKinskys rippling Philip Glasslike progressions meant to suggest profundityor empty pretentiousness I fear the former The movie has virtuoso passagesBertolucci is one of the few filmmakers whose technique is simultaneouslysweeping and probing His camera sweeps and then stops to probeit fixes on anobject and holds it up for scrutinyand then goes back to sweeping But whathe means by what he shows is anybodys guess Its possible thatBesieged is meant to be vaguely allegorical The African is seduced bythe crumbling decadence of Europe while the European falls for the childlikesimplicity of Africa But I sure hope not
