of stock worth a bit more thanthat to  million eligible policyholders in four states Abouthalf of those were individuals or employers in Kentucky andIndianaThe distribution was a result of Anthems conversion last yearfrom a mutual company owned by its policyholders to a publiclytraded company owned by the shareholdersDespite earlier mailings from Anthem the checks caught manypeople by surprise

stateadministered aidprograms in Kentucky you cant have more than  in liquidassets on hand That includes cash and stock In Indiana theMedicaid threshold is even lower The Anthem payouts were large enough to put many seniors overthose limits The average payout was  and the largest about  went to people who had been with Anthem the longestpresumably seniorsWhen the checks started showing up in mailboxes sometime afterChristmas many aid recipients were confused about why they got thewindfall  and what to do with itThey were justifiably concerned advocates sayI think theres a real danger that

fairlyWhile people wondering how to handle their payout should consultan expert abou their particular situation there are some generalguidelinesYou cant give it away said Jess Williams branch manager foreligibility policy for Kentucky Department for Medicaid ServicesHe said many people are asking if they can give it to theirchildren to put it in a trust for them The answer is noIn general you must receive fairmarket value for whatever youspend it on That means for example You cant pay your son for a car that is worth  said Lee Richardson aLouisville attorney specializing in elder lawThe good news for those who must spend up to  in a fewdays is that there is a fairly broad latitude in what you canspend the money on Kentucky advocates and Medicaid officialssuggest such alternatives as buying a prepaid burial payingpremiums in advance on Medicare supplement healthinsurance policyor paying outstanding medical bills Other allowable expenditurescould include buying a car for medical transportation needs makinghome repairs or paying property taxesThe main requirement is you must get value for your moneyOtherwise when you report spending to Medicaid  as is required official could treat the money as unspent which could affect yourbenefitsIn Indiana similarly there isnt really any particularrestriction on what you can buy with your money   as long as youspend the money said
