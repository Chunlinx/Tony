 Based on the discovery of a large propanebomb and other explosives planted by the two killers investigators think theyhad accomplices Meanwhile several bomb threats and trench coat pranks atschools in Colorado and elsewhere over the last two days are being treated ascopycat incidents Editorialists and politicians continued to debate whether toblame the massacre on  guns  violence in the media

destruction of the US governments last samples ofsmallpox  The US and Russian governments have the only known samples ofthe virus which was eradicated in the s after it had killed  millionpeople this century The previous world consensus was that the samples would bedestroyed this year to make sure smallpox never comes back The new thinking isthat rogue states may already have obtained samples of the virus for developinga biological weapon and that the United States should work with Russia todevelop a new vaccine and to test drugs against the virus The politicalquestion is what happens if the rest of the world wants the virus destroyed butthe Americans and Russians dont                         The theorythat male homosexuality is genetic suffered a setback  A previous study hadfound a specific genetic pattern among gay men but a new study does not findthe same pattern The most interesting version of the theory is that the genepassed along on the X chromosome makes the bearer attracted to menand thatthis trait is supposed to be passed on to daughters but is sometimes passed onto sons The author of the old study says the new study is flawed andreporters agreed that the new study raises doubts but doesnt necessarilyrefute the old one The conservative spin This proves homosexuality is achoice not a natural condition so its OK to stigmatize it The gay spins Homosexuality is genetic and therefore natural  If it turns out to begenetic conservatives will just try to eradicate it with gene therapy Forget the genetics debate and just treat us equally                         Scientists founda new candidate for the missing link between apes and humans  The millionyearold creature dubbed Australopithecus garhi  evidently usedstone tools to carve up the animals it killed and had much bigger teeth thanits apelike ancestors The theory is that the creatures tools enabled it toaugment its diet with meat and marrow which gave it the nutrition and energythat eventually allowed it to develop a larger more human brain and to spreadthroughout the world                         A governmentstudy concluded that some New Jersey state troopers pulled over drivers andsearched their cars because they were black or Hispanic  At least percent of drivers who were asked by troopers for permission to search theircars were minorities The ostensible reason for this racial profiling is thatNew Jersey highways are a conduit for drugs and that the troopers think blacksand Hispanics are more likely to be culprits One consequence of the studycould be to help black and Hispanic defendants get the results of their carsearches thrown out of court as a violation of the Fourth Amendment The spinsfrom Gov Christine Todd Whitman RNJ  Im surprised  This is awful The vast majority of troopers are not racist and Im issuing orders thatwill stop this practice right away The reactions from blacks and Hispanics Duh  This is the way the world is  Right                                        Indias                government collapsed The ruling Hindunationalist coalition lost a noconfidence vote because a small party pulledout of the coalition Now the opposition Congress Party led by Sonia Gandhiformer Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhis widow is trying to form a parliamentarycoalition large enough to support a new government The early betting is thatthis will prove impossible and that new elections will have to be called Thekey questions at stake are  whether Gandhi will become a candidate for primeminister  whether the new government will sign the nuclear test ban treatyand  whether India will seek to cool tensions with Pakistan                                       CNN                is dumping Peter Arnett Having kept Arnetton its payroll but off the air
