                                 Chronicle of a Death Foretold            Trent Lotts snap decisionto schedule an immediate debate in the Senate represents an important openingfor supporters of McCainFeingold the main vehicle for campaignfinancereform But do not suppose that the majority leader has developed any sympathyfor a bill that would ban soft money limit independent expenditures andtighten disclosure requirements Republicans have a huge stake in the currentsystem under which they outraised Democrats by  percent in the lastelection cycle Incumbents have an even bigger edge over challengers Thus forthe boss of the incumbent Republicans to permit the playing field to beleveled would be to go beyond good sportsmanship It would be an act ofselfimmolation            But even if Lotts motivefor offing McCainFeingold remains as powerful as ever carrying out the hit nolonger looks so simple Fred Thompsons hearings have done what Lott and hishenchmen Don Nickles and Mitch McConnell feared they would dothey havedramatized the general horror of the current system more than they have theparticular excesses of the incumbent president Simply dismissing reform asunnecessaryLotts approach as recently as a few months agono longersuffices At the same time the Republican leadership cant be too brazen Tocount on party discipline to reject McCainFeingold outright or to use thepower of the gavel to prevent it from coming to the floor would be to court apublic backlash and a revolt within the Republican caucus That kind ofleadership can make a party leader look bad            So astraightforward machinegun massacre is out Thanks to the baroque vestiges ofSenate procedure however Lott and company still have other weapons at theirdisposal the ice pick the poisoned umbrella tip the exploding cigar theJames Bond shark tank the Batman buzz saw quicksand car bombs a variety ofslowacting toxins the complete works of Joyce Carol Oates and their barehands Some of these weapons are of course too barbaric to actually useHeres the best current thinking about how Republican leaders are likely to tryto snuff their victim beginning next week            Supporters of McCainFeingold universally expect Lott tofirst try attaching one or more killer amendments  The idea here is abooby trap You add something offensive that doesnt alter the appearance ofthe bill allowing Republicans to support it while compelling Democrats to voteagainst it The most probable amendment is one that expands on the SupremeCourts Beck decision In  the court ruled that union members havea right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues spent on politicsMcCainFeingold would codify Beck  by requiring unions to notify theirmembers of this right Nickles argues for what is known as a hardBeck                provision which would go further giving union members achance to opt out permanently The AFLCIO considers this nonnegotiable as domost Democrats They argue that corporations may spend money on politicswithout offering a rebate to dissatisfied shareholders If Senate Republicanstack on a Nickles amendment Democrats might even filibuster to blockMcCainFeingold which otherwise has their unanimous support            Theadvantage of a Beck based amendment is that it would create a version ofthe bill friendly to Republican interests to counter what Lott can argue is aversion beneficial to Democrats But assuming that Lott does not persuade anyof the bills four Republican supportersJohn McCain Thompson Susan Collinsand Arlen Specterhe would need all  of his remaining team members to winthe vote The fate of reform will then rest with a few Republicans from stronglabor states such as Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Spencer Abraham ofMichigan If Lott loses on Beck  he may try other killer amendmentssuch as one that would abolish the public financing of presidential campaignsand get rid of the  tax checkoff that pays for it The folks on McCains sidethink the votes on these amendments will be decisive If they can fend off theKlingons it will demonstrate a majority for genuine reform            In that event Lott may try to undermine thebill in backroom negotiations  This would be more in the line ofjudicial murder For example his faction might agree to ban soft moneybutonly in exchange for deregulating hard money McConnell would like to end alllimits on direct contributions Short of that he would like to raise the limiton total annual contributions by any individual from  to Because both a wealthy person and hisher spouse can give each year this wouldmean that he or she could effectively contribute  in an electioncyclenot unlimited money but pretty close Fred Wertheimer of Democracy a reform group notes other recondite antireform measures that Lott might tryto sneak in He might try to undo the ban on direct corporate and laborcontributions that has been in effect since  or undo softmoneyrestrictions by leaving state committees free to dabble in federal races            Theburden of resisting these feints will fall partly on Minority Leader TomDaschle but principally on McCainwho as a Vietnam POW survived torture inthe Hanoi Hilton If McCain holds out for a strong bill Lott may have noalternative to an oldfashioned filibuster  Supporters ofMcCainFeingold will probably need not just  votes for victory with the tieto be broken by Al Gore but  votes to invoke cloture and break afilibuster McConnell heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee andthinks Republicans can remain in control of the Senate for the next  years ifthey can defeat McCainFeingold He has said he is ready to use any meansnecessary A truly diabolical man he could read Art Buchwald columns on thefloor of the Senate until even McCain cries uncle            This kind of public execution of reform would lookterrible so Lott might try to mitigate a filibuster by offering as asubstitute his own phony reform bill  Think of this as a pod orreplicate version of campaignfinance reform It might contain a grab bag ofchanges tied to revelations about the Clinton campaign of  such as banningcontributions from domestic subsidiaries of foreign businesses phonesolicitations from the White House and paying guests in the Lincoln BedroomBut surely this wouldnt satisfy anyone And one downside would be the implicitadmission that most of what Democrats did in the last election wasntillegal            If McCainFeingold gainsenough shameleverage to pass the Senate expect an attempt to kill it in theHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich who argues that we need more money in campaignsnot less expressed his diehard opposition to McCainFeingold last week Hecould use the complex House rules to smother the bill If some sort ofmomentum carries the idea through both chambers differences between the twoversions would still need to be ironed out in conference committee  Thiswould provide additional opportunities for sabotage Conferees appointed byLott and Gingrich could insert a poison pill that would  moveDemocrats to vote against final passage or  be bait for a presidential vetoThey could also implant a constitutional depth charge  by buryingsomething that violates the First Amendment and would be likely to result inthe whole mess being thrown out by the Supreme Court            And thats just the stufftheyve thought of so far  McCainFeingold may be a bill with ninelives But Trent Lott knows that there are many many ways for it to die
