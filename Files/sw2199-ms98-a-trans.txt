        well do you have a lawn   yes we have a house with a big backyard for the kids to play in and a pretty good size front yard   oh good so who cuts the grass   my husband its not a job that i enjoy at all     well i used to own a home and when i owned my house i had a small yard and a small front yard and a small backyard then i cut the grass but i sold it so now i live in an apartment   so you dont have to fool with any of that anymore   so i dont have to fool with any of it no     well im big into the plant i like the the flower beds and plants a lot better than i do the lawn   oh then my wife and you would probably get along well umhum   so yeah i had used to have a garden until the kids got older and we dont have any more room in the backyard so now all ive got is flowers instead of vegetables     yeah we talk about um Laura talks about growing uh right right now shes interested i think in a herb garden she mentioned this morning that she could grow just you know flower box   hum umhum   and i think thats but i think uh after after we um after i finish school and were ready to you know settle down someplace and i get a decent job then well look for something probably with a nice size yard that we can have a garden   yeah its nice to have nothing is better than going out there and picking your own tomatoes or different vegetables and things to eat   yeah yeah that yeah that and thats the big problem with being in an apartment is weve talked about it and even uh Laura even said you know as a wedding present we should ask for these big pots you know that we could put on the front porch and because the apartment complex actually we have the whole front porch and somebody else lives on the other side so we thought about you know having putting it in pots and putting the pots just on our steps   umhum umhum   and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers like right now it would be beautiful in in Maryland you know daffodils are just all blooming so it would be really pretty   um yeah container gardening is really pretty easy because ive done some of it before   umhum   you just need to get the you need to get the right mix of soil so that it doesnt dry out   yep yep   and so that your plants because and then you have to you still have to water them a lot of times once a here in Dallas you have to water sometimes twice a day because it gets so hot in the summer   yeah well we wouldnt have to worry about that       right now were going through we just it just rained all day today or its been raining most of the morning drizzling off and on but yeah   um well weve got a beautiful day and there are people out everywhere all of our neighbors are out scalping their lawn for the first time   oh really this is what is it i guess your growing seasons just about to begin oh   yes we hit our well hit our last spring freeze it snowed here as late as May before but that was really unusual our our our last freeze is usually about April fifteenth   umhum yeah yeah thats a   and so were all everybodys out planting and buying and   yeah see were a little bit later than that but thats right thats about right about the same yeah   seeing what died umhum   but i think um i think you you though must have much warmer weather through the winter so thats   yeah it makes it nice for gardening when its when its like that because we can grow a lot of things even through the winter that uh yall cant grow we can start i can start a garden in July ive done that and and plant some of the uh   umhum   sturdier crops broccoli and things like that you have to really water it a lot when its when its young like that and its in the heat but then   yeah yeah and then July and August yeah   then as the fall comes on you get a you can get a really beautiful second crop of a lot of the cooler weather vegetables and sometimes thats the only some peas and different things like that thats the only time of the year you can grow them   umhum hum   because otherwise its too it gets if you start them when its cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer   right yeah that jeez i never thought of that because see here our growing season is basically done by um well you might have some tomatoes still blooming in uh in October the begining very begining first week of October   umhum   but normally everythings done by September end of September means youre basically done growing anything   yeah um yeah but it gets a lot colder up there a lot quicker because we can grow sometimes there have been times when when ive grown stuff out ive grown broccoli up and through November   umhum yeah because it oh gee thatd be nice   and still have it producing and okra okra will grow real okra will grow to be six foot tall its just   umhum we dont even grow okra up here   yeah you probably dont have the right temperatures and stuff probably not too many people eat it up there either it seems to be kind of a southern delicacy   yeah we dont have the right whatever yeah well i think it it it its getting um a little bit more popular because see theres a lot of the um first you know first the big wave of TexMex food came by you know and so were were big into tacos and stuff up here now and and taco salads and things   umhum     which they probably Mexican people dont even know what a taco salad is but i think its now its moving up too because uh just a change you know just something different   yeah   plus its a little bit more vegetable oriented and i think the uh the mid Atlantic states have been a long time holdout for beef and potatoes   yeah   i think its our Irish descent   maybe so   yeah but i think it its changing now yeah so i so we do know what okra is i wouldnt have known what it was when i was a teenager though     umhum oh well whats your favorite plant if you were you know you were talking about your containers maybe you were going to get those started what would you like to put in them   well we were going to probably just going to start well because were going to be moving were talking about just putting throwing tomatoes in   umhum   you know and then uh but also things like tulips i think uh i would have liked to had flowers like daffodils blooming right now you know   yeah tulips is just kind of late because you have to you have to force them   umhum   if you were going to do that you might put some strawberries in there around the edges   yeah we we talked about that too in fact um our sisterinlaw Lauras brothers wife you know was talking about you know putting strawberries uh moving their strawberries because they just moved   umhum   i its this problem with being in school you know they just moved and they took their strawberries that they had out in their yard and put them all in containers and theyre going to decide what theyre going to do with them i think but theyre going to let them bloom this year in the containers   yeah theyll work that way and theyre theyre kind of pretty theyve got little white flowers and   umhum umhum would you have to stake them up do arent they do they grow along the ground strawberries   long as you no theyd grow kind of like a vine they they put out little feelers kind of like an ivy would   uhhuh yeah   and and along those is where thats where the strawberry grows and it will eventually take over an area you plant them when you plant strawberries you plant them like six to eight inches or more you can even plant further than that but to cover an area so you cover you put them eight inches apart all through a flower bed   huh   and by the next year youll have pretty much a solid bed of strawberries   oh see ive never grown strawberries   theyre real simple thats why i like them i just put a bunch out because you just put them out there and you water them   umhum   the bugs dont least here at least here the bugs dont particularly bother them and they dont require a lot of fertilizing or care you know during the rest of the year   yeah umhum just water   yeah and then about every five years you have to dig them up and throw them away and start over again they dont last forever   umhum well they say arent maybe youre supposed to cut them back cut them and   it that can help but you just get to a point where theyre just not productive anymore   yeah   its just a kind of uh just the way the plant is   yeah rotationary thing   yeah   oh thats interesting see because ive never really grown strawberries lot of tomatoes but never really strawberries   yeah i like tomatoes but i always end up with when ive grown them i i end up with the little cherry tomatoes   uh yeah   just thousands of them and i cant figure out what to do with them all     hundreds of thousand you cant even give them away   yeah because everybody else is growing   i can remember as a kid growing up my whole family all my family grew strawberries grew excuse me grew tomatoes   the same kind of thing   so whenever somebody would come over your house theyd always bring some tomatoes well but you grew your own tomatoes   yeah     so if somebody brings you half a dozen tomatoes it doesnt do you any good because you already had a half a dozen you know pulled that day   yeah     its really funny   yeah some other things thatll grow good in those containers and you can you can mix and match the flowers with your your vegetables and grow around them marigolds and impatiens   uhhuh oh yeah   they do real good especially impatiens because you tend to get shade when youre on a porch area part of the time   umhum   i mix all all my flower beds are mixed up ive got onions behind the irises and   well thats makes sense though     all back and forth and around yeah because theyre going be theyll grow now from now until the about middle of June then ill have all the onions and theyll be out and then ill put in some flowers   umhum   some annuals for the rest of the year and some color   um oh you are a big gardener huh   yeah i like getting in the dirt i just dont i hate mowing   yeah     its just too hot and it has to be done too often   yeah i guess the more you plant the less you have to mow   yeah   because thats a when i had my yard it was you know it was it was really a hassle uh cutting grass was just a terrible just the thought of it was a terrible thing oh i used to hate it   yeah with ours it wouldnt be so bad we had a self propelled mower but the self propelled part broke   oh   and so it doesnt and then and then it weighs a ton   yep because its when its self propelled its heavy yeah   because its yeah and its so its supposed to pull itself along and my husband it doesnt bother him and he im got out and mowed for him one day just to be nice so he wouldnt have to do it when he got home and i said what is with this mower i cant even push it around the yard   yeah that   and you know hes like well i get more exercise pushing it around     my uh my brother went out and bought a mower used you know he was looking for a lawn mower and he he just had bought a house he lived in an apartment before   uhhuh   and he bought a used mower it was a real big heavy one and he said that that you know basically they they sold it on him because you know it was a macho thing   yeah   the bigger and heavier the lawn mower the more macho the guy behind it so you know of course he wouldnt couldnt buy one of those little little tiny skinny ones that you can get at one of the uh one of the Aames or   yeah   the the fast mowing places you had to buy a big one you know because it meant something for your macho same reason why you have to drive a big truck with four wheels you know with four wheel drive       yeah   it was a macho thing he had to use that but then after he used it one year he took it back to where he got it used and he sold it back to them and traded it in for another one that was smaller       because he said it was just too dang heavy   yeah too many trips around the yard with that thing huh for sure   yeah plus i think he lives at a small hillside too so   oh gosh   yeah cut trying to cut it sideways on an angle and turning around you know without it tipping over was a pain   oh yeah thats the other thing with my husband he gets he hes one of these people he didnt care about the flower beds and stuff we i guess we divide it pretty well that way but he he gets real picky about the grass he wants to get out there and he cuts it on diagonal   yeah   and goes all this back and forth and you know and gets the weed eater out and trims all the little bits around the flower beds and all the little bits around the trees that he did nt get   uhhuh   hell go out there and spend four hours on the lawn   uhhuh well its probably his his his personal time while hes cutting the grass hes probably thinking about something else   i guess   its probably and plus no one bothers him you know you walk behind a lawn mower making all that noise no one ever talks to you you know youre on your own     no nobodys going to bother you
