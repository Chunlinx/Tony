                 okay Art you say you own a TI or you own a uh an IBM compatible   uh yeah i have one of these little Zenith laptops which uh the uh everybody here at school has to buy one   uhhuh   and   oh youre in school   oh yeah im a student uh at at Harvard Business School   uhhuh   and uh tremendously useful thing its uh the the portability and the compactness of it are uh pretty nice its uh you know enough that you can kind of throw it in a briefcase or uh slap it over your shoulder and carry it around   what what do you use to to download into the system can you put hook up a a floppy to it   uh its got an internal three and a half inch floppy   oh its built in   yeah and uh it also has a forty megabyte hard drive built in   oh thats pretty good um   and uh you know the batteries carry it for at least four or five hours   um   and so you know i use it um both in school to do uh spreadsheet analysis for various uh businesses that were studying and also uh you know it hooks up to normal printers and what have you and uh works pretty well in that mode as well   uhhuh   im im curious what you use your uh home computer for   uh  i do i do uh word processing on it primarily uh the main reason why im im hanging on to it is because of the business that im in the the home computer business i have a   uhhuh uhhuh   a store in my house where ive got the uh the hardware and the software and i also do repair work on the system if if i started using a different computer at home then i wouldnt be using the the software and the hardware and it would be that much more difficult for me to try and market it the the product   does it does it cause a problem for you to use a different computer at work than you use at home   uh oddly enough no uh because i do different things with it at home i i do mostly play and at work i do mostly work uh its  you know you you you can put a game on an IBM compatible computer uh but uh   uhhuh yeah   you know i i dont normally do that at at work uh and i i typically deal with uh       Lotus uh WordPerfect which is a spreadsheet   right   and uh we also have a tie in to a mainframe out in in Dallas Texas   uhhuh   and the mainframe has a lot of software out there where i use to interface my computer with   are are you at the point where the the mainframe appears slow to you relative to your personal computer given the the ratio   no um there was at one point in time where where it was continually down it it appears at though whenever i wanted to use it it wasnt working and this was about   uhhuh   seven ten years ago   uhhuh   and they made a dramatic effort of trying to reduce down time down to nothing and today uh i cant say that i can remember the last time it went down uh several months its its just up all the time now they take it down like on Sunday nights like for a couple of hours to do maintenance or whatever but uh unless theres something dramatic that happens with the telephone system uh usually doesnt break down and i think what theyre doing is theyre using satellite somehow   thats   to uh to transmit the signals to have a backup some to back that that system up so that there is no no down time   umhum you you dont think that they went and did a uh what is it an Ishihara uh quality analysis   analysis  i dont i dont know how they fixed the problem but theyre uh you know the whole theme of of what they were doing was was to measure and record and and uh reduce down time     uhhuh   and the other big thing is uh quality satisfaction or customer satisfaction   uhhuh   how do how do the users feel about the the system and what are their likes and dislikes and thats thats uh thats where they they were heading and the system is fantastic so its its not slow if anything the the PC is now slower than the mainframe   that   were transmitting from from uh New England to Dallas Texas and im getting responses in in split seconds   thats tremendous are are your computers at work net uh networked at all or is that   yeah oh well that thats another system that i link in to i i network internally to Texas Instruments in Attleboro   umhum   and use the mainframe for corporation uh type programs like payroll and uh financial data bases and we also have uh uh a message system which is a worldwide network within within the corporation   uhhuh   where i can send telegrams to any TI site and theyve also hooked up to some company to allow us to do Email and allow it to convert it   huh   to other companies so that the other companies can recognize our Email and now were getting into faxes as well right off the PC   thats tremendous   yeah thats uh the technology is really  really blow you know going going crazy with this   its clearly a uh a uh a uh productivity enhancement uh device and allows you to do   uh originally i didnt think it was i thought that what ended you know we ended up doing was uh doing all of the secretarial work and the secretaries had nothing to do       uh and and that i guess part of that is true  uh i do all my own typing i i i dont give anymore uh paper to the secretary to type up only because it takes me longer to write it and redo it and then give it back to her again for me to sit down and and do it and correct it myself i i i am not a typist i type with two fingers but i do very well at it and uh i i do everything i do my only typing do my own foils uh its just its just so much easier for me to do that   that thats been my experience also ive actually i guess ive been doing that since probably when i was in high school   uhhuh   many years ago and uh uh it it its gotten to the point now i think where the uh secretaries are are finding other jobs to do because you know the typing and to some extent the filing is just not there anymore   yeah and   big paper files are disappearing   the the files may be disappearing but the secretaries are not the the people people in power are are afraid to give up that status symbol     uhhuh   and uh although what theyre doing now is is theyre maintaining secretaries but theyre piling more and more people onto that one secretary rather than get rid of the secretary  theyre theyre just you know theyre finding justification by adding more people to her     i guess theres theres a fear that one day if the computers ever stopped working thered be a bunch of people staring at the typewriter with no idea what to do with it   well i dont know like back in my particular office there must be at least uh twenty twenty five people one secretary no typewriter its all computers everybodys got a a PC sitting in front of their desk   huh do you uh if if i assume you all are networked to a a variety of of laser printers   oh uh i i have a laser printer i have access to a laser printer in my office but i dont have one tied in to my system yet uh im im networked into it but its so inconvenient for me to to   uhhuh   to run all the way downstairs that  that i dont use it   huh because what i was what i was going to ask you is it seems like the next big jump will come with color printing you were talking about doing your own presentation and foils it would seem that color capability would be the next big sort of leap in presentation   yeah well i think what i see is a different direction i dont know if you are you familiar with uh programs like Harvard Graphics where they have uh   yeah   like a print shop or or a thing in the system well we have uh instead of using view view foil machines we have uh a transmitter that will pick up the signal from the the monitor   right   and transmit it just like a view foil   huh   so we we do that somewhat uh we also have uh teleconferencing where we have   a   um so we we do that somewhat uh we also have uh teleconferencing where we have uh the the mainframe as being the monitor in other words if youve got foils you pull it out of the mainframe and then use the telephone speaker system to communicate with   wow   and and we use uh we do teleconferencing that way so that that everybodys looking at the same foil because were pulling it off the network   interesting yeah thats uh thats uh pretty powerful set of tools to give to people who traditionally have had to go through a whole production process just to get the   oh yeah i can remember at one time the the uh secretaries actually had to be artists and  and technicians and today uh with the laser printer       theyre uh really not being utilized as much as they had been in the past im making some really pretty foils that uh four or five years ago i wouldnt have ever dreamed i could be doing them and its its so easy to do uh       with the with the programs that are out there now   huh huh well uh Frank i think i kind of need to get back to some other things so i i hope weve talked uh   all right okay i believe we have   covered enough of of this for for what this is all about   okay nice talking to you   yeah it was a pleasure   take it easy   thank you bye
