                                 Disordered Diana                                             Editors note Some of the letters below originallyappeared in The Fray Slate s reader feedback forum                                       Whos DeliriouslyMeanSpirited                        Your review of my book Diana in Search ofHerself was so confusing that I scarcely know how to respond see the Sept  posting Your writer asserts in the first sentence that it wasdeliriously meanspiriteda surprising statement given that reviewers forTime  Newsweek  and the Washington Post among others haveremarked on the evenhandedness of my book In fact Judith Shulevitz isherself deliriously meanspirited and I resent the fact that she relies onmaterial from my book in an effort to make her arguments            Your writer assesses the book in only one otherplace noting that Diana suffered from what Smith dubiously diagnoses as aborderline personality disorder The review promptly lists seven psychologicalproblems that plagued Diana all of which are common in those afflicted withborderline personality disorder For the record I used the term as a frameworkfor understanding Dianain particular how its symptoms interacted to producethe chaotic behavior that so many close to her witnessed over the years Iemphasized that while I couldnt say with certainty that Diana had thedisorder the evidence as presented throughout the previous  pages wascompelling As it happens a number of psychiatrists have approached me sincethe books publication to say that Diana was a classic borderline            I suppose that I shouldbe flattered that the three meatiest paragraphs of five in the review weredrawn entirely from my biography But as someone who read a vast amount of whathad been written about Diana conducted  interviews many with herintimates and included  pages of detailed footnotes I find it dismayingthat                   Slate                would run such a disingenuous review                           Sally Bedell Smith                                       Sucking Up to theBoss                         always makes for interesting reading whether ornot it really gets anyone to give besides maybe Bill Gates is open toquestion but Im sure it cant hurt At least its better than trying to rankcolleges            I have a question about that  million gift thatheads the list though As far as I can see the gift was made by the Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation not the Gateses themselves Obviously most all ofthe foundations assets have come from the Gateses and I dont want todiminish the generosity of surrendering  billion for the public good Butstrictly speaking there doesnt seem to be any other foundation on The                  Slate                 list nor are Henry Ford Andrew Carnegie or the veryliving Walter Annenberg listed In truth I dont know how much the AnnenbergFoundation gave away last quarter but lets prorate its annual giving andguess that it was around  million based on s figures Here is thesummary if you want to look it up            In fact if I understand the rules a  billionfoundation will have to give away roughly  million per quarter and intodays market and economy ought to have considerably more than that to spendeven after hedging against inflation Aside from the occasional Ted Turnerbombshell the Gateses seem to have just about guaranteed themselves the topslot on The                   Slate                 for the rest of their lives even if theynever give another nickel away            As I said I dont want to suggest that Bill Gatesisnt a generous person nor even that his giving doesnt represent considerablesacrifice on his part though it must be nice to be able to give that kind ofmoney away But as this edition is constituted it looks an awful lot likesucking up to the boss            Of course if it helpskeep you in business by all means carry on             Chris Hammett                        NewYork                                             Ann Castlereplies                               Youre right that the headofthelist gifts come from theBill and Melinda Gates Foundation The funds in that foundation were given bythe donors themselves so they meet our criteria as gifts from livingindividual Americans The Gateses use the foundation as their giving vehicleas do some others on the list                                       You mention Henry Ford Andrew Carnegie andWalter Annenberg as examples of foundation founders who are not on the listFord and Carnegie are easy to explainthey are no longer living and wedecided to list family foundation gifts only when one of the original donors isstill alive                                       The AnnenbergsWalter and Leonorehaveappeared on the list previously But according to a cursory search done todaythe Annenberg Foundation announced gifts totaling  million in July  atotal that under our terms would not have met the minimum for the secondquarter of  This total was composed of  gifts ranging from  to                                       Our method looks for single large gifts Theresnothing sacred about that technique others have ranked cumulative giving overa lifetime etc We count pledges as well as paid gifts I look for giftsannounced by the donor or the recipient as gifts from individualsthats whyyou saw the Rockefeller name appear for the first time on The Slate this quarter I also search for foundation gifts from individuals and have setan arbitrary minimum of  million                                       We dont list gifts that we cant verify A giftwas announced earlier this year from James E Beasley to Temple University LawSchool as the largest endowment in the history of the university to the lawschool which has been named the James E Beasley School of Law in his honorWe couldnt verify any amount so this gift was not included in TheSlate  although it almost certainly would have qualified                                       Some people make all their gifts through theirfoundations others do a portion of their philanthropy that way Some give at aparticular time of year others spread it out Many of the same people makingannounced large gifts also give anonymously and I dont try to ferret thoseout Our goal is to celebrate both donors and recipients so we list gifts asthey are made out of a foundation to a separate nonprofit Thats why theGateses were not credited with the even larger amount that was announced in allthe papers If we recognize them for the  billion they put into theirfoundation then we cant recognize the organizations that receive that moneydown the road or wed be doublecounting                                       The fact is that theGateses now have created the largest personal foundation in the United Statesand will probably continue to make the top or near the top of the listHowever as Jack Shafer noted in  there are plenty of other people out therewho could meet and exceed their  running total of  million and not evenwince                                       At Lager Heads                        Dont get me wrong I
