                                 Missing Links            When TimeLife bought theZapruder film rights the day after JFKs murder a company executive said thefootage was so horrific that the  second film would be locked away foreverAs of a few weeks ago however you could pick up a digitally enhanced morehorrific than ever version for  bucks at the corner video store Timesurrendered its rights in  the year Geraldo Rivera first broadcast thefilm on television            Mostpeople already know the imageryafter all Oliver Stone presented it inPanavisionand probably regard it as a valuable clock of the assassinationone that created problems for the Warren Commission Among other things thefilm led to a magic bullet thesis to account for a lot of wounds from threerapid shots and later to the neurospasm and jet effect theories toaccount for JFKs head snap reaction to the final shot Assassinologists haveargued for years that the Zapruder film alone confounded any lone gunmanthesis            Many still think so but in recent years a latestage hardcore of Zfilm specialists has developed a different view Watching dupes yearafter year measuring prints with calipers subjecting the movie to vectoranalysis and performing their own stopwatch experiments these criticsincluding several academics have discovered the film is not merely evidenceof conspiracy but is also a part of the plot That is its a fakeor as onecontemptuous critic describes it a cartoon            How didthe Zapruder film become in one professors phrase itself an instrument ofconspiracy The film is known to have been copied at Washington DCsNational Photographic Interpretative Center though nobody knows when In oneconspiracist scenario it was rushed to NPIC from the Dallas lab where Zapruderhad left it In five feverish hours CIA experts edited and opticallymanipulated the film to mask what had really happened Faked prints were rushedback to Dallas just in time to be given to Zapruder When other Dealey Plazahome movies surfaced they too were collected and altered to match Theresult is the hoax of the century            But it hasnt fooled everyone In their hastethe purported hoaxers left behind evidence of tampering Back in  RobertGroden a conspiracist specializing in image trickery argued in RollingStone that frames were missing The same Groden testified in the OJSimpson civil trial that the Bruno Magli photos were fake Groden thought frames were gone but the stakes on missing frames have since risen One pairof critics now theorizes that three times as many frames were exposed as we seetoday that twothirds of the original film has been removed            How can anyone tell Amongthe many clues offered in Assassination Science  a  anthology thatdevotes  pages to proof that the film is a fraud People make supposedlyimplausible moves between frames the blink pattern on the presidentiallimos front lights is said to be uneven the awful results of the head shotcant possibly have lasted only one frame the horrible Frame  DavidLifton famous for his theory that JFKs body was surgically altered before theautopsy has written elsewhere that portions of the head shot sequence looksuspiciously dark to him and that some of JFKs movements may be specialeffects            But otherZfilm critics argue the film is almost entirely special effects that thegrassy background one sees is surely a repeated matte shot because nobody init moves that the head shot sequence features an optical zoom to eliminateforeground figures and make it easier to manipulate that the head shot itselfis an optically collapsed version of two more widely separated hits Oddlythere is even a claim that JFKs shocking head snap among the biggestchallenges to the lone gunman thesis didnt happen and is a CIA specialeffect            So what did the real Zapruder film reveal To theseresearchers it contained incontrovertible proof of conspiracy more shotssay but just what that proof was depends on which conspiracy each believesin A few theorists believe the lost footage showed an assassin actuallyshooting JFK No not Black Dog Man who looms indistinctly over the grassyknoll in other Dealey Plaza imagery and who may or may not be seen on theZfilm at Frame  The assassin these theorists have in mind is WilliamGreer the driver of JFKs own car who purportedly braked drew his gun anddelivered the coup de grce in the middle of the motorcade            Perhaps the original Zapruderfilm still exists Texas Hunt family may have a copy according to a man whoclaims he picked it up for them or maybe theres a copy at NBC where onewoman says she watched it But the real question about the filmin thiscontext the inevitable questionwas raised by longtime conspiracist HarrisonEdward Livingstone in his  book Killing Kennedy             Is it possible asksLivingstone that Zapruder was a plant Livingstones theory is that themasterminds behind the murder wanted a film they could alter Otherwise hewrites the whole sequence of events is just too convenient            Thus on close scrutiny theZapruder films ultimate revelation is that Abraham Zapruder was himself aconspirator At least it gives the film a surprise ending
