                                 Bill Bradleys Naomi  Wolf            Last week the Washington Post published an editorial about the NaomiWolf business that drew a contrast between Al Gores and Bill Bradleys uses ofadvisers The editors noted that while Gore is a sucker for trendy guruspeddling magical elixirs Bradley relies only on trusted longterm adviserswho think nothing of sharing hotel rooms in order to save money            But as Wolf quite reasonably pointed out in TV appearances last weekBradley has a guru too a Harvard professor by the name of Cornel West WhileWest is not being paid by the Bradley campaign as Wolf is by Gores campaignhe plays an analogous role as affiliated intellectual Where Wolf advises Goreabout how to score with women voters West is helping Bradley appeal to blacksAnd as in the GoreWolf case the benefits of the BradleyWest relationship areclearly reciprocal As a result of his association with a leading presidentialcandidate West can expect to see his fame and his already formidable lecturefees rise I dont think he shares hotel rooms            I must admit to being poorly disposed toward West mainly on the basis of adevastating critique in the New Republic by Leon Wieseltier thatappeared in year  In a long reviewessay Wieseltier demolished Westsstature as a public intellectual portraying him as a pretentious egomaniaca mass of contradictions and a superficial thinker who dresses up dilutedMarxism in incomprehensible phraseology An obvious column idea suggesteditself Bradleys guru is much wackier than Gores            Then I read some of Wests writings While he certainly can be eccentricsolipsistic and turgid at his best moments West is shrewd courageous andinspirational I remain ambivalent about his work but it is certainly not asWieseltier asserts almost completely worthless It doesnt trouble me at allthat West is advising Bradley In fact it makes me respect Bradley for openlyengaging a selfdescribed socialist who may prove a big political liability tohis campaign mainly because he finds him insightful and stimulating            Lets get some of Wests obvious faults out of the way His vanity is indeedconsiderable Wests picture invariably appears on the cover of his books andtheir interiors contain nearly as many selfreferences as those of that otherBradley mentor Pat Moynihan West goes on tremendous namedropping riffs Thejustpublished Cornel West Reader is dedicated to John ColtraneFrederico Garcia Lorca Franz Kafka Paul Celan Tennessee Williams GiacomoLeopardi Samuel Beckett Sarah Vaughn Muriel Rukeyser Thomas Hardy NikosKazantzakis Toni Morrison and above all Anton Chekhov Its that aboveall that really cinches it West has an unfortunate tendency to refer to hisutterances as prophetica judgment best left to others But like Weststaste for threepiece suits after another of his idols WEB DuBois thisis a more a matter of style than of substance West cultivates a distinctivelyblack mode of academic discourse improvisational in tone and containing astronger element of showmanship and braggadocio than most of his whitecolleagues are comfortable with            Another annoyance is Wests love affair with labels In the early pages ofThe Cornel West Reader he describes himself a Chekhovian Christianwith deep democratic commitments a Gramscian democratic socialist anonMarxist socialist and a prophetic Christian pragmatist freedomfighter These stickers accumulate as on a steamer trunk without pointing toany definitive destination This habit too makes West easy to mock but Ithink it serves a purpose West wants to communicate the intensity of hiseffort to reconcile his various influences religious political philosophicand artistic Wieseltier may be right that Wests efforts at synthesis lackrigor But I dont think Wests intention is so much to work out a system as itis to put his own personal journey forward as an example West is selfmadeintellectual who found Kierkegaard in a bookmobile was influenced by the BlackPanthers as a teenager and found his way to Karl Barth and John Dewey Hispromiscuous use of slogans is a way of personalizing the philosophical oftelling you where hes been            So what is it that I find appealing about West I think his main strengthsare his thoughtfulness about Americas racial divide and his charismaticenthusiasm about bridging it West has a reputation as something of an angryrevolutionary I would describe him as a bluntspoken moderate with a radicalselfimage slightly at odds with the substance of his views In RaceMatters  he blasts Jesse Jackson for trying to monopolize black politicalleadership and for lacking programmatic followthrough He defends affirmativeaction but notes that it is not the most important issue for black progressin America His basic stance is a rejection of both the conservative view thatracism is no longer a big problem and the liberal view that its the wholeproblem            Instead West opts for a multicausal explanation of black Americasproblems He thinks racism remains pervasive and destructive a truth thatBradley alone among this seasons presidential candidates seems comfortableuttering and one that West has helped him articulate more pointedly Yet Westdoesnt exonerate victims of racism for irresponsibility or criminalitysomething for which his critics on the conventional academic left like AdolphReed cant forgive him West is blunt about what he calls blacknihilismwhat he defines as a numbing detachment from others and aselfdestructive disposition toward the world West in fact takes a positionthat is close to that of many conservatives on the importance of familystructure and religious values He is also a relentless and insightful enemy ofblack antiSemitism black homophobia and antiwhite racism The very ethicalcharacter of the black freedom struggle largely depends on the opencondemnation by its spokespersons of any racist attitude or action hewrites in Race Matters             Despite his emphasis on how bad things are West is hopefulas opposed tonaively optimisticabout Americas racial future As a believer in what hecalls politics of conversion he considers no one beyond the possibility ofredemption and no problem utterly intractable West is among the toughest andmost trenchant critics of black nationalism and Afrocentrism But he seldomconcludes a diatribe with a condemnation His religious sensibility tells himto try to find what is useful in views that he deplores and to try to pullmoral reprobates in a more positive direction West is scathing on the subjectof Louis Farrakhan Yet he has embarked on a quixotic effort to engageFarrakhan and change his mind            Wests writing lacks the lucidity and panache of his Harvard colleague andsometime collaborator Henry Louis Gates He has said many things that Iwouldnt try to defend and that I doubt Bill Bradley would want to defendeither such as his formulaic pc denunciations of American imperialismWhere he tries to lay out a policy agenda as in his recent book The Futureof American Progressivism cowritten with Roberto Mangabeira Unger Ithink he oscillates between dreary conventional ideas public financing ofcampaigns classbased rather racebased affirmative action a consumption taxand utterly impractical ones a modified parliamentary system expliciteconomic redistribution mandatory voting Id be alarmed if West weredrafting Bradleys policy positions But for the role of spiritual guru to acandidate with a charisma deficit he seems like just the guy
