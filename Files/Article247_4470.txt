                                 Surplush                           USAToday and the New York Timeslead with a surprisingly large revised Congressional Budget Office yearestimate of the federal budget surplus now thought to be as much as aboomdriven  trillion nearly notes the Times  twice last yearsCBO estimate The Washington Post gives its whole abovethefold space toDCs snowstorm pushing the surplus down below the fold The Los AngelesTimes  top nonlocal story is the research bombshell that the standardlongterm estrogenprogestin replacement therapy for menopause substantiallyincreases the risk of breast cancer a story also fronted by the WP The Wall Street Journal frontpage news box is topped bythe new surplus estimate which the LAT stuffs to Page             The coverage states that President Clinton and the leading presidentialcandidates quickly weighed in on how they would variously divvy up the surplusamong tax cuts spending debt reduction and Social Security and Medicarereinforcement But the front pages contain a builtin reminder not to spend themoney just yet The surplus stories are juxtaposed with reporting about how theEast Coasts blizzard was such a surprise The WP notes that Monday theNational Weather Service used a new IBM supercomputer and enhanced software topredict a total accumulation less than one inch            Both the WP and LAT make it clear that the new hormone studywas quite extensiveconducted over  years and covering some  womenBut the WP says high up that it impacts  million postmenopausalwomen whereas the LAT doesnt mention menopause until the eighthparagraph and never mentions the number of women at risk Both stories mentionthat progestin also reduces the risk of uterine cancer which prompts asuggestion It would be helpful if the papers would get in the habit ofaccompanying stories about the particular potential cancer risk of a givensubstance with a graphic summarizing all its known cancer plusses andminuses            The papers go inside with the latest in the Elin Gonzlez saga After theImmigration and Naturalization Service threatened the boys Miami relativeswith revocation of his permission to temporarily reside in the US theyrelented and agreed to allow his visiting grandmothers to see him today Butthe feds also made it clear to the gmoms that they will not be allowed to takeElin back to Cuba at this time            The NYT runs a Reuters dispatch saying that China is implementing newvetting procedures designed to prevent Chinese Web sites from containing statesecretswhich in China the paper explains means virtually any informationnot specifically approved for publication The WSJ follows up its reportyesterday that Chinese authorities would require companies doing businessincountry to reveal their encryption software Todays development is that thecountrys spy agency will help ensure compliance Western countries the paperexplains are worried that providing this information will lead to rampantChinese knockoffs Although technology companies arent saying much officiallyabout this the Journal says some will rather than surrender sourcecode simply halt exports to China            The WP reports that all the presidential candidates submit tointerviews about their prepolitical lives in a onehour MTV special airingtonight Where Were You at  All that is except George W Bushwho instead dispatches a cousin and friend to sing his praises The resultsays the paper is that Bush is the only candidate who comes across like hesgot a closet bursting with frat house skeletons            The WSJ reports that former Arkansas Gov Jim Guy Tucker who hadbeen pressured by Whitewater prosecutors into cooperating with theirinvestigation as part of a guilty plea deal was hired last year by anIndonesian cable TV company controlled by Clinton friend James Riady This issignificant the paper explains because Riady was previously suspected ofpaying large consulting fees to Webster Hubbell to buy Hubbells silence onvarious Whitewater topics            The WP runs an editorial and a letter today bearing on thecontroversy sparked when a DC taxi commissioner said that cabdrivers shouldfor their own safety refuse to pick up dangerouslooking young black malepassengers and avoid taking fares to dangerous neighborhoods Both theeditorial and the letter from the head of the city cab commission state thatfailing to serve potential clients because of their race and redlining ofneighborhoods are both banned by the citys cab rules As they should be Buttheres a complication here that both the editorial and the letter overlookbut that cab drivers cannot Although the local rules say a cab driver cannotignore a fare on the basis of personal appearance this obviously cant meanthat drivers must see threatening behavior before refusing to pick someone upImagine for instance that you are a cab driver and around the corner from thecounty jail you are peacefully flagged down by a young man in a bright orangejumpsuit stamped Property of County Jail Youd be nuts to pick him up and nolaw could possibly make it otherwise even though he only looks liketrouble            A doctor writes a letter to the NYT that poses a good questionAlthough Bill Bradley and his doctor have discounted his recent heart episodeswould a doctor examining him to determine eligibility for a  million healthand disability policy agree Perhaps the dailies ought to pose this question tosome insurance company docs
