                    Background        Recent work has shown that the Bcl family regulates        mitochondrial homeostasis during apoptosis            Proapoptotic members including Bax Bak Bid and Bim        promote the release of deathinducing proteins such as        cytochrome c      smac     and endonuclease G            from mitochondria while antiapoptotic members such as        Bcl and BclX         L  inhibit this release Following        release into the cytosol these deathinducing proteins        promote apoptotic cell destruction through multiple        pathways including caspase activation and nuclear DNA        fragmentation        In addition to controlling the release of prodeath        proteins the Bcl family also alters the function of        mitochondria undergoing apoptosis Dysfunction of voltage        dependent anion channel opening ADPATP exchange the        electron transport chain oxidative phosphorylation and        calcium buffering through the action of this family of        proteins have been reported       While early defects        in the electron transport chain can be reversed by addition        of exogenous cytochrome c the damage eventually becomes        refractory to cytochrome c addition     This finding        suggests that prodeath Bcl proteins can damage        mitochondrial function independent of cytochrome c        loss        Recently we demonstrated that the targeting of the        proapoptotic protein tBid to mitochondria depends upon the        presence of the mitochondriaspecific lipid cardiolipin in        a possibly unique structure     Cardiolipin has a        defined distribution pattern within mitochondria            It is found in high concentrations throughout the inner        membrane including at contact sites where the inner        membrane and outer membrane interact Cardiolipin is        present at much lower concentrations elsewhere in the outer        membrane This distinction suggests that tBid might        localize to contact sites because of the arrangement of        cardiolipin there To test this hypothesis we determined        the submitochondrial localization of tBid using a new        hybrid technique  immunoelectron tomography which couples        conventional immunoelectron microscopy with tomography to        add the third dimension Tomographic analysis was chosen        because it enables quantitative threedimensional        examination of fine structure within the relevant        mitochondrial domains in semithick sections and thereby        facilitates accurate representation of the sometimes        complex membrane topology of this organelle             Immunoelectron tomography is ideal for testing the        independence of two types of labels or label and        structural component as employed in this study and their        deviation from independence  colocalization or mutual        inhibition  because it allows true D distances to be        measured We report here an analysis of the D distances        of immunogoldlabeled tBid from contact sites on the        periphery of liver mitochondria that strongly supports the        colocalization of the two                    Results        Initially we used wild type WT tBid that was        myctagged for immunogold electron microscopy in our        investigation of its localization along the mitochondrial        periphery Generally WT tBid was observed to be in close        proximity to contact sites Fig  However the        preservation of the outer membrane of isolated mouse liver        mitochondria treated with this tBid was less than optimal        for testing the hypothesis of tBid association with contact        sites A significant portion of the outer membrane was        absent in most mitochondria observed which may have been        caused in part by the activity of this proapoptotic        protein in releasing cytochrome c from the region between        the outer and inner membranes Neither was the gold        labeling very high most likely because a stripped outer        membrane results in considerably fewer contact sites        Another pitfall was the use of nm gold as opposed to        nm gold particles which resulted in streaks that        sometimes obscured the peripheral membranes Fig b Even        though harder to see in the microscope for our analysis of        mutant tBid labeling we resorted to the smallersized        gold which greatly diminished the artifactual        streaking        To enhance mitochondrial membrane preservation a point        mutation changing the glycine residue at position  to        glutamic acid in the BH domain of tBid was used This        mutation was previously shown to lower the cytochrome c        releasing activity of tBid without affecting its targeting        to mitochondria     Mitochondria treated with tBid         GE displayed better preservation of        the outer membrane than those treated with WT tBid Hence        because of better preservation of contact sites the tBid         GE was used primarily for the        tomographic analysis For immunogold labeling a threemyc        tag was placed at residue  of Bid         GE  Following cleavage by caspase         a version of tBid         GE was generated with the threemyc        tag at the Nterminus of tBid         GE  Monoclonal antimyc antibody was        used for immunogold labeling to ensure high specificity of        binding        Before performing the timeexpensive tomography        analysis of thin sections with conventional electron        microscopy was used to judge the immunogold labeling        quality As expected the number of gold particles per        mitochondrion varied However most had several particles        arrayed along the perimeter Fig  To confirm the        specificity of labeling three controls were analyzed by        thinsection microscopy Neither the noprimary control        Fig  nor the second control consisting of replacing        the primary antibody with an excess of tBid         GE data not shown showed any gold        particles The third control was the presence of a        contaminant organelle peroxisomes Fig  no gold        particles were observed attached to them All three        controls for labeling specificity indicated that the        nonspecific immunogold background was very low Further        on those mitochondrial surfaces where the outer membrane        was inadvertently stripped off during the specimen        processing no gold was observed which is to be expected        as there is no contact site where there is no outer        membrane        Electron tomography has several advantages over        conventional twodimensional immunogold electron microscopy        that should be enumerated to understand the accuracy of the        measurements made in this study First a more accurate        localization of the nm gold particles is possible because        each slice of the tomographic reconstruction is about  nm        in thickness compared with the typical  nm thickness        used in conventional immunoelectron microscopy Second        because the dimensions of contact sites  nm diameter            are considerably smaller than  nm they are        easily missed in conventional microscopy this problem was        removed by the typically finer sampling of electron        tomography  nm Third because tomography is inherently        a D tool the D placement of goldlabeled tBid         GE was obtained in relation to the D        distribution of contact sites and gold beads at high        resolution Unlike twodimensional electron micrographs        true Euclidean distance was measured at a resolution of         nm twice the pixel size or thickness according to        Shannon sampling theory in tomographic reconstructions        from each gold bead to the nearest contact site These        measurements were then used for a statistical analysis of        association        Tomographic reconstruction of immunogoldlabeled        semithick sections confirmed the preferential association        of tBid with contact sites Figure highlights features of        a tomographic reconstruction of one of the tBid         GE labeled liver mitochondrion used        in the statistical analysis The mitochondrial volume        sliced in three perpendicular planes where gold particles        can be seen in all three faces Fig a arrowheads        emphasizes the vast D information available with        tomography Individual nm slices illustrate how gold        particles and contact sites can be easily identified with        this hybrid highresolution technique Fig b The        insets in figure bshow two examples of gold particles near        contact sites Graphic representations of a segmented        volume are shown in figure c Segmentation is a visual        tool that defines and dissects volumes and thus aids the        interpretation and measurement of structural        interrelationships     Once segmented volumes were        surfacerendered With the surfacerendered volume the        various components of interest can be oriented to best        study the proximity of gold and contact sites in relation        to the membrane topology A wealth of information can be        quickly taken in by rotating the segmented volumes        httpncmirucsdeduperkinstBid For example it became        apparent that contact sites can be clustered Fig c        righthand side of mitochondrion        We tested the association of tBid with contact sites by        employing the statistics of spatial point patterns            We measured the distances between the D loci of all        contact sites and immunogold particles in the tomographic        reconstructions of WT tBid and tBid         GE labeled mitochondria The closest        contact site to each particle was calculated in Euclidean        D space Table shows a comparison of experimental        nearest neighbors with nearest neighbors expected from a        random distribution of gold The experimental mean value        for nearest contact sites was significantly less than the        random mean value for all mitochondria We conducted a        Students ttest to test the null hypothesis that the        experimental mean values would be reasonably likely to be        obtained from sampling randomly The probability of this        test for WT tBid  was  x  and was even lower for        the other samples Thus at essentially any significance        level the null hypothesis is rejected and we conclude that        the association of tBid with contact sites is not random        For an understanding of what constitutes close        association of gold particle with contact site it is        important to consider that the finite size of        immunoglobulin molecules is about  nm in the most        extended state Two immunoglobulin molecules were used for        the labeling primary and secondary antibodies tBid and        the myctag have molecular weights of  kD and  kD        respectively Hence myctagged tBid has a size of  nm        The maximal size of the tBidimmunogold complex is thus        about  nm for nm gold  nm Hence the        distance between gold and contact site is not expected to        be much less than this value With this understanding one        can see that experimental means of  nm shown in table         are reasonable values for specific association of tBid        with contact sites This is especially true upon comparing        with the mean distances of  nm from the random        placement of gold Thus this nearest neighbor statistic        provides strong evidence that tBid associates with        mitochondrial contact sites                    Discussion        Mitochondria are compartmentalized into three spaces by        their inner and outer membranes     The outer membrane        surrounds the mitochondria and separates it from the        cytosol The inner and outer membranes unite to form        mitochondrial contact sites with protein composition that        is still being defined     It is important to test        association of tBid with contact sites using electron        microscopy because whereas purification schemes are based        on assumptions about what contact sites should contain and        sometimes arrived at close to  proteins these sites        have always been defined structurally As previously noted        contact sites are purported to have a unique lipid        environment that is rich in cardiolipin The presence of        cardiolipin has been implicated in the function of numerous        mitochondrial proteins including sites I and III of the        electron transport chain the adenine nucleotide        transporter the protein translocation machinery and the        localization of mitochondrial creatine kinase                      tBid         GE was used predominantly for testing        the hypothesis of localization of tBid to contact sites        Although this mutant translocates to mitochondria as        efficiently as does the WT with diminished disruptive        effect on the outer membrane it seems conceivable that        tBid harbors two distinct signals one for translocation to        mitochondria and the other for interaction with proteins        or lipids to exert its proapoptotic function Disruption        of this latter signal via mutation might alter tBids        submitochondrial localization while preserving the outer        membrane We showed that WT tBid was not randomly localized        with respect to contact sites The mean experimental        distance between gold particles and contact sites  nm        see table  though was significantly higher than those        values for tBid         GE  nm table  This increased        distance for WT tBid is likely due to two factors that        affect the visualization of contact sites First tBid may        have degraded the outer membrane so that the nearest        contact site is not always recognized as such Second the        streaking caused by reconstructing the nm gold particles        used for WT tBid labeling may have obscured the nearest        contact site in a few instances Hence whereas our        analysis cannot disprove the hypothesis that by mutating        tBid its submitochondrial localization was changed it        seems more likely that the greater value for WT tBid is        caused by the factors mentioned above Thus it appears        that the conclusion of tBid localization to contact sites        can be applied more generally than the narrow        interpretation of tBid         GE localization only        Truncated Bid as other BHonly proteins requires        another protein such as Bax or Bak to exert its        proapoptotic function      Interestingly tBid was        found associated with mitochondrial contact sites Figs        and  and was shown to destabilize lipid membranes in        vitro along with Bax by increasing the permeabilization        of artificial liposomes      Therefore it is        possible that tBid can bind to the cardiolipin rich contact        site membranes and destabilize them by inducing Bax or Bak        to oligomerize The membrane destabilization may cause a        secondary effect of inhibiting the action of the proteins        located there This hypothesis would account for how tBid        affects the function of many different processes without        binding directly to several proteins Indeed it was found        that the targeting of tBid to mitochondrialike membranes        occurs in the absence of proteins yet depends upon        cardiolipin being in a possibly unique structure as opposed        to free cardiolipin     The requirement for a specific        cardiolipin structure that is likely defined by the contact        site is consistent with our observation that no gold        particles were found in regions stripped of the outer        membrane exposing the cardiolipinrich inner membrane        After the induction of apoptosis mitochondria display        two distinct phases of damage Early in the process the        outer membrane becomes permeable without rupture Although        this is controversial     to several proteins found        in the mitochondrial inner membrane space including        cytochrome c in which contact sites have a probable role            During this early phase though the inner membrane        remains intact and mitochondria still retain their protein        import machinery     Later in the process there is        swelling and herniation of the matrix leading to a        distension of the cristae             Many factors could contribute to the structural changes        observed in mitochondria tBid and other prodeath proteins        such as Bax or Bak could destabilize the membrane leading        to the observed changes Additionally loss of contact site        and inner membrane integrity could indirectly cause        alterations in ion exchange and lead to the flow of water        into the matrix The loss of cytochrome c causes a break in        the electron transfer chain resulting in the production of        reactive oxygen species     Reactive oxygen species        are known to cause the oxidation and loss of function of        many lipids including cardiolipin     Finally        caspases activated downstream of cytochrome c release have        been implicated in mitochondrial damage     It appears        likely that the cumulative damage of these agents could        lead to the irreversible loss of mitochondrial membrane        integrity and structure                    Conclusions        In conclusion we have combined the techniques of        immunogold microscopy and electron tomography to determine        visually and by statistical analysis that tBid is        preferentially concentrated at contact sites rather than        being randomly distributed along the outer membrane For        the first time immunogold electron tomography permitted a        quantitative demonstration of D organellar protein        labeling with antibodies The method described is        envisioned to broaden biological applications of        ultrastructural immunogold labeling techniques especially        in investigations dealing with compartmentalization of        functional elements For example many organelles        including the nucleus endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi        apparatus have a complex organization with a unique        distribution of proteins throughout each Immunoelectron        tomography is starting to be a useful tool in determining        how the distribution of proteins may provide clues as to        their targets or scope of action                        Materials and

tomographic          reconstructions          Tomographic reconstructions were performed as          described previously     Briefly thinsectioned          material nm thick was examined using a JEOL FX          electron microscope Thicksectioned material was          examined with a JEOL EX microscope operating at           keV The  m thick sections were tilted through           of rotation and electron micrographs were taken in           increments Using the SUPRIM software package Four tilt          series from different sections consisting of  tilt          images each were then digitized aligned and back          projected using R weighting to generate the volume          information Volume segmentation of the reconstructed          mitochondria using Xvoxtrace software was used to

representations using the SYNU software          package Gold particles were represented by gold spheres          in the surfacerendered volume                          Statistical analysis          To determine whether immunogoldlabeled tBid is          spatially clustered or randomly located about contact          sites a spatial point pattern statistics was used          namely the nearest neighbor statistic     The          Euclidean distances from each immunogold particle to all          of the contact sites in the reconstruction was calculated          for all the particles using a similar approach to that          described by Perkins and coworkers     The nearest          neighbor statistic was calculated for the reconstruction          using the closest observed contact site to each gold          particle and then calculating the mean and standard          deviation for all such measurements in a reconstructed          mitochondrion These values were compared with those          derived from simulations in which the same number of gold          particles determined empirically were randomly placed on          the mitochondrial surface
