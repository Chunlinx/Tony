                                 The Peoples Hitler            It is one of the paradoxesof modern biography that Adolf Hitler who came frighteningly close toestablishing his Thousand Year Reich has seldom been taken seriously as apolitical leader In Hitlers own day Churchill called him a guttersniperBrecht parodied him in the character of Arturo Ui a buffoonish thugimplausibly thrust into power and Neville Chamberlainwell enough said aboutMr Chamberlain Afraid of being branded revisionists Hitlers biographershave been largely reluctant to acknowledge his political talents Thus havethey given us Hitler as psychopathic god and unprincipled opportunist butnever as statesmana title that even in the age of the Kissingers and thePinochets has lost little of its luster            But asthe historian John Lukacs underscores in his study The Hitler ofHistory  the Nazi dictator was not simply the centurys most murderoustyrant he was one of its most brilliant politicians Lukacs a distinguishedhistorian of modern Europe has reflected perceptively in previous books on theNazi leaders hypnotic allure In The Hitler of History  Lukacs adopts amore historiographical approach examining comparing and correcting theinterpretations of Hitlers biographers Lukacs courtly prose can mask thebold scope of his ambitions Besides critiquing Hitler biographies Lukacs isalso advancing his own reading of Hitler            Hitler says Lukacs was a peculiarly modern demagogueMore than any of his peers including Mussolini he created an electrifyingfusion of aggressive nationalism and populist rhetoric An early practitionerof McLuhanesque politics who was extraordinarily aware of his pictorialimage Hitler understood the popular effect of the cult of the star  onhis fans the ordinary Germans who admired and even loved him If only theFhrer knewthe cry of many ordinary Germans who felt betrayed by the Naziregimesuggests the depth of their affection            Oftendismissed as a poor military strategist intoxicated by quixotic ambitionsHitler was in fact extremely adept at sizing up his opponents weaknesses andunderstood acutely the supreme importance of land power with themotorization of military movement As a result he succeeded in less than adecade in making himself the ruler of Europe from the gates of Moscow to theEnglish Channel Indeed until his obsessive vision of cleansing Europe of theJews and conquering Soviet Russia overcame his pragmatic instincts Hitler didnot make a wrong move His victories emboldened him and his National Socialistfollowers to visit untold misery upon their victims As Lukacs writes he lefta more indelible mark upon the century than any other dictator a Lenin or aStalin or a Mao            Much of the writing about Hitler falls into thecategory of Hitlerology a form of insipid voyeurism similar to thatsurrounding Kennedy or perhaps closer to the point Jack the Ripper Thedetails about Hitlers personality titillate but they rarely edify eventhough Hitlers fanatical devotion to his mother does provide a rather chillingrebuttal to a faith in family values            Lukacsdoes not himself always resist the temptation of Hitlerology He tells ofHitlers love of romantic poetry and creamy Viennese cakesthe onlyexceptions apparently to his unyielding asceticismand speculates inponderous footnotes studded with citations from Kierkegaard on the theologicalnature of evil A Catholic writer Lukacs whitewashes the record of the churchas the least compromised and  sometimes even inspiring of institutions Ifso why has the church subsequently apologized for its cozying up to HitlerFor the most part though Lukacs concentrates on the disturbing specter thathas come to haunt Hitler scholarshipHitlers admirers and defenders openand hidden The most notorious Hitler apologist is the British Holocaustrevisionist David Irving who has worked tirelessly to exculpate the Fhrerwhile lashing out at his adversaries As Lukacs observes Irving has notscrupled to invent evidence that Stalin planned to attack Germany beforeHitlers invasion and that Hitler again and again ordered the Jewish problemset aside until the war was won            Since the mids a subtler but arguably more insidiousform of revisionism has come from such reputable German scholars as ErnestNolte and the late Andreas Hillgruber both leading participants in theHistorikerstreit  a quarrel among German historians over the uniquenessand meaning of the Holocaust While rebuking Hitler for declaring war againstthe Western democracies Nolte offered an implicit justification of theHolocaust as an anxious reactive measure sparked by the previous practicesand exterminations by the Russian Revolution For Nolte Stalin was theoriginal sinner Hillgruber added his own provocative twist by proclaiming thatGerman historians were obliged to identify with the German soldiers on theEastern front who were protecting Germany from Bolshevism The thrust of suchinterpretations as Lukacs argues was to rehabilitate Hitler as a Germanpatriot and antiCommunist            AlthoughLukacs has somein my view rather too muchcompassion for Noltes andHillgrubers bitterness against the antinationalist consensus among Germanhistorians he concludes that their explanations amounted to a kind ofrelativization to the point of defending Hitler And yet that shrewdcritique of revisionism notwithstanding Lukacs own corrections to Hitlerhistory are idiosyncratic and often wrong For instance we are told thatforeign policy was secondary to German unity in Hitlers intentionsalthough Hitler saw these aims as inseparableinvoking in Mein Kampf Germanys need for living space  lebensraum  and her moral right toacquire foreign land and soil Indeed as the selfproclaimed imperial saviorof an Aryan Europe weakened by Jews and socialism he exalted the quest forlebensraum as a struggle to the death No less questionable is Lukacsclaim that Hitler for all his hatred of the inferior races was not abiological racist Lukacs gleans this insight from a solitary remark by Hitlerin  to the effect that from the genetic point of view there is no suchthing as the Jewish race If Hitler was less a biological racist than anextreme nationalist as Lukacs asserts this was a distinction without adifference to the millions of Germans instructed in such particulars of SocialDarwinist science as how to tell a Jewish skull from an Aryan one            Why would Lukacs underplay Hitler the racistBecause he is more intent upon painting Hitler as a populista creature of thebaleful age that wrested authority from responsible elites and enshrinedpopular sovereignty Lukacs who came of age in Hungary while Hitler was inpower has long described himself as a reactionarynot a Gingrichianrightist but a partisan of the patrician mores of preWorld War I EuropeBecause Hitler took to the streets and disregarded the niceties of bourgeoispolitics Lukacs considers him an antibourgeois revolutionary and a friendof the proletariat While Lukacs is right to point out that Hitler wascontemptuous of the bourgeoisies caution of their thrift  of theirdesire for safety Hitler did not crush their political parties and send themin droves to labor campsthis fate he reserved for the organized workingclass Nor did Hitler try to abolish capitalism as Lukacs suggests althoughlike his adversary Roosevelt he did expand state supervision of privateindustry Despite his penchant for revolutionary rhetoric his inspired use ofmodern techniques of collective mobilization and his willingness to strike upa tactical alliance with Stalin Hitler remained a committed foe of what hecalled JewBolshevism and indeed of all leveling ideologies            Lukacs often writes asthough Hitler or rather Hitlerism triumphed in the war Thats because forLukacs the horror of Hitlerism is simply an expression of the horror of moderncollectivism In one sense Hitlers vision survived him notes LukacsDuring the twentieth century the compound of nationalism with socialism hasbecome the nearly universal practice for all states  whether they callthemselves socialist or not  We are all national socialists now Does thismean that the difference between say Swedish social democracy and Nazi statecapitalism is less significant than the similarities Or between Afrikanerwhite supremacism and postapartheid multiracial democracy Lukacs would notof course go that far But in using Hitler to illustrate the threat of powerpassing into the hands of the masses he ignores an important distinctionbetween mass societies those ruled by charismatic dictators unchecked bypopular representation and those governed by democratic institutions Withsome exceptions we are all democrats now Perverse as this may sound Hitleris one reason why
