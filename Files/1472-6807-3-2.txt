                    Background        The human immunodeficiency virus type  aspartic        protease HIV PR is an important enzyme due to its key        role in viral maturation Inactivation of the enzyme causes        the production of immature noninfectious viral particles        The enzyme therefore is an attractive target in antiAIDS        drug design and the effect of binding various inhibitors        on the protease structure is currently the focus of        intensive research              To obtain information about the position and energy of        binding between an inhibitor and the corresponding protein        several automated docking programs have been developed              Given recent improvements in search algorithms and        energy functions computational docking methods have become        a valuable tool to probe the interaction between an enzyme        and its inhibitors These methods can contribute        significantly to the understanding of structural and        energetic basis of enzymesubstrate interactions                     Proteinligand docking methods aim to predict the        binding energy of the proteinligand complex given the        atomic coordinates In such calculations both the protein        and ligand can be treated as rigid bodies             alternately the ligand the protein or both molecules        can be completely or partially flexible             One advantage of incorporating flexibility is that it        enables a search without bias introduced by the initial        model This bias normally influences both the orientation        and conformation of the ligand in the active site which        usually represents a local minimum conformation            More importantly the lock and key concepts used to        evaluate enzymesubstrate binding in reality refer to        flexible locks and keys that are both in constant dynamic        thermal motion     For example an analysis of        conformational changes upon complex formation for a        representative set of  pairs of ligandfree and        ligandbound structures showed that  of these proteins        undergo substantial mainchain and side chain        conformational changes when the ligand is bound                   Several techniques have been developed to predict the        binding energies of HIV proteaseinhibitor complexes                 Head RD         et al      used an approach        that calculates physicochemical properties of the ligands        and the receptorligand complexes to estimate the free        energy of binding The enthalpy of binding is calculated by        molecular mechanics while properties such as complementary        hydrophobic surface area are used to estimate the entropy        of binding through heuristics Gohlke H         et al      developed        DrugScore a knowledgebased scoring function to        discriminate between welldocked ligand binding modes and        those largely deviating from the native structure        Schapira M         et al      used the finite        difference PoissonBoltzmann implementation of the        electrostatic term in conjunction with appropriate surface        and entropy terms to predict the binding energy of  HIV        proteaseinhibitor complexes The predicted binding        energies had a correlation coefficient of  with the        experimental data Recently sterberg F         et al   used AutoDock  a        ligand flexible docking program together with combining         protease structures into a single representative grid of        interaction energies for incorporating the side chain        motion into a docking simulation protocol     The        correlation coefficient between experimental and calculated        binding energies produced by this technique was         Since most current docking programs treat the receptor        andor ligand as rigid objects this represents an        important cause of failure to predict the correct binding        enzymesubstrate energies     We address this problem        by performing Molecular Dynamic MD simulations on HIV        proteaseinhibitor complexed and using the resulting        structures to calculate the binding energies by AutoDock a        ligand flexible docking program                    Results and discussion                  Correlation between experimentally determined and          calculated binding energy          The primary objective of this study was to determine          whether protein relaxation would improve prediction of          proteinligand binding energies Table shows that the          correlation coefficient of the experimentally determined          and calculated binding energies from AutoDock for the          twentyfive proteaseinhibitor complexes after          proteinrigid docking was  The correlations after             and  picoseconds ps of MD simulations          were    and  respectively These          correlations are plotted in Figure  One outlier from          hvi was noticed in Figure B after it is eliminated          the correlation coefficient changes from  to           after  ps of simulation          All these correlations represent a significant          improvement over the proteinrigid docking results The          best results were obtained from the structures at the           ps MD simulation time point These structures also have          low    average allatom root mean square          deviations RMSD relative to the experimental results          Table shows the allatom RMSD between each simulated          complex and the corresponding proteaseinhibitor xray          structure The average allatom RMSD for the complexes          increases from   at  ps to   at the end of           ps of simulation time Similar results are          consistently observed regardless of the five starting          seeds used in the MD simulations          When a constant value of  is subtracted from the          predicted energies after  ps MD the binding energies          of almost all of the predictions were within  kcalmol          of the experimental values Three complexes hvi hvr          and hte had poor predicted energies with an average          error of   and  kcalmol respectively          Among these one hvi had better predicted energies          when compared to the results of proteinrigid          docking                          Influence of the protease flap movement on          calculated binding energy          The betastrand flap is the most flexible region in          the HIV protease It is normally   RMSD from the          active site and is in an open conformation in the native          state      The protease undergoes significant          structural changes on binding to an inhibitor The two          flaps fold over the inhibitor to form a tunnelshaped          active site and are held in this close position by          hydrogen bonding from Ile and Ile NH groups of the          enzyme to a water molecule which in turn is hydrogen          bonded to the P and P CO groups of the inhibitor              The bonding stabilizes the flaps in a closed position          and inhibits the activities of the enzyme          MD simulation has been used to study the movement of          the flap region of HIV protease with a ligand                   The flaps initially opened to an allatom          RMSD of   within  ps and became completely open at          the end of a  ns simulation In this study Figure           the flaps opened up and moved away from the xray          structure from   at  ps to   RMSD at  ps          the flap RMSD was calculated from residue  to  of          each protein chain These movements after  ps of          simulation are inversely correlated with the quality of          the binding energy prediction As shown in Table  the          correlation coefficient significantly decreased from           at  ps to  at  ps as the allatom flap RMSD          increased from  to  at  and  ps          respectively          Complementarity between the ligand and the binding          site is the basic concept behind ligand binding This is          manifest as steric complementarity ie the shape of the          ligand is mirrored in the shape of the binding site          allowing molecular interactions between two molecules              MD simulations allow rearrangement of the protease          side chain especially on the active site surface which          improves the interacting surface complementarities of the          complex As shown in Table  after  ps the time          scale that produced the best correlation coefficient the          average allatom RMSD of the complex was only            while the average allatom RMSD of the flap region was                                     Influence of MD simulation duration on ligand          binding          Ligand docking revealed a consistent set of recurring          binding modes For all MD time scales wellclustered          docking results could be obtained Generally the lowest          binding energy clusters are associated with the lowest          allatom RMSDs of the ligands The best results in terms          of lowest binding energy are located in a similar          position of the xray structure at the active site Table          shows the number of docking solutions in a cluster            N  along with the allatom ligand          RMSD for each MD time scale          A small           N value indicates strong          specificity of binding with all of the solutions          resembling one of only a small number of binding          conformations and orientations On the other hand if           N is large the experiment          indicates a low specificity of binding since the          solutions are composed of many different binding          conformations or orientations          In this study the clustering result of ligands had an          average           N of  for docking without any          MD    and  for docking with             and  ps MD simulation respectively On          average the lower number of docking solutions in the          cluster for all MD simulation time scales indicates that          the ligands bind to their binding pocket with high          specificity The docked ligands after  ps MD simulation          exhibited a wide range of RMSDs   to   with          an average RMSD of   which indicates the failure of          the ligands to recognize and specifically bind to the          binding site with the protease flaps open                            Conclusions        In this study we illustrate the importance of taking        dynamics into account to predict the structure and        energetics of proteinligand interactions It is clear that        relaxation of HIV protease for  ps MD simulations is        enough for rearrangement of the surfacebinding pocket to        produce good correlations between calculated and        experimental binding energies The binding energies of all        protease molecules bound to different inhibitors were        influenced by the movement of the flap regions with the        correlation coefficient decreasing as the flaps moved away        from the experimental structure The differences in these        correlations may reflect biological features of the        dynamics of HIV proteaseinhibitor complexes        Future work with larger data sets different energy        functions different docking and binding energy evaluation        methods and more starting seeds is necessary to determine        the optimal parameters to robustly predict        proteinsubstrate binding energies         in silico                     Methods                  Molecular Dynamics simulations          MD simulations of all complexes were carried out with          the NAMD software version b    using the XPLOR          force field     Missing atoms in heg hte and hvp          were added by using the guesscoord command in NAMD The          van der Waals bond angle dihedral and improper          dihedral parameters for all the ligands were adopted from          the Heterocompound Information CentreUppsala HICUp          httpxraybmcuusehicup     The water molecule          under the flaps present in all complexes was included in          all steps throughout this study except for hvr where          the structural water was removed in the preparation of          the protease to be docked with the ligand the ligand of          hvr which is a ureabased inhibitor does not bind a          water molecule in this position The water molecules          were added to the binding site of hvs because all the          water molecules were absent in the experimental          structure Protein protonation states were modeled as in          the related HIV protease MD simulation study              All protein residues were modeled in their charged state          except for one of the two aspartic acid groups Asp           and Asp  in the active site since previous studies               have shown that at least one of these two          aspartic acids is protonated We used a protonated Asp           and deprotonated Asp  for all HIV proteaseligand          complexes The terminal residues of both monomers were          also protonated Pro  Pro  Phe  and Phe           The complexes were immersed in a   radius sphere of          TIPwater using the program SOLVATE    to allow the          proteinligand complexes to relax in an aqueous          environment One hundred steps of energy minimization of          the proteinligandwater complex were initially          performed followed by  ps MD simulation at  K with          an atombased shifted distancedependent dielectric          constant   r a switch function on van der Waals          interaction and a time step of  femtosecond fs The          nonbonded interaction list was updated every  time          steps The van der Waals interactions were truncated at a          distance of   The simulations were repeated with five          different starting seeds The structures at  ps           ps  ps and  ps were recorded and processed in the          docking step                          Preparation of proteaseinhibitor complexes          To calculate the binding energy with AutoDock we          first prepared the protein complexes by separating each          snapshot recorded from MD simulations into one file          containing the protease and the water molecules and one          file containing only the ligand Polar hydrogens were          then added to the protein coordinates with the PROTONATE          utility from AMBER     AMBER united atom force field          charges were assigned and solvation parameters were          added using the ADDSOL utility The D affinity grid          fields were created using the auxiliary program AutoGrid          The center of protein mass was chosen as the grid center          In this stage the protein was embedded in the D grid          and a probe atom was placed at each grid point The          affinity and electrostatic potential grid was calculated          for each type of atom in the protease molecule The          number of grid points in x y zaxis was               with grid points separated by            Ligands that had a peptidelike N or Cterminal end          were assigned a charge Hydrogen atoms were added to fill          all empty valences and Kollman unitedatom charges             were also assigned to the ligands Rotatable dihedrals          in the ligands were assigned using the program AutoTors          and were allowed to rotate freely The nonpolar hydrogens          were removed and the partial charges from these were          added to the carbon that held the hydrogen The atom type          for the aromatic carbons was reassigned to be handled by          the aromatic carbon grid map These preparations were          done for each ligand using the AutoTors module                          Automated docking          Docking calculations were carried out using AutoDock          version      Three binding energy terms were          taken into account in the docking step the van der Waals          interaction represented as a LennardJones           dispersionrepulsion term the hydrogen bonding          represented as a directional  term and the          Coulombic electrostatic potential          Docking runs were performed using the Larmarckian          genetic algorithm LGA    as previously described              with some modifications of the docking          parameters The LGA describes the relationship between          the protein and the ligand by the translation          orientation and conformation of the ligand These state          variables are the ligands genotype and the resulting          atomic coordinates together with the interaction and          intermolecular energies are the ligands phenotype The          environmental adaptation of the ligands phenotype was          reverse transcribed into its genotype and became          heritable traits          Docking began with a population of random ligand          conformations in random orientations and at random          translations Each docking experiment was derived from           different runs that was set to terminate after a          maximum of  energy evaluations or           generations yielding  docked conformations The          population size was set to  The elitism number the          rate of gene mutation and the rate of gene crossover were            and  respectively A pseudoSolis and Wets          local search was then used to minimize energy of the          population The probability that docking solution in the          population would undergo a local search was set to           and the constraint was set to a maximum of  iterations          per search The maximum number of successes or failures          before changing the size of local search space rho were          both set to  The starting conformations of the ligand          were set to random positions Translations were set to          have a maximum limit of  step and the orientation step          size for the angular component and the torsions had a          maximum limit at  degreesstep          At the end of a docking job with multiple runs          AutoDock performed cluster analysis Docking solutions          with ligand allatom RMSDs within   of each other          were clustered together and ranked by the lowest energy          representative The lowestenergy solution of the lowest          ligand allatom RMSD cluster was accepted as the          calculated binding energy                            Authors contributions        EJ performed Molecular Dynamics simulations docking        evaluated the results and drafted the manuscript RS        helped with
