                    Synopsis                  Introduction          Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a chronic systemic          autoimmune disease that is characterized by joint          inflammation and progressive cartilage and bone erosion          Recent research has identified certain biologic agents          that appear more able than conventional therapies to halt          effectively the progression of disease as well as          ameliorate disease symptoms One potential problem with          the use of biologic agents for arthritis therapy is the          need for daily or weekly repeat dosing The transfer of          genes directly to the synovial lining can theoretically          circumvent the need for repeat dosing and reduce          potential systemic side effects    However          although many genes have been effective in treating          murine CIA if administrated at a time before disease          onset local intraarticular or periarticular gene          transfer has not been highly effective in halting the          progression of established disease IL similar to          tumor necrosis factor TNF and IL inhibitors has          been shown be therapeutic for the treatment of murine CIA          when administered intravenously as a recombinant protein          either alone or in combination with IL IL can          downregulate the production of proinflammatory and          Thelper Thtype cytokines by inducing mRNA          degradation and upregulating the expression of inhibitors          of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL receptor          antagonist ILRa    IL is able to inhibit IL          and IFN production by Th cells resulting in          suppression of macrophage activation and the production          of the proinflammatory cytokines IL IL IL and          TNF by monocytes and macrophages                                          Objective          In order to examine the therapeutic effects of local          and systemic IL expression in established CIA an          adenoviral vector carrying the gene for murine IL          AdmIL was generated The ability of AdmIL to          treat established CIA was evaluated by local          periarticular and systemic intravenous injection of          AdmIL into mice at various times after disease          onset                          Materials and methods          Male DBA lacJ H           q  mice aged  weeks were          purchased from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME          USA The mice were immunized intradermally at the base          of tail with   g bovine type II collagen On day           after priming mice received a boost injection          intradermally with   g type II collagen in          incomplete adjuvant For the synchronous onset of          arthritis   g lipopolysaccharide Sigma St Louis          MO USA was injected intraperitoneally on day           AdmIL was injected periarticularly into the hind ankle          joints of mice on day  or intravenously by tail vein          injection on day  Disease severity was monitored every          other day using an established macroscopic scoring system          ranging from  to   normal  detectable arthritis          with erythma  significant swelling and redness           severe swelling and redness from joint to digit and           maximal swelling with ankylosis The average of          macroscopic score was expressed as a cumulative value for          all paws with a maximum possible score of  per mouse          Cytokine production by joint tissue or serum were          assessed using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA          RD Systems Minneapolis MN USA                          Results          To examine the therapeutic effects of IL gene          transfer in a murine model of arthritis  particles          of AdmIL and enhanced green fluorescent protein          AdeGFP were administered by periarticular injection          into the ankle joints of mice with established disease           days after lipopolysaccharide injection All mice had          established disease at time of injection As shown in          Figure  the severity of arthritis Fig a paw          thickness Fig b and the number of arthritic paws          Fig c were all significantly reduced in the AdmIL          group compared with the saline and AdeGFPtreated          groups Analysis of the bones in the ankle joints of          control arthritic mice showed evidence of erosion with an          associated monocytic infiltrate around the joint space          compared with the AdmILtreated and nonarthritic          control joints In addition injection of the ankle          joints in the hind legs resulted in a therapeutic effect          in the front paws A similar contralateral effect has          been observed with adenoviralmediated delivery of viral          vIL Interestingly a high level of murine IL          also was detected from the joint lysates of          AdmILtreated nave and arthritic mice with the          production of endogenous IL correlating with the dose          of AdmIL The administration of recombinant IL          protein systemically has been shown to be therapeutic in          murine CIA models if given before disease onset To          examine the effect of systemic IL delivered by gene          transfer  particles of AdmIL were injected via          the tail vein of collagenimmunized mice the day after          lipopolysaccharide injection Whereas the immunized          control mice injected with AdeGFP showed disease onset          on day  after lipopolysaccharide injection          AdmILtreated mice showed a delay in disease onset and          as a reduction in the total number of arthritic paws          Also systemic injection of AdmIL suppressed the          severity of arthritis in CIA mice according to arthritis          index                          Discussion          Gene therapy represents a novel approach for delivery          of therapeutic agents to joints in order to treat the          pathologies associated with RA and osteoarthritis as          well as other disorders of the joints In the present          study we examined the ability of local periarticular and          systemic gene transfer of IL to treat established and          earlystage murine CIA respectively We have          demonstrated that both local and systemic administration          of AdmIL resulted in a reduction in the severity of          arthritis as well as in the number of arthritic paws In          addition the local gene transfer of IL reduced          histologic signs of inflammation and of bone erosion          Interestingly local delivery of AdmIL was able to          confer a therapeutic effect to the untreated front paws          through a currently unknown mechanism In addition both          local and systemic expression of IL resulted in an          increase in the level of endogenous IL as well as of          ILRa data not shown Previous experiments have shown          that gene transfer of IL and IL and TNF inhibitors          at the time of disease initiation day  is          therapeutic However delivery of these agents after          disease onset appeared to have only limited therapeutic          effect In contrast the present results demonstrate that          IL resulting from local periarticular and systemic          injection of AdmIL was able partially to reverse          progression of established and earlystage disease          respectively These results as well as those of others          support the potential application of IL gene therapy          for the clinical treatment of RA                            Introduction        RA is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that is        characterized by joint inflammation and progressive        cartilage and bone erosion Currently the symptoms of        arthritis are managed using pharmacologic agents including        both steroidal and nonsteroidal drugs and        diseasemodifying drugs such as methotrexate No        pharmacologic agents have yet proven effective in halting        the progression of disease however Recent research has        identified certain biologic agents that appear more able        than conventional therapies to halt effectively the        progression of disease as well as ameliorate disease        symptoms In particular inhibitors of TNF and IL have        proven effective in clinical trials and the US Food and        Drug Administration has approved the use of soluble TNF        receptor for treatment of human RA One potential problem        with the use of biologic agents for arthritis therapy is        the need for daily or weekly repeat dosing The transfer of        genes directly to the synovial lining can theoretically        circumvent the need for repeat dosing and reduce potential        systemic side effects    Exvivo and invivo methods        have been used to deliver therapeutic genes such as those        that encode IL vIL soluble TNF and IL receptors        and ILRa to arthritic mouse   rat   dog          and rabbit joints   Although many genes have been        effective in treating murine CIA if they are administered        before disease onset local periarticular gene transfer has        not been highly effective in halting the progression of        established disease        IL similar to TNF and IL inhibitors has been        shown be therapeutic for the treatment of murine CIA when        administered intravenously as a recombinant protein either        alone or in combination with IL IL can downregulate        the production of proinflammatory and Thtype cytokines by        inducing mRNA degradation and upregulating the expression        of inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines such as ILRa           IL is able to inhibit IL and IFN production by        Th cells resulting in suppression of macrophage        activation and the production of the proinflammatory        cytokines IL IL IL and TNF by monocytes and        macrophages       In addition IL inhibits        growth factorinduced RA synoviocyte proliferation and        expression of prostaglandin E and matrix        metalloproteinase in RA synovial fibroblast            and reduces bone resorption Given that IL is able        to inhibit the production of both IL and TNF block        synovial cell proliferation and bone loss and promote the        formation of Th lymphocytes it represents an attractive        cytokine for treating arthritis by gene transfer        To examine the therapeutic effects of local and systemic        IL expression in established CIA we have generated an        adenoviral vector carrying the gene for murine IL        AdmIL The ability of AdmIL to treat established        CIA was evaluated by local periarticular and systemic        intravenous injections of AdmIL into mice at various        times after disease onset Local injection of AdmIL        resulted in a reduction in the severity of arthritis and        joint swelling and reduced macroscopic signs of joint        inflammation and bone erosion Injection of the ankle        joints in the hind legs also resulted in a therapeutic        effect in the untreated front paws A high level of        endogenous murine IL was detected in the joint tissues        of mice injected locally with AdmIL Systemic delivery        of murine IL by intravenous injection of AdmIL also        resulted in a slight delay in the onset of disease with a        significant reduction in the number of arthritic paws        These results demonstrate that local and systemic gene        transfer of IL is able to treat established and        earlystage disease respectively in a mouse model of        arthritis and thus may be useful for clinical applications        for the treatment of RA                    Materials and methods                  Mice          Male DBA lacJ H           q  mice aged  weeks were          purchased from The Jackson Laboratory They were          maintained in a specific pathogenfree animal facility of          the University of Pittsburgh Biotechnology Center For          local periarticular injection mice were anesthetized          with inhalation of  isoflurane gas A maximum of            l diluted adenovirus was injected into joint articular          space under the ankle joint bone in each hind paw with a          gauge Hamilton syringe For systemic delivery of          adenovirus  l diluted adenovirus was injected          intravenously via the tail vein                          Vector construction and adenovirus          generation          AdmIL was constructed and propagated according to          standard protocols as previously described            Briefly recombinant adenoviruses were generated by          homologous recombination in CRE cells a  cell line          that expresses Cre recombinase between psi an          Adderived E and Edeleted adenovirus and pAdlox          the adenoviral shuttle vector that expresses IL The          inserted cDNA sequences are expressed under the          transcriptional control of human cytomegalovirus          promoter          Vectors were purified using two consecutive CsCl          gradient ultracentrifugation dialyzed at C against          sterile virus buffer aliquoted and stored at C          until use The titers of the adenoviral stocks were          determined by incubating serial dilutions of the stocks          at C for  min with subconfluent  cells Viral          titers were calculated by determining the highest          dilution that produced  viral cytopathic effect          which was then multiplied by the number of cells per well          and by the dilution factor CRE and  cell lines were          grown in Dulbeccos modified eagle medium GIBCOBRL          Rockville MD USA supplemented with  fetal bovine          serum                          Induction of arthritis          Bovine typeII collagen Chondrex Seattle WA USA          was dissolved in moll acetic acid at a concentration          of mgml by stirring overnight at C and emulsified in          equal volumes of FCA containing mgml heatkilled           Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain          HRa The mice were immunized intradermally at the base          of tail with   g collagen On day  after priming          the mice were boosted with  g type II collagen in          incomplete adjuvant In order to synchronize the onset of          arthritis   g lipopolysaccharide Sigma was injected          intraperitoneally on day                           Disease evaluation          Disease severity was assessed every other day using an          established macroscopic scoring system ranging from  to            normal  detectable arthritis with erythma           significant swelling and redness  severe swelling and          redness from joint to digit and  maximal swelling with          ankylosis The macroscopic score mean  standard          deviation was expressed as a cumulative value for all          paws with a maximum possible score of  The thickness          of each paw was also measured using a springload          caliper The paw swelling for each mouse was calculated          by adding the four thicknesses of the individual paws In          addition the number of arthritic paws of individual mice          were counted and added to represent the number of          arthritic paws in a group The           in vivo experiments were performed          with  micegroup and repeated three times to ensure          reproducibility                          Histologic examination          Joint tissues from freshly dissected mice were          immersionfixed in  neutral buffered formalin and          decalcified in  ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid          glycerol for  weeks Tissues were then dehydrated in          graded alcohols embedded in paraplast sectioned at  m          on a microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin          Sections were evaluated in a blinded manner for          histologic signs of arthritis and scored as follows           synovial cell proliferation synovial hypertrophy with          villus formation andor fibrin deposition           inflammation synovitis andor generalized inflammation           cartilage disruption chondrocyte degeneration andor          ruffling of cartilage surface andor dystrophic          cartilage and  joint destruction cartilage erosion          with abundant inflammation and pannus formation with bone          erosion                          Type II collagen antibody titration          Serum level of antibody against type II collagen was          measured using a standard ELISA assay Briefly a well          ImmunoMaxisorp Plate Nunc Naperville IL USA was          coated with bovine type

washing bound antibody isotope was detected with          biotinconjugated antimouse whole IgG heavy and light          chain antibody Pharmingen San Diego CA USA          Thereafter plates were washed incubated with   l          azinodiethylbenzthiazolinesulfonate substrate          ABTS Boeringer Mannheim Indianapolis IN USA at          mgml and read at nm                          Cytokine production          Cytokine production in the joint tissue or serum was          assessed by ELISA RD systems For measuring the          cytokine production peeled joint tissues from the upper          portion of ankle to the middle of the paw were ground by          homogenizer in the equal volume of the lysis buffer          mmoll potassuim phosphate pH  and  TritonX           Cytokine production was standardized as amount of          cytokine per gram of tissue                          Statistical analysis          Results were compared using the Students           t test and by analysis of          variance           P  was considered          statistically significant                            Results                  Local delivery of AdmIL in established CIA mouse          model          To establish CIA weekold aged DBAlacJ male mice          were immunized with   g bovine type II collagen          emulsified in complete adjuvant After  days the mice          were boosted with the same amount of collagen in          incomplete adjuvant with disease pathology observed          starting  days after immunization In order to          synchronize the onset of arthritis lipopolysaccharide          was injected intraperitoneally on day  excluding the          mice that had already showed signs of disease pathology          All of the collagenimmunized mice had swollen and red          paws and ankle joints within  days after          lipopolysaccharide injection          In order to examine the therapeutic effects of IL          gene transfer in a murine model of arthritis increasing          doses of an AdmIL recombinant virus were administered          by periarticular injection into the hind ankle joints of          mice with established disease  days after          lipopolysaccharide injection          As shown in Figure  all mice had established disease          at time of injection However the severity of arthritis          Fig a paw thickness Fig b and the number of          arthritic paws Fig c were all significantly reduced          in the AdmIL group compared with the saline and          AdeGFPtreated groups          Analysis of the bones in the ankle joints of control          arthritic mice showed evidence of erosion with an          associated monocytic infiltrate around the joint space          Fig a compared with the nonarthritic control joints          In contrast the joints from AdmILtreated mice showed          less inflammatory joint tissue reduction in bone          erosion and reduction in the number of inflammatory          cells The changes in histology of the ankle joints from          sections from five mice per group were also scored in a          blinded manner As shown in Figure b significant          inhibition of disease progression as assessed by joint          histology was observed in the AdmILtreated group          These results suggest that local expression of IL          after gene transfer to joints with established disease          could effectively protect tissue from inflammation as          well as block bone erosion It is important to note that          the possible inflammatory responses to adenoviral          injection were examined by injection of the same number          of particles of AdmIL and AdeGFP into nave joints of          DBA mice At the doses of virus used however no          inflammation was observed data not shown                          Reduction in disease severity in noninjected front          paws by local injection of IL          Previously we have noted a contralateral effect in          which treatment of a diseased joint by          adenovirusmediated transfer of the gene that encodes          vIL resulted in a therapeutic effect in noninjected          joints To determine whether AdmIL was able to confer          a contralateral effect the severity of disease in the          hind and front paws of the mice injected only in the hind          ankle joints was evaluated As shown in Figure a a          reduction in the arthritis index was observed in the          AdmIL injected hind leg ankle joints of the CIA mice          Interestingly the noninjected front paws also showed a          statistically significant reduction in the severity of          arthritis Fig b Taken together these results          suggest that local periarticular injection of AdmIL          resulted in a therapeutic effect in both injected and          noninjected joints However unlike vIL IL is able          to confer a contralateral therapeutic effect in mice with          established disease                          Stimulation of endogenous IL expression by local          IL gene delivery          To test the level and duration of gene expression           particles of AdmIL AdmIL and AdeGFP were          injected periarticularly into the ankle joints of nave          DBA mice Joint tissues were isolated at indicated time          points homogenized in lysis buffer and the lysates          analyzed for cytokine production by ELISA Maximal IL          expression was detected on day  with the level          gradually decreasing over time Fig a However it is          important to note that it is unclear whether the level of          IL detected in the joints at the different time points          is partially due to induction of endogenous IL          Interestingly a high level of murine IL also was          detected from the joint lysates of AdmILinjected          animals Fig b that directly correlated with the dose          of AdmIL data not shown An increase in the level of          IL expression could even be detected  weeks after          injection of a high dose of AdmIL          The levels of IL and IL expression also were          examined in arthritic mice treated with AdmIL at day           after injection As shown in Figure a a slight          increase in IL expression was observed in that          correlated with the dose of AdmIL Fig a A similar          increase at day  was also observed in nave mice data          not shown In addition a significant dosedependent          increase in the level of endogenous IL  days after          AdmIL administration was observed in the CIAtreated          animals Fig b These results demonstrated that IL          transgene expression was detectable for up to  weeks          after AdmIL delivery and that IL was able to induce          the production of endogenous IL in the joints of both          nave and immunized mice In addition expression of IL          resulted in a twofold increase in the level of endogenous          ILRa data not shown In contrast periarticular          injection of AdmIL did not affect the level of          expression of endogenous levels of IL Fig a and          ILRa data not shown Taken together these results          suggest that the therapeutic effects of exogenous IL          could be mediated in part through the induction of          endogenous IL and ILRa                          Delay of disease onset by systemic AdmIL          administration          The administration of recombinant IL protein          systemically has been shown to be therapeutic in murine          CIA models if given before onset of disease onset To          examine the effect of systemic IL delivered by gene          transfer  particles of AdmIL were administered          intravenously by tail vein injection of the          collagenimmunized mice on the day after          lipopolysaccharide injection Whereas the immunized mice          injected with AdeGFP showed disease onset on day  after          lipopolysaccharide injection ILtreated mice showed a          delay in disease onset Fig a as well as a reduction          in the total number of arthritic paws Fig c In          addition seven out of the  AdmILtreated mice were          diseasefree for up to  days after lipopolysaccharide          injection and two mice were disease free at the end of          the experiment on day  In addition systemic injection          of AdmIL suppressed the severity of arthritis in the          CIA mice according to arthritis index Fig b Thus          systemic delivery of IL by adenovirusmediated gene          transfer is able to reduce the onset and severity of          earlystage disease                          IL and IL expression in sera of CIA mice          administered AdmIL systemically          To examine the duration of IL expression as well as          induction of endogenous IL expression serum was          collected from the mice and tested for levels of IL and          IL Fig  An elevated level of IL was detected in          on day  Fig a and on day  Fig c after IL          injection In addition although there was no observed          increase in the expression of IL in the sera at day           after systemic delivery of IL Fig b IL was          elevated in the sera at day  Fig d In contrast          the levels of IL and IL in the saline or          AdeGFPtreated control groups were not significantly          above background after either or local AdmIL delivery          Thus the early therapeutic effects of IL after          systemic delivery most likely are not mediated by IL          In contrast it is possible that the therapeutic effects          of IL after local injection are conferred in part by          IL                            Discussion        Gene therapy represents a novel approach for delivery of        therapeutic agents to joints in order to treat the        pathologies associated with RA and osteoarthritis as well        as other disorders of the joints Previously we and others        have shown that local         ex vivo and         in vivo gene transfer of vIL        ILRa IFN soluble IL receptor and soluble TNF        receptor are able to block certain intraarticular        pathologies in rabbit rat and murine models of arthritis        IL like IL is a Th cytokine that has been        demonstrated to be therapeutic for the treatment of        arthritis after systemic administration of recombinant        protein        In the present study we examined the ability of local        periarticular gene transfer of IL to treat established        murine CIA We demonstrated that both local and systemic        administration of AdmIL resulted in a reduction in the        severity of established and earlystage arthritis        respectively as well as in the number of arthritic paws        In addition the local gene transfer of AdmIL reduced        histologic signs of inflammation as well as bone erosion        Previous experiments have shown that gene transfer of IL        and IL and TNF inhibitors at the time of disease        initiation day  was therapeutic However delivery of        these agents after disease onset appeared to have only        limited therapeutic effect In contrast the present        results demonstrate that local IL delivery was able        partially to reverse progression of established disease        after local periarticular injection        Interestingly local and systemic expression of IL        resulted in an increase in the level of endogenous IL as        well as ILRa Previous reports have shown that an        additive or possible synergistic therapeutic effect can be        achieved in animal models of arthritis with combined        treatment with recombinant IL and IL Treatment of        mice with IL and IL results in reduction in TNF and        IL production with a concomitant shift in the        ILRaIL ratio    The fact that the therapeutic        effects of IL and IL are potentially synergistic is        possibly due to the fact that they suppress proinflammatory        mediator production through different mechanisms IL is        able to block transcription of TNF and IL genes whereas        IL stimulates degradation of TNF and IL mRNAs          Thus it is likely that the therapeutic effects we observed        after local injection of AdmIL are due to both exogenous        IL and endogenous IL production However the delayed        induction of IL after systemic administration of        AdmIL suggests that the initial therapeutic effects are        not conferred by IL        A mechanism whereby IL may alter IL and ILRa        levels could involve the regulation of transcription        factors that regulate the respective genes for these        cytokines In particular nuclear factor B and signal        transducer and activator of transcription are important        for conferring transcriptional regulation by IL Signal        transducer and activator of transcription after tyrosine        phosphorylation can bind directly to nuclear factor B          resulting in synergic activation in certain cell        types        The present results suggest that gene transfer of IL        can stimulate expression of endogenous cytokines such as        IL and ILRa as well as possibly endogenous IL        expression Endogenous IL which can be induced by IL        is a natural suppressor of a number of inflammatory        responses Inhibition of endogenous IL with neutralizing        antibodies enhanced endotoxic shock IgG immune        complexinduced lung injury and the severity of CIA             Periarticular delivery of murine or viral        IL by gene transfer resulted in the inhibition of CIA in        mouse models    if delivered before or at the time        of disease onset The present results are also consistent        with the observation that IL but not IL has been        shown to enhance the production of ILRa by RA synovial        cells           IL is a potent mediator in shifting the balance of        ThTh cells and skewing the production of antibody        subtypes   Th effector cell differentiation also is        dependent on the presence of IL during priming          Blocking endogenous IL using neutralizing antibodies has        been shown   to result not only in the absence of T        cells with a Thlike phenotype but also in the appearance        of T cells producing IL and IFN after restimulation        IL is also able to skew the production of antibody        subtype   However we have shown that anticollagen        antibody levels are already very high at day  after        immunization and that IL treatment did not significantly        change these elevated levels data not shown In addition        we did not observe significant differences between IgG        isotypes in the control and AdmIL treated mice data not        shown Thus the mechanisms through which local and        systemic IL administration are able to suppress CIA are        still unclear        We have demonstrated previously that periarticular        injection of adenovirusmediated gene transfer of vIL        into the hind paws of mice with earlystage arthritis was        able to confer a therapeutic effect in the untreated front        paws Similarly administration of vIL into one knee of        rabbits with antigeninduced arthritis was able to confer a        therapeutic effect in the contralateral untreated knee        This observed contralateral effect was not limited to        vIL in that coadministration of adenoviral vectors        expressing soluble IL and soluble TNF receptors also        conferred a similar protective effect to untreated knees        Although the mechanism of the contralateral effect is        unclear we have demonstrated that adoptive transfer of        dendritic cells from animals treated with        adenovirusmediated gene transfer of vIL to untreated        immunized animals is able to confer a therapeutic effect        unpublished data Thus it is possible that local        expression of vIL or IL and TNF inhibitors modulates        the activity of dendritic cells However although vIL        is able to block earlystage disease it is ineffective in        reversing established disease In contrast periarticular        injection of AdmIL was able to reverse pathology in        established disease not only in the treated hind paws but        also in the untreated front paws Interestingly we have        observed that intravenous injection of nave dendritic        cells genetically modified to express IL is able to        effectively treat established arthritis by inhibiting the        Th response unpublished data        During the preparation of this manuscript a similar        study using a recombinant AdmIL vector for treatment of        murine CIA was reported   However the vector was        administered before onset of disease into knee joints        whereas the vector in the present study was injected after        disease onset into ankle joints Similar to the present        results in that study local injection of the recombinant        AdmIL vector resulted in a reduction in bone erosion and        a reduction in cartilage degradation However unlike the        present results no effect on joint inflammation was        observed Moreover in the present report we demonstrated        that both local and systemic injection resulted in        induction of endogenous IL Given the ability of IL to        reverse established disease partially our studies as well        as those of others support the potential application of        IL gene therapy for the clinical treatment of RA
