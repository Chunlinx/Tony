                              A BRIEF HISTORY        Italy has only existed as a nation since  Before then        despite the peninsulas obvious geographical unity bounded by the Alps        and the Mediterranean its story is a fragmented tale of        independentminded cities regions and islandsand the outside        powers who coveted them        We have abundant evidence of the ancient Etruscan Greek        and Roman communities in Italy but know very little of the countrys        earlier prehistoric settlers Vestiges of dwellings survivecabins        on stilts in the frequently flooded Po valley larger clay houses on        the western marshlands of Tuscany and Sardinias still visible domed        drystone nuraghi But the inhabitants Perhaps North Africans and        eastern Europeans peopled the Ligurian coast while the Adriatic and        south may have been settled by people from the Balkans and Asia        Minor        Nobody knows much about the early Etruscans Some historians        believe that they were the first native Italians others believe they        arrived from Asia Minor During the millennium before the Christian        era their civilization reached north beyond Tuscany to the Po valley        and south toward Naples At a time when early Roman and other Latin        tribes were still primitive Etruscan society  itself savage in many        respects  was also aristocratic and highly sophisticated Solid gold        workmanship and other metal ornaments and tools showed a Greek        influence but the Etruscans vaulted architecture town planning and        irrigation systems were indigenous        Arriving in the eighth century bc  the Greeks set up        citystates in Sicily dominated by Syracuse as well as other        settlements on the Italian mainland such as Naples Paestum and        Taranto Together they formed Magna Graecia whose zenith was reached        during the th and th centuries bc        After defeats by Greeks in the south Latins in the center        and Gallic invaders in the north the Etruscan empire faded in the        fourth century bc As Greek colonial power grew weak from        AthensSparta rivalry back home and pressure from Phoenicians in        Sicily the vacuum was filled by an uppity confederation of Latin and        Sabine tribes living on seven hills known collectively as Rome        The Romans        Legend says Rome was founded by Romulus sired with twin        brother Remus by Mars of a Vestal Virgin and abandoned on the Palatine        Hill to be suckled by a shewolf Historians agree with the mythmakers        that the site and traditional founding date of  bc are just about        right        Under Etruscan domination Rome had been a monarchy until a        revolt in  bc established a patrician republic which lasted five        centuries In contrast to other Italian cities weakened by internal        rivalries and unstable government Rome drew strength from a solid        aristocracy of consuls and senate ruling over plebeians proud of their        Roman citizenship and only rarely rebellious        Recovering quickly from the Gallic invasion of  bc         the Romans took effective control of the peninsula by a military        conquest reinforced by a network of roads with names that exist to this        day Via Appia Flaminia Aurelia All roads did indeed lead toand        fromRome By  bc  the citys population had grown to an        impressive         Roman power extended throughout the Mediterranean with a        victory in the Punic Wars against Carthage now Tunisia and conquests        in Macedonia Asia Minor Spain and southern France The rest of Italy        participated only by tax contributions to the war effort and minor        involvement in commerce and colonization Resentment surfaced when        former Etruscan or Greek cities such as Capua Syracuse and Taranto        supported Hannibals invasion in  bc Rome followed up defeat of        the Carthaginians with largescale massacres and enslavement of their        Italian supporters The Third and final Punic War ended in  bc         though national solidarity was still a long way off        Under Julius Caesar elected in  bc  provincial towns        won the privileges of Roman citizenship His reformist dictatorship        bypassing the senate to combat unemployment and ease the tax burden        made dangerous enemies After being appointed dictator for life he was        assassinated by Brutus among others on the Ides of March  bc        This led to civil war and the despotic rule of Octavian nephew and        heir of Julius Caesar whose new title of Augustus Caesar signified the        collapse of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire in         bc        Conquest of the Greeks accelerated rather than halted the        influence of their culture in Italy Romans infused Greek refinement        with their own energy to create a unique mixture of elegance and        realism delicacy and strength which have remained the essence of        Italian life and art        In architecture the Romans made a quantum leap forward        from the Greek structures of columns and beams by developing the arch        vault and dome well suited to the needs of the empire The Romans        built basilicas for public administration pioneered the new        engineering of aqueducts and bridges and erected triumphal arches for        victorious armies They adopted the Greeks gods convertingZeus into        Jupiter Aphrodite into Venus and placing the emperor serving the        interests of the Roman stateat the apex of the gods        Throughout the centuries of imperial expansion decline        and fall Italy took a back seat as the realm of power moved with the        armies away from Rome east to Byzantium and to the north as far as        Gaul or Germany        Despite the dramatic persecution under Nero in the first        century ad  Christianity spread from Rome through southern Italy        then continued northward Constantine the Great declared Christianity        the official state religion in ad  he later boldly transferred        the capital to Byzantium Constantinople in  At the end of the        fourth century Emperor Theodosius the Great organized the Church into        dioceses making Ravenna the new capital of the Western Empire with        Constantinople as capital of the Eastern Empire Rome would never be        the same again The position of Bishop of Rome as primate of the        Western Church pope derived from papa the Latin word for father        first claimed in the second century was later asserted by Pope Leo I         who traced the succession back to St Peter        The invasion of Attilas Huns and the Goths and Vandals who        came to sack rape murder and pillage Rome brought an end to the        Western Empire in  with the abdication of Emperor Romulus        Augustus        After the Empire        Wars between the Goths and Byzantines followed by new waves        of invasions made Italian unity impossible        The dual influence of Greek and Latin culture persisted        Emperor Justinian  and his wife Theodora reannexed Italy to        the Byzantine Empire and codified Roman law as the states legal        system Under Heraclius  Greek was extended to Italy as its        official language        Hellenistic and Oriental influences were most evident in        religion Byzantine ritual colored the Roman liturgy The Roman        basilicas long colonnaded nave leading to an apse gave way to the        Greek cross with a central space surrounded by arches and topped by a        dome Sculptural reliefs flattened out to symbolic decorative        nonhuman forms and painting and mosaics were rich in color but more        rigid and formal Spiritual preoccupations turned away from the worlds        few joys and woes in the present to mystic contemplation of the        ineffable hereafter        Things were much too ineffable it seems for Italian        tastes The monastic movement founded by St Benedict of Umbria in the        sixth century reasserted involvement in the realities of social life        The Benedictine order emphasized moderation in the austerity of its        food clothing and sleep not unlike the habits of any peasant of the        times Flagellation and similar rigors introduced into other Italian        monasteries by the Irish monk Columbanus were soon modified by the        gentler Benedictine rule        By the eighth century the Byzantines held the balance of        power with the Lombards a Germanic tribe who had invaded Italy in         and set up their capital at Pavia four years later The Lombards        controlled the interior in a loose confederation of fiercely        independent duchies Lombard territory split Byzantine Italy up into        segments ruled from the coasts The divisions resulted in Veneto        Venice and its hinterland Emilia between Ravenna and Modena and        Pentapolo between Rimini and Perugia plus Rome and Naples with        Sicily and Calabria        In Rome the highly political popes played the Lombard        duchies against those of the Byzantine Empire They cited a forged        document the Donation of Constantine supposedly bequeathing them        political authority over all of Italy Seeking the powerful support of        the Franks Pope Leo III crowned their king Charlemagne Emperor of        the West on Christmas Day in  But in turn the pope had to kneel in        allegiance and this exchange of spiritual blessing for military        protection laid the seeds of future conflict between the papacy and        secular rulers compounded in  when Otto I was crowned Emperor of        the newly formed Holy Roman Empire        Venice founded on its islets and lagoons in the sixth        century by mainland refugees fleeing Lombard raiders prospered from a        privileged relationship with Byzantium and an uninhibited readiness to        trade with Muslims and others farther east The merchants of Venice        that were the backbone of the Most Serene Republic were only too happy        to dessiminate their Oriental cargoes of exotic goods to the dour lives        of Lombards in the Po valley and beyond the Alps to the courts of        northern Europe        Naples held on to its autonomy by combining links with Rome        and Constantinople When Arabs conquered Sicily in the ninth century        and turned to the mainland Naples at first sought an alliance But as        the invaders advanced north towards Rome Naples successfully linked up        with the then powerful maritime republic of neighboring Amalfi Despite        military expeditions by the Franks and Byzantines however the Arabs        remained on the Italian scene for two centuries Their influences in        the sciences and foods they brought with them are still felt today        The Middle Ages        In the th century the adventurous Normans put an end to        Arab control of Sicily and southern Italy Exploiting a natural genius        for assimilating the useful elements of the local culture rather than        indiscriminately imposing their own they adopted Arabstyle tax        collectors and customs officials and Byzantine fleetadmirals for their        navy In Palermo churches and mosques stood sidebyside feudal        castles next to Oriental palaces and their exotic gardens        The Crusades against the Islamic threat to Christendom        brought great prosperity to Italys port cities Pisa sided with the        Normans in Sicily and profits from its new commercial empire in the        western Mediterranean paid for its magnificent cathedral baptistery        and campanile todays Leaning Tower Genoas equally powerful        merchant empire spread from Algeria to Syria        Supreme master of the art of playing all sides Venice        stayed out of the First Crusade to expand its trade with the faraway        East while ferrying pilgrims to Palestine Later when Byzantium        threatened its eastern trading privileges Venice persuaded the armies        of the Fourth Crusade to attack Constantinople in  conquering        Byzantium strengthened its position even more        The Po valleys economic expansion through land clearance        and new irrigation works brought a rapid decline of feudalism Dukes        administrators and clergy lived in towns rather than isolated castles        absorbing the hinterland into communes forerunners of the        citystates        The communes were strong enough to confine German Emperor        Frederick Barbarossas Italian ambitions to the south where he secured        Sicily for his Hohenstaufen heirs by marrying his son into the Norman        royal family Ruling from Palermo Barbarossas highly cultured but        brutal grandson Frederick II  was a prototype for the future        Renaissance prince        His power struggle with the papacy divided the country into        two highly volatile campsGuelfs supporting the pope and Ghibellines        supporting the emperor The backbone of the Guelfs was in communes such        as Florence and Genoa In  they financed the mercenary army of        Charles dAnjou to defeat the imperial forcesand take the Sicilian        throne But Palermo rose up against the French in the murderous        Sicilian Vespers of  when the locals massacred everyone who spoke        Italian with a French accent and forced Charles to move his capital to        Naples The Sicilians offered their crown to the Spanish house of        Aragon        The GuelfGhibelline conflict became a pretext for settling        family feuds such as the one typified in Shakespeares Romeo and        Juliet or communal rivalries from which Genoa and Florence emerged        stronger than ever In Rome the dissolute popes repeatedly switched        factions for temporary advantage and lost all political and moral        authority in the process        After two centuries of religious heresy the Church needed        a spiritual renewal finding the perfect ally in Francis of Assisi         pious without being troublesomely militant His sermons        had immense popular appeal He chose not to attack Church corruption        but instead to preach the values of a Christly life The Franciscan        order provided a much needed manageable revival The architecture of        the church built in his name at Assisi contradicted Franciss humble        testament denouncing temples of great dimension and rich ornament         But Assisis frescoes of the saints life painted by Cimabue and        disciples of Giotto which barely survived the severe earthquake of         proved an immensely effective act of artistic propaganda against        the prevalent libertinism and heresy        The CityStates        By the end of the th century with the independentminded        communes growing into fullfledged citystates Italy was clearly not        to be subjugated to the will of one ruler        The Middle Ages in Italy were far from being the murky era        that many humanist scholars liked to contrast with the brilliance of        the Renaissance Bologna founded Europes first university famous        above all for its law studies in the th century followed by        institutions of learning in Padua Naples Modena Siena Salerno and        Palermo Unlike other Churchdominated European universities Italian        universities emphasized the sciences medicine and law over        theology        In the absence of political unification it was the        universities that awakened the national consciousness Scholars        traveling across the country needed a common tongue beyond the elitist        Latin to break through the barriers of regional dialects It was a        foreigner German Emperor Frederick II who launched the movement for a        national language at his court in Palermo but Florentineborn Dante        Alighieri  provided the ardor moral leadership and        literary example to bring it to fruition        The maritime republic of Genoa rose to challenge Venices        supremacy It dislodged Pisa in the western Mediterranean whittled        away at Venices hold on eastern ports and set up colonies on the        Black Sea for trade with Russia and faraway Cathay But Genoas         participation in the ruinous Chioggia War on the Venetian lagoon        exhausted its resources Its newly formed Bank of St George had to        sell off overseas colonies It ran the town like a private company for        the benefit of a local oligarchy seeking future prosperity as        international financiers for the kings of Spain or France        Venice and its Repubblica Serena rebounded to turn to the        mainland extending its Veneto territory from Padua across the Po        valley as far as Bergamo After relying exclusively on overseas trade        Venice created a new landowning aristocracy through this        expansion        In its fertile Po valley Milan prospered from trade with        Germany principally in textiles and armor Escaping unscathed from the        Black Death of  and subsequent plagues it built up a sound        economic base and maintained a strong army with plentiful manpower        Florence was the first Italian town to mint its own gold        coin fiorino or florin a prestigious instrument for trade in        European markets and it organized textile manufacture on an advanced        largescale basis Despite uprisings such as that of the Ciompi        woolworkers the resilient Florentines were wellfed and highly        literate compared to the rest of the country The wealthy and ambitious        Medici not doctors as their name implied emerged as the dominant        merchant family Cosimo the Elder  became the citys ruler        and founder of the Medici dynasty in  A building boom underlined        the prosperity Giottos Campanile was at last completed as were        Ghibertis great baptistery doors and Brunelleschis dome on the        cathedral        Divided in the th century between the Spanish in Sicily        and the French in Naples southern Italy remained solidly feudal Its        almost exclusively agricultural economy suffered much more than the        north from plague and famine Landlords resorted to banditry to        replenish their treasury As Palermo was in decline Naples flourished        as a brilliant cosmopolitan capital In  it was reunited with        Sicily and known as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies under the Spanish        King Alfonso V of Aragon        With the papacy in comfortable exile in Avignon since         the brutal rule of the Orsini and Colonna families reduced Rome to a        halfurban halfrural backwater village Selfeducated visionary Cola        di Rienzo governed briefly in  until the nobles drove him out        After thirty years the papacy returned        The Renaissance        A new national fraternity of scholars with expertise in the        arts sciences and law emerged as itinerant consultants to visionary        rulers eager to make their citystates centers of cultural prestige and        political propaganda        Men like Leon Battista Alberti brilliant        architectmathematicianpoet brought about a new spirit of inquiry and        scepticism From their detailed study and translation of the Greek        philosophers they developed principles of objective scientific        research independent of all the political religious and emotional        bias characterizing medieval scholarship The emphasis switched from        heaven to earth        Leonardo da Vinci eagerly applied the new method to        architecture civil and military engineering urban planning        geography and mapmaking It was Giorgio Vasari facile artist but        firstrate chronicler of this cultural explosion who allegedly dubbed        it a rinascita or rebirth of the glories of Italys GrecoRoman past        But even more it proved with the humanism of Leonardo and        Michelangelo and the political realism of Machiavelli to be the birth        of our modern age        Unfortunately the creative ferment by no means precluded        new horrors of war assassination persecution plunder and rape It        was the heyday of the brilliant but lethal SpanishItalian Borgias        lecherous Rodrigo who became Pope Alexander VI and treacherous son        Cesare who stopped at nothing to control and expand the papal lands        His sister Lucrezia forever smeared by antiSpanish propaganda of the        day as mistress of both her father and brother was in fact as Duchess        of Ferrara a generous patroness of the arts and benefactress of the        poor        In Florence where his family had to fight tooth and nail        to hold on to their supremacy Lorenzo il Magnifico de Medici         found time to encourage the art of Perugino Ghirlandaio        Botticelli the young Leonardo and tempestuous Michelangelo But        decadence set in and Dominican monk and rabblerousing preacher        Girolamo Savonarola  denounced the corruption of a Church        and society more devoted to pagan classics than to the Christian        gospel At the Carnival of  he shamed the Florentines into        throwing their vanitiesnot only clothes jewelry and cosmetics        but books and paintings with Botticelli contributing some of his        ownonto a giant fire on the Piazza della Signoria Four years later        when Savonarola declined to test the validity of his apocalyptic        prophesies with an ordeal by fire he was arrested hanged and        ironically burned on the Piazza della Signoria        On the international scene the Turkish conquest of        Constantinople in  closed Genoas Black Sea markets but competitor        Venice worked out a new deal in Cyprus and even a modus vivendi in        Constantinople itself But the Venetians empire declined as they lost        their taste for the adventure of commerce in favor of the safety of        their landholdings From  to  the Spanish Hapsburgs and the        French turned Italy into a battleground for the Kingdom of Naples and        the Duchy of Milan Genoa sided with the Spanish to give Emperor        Charles V access via Milan to his German territories and later        became a lucrative clearinghouse for Spains newly discovered American        silver Rome was plundered by imperial armies in  the Medici were        driven out of Florence and returned to power only under tutelage of the        Spanish who won effective control of the whole country        When the dust of war settled it was the dazzling cultural        achievements that left their mark on the age The true father of Romes        High Renaissance Pope Julius II  began the new St Peters        cathedral and commissioned Michelangelo to paint the ceiling of the        Vaticans Sistine Chapel and Raphael to decorate the Stanze Architect        Donato Bramante was nicknamed maestro ruinante because of all the        ancient monuments he dismantled to make way for the popes megalomaniac        building plans With the treasures uncovered in the process Julius        founded the Vaticans magnificent collection of ancient sculpture        CounterReformation        Badly shaken by the Protestant Reformation the Church        convoked the Council of Trent north of Lake Garda in         NonItalian bishops urged the Church to carry out its own reform        hoping to democratize relations with the pope But the threat of        Lutherans Calvinists and other heretics shifted the emphasis to        repression culminating in the CounterReformation formally proclaimed        in  The Church reinforced the Holy Offices Inquisition and the        Index to censor the arts The Jesuits founded in  quickly became        an army of theologians to combat heresy Italian Protestants fled and        Jews in Rome were restricted to a ghetto  years later than the        Venice ghetto Europes first and expelled from Genoa and Lucca        Cardinal Carlo Borromeo nephew of Pope Pius IV and        Archbishop of Milan  was the exemplary spiritual leader of        Italys CounterReformation In alliance with the Jesuits he weeded        out corrupt clerics and what he considered too soft Umiliati order of        Catholic laymen As a symbol of his crusading spirit he consecrated        Milans new Flamboyant Gothic cathedral which took centuries to        complete and remains one of the worlds largest and most famous Gothic        structures        Art proved to be a major instrument of CounterReformation        propaganda but it had to undergo some important changes The vigor and        intellectual integrity of the High Renaissance had softened into the        stylized sophistication of Mannerism the transition from the        Renaissance to the Baroque Condemning the preoccupation with pagan        gods and worldly decadence the Church urged artists to deliver a        strong clear message to bring the troubled flock back to the fold The        Madonna and saints of Annibale Carracci further paved the way for the        Baroque attracting the faithful with a sensuous image of ideal beauty        while Caravaggio made a more brutal but no less effective appeal with        a proletarian Mary and barefoot Apostles As the Church regained        ground it promoted a more triumphant image epitomized by the works of        Bernini the most productive of them all His grandiose Baroque altar        in St Peters speaks rather effectively to the time        But such selfconfidence had its limits For example in         the Vatican ordered Galileo to deny the evidence of his own eyes        as assisted by the new telescope he had designed and stop teaching        that Gods earth was only one of many planets in orbit around the        sun        After a th century in which Naples had become the largest        town in Europeand one of the liveliestthe south was increasingly        oppressed and impoverished The army had to crush revolts in Sicily and        Naples against heavy taxes and conscription for Spains wars in        northern Europe        Towards Nationhood        Lacking the solidarity to unite and too weak to resist by        themselves Italian kingdoms and duchies were reduced to convenient        pawns in Europes thcentury dynastic power plays At the end of the        Wars of Spanish Austrian and Polish Succession the Austrians had        taken over northern Italy from the Spanish The Age of Enlightenment        engendered a new cultural ferment The theater of La Scala opened in        Milan and La Fenice opened in Venice Stimulated by the ideas of        Voltaire Rousseau and Diderot the countrys intellectuals were more        keenly aware of being Europeans but also Italians        The hopes of progressives were raised by Austrian reforms        in Lombardy and Tuscany where the Medici dynasty had fizzled to an end        in  The results included fairer taxes less Church influence in        schools more public education and removal of the Inquisition        Jesuits the death penalty and instruments of torture Outside the        Austrian sphere of influence Italy remained solidly conservative        Venice stagnated under the rule of a small entrenched lite drawing        nostalgic comfort from the citys petrified beauty as painted in the        vedute of Guardi and Canaletto The papacy in Rome had lost prestige        with the dissolution of the Jesuits and the crippling loss of revenue        from the Hapsburg Church reforms The souths aristocracy resisted all        significant social reforms proposed by the Spanish Don Carlos a        descendant of Louis XIV who saw himself as a southern Sun Kingwith        Caserta Palace as his Versaillesis best remembered for launching the        excavations of Pompeii in         On the northwestern Alpine frontier a new state had        appeared on the scene destined to lead the movement to a united Italy        With Savoy split in the th century between France and Switzerland        its foothill region southeast of the Alps Piedmont had come into the        Italian orbit Sidestepping the stagnant economic burden of Spanish        domination the sparsely populated duchy expanded quickly Turin was        little more than a fortified village of  inhabitants in  but        it rose to  a century later The pragmatic dukes of Piedmont        liked Frenchstyle absolutist monarchy but tempered it with a        parliament to bypass local fiefdoms They copied Louis XIVs        centralized administration and taxcollection and by the th century        Turin was a sparkling royal capital built quite unlike any other        Italian city in classical French manner        Napoleon Bonaparte with his seductive ideas of Italian        independence was welcomed after driving out the Austrians and        Spanish in  But the French soon proved just as great a burden on        Italian treasuries used to support their war effort and the Bonaparte        family If Napoleon did not exactly liberate Italy he did shake up        the old conservatism from Lombardy to Naples by creating new        universities and

among Italian rulers restored to        their lands after Napoleons defeat Austria seized the occasion to add        the Veneto to its Lombardy territories The  conclave of zelanti        zealot cardinals elected archconservative Leo XII to help the papacy        recover from its Napoleonic shock On the lookout for any contagiously        progressive movement the Austrians helped Bourbon King Ferdinand of        Naples crush an  revolt for constitutional monarchy and foiled a        similar uprising in Piedmont The danger became clear in  when        insurrection spread through Bologna Modena and Parma to the Papal        States of central Italy But the Austrians defeated a rebel government        of united Italian provinces weakened by regional rivalries and        conflicting

rebellion erupted in Milan on  March  a        year of revolution all over Europe Emissaries flew by balloon to        nearby cities for reinforcements that freed Milan from the        strong Austrian garrison The Venetians restored their republic        a Piedmontese army joined up with troops from Tuscany the Papal        States and Naples and a new democratic Roman Republic was proclaimed        But the hesitant Carlo Alberto of Piedmont gave the Austrians time to        recover and Italian gains toppled like dominoes National unity was        again sabotaged by provincial rivalries        Conceding the need for more reform the new king of        Piedmont Vittorio Emanuele II became a constitutional monarch with a        moderatedominated parliament His Prime Minister Count Camillo

flocking to Piedmont was        a veteran of the earlier revolts Giuseppe Garibaldi        With their French allies Piedmont defeated Austria at        Magenta and Solferino to secure Lombardy in  A year later Cavour        negotiated the handover of Emilia and Tuscany But it was the adventure        of Garibaldis Red Shirts that imposed the unification of the peninsula        in  With two steamers antiquated artillery and  lire in        funds Garibaldi set sail from Genoa with his Expedition of the        Thousand  The heroic Red Shirts seized Bourbon Sicily and crossed to        the mainland At Teano outside Naples they met up with Vittorio        Emanuele who was proclaimed King of Italy National unity was        completed with the annexation of the Veneto in  and Rome the new        capital in         The Modern Era        Despite its extraordinarily fragmented history unified        Italy took its place among modern nations as an unexceptional        centralized state careful to protect the interests of its industrial        and financial establishment and granting reforms to the working classes        only under the pressure of their united action        From working as migrant laborers in France and Germany        Italian factory and farm workers brought back expert knowledge of union        organization and strikes But in keeping with the Italians traditional        local attachments their first unions were camere del lavoro        regionally based chambers of labor linking workers to their town or        commune rather than their individual trade        Both the politically left and the right wanted Italy to        join the European race for coloniestheir eyes fixed on Ethiopia and        Libya Conservatives supported expansion for reasons of national        prestige Socialists talked of Italys civilizing mission in the        Mediterranean seeking to divert the flow of emigrants heading        increasingly to the Americas to

Italietta Vacations were spent        by the sea or in the mountains people listened to soothing operas like        Puccinis La Bohme and Madame Butterfly the first silentmovies of        The Last Days of Pompeii and Quo Vadis were made one could partake in        intellectual conversations in open air cafs at the hour of the        passeggiata        They were less amusing when hailing World War I as the        worlds hygiene  Previously committed to a Triple Alliance with        Austria and Germany Italy remained neutral in  The following        year acting with what Prime Minister Antonio Salandra acknowledged to        be sacro egoismo Italy signed a secret treaty to enter the war on        the side of Britain France and Russia in exchange for the postwar        annexation of Austrianheld Trento South Tyrol now Alto Adige and        Trieste        The people were at first cool to the war despite the        jingoism of flashy aristocratic aesthete and author Gabriele DAnnunzio        and his friend an exsocialist newspaperman named Benito Mussolini        The Italian Army was the least well prepared of the combatants lacking        artillery machine guns trucks and properly trained officers but the        infantry showed remarkable courage in the trenches After the disaster        at Caporetto the planned AustroGerman  advance across the Veneto        plain was held until the Italian counterattack of OctoberNovember         permitted a triumphant entry into Trento and Trieste        For most Italians particularly the peasant worker and        petit bourgeois war in uniform was their first real experience of        Italian nationality Enthusiastic warsupporters like DAnnunzio who        captured the popular imagination by flying over Vienna to drop        propaganda leaflets were acclaimed as patriots while democrats and        pacifist republicans were dismissed as defeatists Parliament which        was denied knowledge of the secret war treaty until the Peace        Conference of  was exposed as impotent        The political left was in disarray The Socialists won the        elections but split over support for the Russian Revolution leading to        the formation in  of the Italian Communist Party In an atmosphere        of economic crisisstagnant productivity bank closures and rising        unemploymentconservatives wanted somebody tougher more dynamic than        eternally compromising oldstyle politicians As the blackshirted        Fasci Italiani di Combattimento Italian combat groups beat up Slavs        in Trieste and union workers in Bologna Mussolini filled the bill        Threatened by the Fascists March on Rome in  King Vittorio        Emanuele III invited Mussolini il Duce to form a government        The now alltoofamiliar process of totalitarianism set in        Opposition leaders were assassinated their parties free unions and        free press all abolished The Vatican was upset when the fascist youth        movement dissolved the Catholic Boy Scouts The Lateran Treaty of         had created a separate Vatican state and perpetuated Catholicism as        Italys national religion with guaranteed religious education in the        schools        Italian fascism remained more of a style than a coherent        ideology typified by the raisedarm salute replacing the weakling        handshake bombastic architecture and Mussolinis arrogant harangues        from the Palazzo Venezias heroic balcony in Rome The Duces motto        of Better to live one day as a lion than  years as a sheep        contrasted with the one he gave the country Believe obey fight         Neither lions nor sheep most Italians survived with lipservice and        good humor while communists reallied with socialists in the        antifascist underground whose partisans linked up with the Allies        during World War II        In  Mussolini diverted attention from the worsening        economic climate at home with an invasion of Ethiopia and proclamation        of the Italian Empire Italian war planes joined Hitlers Luftwaffe on        General Francos side in the Spanish Civil War  Italian        communists and socialists fought on the Republican side Following the        Germans lead in  racist legislation was introduced against the        countrys  Jews The next year Italy invaded Albania and after        Frances collapse in June  plunged with Germany into World War II        Its poorly equipped armies were defeated by the British in the African        desert and by the mountain snows in the Balkans The Allies landed in        Sicily in June  and liberated Rome one year later Mussolini        toppled soon after the Allied landings and reinstated briefly as a        German puppet in the north was caught fleeing in German uniform to the        Swiss border He was executed in April         The sordid hardships of postwar Italyunemployment the        black market and prostitutionhave been made graphically familiar        through the brilliant neorealist cinema of Rossellini de Sica and        Fellini Today the remarkable economic recovery has silenced the old        condescension about Italys technological and managerial talents In        the European Union Italy has more than held its own in heavy industry        agribusiness and the new electronics industry A specifically Italian        ingredient has come from highly productive clandestineand as a        result untaxablemanufacturing and other activities parallel to the        open market        Italians didnt take easily to national government They        had existed through most of their history without it and Mussolini had        spoiled their appetite Now fatigued by his excesses they rejected        the militant left for a little dolce vita with the less adventurous but        less disturbing Christian Democrats Their perpetually changing        coalitions hardly constituted real national government but the people        seemed to function quite well regardless In the s a pragmatic        socialist coalition government with the Christian Democrats brought a        few years of unusual stability Corruption and taxevasion continued        but police clamped down on the political terrorism of the Red Brigades        and neoFascists and the ageold criminality of the Mafia        Sadly enough as Italy put on its best face for the        nationwide celebration of Jubilee  a series of corruption scandals        tangenti revealed the dirty and deeprooted hold of politicians and        business tycoons alike that began in the early to mid s Much of        the dust is only now settling as the Italians get on with their daily        lives Theyre administering the changes of the new century while        continuing to preserve their unparalleled past much of which got a        long overdue dusting off Billions of lire were spent on Rome alone for        the recordbreaking numbers
