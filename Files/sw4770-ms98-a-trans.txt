        uh i dont know my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted       and i dont feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be selfserving to the community i think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight and to kind of say hey you know im a public official i dont have to do uh certain things and they just stand out more involving themselves more and more with politics but uh its really after all the things that ive seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts uh of checks uh before that it was the wonderful uh escapade that they had with uh the new uh oh God chief of uh well Supreme Court im trying to think of his name and uh what they put uh him through in regards to yeah Thomas   Thomas uhhuh   the sex the sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers monies and things like that i i just think its very corrupt and whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor and send them into government versus people that are rich but its always the rich person that gets into government that has uh the money to advertise the money to do to do this theres no more Abe Abraham Lincolns out there uh that can get into government even if they were poor so i know thats my personal viewpoint of things   doesnt Wisconsin have a uh state uh Medicare program or health program   now they just uh theyve already put through the health bill  yes it just went through and it was passed and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical uh i dont know if that was done out of just lets be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people you know what im saying it its right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system and of course they think uh Wisconsin our neighbor or Minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill and its kind of like were the first to do it so i dont know if its done because were we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh you know a real good purpose to help people that cant afford uh health insurance that kind of thing   right well i i think the one of the biggest problems that uh we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself   uhhuh oh sure   and that is uh uh we become so debt ridden and credit oriented   oh sure   uh instead of uh cash and carry or debt free  and therefore uh that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities state and federal governments   uhhuh it it sure does and i think it it is reflecting like you said i think society as a whole         uh you cant expect uh when we have TVs and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for uh you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off thats going to be clean totally clean  and come into government uh   right   but down the line it does hurt i mean when somebodys corrupt and somebodys doing something its uh you know it does hurt the each individual of the society when you find out that somebodys done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred so uh   well what is see the thing is is when a lot of things become acceptable practice uh its hard to discern the border what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical and then someone blows the whistle and says   uhhuh exactly   oh this is not ethical and yes i did it too   yeah  well thats exactly what happens in government  all the time hey blow the whistle on each other oh i hear that youre doing this ive done it but oh boy  and its not going to get out exactly yeah exactly exactly its uh     yeah we just had a   theres no secrets in the government uh i dont think anymore   uh right the mayor of Dallas is uh Bartlett Steve Bartlett he also uh was a congressman   uhhuh uhhuh   uh to the uh to Congress and he had been in that position for years   uhhuh sure   and uh he was elected mayor of Dallas overwhelmingly   uhhuh uhhuh   however if the vote was taken today the whole thing might change because he was part of that uh check kiting scam   oh sure  i think i i dont think uh
