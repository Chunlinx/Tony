                                 Lies Damned Lies and Impeachment            OK so its not about sexIts about lying under oath obstruction of justice and abuse of power If thestandards used to impeach President Clinton for those offenses were applied tohis two Republican predecessors Reagan and Bush they would have beenimpeached too The fact that they werent owes less to any lack of evidencethan to a sense of proportion and respect for the popular willor call itcowardice perhapsin the opposition party the Democrats which thencontrolled Congress            The only time RonaldReagan ever talked about IranContra under oath was in a deposition for thecriminal trial of his former National Security Adviser John Poindexter Thedeposition was in  after Reagan had left office He claimed that there wasnot one iota of evidence that profits from the sale of arms to Iran had beendiverted to the Nicaraguan Contras that his aides hadnt lied to Congressabout the affair and so on All this was demonstrably false The only reasonhe might not be guilty of perjury is that his mind pretty clearly wasgoing            But the very fact that Reagan was never forced to testifyunder oath as president illustrates the double standard that has trapped BillClinton If Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh had operated like Kenneth Starrhe would have forced Reagan while president to repeat or renounce under oathhis public lies about IranContra such as those in his first TV address on thesubject when he declared it utterly false that arms had been shipped to Iranin exchange for the release of American hostages This was as vivid asClintons televised fingerwagging that woman sound bite and just as flatlyuntrue Reagan had been at several meetings where the armsforhostages dealwas discussedand indeed where Cabinet members had warned him it was illegaland hed said he didnt care If Walsh had been Starr Reagan would have facedthe same excruciating dilemma as Clinton admit to a spectacular public lie orlie again under oath            Possibly Reagan wasalready gaga in  while still president though this is not an argument theRepublicans now pursuing Clinton are likely to want to make or were heard tomake back in  But even before he was officially declared to be losing itReagan benefited from a more general double standard about truth tellingReagan and Clinton both are among the great bullshitters of American historybut somehow Reagan was always regarded as floating above the truth whileClinton is regarded as wallowing beneath it            Walshs final report concluded that Reagan knowinglyparticipated or at least acquiesced in the IranContra coverup whichinvolved among other things Oliver North shredding thousands of documentsthat may well have implicated Reagan more deeply Any Flytrap coverup pales incomparison The nearest equivalent involves the mysteriousappearance not disappearanceof documents none of which has turnedout to be vital in a White House closet Yet Walsh didnt bring chargesagainst Reagan or even depose him to squeeze out information or set him up fora perjury rap            The case against GeorgeBushby the standards being applied to Bill Clintonis even stronger Bushclaimed in the  campaign that hed given sworn testimony hundreds of timesconceding that he knew all about the armsforhostages deal In fact when thestory broke in  Bush repeatedly claimed to have been out of the loop Heknew we were selling arms to Iranitself flatly illegal and spectacularly inconflict with the administrations public pronouncementsbut he claimed hehad no idea the deal involved paying ransom for hostages            Specifically Bush claimed not to have attended a January meeting at which Secretary of State George Schultz and Secretary ofDefense Caspar Weinberger vehemently opposed trading for hostages When WhiteHouse logs indicated that Bush was at the meeting he emended his story to sayhe hadnt caught the drift of Schultzs and Weinbergers objections If onlyhed known George and Cap were as bothered as he was Bush said he would havetried to stop the policy This was his story until  when Walsh releasednotes taken by Weinberger at the meeting recording that VP approves of thepolicy Bush claimed to be both ignorant of and disturbed by            As president in Bush did his best to thwart Walshs investigation He tightened up on therelease of classified information A diary he started keeping in  somehownever materialized until after the  election And his lastminute pardon ofWeinberger Poindexter and others after hed lost reelection effectivelythwarted Walshs pursuit of Bush himself among others No obstruction ofjustice or abuse of presidential power in Flytrap comes close            So why is Bill Clintons presidency stamped forever withthe shame of impeachment and why does he face premature removal from officewhen impeachment was never seriously considered for Bush and Reagan Perhaps atthis point Clintons critics would like to revisit their insistence that itsnot about sex The only sensible distinction is that lies about some thingsmatter more than others Henry Hyde for example was quite eloquent back inthe IranContra era about how statesmanship and higher principles sometimesrequire presidents to lie and break the law            Hyde and others would betempted to say that lying to free American hostages and breaking the law toprotect Latin America from communism are more justified than lies to hide atawdry affair I would be tempted to reply that lies and coverups intended tothwart the workings of democracy on an important public policy issue seem to meto be a lot worse than lies about an embarrassing personal mess But perhaps wecould agree that David Schippers the House Judiciary Committee Counsel waswrong in his selfrighteous pronouncement Lies are lies are lies            Schippers himself told a quick series of obvious whoppersduring that same impeachment hearing opening statement When I appeared inthis committee room a little over two months ago he said mournful as theWalrus in Through the Looking Glass  it was merely to analyze theStarr report referral and to report to you Today after our investigation Icome to a point that frankly I prayed I would never reach It is my sorrowfulduty now to accuse President William Jefferson Clinton etc etc Raise yourhand if you believe Schippers a was feeling sorrowful b had prayed that hismonths of effort to nail the president would be in vain c was being frank dhad no settled view on the whole matter even after analyzing the Starrreport until our investigation whatever that consisted of And while yourhand is up would you care to swear an oath that you believe these unbelievablethings            Every time a witnesslies that witness chips a stone from the foundation of our entire legalsystem Schippers intoned Or does he make an exception when the witness ishimself            Trent Lott as Senate majority leader is overseer of theforthcoming Clinton trial He was pictured in last Fridays New YorkTimes actually wagging his finger Clintonthat womanstyle as hepublicly lied to get himself out of a fix On Wednesday he had said about theBaghdad bombing While I have been assured by administration officials thatthere is no connection with the impeachment process  I cannot support thismilitary action in the Persian Gulf at this time Both the timing and thepolicy are subject to question It was immediately clear that Lott should nothave said this So on Thursday Lott declared that he did support the actiondid not suspect any connection with the impeachment process and had not meantto imply otherwise merely by uttering words whose plain meaning and universalinterpretation was the exact opposite Lotts sushimaster carveup of thephrase at this time was positively Clintonian in its boldness and artistryOf course he wasnt under oath so thats OK            What made the Lott incident especially enjoyable isthat Republicans all rallied round the obvious meaning of his originalstatement even as Lott himself was denying it Paul Gigot for example gottrapped midspincycle In his Friday column on the Wall Street Journaleditorial page he praised Lotts remark as an honest considered judgmentBut how could a conservative Republican senator and major flag waver for theoriginal Gulf War honestly oppose punishing Saddam for violating his surrenderterms Easy This is the surreal politics Bill Clinton has created Hawks arenow doves and vice versa But surely Paul you dont really believe Clintonbombed Baghdad to affect the impeachment vote Well no but The tragedy forAmerican interests is that Mr Clinton is doubted even when he might beright            Neato Clinton is thus responsible not only for hisown lies and hypocrisies but also for those of his enemies No doubt he issomehow to blame for IranContra too
