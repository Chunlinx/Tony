                                 Jesus Wept            Some years ago I attemptedto write a work of nonfiction that reconstructed the life of the historicalJesus I knew that it was an impossible taskand for that reason worthattempting since human curiosity can never satisfy itself about the identityand character of a man whose destiny it was to be hailed three centuries afterhis birth as Light of Light God of God Very God of Very God            Discussing the purely technical problem of how such a book could be writtenthe British novelist Peter Ackroyd asked me why I did not make mine a work offiction As the discussion wore on during a long evening we decided that itwould make a better novel if the traditional claims of theologyfrom virginalConception to Resurrection with all the miracles betweenturned out to betrue Then with a great deal of laughter we recollected that four such bookshad already been written attributed to the writers known as Matthew MarkLuke and John            Norman Mailer has now made that attempt Fortuitously hehas followed the plan Ackroyd and I considered namely writing a book thataccepts the traditional story of Jesus Christ that we were told in our Sundayschools This is no Last Temptation  There are no troubling scenes oflust with Mary Magdalene or as in a notorious poem that was condemned forblasphemy in England some years ago with the Roman soldiery The only newdifficulty that Mailer has made for himself is that he has decided to tell thestory in the first person This is the autobiography of Jesus written we knownot where but in some eternal realm where he has been dwelling since hisascension Like a Chekhovian character frustrated by his own redundancy and byan unexplained absence of sympathy with his closest relation Jesus recordsMy Father  does not often speak to me Nonetheless I honor Him He sendsforth as much love as He can offer but His love is not without limit            At thebeginning of the book it would seem as if JesusMailer like Mikhail Bulgakovin The Master and Margarita  was going to make witty play of theevangelists incomprehension of his message But in spite of telling us thatthe Gospel of Luke is highly unreliable Jesus accepts the basic evangelicalaccounts of his own life death and teaching It is obvious that in theheavenly places he has not had access to any of the modern works ofscholarship that have urged caution on those who accept too readily the Gospelaccounts of his trial            Jesus claims to have been an Essene a memberof that strict Jewish sect whose puritanical customs and views of life it hasbeen the delight of modern fantasists to reconstruct Like the Gospel writersJesus almost exonerates Pontius Pilate from any guilt in his death He eitherhas not reador disbelievesthose modern scholars who believe that far frombeing an enemy of the Pharisees the historical Jesus was likely to have beentheir ally if not a Pharisee himself Pilate who was in real life so cruelthat the Roman authorities had to remove him from the procuratorship of Judeais in Jesus account of things the detached Gentile observer who believesthat the King of the Jews has done no wrong and should be released Thereal Pilate crucified  Pharisees in a single day Here in Jesusaccount we read of the Pharisees improbably collaborating with the Romans andurging them to kill Jesus It remains the Jews in the accounts ofJesusMailer who are guilty of crucifying the innocent Galilean prophetafiction that has had an incomparably damaging historical effect and which isboth the origin and supposed justification of European antiSemitism            But thisJesus has strange memory lapses He was told as a child for instance aboutthe annunciation of the Angel Gabriel to his Virgin Mother but then he forgotabout it until he was  concentrating instead on the carpentry details thatform the least arresting part of his narrative            Reading these pages one can see why Jesus has never chosento write a book before since whenever he adds to the words of Matthew MarkLuke or John the results are less than happy Johns Pilate epigrammaticallyoffers the cynical question What is truth Jesus Pilate is a windbag whoadds Where there is truth there will be no peace Where peace abides youwill find no truth What does this mean If Jesus had ever read theuneventful lives of men like Immanuel Kant or Ludwig Wittgenstein he mighthave decided that peace was a precondition for the pursuit of truth            But thenthe sad evidence presented by these pages is that Jesus is not merely ratherstupid but also a very bad writer They drove a spike into each of my wristsand another spike through each of my feet I did not cry out But I saw theheavens divide Within my skull light glared at me until I knew the colors ofthe rainbow my soul was luminous with pain Perhaps it sounds better in theAramaic in which Jesus originally wrote it but one cant help fearing when hesees his words in print that Jesus will think this sounds like a sadomasochiston acid            His story ends rather lamely for one who hasbeen through so much There are many churches in my name and in the name of myapostles The greatest and holiest is named after Peter it is a place of greatsplendor in Rome Nowhere can be found more gold Again Jesus should haveemployed a researcher to tell him that while the Vatican is not short of goldit can hardly rival the Federal Reserve Jesus is wistful more than angry atthe continued success of the devil but he modestly hopes that he is himselfstill of some use to the poor old human race It is even by way of my blessingthat the Lord sends what love He can muster down to that creature who is manand that other creature who is woman and I try to remain the source of thatlove that is tender            If only there were creativewriting schools in Heaven or failing that editors we could hope that Jesuswould learn how to improve on awful sentences like that No doubt he will dobetter in his next book Perhaps the most surprising revelations are left tothe end when in a passage of acknowledgements Jesus reveals that he has awife called Norris and a literary agent called Andrew Wylie Maybe he shouldget some publisher to sign him up to write the life of Norman Mailer
