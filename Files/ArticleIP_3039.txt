                                 Eden Oklahoma            Klansmen were not the onlypeople who resented integration AfricanAmericans who lived as serfs in thedeep South saw Brown vs Board of Education in a favorable light Butthose who had thrived in functional black communities with strong schools andcivic organizationsdoing just fine without white folkswere understandablyambivalent about desegregation Their misgivings rarely reached the mainstreammedia A notable exception was the black novelist and anthropologist Zora NealeHurston  who had grown up in the Pure Negro Town of EatonvilleFla which boasted a charter marshal mayor council plenty to eatandstreets so peaceful that there was no jail Hurston wrote that she was too busyeating well and sharpening her oyster knife to feel victimized by racism Blackliberals attacked her bitterly when she described the Brown decision asan insult to black communities like hers which had educated their own justfine            ToniMorrison has been praised for using magical realism in the style of GabrielGarca Mrquez and for the literary black feminism she established almostsinglehandedly in novels like The Bluest Eye  Sula and Song of Solomon  But magic and feminism are onlysurface features of Morrisons work Her novels are an archaeology of strongblack communities like the ones she and Hurston were born into Morrison wasborn in Lorain Ohio a stones throw from Oberlin College a stop on theunderground railroad In Morrisons youth the region would have been headywith this heritage filled with descendants of blacks who felt themselves equalif not superior to whites and who had made selfreliance into a religion            Communities like this one faded with desegregation whichsent middleclass blacks scurrying to white suburbs By the s even thememory of flourishing towns like Hurstons Eatonville had been erased replacedby crimeridden ghettoes that s radicals tried to palm off as the onlylegitimate black experience            Morrison reconstructed thoselost communities magnificently in her early novels Sula is myhandsdown favorite a crystalline work about the bond between a pair ofgirlhood friends the timid conformist Nel and the rebel Sula Peace Sula is aforce of nature the alpha and omega of the town After an absence of  yearsshe returns accompanied by a plague of robins who coat the town in shit andfall dead from the skies The novel strikes a creative balance betweenMorrisons affection for magical reality and the need to tell a straightforwardstory of smalltown pettiness jealousies and affections            Morrisonsnovels since then have revealed a growing tension between the twoParadise finds that tension more pronounced than ever The novel has adifficult Faulknerian stylewith twists turns and ghosts There isbeautiful writing here  to read a sample But the historical events thatinspired the novel remain submerged and inaccessible except to those of us whoknow them well            Paradise focuses on the fictional town of RubyOkla founded by blacks who came West to escape the horrors of ReconstructionMorrison has given the towns founders a biblical stature But they are almostcertainly based on the founders of a very real town called Langston Oklasettled by Negroes in  and named for the black educator and Reconstructioncongressman John M Langston He graduated from Oberlin College was Ohiosfirst black lawyer and would have been a familiar figure in the local historyto which Morrison was exposed as a child Long before it became a stateOklahoma was Indian territory and a haven for runaway slaves Langstonsfounders convinced about  Negroes to settle there But the town shrankdramatically when the proud Negro residents had exhausted their savings with noway of making a living With prospects dwindling the founders themselvesdecamped for Guthrie the territorial capital                           Paradise recounts a similar move for the people who eventually foundedRuby but attributes the migration to the fact that an earlier settlement hadbecome too worldly and corrupt In Ruby founding families control the localbank and mete out justice as they see fit The town is lavishly prosperoussharing food and resources and money such that need is unknown The nearestmunicipality is  miles away and outsiders are profoundly unwelcome A whitefamily that happens through town ends up trapped in a blizzard and is eaten bybuzzards come the spring thaw One leading citizen criticizes the NAACP as abunch of stirup Negroes for bringing desegregation suits in Oklahoma Thefamilies evaluate prospective spouses on the basis of skin color and only theblackest of the black are welcome Mulattoes are despised as mongrels            The isolation pays off in immortality for no one dies inRuby But inbreeding brings sterility and spiritual rot The towns firstfamily reaches the end of the line when neither of its scions produces an heirSuch children as there are grow troublesome during the s when they rebelagainst tradition Vexed by discord the founding families find a convenientscapegoat in a colony of single women that springs up at a ruined Catholic homefor Indian girls  miles away            Morrisonhas always regarded the impulse to murder as part and parcel of loveparticularly a mothers love for her children In Beloved  forexample an escaped slave slits her infants throat to prevent its capture byslave hunters In Sula  a mother douses her son with kerosene and burnshim alive after he becomes a heroin addict and petty thief Through murder themothers deliver their childrenand sometimes themselvesfrom evil            Paradise reiterates these themes Beforerunning away from home in Newark NJ to the Catholic homeknown locally asthe Conventfor instance a character named Mavis allows her twin infants tosmother to death in the family car Mavis believes the deaths are accidentalbut circumstances suggest that the act was at least unconsciously volitionalMavis has dreamt of an incubus clearly a child taking her blood She isfrightened to death of her remaining children whom she suspects of plotting tomurder her            TheConvents other residents are refugees from bad marriages or abuse of one kindor another The place also serves as a haven for Ruby citizens who need a breakfrom the towns claustrophobic sameness An influential townsman takes a loverthere A mother driven mad by caring for a disabled child recovers there TheConvents spiritual life revolves around Consolata a benevolent witch who usesher powers to bring a dying townsman back to life But the stallions who runRuby see the place as purely evil To them the women represent the danger anddisorder that must be expunged if the town is to survive The men attackmurdering some women and scattering others to the winds The women do not goquietly extracting a toll on their way out            Morrison uses both Ruby and its opposite the Convent tocritique the utopian ideal as dangerous stultifying and illusory The moralof the story simply put is Till your garden where you are good and evilexist in similar quantities almost everywhere            This of course is a drasticsimplification of a complex book that tells its stories from severalperspectives each in its own chapter Morrison thickens the ambiguity byavoiding literal references to history and even physical descriptions thatmight fix characters in time and space These omissions blur the characters andallow them to operate at the level of myth But the absence of workaday andhistorical detail keeps the reader at a distance many of Morrisons charactersare impenetrable to the minds eye The lack of literal historical context alsoallows us to leave Paradise without learning about the black Westernsettlements that sprang up during Reconstruction or the socalled exodusterswho left the South to seek their fortunes on the frontier The history is solittle knownand so fascinatingit could easily have served as this novelspoint of departure or the spine of a novel all its own            Morrison certainly has earnedthe right to be as idiosyncratic as say William Gaddis Thomas Pynchon orWilliam Faulkner But I would love to see her talents turned to a culturalhistory of the eras and places she treats so compellingly in her novels Shehas recaptured those communities beautifully in fiction It would be even morerewarding to see her write about them in fact
