                                 The Poetics of Traffic Jams                        I loved the traffic story for its winning characters a poet ofthermodynamics and a Jam professor its clear explication of competingscientific theories and the satisfaction of knowing that our nations bestphysicists are even more annoyed by traffic than are the rest of us            I noticed that the story didnt use the word sprawl It didnt referenceAl Gores livability agenda for the  election or quote any politiciansdecrying the pernicious social effect of traffic Sipress did call the Easternseaboard sprawling but thats it Instead the story was nicely focused onlocal trouble spots such as the Capital Beltway and the Woodrow Wilson BridgeI wonder if this indicates that sprawl has ebbed back into the realm of theregional or just that Sipress was so annoyed by all the rhetoric that he leftit out of his piece            Speaking of local issues the carpetbagger issue rankles me too but fordifferent reasons I keep hearing New Yorkers described as transient drifterswhose own roots are so ephemeral that we are willing to let any politician renta hotel room and represent us As someone whos lived in four of the fiveboroughs whose family on both sides has lived in the city since arriving inAmerica and who worked for the City of New York I am offended This is partlybecause my local pride has been injured but also because I think that NewYorkwith its size diversity abundant businesses crumbling schools hugeinfrastructure and so onhas local needs that are just as if not moreparticular as any other district in the country And even if New York Citysdenizens are more transitory than the average American residents of New YorkState are not So even if we elect an adopted Senator rather than a homegrownone it wont be because we lack a sense of place            Yesterday you warned me not to lump you with radio hosts who chide Hillaryfor capitalizing on her husbands fame and power Yet today you wrote thatHillary owes her celebrity solely to her husbands political career Yes shedoesjust as George W Bush Al Gore and Jack Kennedy once owed theirs onlyto their fathers If sons can create political careers based on the successesof their fathers why cant wives do so based on those of their husbands Ifyoure going to prevent one political dynasty from being created youre goingto have to topple them all            Walter our correspondence is drawing to a close Thank you so much forsharing your breakfast thoughts especially with someone with far fewer yearsof newspaperreading and writing under her belt            CheersJodi            PS I never responded to the wager you made with me yesterday If RickLazio wins the New York Senate race Ill buy you a Manhattan at the bar ofyour choice
