                     Testing one two three four         Im here with Sean Jamieson hes going to be the third subject and Im just making sure this recorders working good         OK were here with Sean Jamieson he is the third subject here in the um project and Sean is from Chicago originally         And uh how would you describe your your accent the way you speak or                     To to well I guess I I of course I dont think I have an accent         Ah I speak like ah everybody I grew up speaks so speaks the same way but ah to the extent I have one its a would be Midwestern I I think more generically Midwestern than specifically Chicago         Chicago to me sound is is more nasal and more pronounced and sounds like ah sounds surprisingly close to Chi New York         Uh         But I dont think I speak like that however you may prove me wrong                     But youre from the suburban area                               Suburban Chicago  thats right                     So that may have something to do with that                     Umhum                     And and how about living in the South         Do you think thats actually ah I mean when if when you go back up North do people say Hey I can tell youre picking up some yalls or something                     I have not heard that to the to the best of my knowledge I have never knowingly used the term yall                              But ah maybe maybe the words are slightly as far as you know                     They might be I dont know ah you know the people I hang out with in Charlotte by and large are are not Southerners because the people I work with and the people who are my friends tend to be transplants as well         The newspaper business recruits nationally and so the people I work with are from all over the country                     Thats right                     And only a minority I guess are Southerners and uh my friends here are tend to be people from other places as well and rather than rather than ah Southerners or Charlotteans so I dont ah Im not although when Im in the store and when Im out and about in other places yeah I hear the Southern accent but I dont I think my speech patterns are probably pretty much set at this point and and I dont think Im picking anything up                     OK so and were talking were talking about um I guess going back to Chicago and um your you want to talk about your family um on your dads side                               Yeah I was          Trying trying to think of a subject to talk about and I Im Im not good at remembering stories         I dont remember jokes and I dont remember stories which is which says something about the way my brain works but I do remember you know hearing about family history and such and and uh had asked about it since then to to figure out how everybody ah came to be in Canada which is where is where my dads side of the family is from and my dad came down to the United States in the middle of the s when he was working for a company in Guelph Ontario which is outside of Toronto and met my mom in at that time and he settled down they settled down in the Chicago suburbs and and spent their whole lives there         Ah but my dad both my grandparents on my dads side were born in Europe         My grandfather was born in Edinburgh Scotland and my grandmother was born in County Cork Ireland         They both immigrated well my grandmother immigrated to New York I believe and then made her way up to Rhode Island where I believe she worked as a domestic         And my grandfather ran away from home as a very young boy and became a sailor and sailed back and fourth across the Atlantic         I know that much and I dont know where all else he sailed but ah eventually got tired of that and left his ship in New York and and was spending was in New York and this was I guess about the time of WWI                     Do you think he was fishing or was he doing                     He was working he was doing some sort of work         I dont know exactly what this is this is a little bit ah hazy         I dont know if my dads if Ive ever if my dads told me that I dont recall exactly what it was and then my so my my grandfather was living in New York I believe in an immigrant community in New York and the Canadian Army was recruiting from among immigrants because I believe at the time the Canadians did not uh did not draft did not draft during WWI and try need but they needed to help the British fighting in Europe and so the they decided that a good place to recruit would be among the immigrant communities in NY particularly among people who had immigrated from the British Isles         And the promise was that if you made it through the war you would have a shot at some ah you know there would be money for you at the end ah youd be able to settle in Canada         And so my grandfather joined the Brit and joined the Canadian army fought in France was wounded and eventually made his way back to I guess New York and then up to Rhode Island where he met my grandmother         I dont know the exact sequence of events here but he met my grandmother and then moved to to ah Ontario Canada where                      He had a farm waiting for him right                     Where he had a where he became tried to become a farmer and this was an area about  miles southwest of Toronto in what at the time must have been a pretty remote part of part of the province         Turns out he was not very successful as a farmer and gave that up and moved into the city of Guelph which was a decent sized a free standing city outside of of Toronto but much smaller than Toronto and build a house there and became did a variety of jobs ah I dont believe I dont know if he had a particular trade other than being a sailor so he worked in a variety of jobs         I know during the Depression he worked as a as a night watchman at a factory and he was my dad talked about how he how my grandfather felt very fortunate that he didnt lose his job during the Depression that at least he was able to keep a job all through the Depression working as a night watchman and they built a house which the family owns as of today         In fact my aunt who just died within the last month was living in the house that my grandmother and grandfather built when they first moved to Guelph very old woodframed house on two lots and at the time this wasnt a big deal but now it is theres about a hundred yards of a hundred yard wide strip of forest behind the house and then behind that is a private country club and a very nice one and so the land the land has become very valuable         At the time obviously it wasnt a big deal to live on a golf course and now it is so that that property is still in the family um as a kid my I used to go we used to go up there every year for family reunions we would ah drive from Chicago through Detroit up to Guelph                     To the same house                     To the same house that my grandmother and grandfather had had built and uh attend the family reunion my dad was one of eight kids and I guess six of them married and everybody had at least three kids         The number of kids that my aunts and uncles had varied I guess from three to six         So there was a pretty good good crowd at the reunions                                                      Typically about  to  people at each at each reunion which is held in August of every year                     You ever count how many first cousins you have                              Um Im not sure I know         Somebody has these numbers but Im not sure but ah but my dads my dads siblings were so ah spread out in age theyre at least  years at least  years from the oldest to the youngest so my oldest uncle had married fairly young he had fought in WWII and he was married during WWII and I believe he and my aunt had their first child during the War and that that was a cousin of mine named Dave who I oh when I first met him and his wife I thought they were my aunt and uncle but when I got older I realized that theyre actually my first cousins they were just old enough to be my parents and so it seemed to me like they were too old to be cousins because the people I associated with being my cousins were my age or relatively close to my age uh and they were a large group of these kids but these other two were like um my parents age and hanging out with my parents at the reunion and you know drinking beer under the tent and shooting the crap and I just thought they were my         aunt and uncle but they were actually my cousins uh and that was because                     Its like their ah dads ah brother or sister beared children other                     Yeah exactly exactly                     Your dads probably ah oldest brother                     Right that was my dads oldest brother and his wifes oldest kids so there was and then then there would be different people who would show up at different reunions so every year there would be people there who I didnt know and then I would were fairly close relatives but I didnt know who they were and so I would always have to be asking or would kind of wait for an introduction of some sort         So it was quite you needed a scorecard to keep track of who was who         And it got even more confusing when my cousins got older and would bring girlfriends or boyfriends or spouses who I never met before to oh the reunions and it all just ah so its still uh these days I was at one about two years ago a reunion and there are still about  to  people who show up consistently every year although its its a different group of people theyll be you know theres a group of maybe  or  who dont come to every reunion like me but therell be a different  or  in there         So the number of people who show up is pretty consistent its just that the group changes somewhat from year to year as the people are are available to make the weekend or arent         Um                     Is it every year they have the reunion                     Every year yeah we do a reunion every year         And it was was my my aunt who owned my Aunt Pat who had the ah my grandparents old house who was instrumental in getting these started and keeping them going because she realized she told me this just within the last couple of years that she thought it was very important to have the reunions every year so the family would stay in touch with each other cause otherwise I would never have known my cousins because the only things we might have gotten together for would be maybe at weddings and funerals which are not good opportunities to do much mixing and mingling because there are other things on the agenda         At a wedding or a funeral its really hard to catch up with people         So my aunt had been had been real smart about about scheduling those every year and trying to get as many people there as possible so that we all ah kept in touch and we all know who our cousins and our relatives were                     So whos going to ah start doing that whos going to be coordinating that now that shes                     Ah one of my cousins apparently is well two of my cousins are are keeping it going in fact         I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and ah its not clear whos going to host it but ah theres still quite a large group of family members in this city of Guelph and somebody is going to end up hosting it         Ah the reason that one of the reasons my Aunt Pat was always good at being the hostess for it is that the family had there are two small houses on four big lots on this deadend street so there was a lot of room for everybody to kind of spread out put up a couple of tents or shelters or whatever have barbecue grills out there and uh a couple of houses to run in and use the bathroom whatever so theres just a lot of room and uh but its not clear if that house is going to be sold or not now that my aunt has ah passed away         Apparently in her will she said that the house should be sold and the money given to a ah couple of my aunts and its not clear if a family member is going to buy the house and sort of keep it in the family or whats going happen to it but Im hoping that they keep it because its its ah theres so many family members there that you think somebody would want to hang on to it and its such a nice set up with really sort of an extended family that always sort of lived right on this block and uh Im thinking would probably want to keep hang on to the house                     How many of your um um I guess thats these are all the ah brothers and sisters of your your dad                     Of my dad yeah                     How many of them live in is it Guelph                     Its the name of the city is Guelph         Yeah its named for a city in Belgium I believe and Im not sure                     How do you spell it                     GUELPH                     OK                     And Im not sure why its named for a city in Belgium but it is         There is lets see Ive got an aunt and an uncle and two of their kids are still there         Ive got an aunt whos a widow and a cousin         I Im running out of fingers here but ah and then an aunt or ah a a cousin and his wife and their three kids and lets see thats about a dozen people right there that I can think of off the top of my head and then quite a few cousins and their and their families and kids are in the Toronto area some of some of them have moved away and come back ah but everybody most of them have sort of settled in and around the Toronto area in the suburbs in one direction or another         Oh theres in fact theres a cousin and her husband and their ah their six kids who just moved back to Guelph after having been ah ah his business had taken him away for a couple of years but now theyre back in Guelph so thats number six         So Id say there must be at least  uh immediate relatives that are still living in Guelph                     Um now how big of a city is that                     I want to say its  or  thousand or something like that         Theres a couple of other cities of similar size nearby so its almost getting to be like its own metropolitan area small metro area                     Right         So its um almost like youll youll meet ah if you go to Guelph youll meet someone will probably know a Jamieson there                     Yeah yeah because some of like my aunt who just died was a bookkeeper who worked at a lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious so I think she was probably on a first name basis with a awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever went downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew a lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of that Irish tradition like everybodys your friend everybodys your neighbor and even people that ah should be fairly casually shed greet those people by name and know a little bit about them ah and so yeah shes ah and my cousin one of my cousins has a couple of businesses in town and I think is relatively wellknown is on some sort of city board or something like that         Yeah the family is big enough and the city is small enough I think that you would run into a decent number of people who would know a Jamieson or two                     Or at least somebo dy married to a Jamieson                     Thats right                              Interesting                     Uhhuh                     And then ah I guess the family reunion is when is the next one youre going to go to                     Its August th of this year August th of  and uh dont know dont know too many more details about it and dont know if Ill be able to go         I went a couple of years ago and didnt make it last year and Im Im now Im kind of sorry I didnt because my aunt passed away in the meantime and I knew she was in poor health last year         Oh but theres just um just a couple of my dads generation left         Its theyre starting to get up there and and a lifetime of bad eating habits is starting to catch up although my aunt was about  when she when she died so she had a she had a long run                     Sounds like she was getting out and meeting a lot of people                     She was yeah right up right up to the day ah when she fell and I think she fell and broke her hip if I recall what put her in the hospital         She was ah I think she was ah downtown I think she had taken the bus or a cab downtown and had uh met with her lady friends to have lunch or something         She did almost every day and I recall that she slipped and fell and then as happens with a lot of older people developed complications while she was in the hospital and ah never never recovered unfortunately         It sounds simple breaking your hip but you just it is I Im sure you know older people whove had that happen to them you get into the hospital and you end up catching an infection or something like that from somebody else and your immune system is kind of weakened and she just um um didnt make it unfortunately                     It sounds like a big loss for the community just because there was so many people and she organized the family reunions but you know at least you know youve got somebody thats going to take over and start putting that back together there                     Yeah but Aunt Pat was definitely the matriarch of the family                     Matriarch huh                     Matriarch         Thats a good thats a good vocabulary word         You can you can probably add a whole chapter in the report of my use of the word matriarch                              That and a couple of others too         Im sure         OK         Im not sure if I said ah Seans name but this is Sean Jamieson from Charlotte and um and uh you know hes the third um subject                     I think you did say that         You might have said my name at the beginning         Im just not positive         Is it                     And uh I think we did a little background on your dialect or how you think you speak                     Thats right thats right                     OK thats thats and that should wrap it up there         Thanks Sean
