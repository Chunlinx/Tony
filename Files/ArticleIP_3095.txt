                                 Family Jewels            The Cartier name connotesluxurious objects but none in particular Faberg means enameled Easter eggsand Tiffany means wedding presents and engagement ringsmaybe art noveaulampsbut Cartier means well expensive jewelry in the abstract The firm hasalways been a retail business the product of commercial enterprise rather thanaesthetic visiona glorified jewelry store LouisFranois Cartier founded theParis firm in  just in time to help deck the famous beauties of the SecondEmpire from the empress to the great cocottes Branches were soon opened inLondon and New York by LouisFranois sons to serve Victorian magnates on bothsides of the Atlantic and eventually a Cartier grandson married thegranddaughter of Worth the world famous couturier  as if to consolidatethe whole international luxurygoods network            Meanwhilethe Cartier firm ranged far seeking clients in Imperial Russia and amongIndian maharajahs buying enamels from Russia and pearls from India to sell toFrench clients For nearly  years the three branches provided jewels tosuit the varied tastes of the worlds multimillionaireswithout ever imposinga distinct artistic style on any of them The client was invited to participatein the creation of a given piece his or her sketches were considered his orher stones might be used But to establish a solid worldwide reputation amongthe aesthetically alert and the crude alike Cartier employed a single unifyingprinciple the highest quality of materials and workmanship and a singlestandard of elegance            Which means that the stuff risked being stuffy if you cansay that about jeweled ornaments Cartiers defining epoch was the art decoperiod which the firms designers seem to have anticipated by two decades andextended through the s Beginning in  they were already usingrecognizable art deco forms but clearly not as signs of revolutionarymodernity The simple shapes and lines were being offered rather as extensionsof late  th century neoclassicism as new bearers of old values Nowonder they were popular with both nouveaux riches and royalty            Thecurrent Cartier exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is confined topieces made between  and  the period of Cartiers greatest fame Mostof the show demonstrates Cartiers adherence to an oldfashioned view ofjewels Take tiaras for example The tiara that is a womans ornamentalcrown of a more or less crescent shape is not at all modern but it isdefinitely both classical and neoclassical Sappho wore one So did Nerosmother Agrippina the Younger and Napoleons Josephine Thanks to Cartier soapparently did every commoner who could afford it between  and  tomatch the royals and nobles who had inherited theirs            Royalty was still big news in the first half ofthis century Highlevel elegance then epitomized by Cartier manifestlyrequired the effect that made Napoleons upstart court look imperial andlegitimate That looksimple yet richly paved with glitter and colored enamelaltogether different from the frothy rococo excesses of the ancien               rgime also suited New Yorks steel railway or breakfastfoodemperors and their descendants and emulators in the succeeding two generationsTiaras imposing necklaces multiple bracelets everything in diamondsit allstill held good and Cartier kept it up            But thewhole idea is now pass It lingered into the s when Grace Kelly and AudreyHepburn gave it a whirl but its really gone now A dazzling array ofhereditary jewels might occasionally adorn Queen Elizabeth but other richwomen never appear in diamond tiaras Figure skaters and ballet dancers are theonly ones who wear them along with Miss America            My understanding of Cartier was so nebulous that I thoughtan hour would suffice to check out the show at the Metropolitan Museum Istrode briskly up to the first glass casebut there I stopped transfixed Inthe first three cases were diamond brooches made to adorn the spacious dressesof the belle                poque  gleaming leafandflower compositions thatcould sweep across a whole dcolletage from shoulder to shoulder or smallerornaments festooned with graceful diamond swags and dripping with pendantdiamond drops Each piece was an entire show dazzling under the lights Butthere was more            Eachdiamond in each leaf and petal was surrounded by a tiny wall of platinumbeading in what I learned is called the millegrain setting No crude prongshold up these stones but rather a precise silvery tracing that sets off thediamond and emphasizes the interlaced design of the brooch while hiding itsconstruction Out of sight at the back the grainy tracing around the stones isheld up on a continuous gallery of supports rising from another tracery thatlies against the body The diamonds are lifted up on an airy cage and lightcan come through them from below            I was repeatedly struck by how unlike theseCartier creations are to modern rhinestone jewelry or even to modern preciousjewelry Today the seriousness is missing When it comes to style in jewelsmodern chic has followed Chanel and Chanel refused to be solemn She insistedon casual fakes and mixtures of vivid barbaric ornaments along with realpearls Cartier jewels were once sought expressly for their link to a traditionof exquisite applied craftmanship as the best celebration of preciousminerals something undertaken almost for their sake Modern vanity is morepersonal we no longer want to wear ornaments with that detached eternal lookThe designs for the Cartier jewels have a consistent discretion These arenever expressions of wild genius like the beating heart made of rubies thatDali designed On the contrary respect for the capacity of the materialsalways wins out over daring visual invention but a staggering technicalimagination has also been summoned That if anywhere is where the modernityof these jewels lies            Ilearned for example how a diadem brooch or bracelet could be invisiblyhinged so as to be completely flexible in all directions not a rigid littlebeast of unyielding metal and stone but supple tender toward the bodychangeable in mood I saw in the catalog how the lengthy diamond necklaces withcomplex pendants were often made to be disassembled by the client so she couldhave four bracelets two brooches and a shorter necklace whenever she gottired of the one big thing Meanwhile her tiara just right for attending thecoronation of a monarch could be dismounted from its frame and reversed into anecklace suitable for the opening of the opera season The jewels would bedelivered in exquisite goldtooled leather boxes with compartments containingthe relevant alternative mounts and fastenings and a tiny screwdriver in itsown velvet nest            As I stared into the cases I often heard Oh my God nextto me or behind me uttered in an undertone with a note of awe I was temptedto misquote Mae West God has nothing to do with it honey Here we abandonhim in the heady presence of treasures laid up on the earth material wealth inits most concentrated and enduring form A diamond bracelet mocks all thesables that wither and rot the cars that rust the champagne gone flat andthe claret turned vinegar even the crumbling great houses and the faded greatpaintingspainstaking creations now fatally ripped soaked or burnedLifeless from the start jewels sneer at death and they require zeromaintenance            The Cartier operation keptits jewels on the move The client might lose at cards and the gold cigarettecase with sapphires would be sold back to Cartier who would promptly sell itthe next year to another gentleman A rubyanddiamond necklace might have togo for inheritance taxes Cartier would buy it back dismantle it entirely andmake it into two tiaras and a brooch for three other clients maybe preservingsome elements and using them upside down or sideways Each piece wasphotographed for the archives against just such a fate            Thecosmeticsandsmoking mania of the s resulted in a whole array ofgemstudded vanity cases with builtin lipstick comb and compartment forcigarettes These were meant to be carried in the palm of the hand at the ballor the restaurant and deployed in front of everybody their gold interiorswith their clever little hinges flashing while the nose was dusted the mouthrepainted or a Sobranie selected You had to take it back to Cartier to getthe lipstick refilled and you held onto it with a little ring or chain thathooked over two fingers            None of these has much current appeal luxenotwithstanding Of things we would like whole categories are oddlyunderrepresented There are well over  pieces in this show but only sixpairs of earrings all very drippy ones from the s Where are the littlediamond floral clusters for the lobe the neat ruby circles And there areexactly two rings Obviously all the Cartier rings are still in use and allthe little earrings fell off in the taxi            I camehome drained and exhausted from thinking about how to adjust my diadem andreassemble my lavaliere and unable to choose between the Japaneseribbonknotbrooch with the rubies and the Gothicstyle doublecircle brooch with thesapphires The next day fully recovered I saw the photo in the paper of theopening party And there was one of Cartiers glorious tiaras on loan crowningthe head of a foot AfricanAmerican lady wearing the perfect silvery backlessgown to go with itbut alas she had to be followed everywhere by securityguards Nevertheless the tiara looked nothing at all like the Miss Americacrown and I must admit I felt a stab of envy
