                    Kinase Inhibition for Treatment of Cancer        Uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells is a hallmark of cancer In many types of        cancer mutations in genes that activate cellular signal transduction pathways contribute        to enhanced proliferation and survival of cancer cells One wellcharacterized example is        mutation in tyrosine kinases enzymes that regulate the growth and survival of cells        Tyrosine kinase activity is tightly regulated in normal cells but is dysregulated due to        mutation in some cancers including lung cancer resulting in enhanced proliferation and        survival of cancer cells The tyrosine kinases are attractive candidates for molecularly        targeted therapy in cancer because cancers become dependent on growth signals from the        mutant tyrosine kinases Tyrosine kinases require ATP for their enzymic activity and thus        small molecules that mimic ATP can bind to mutant kinases and inactivate them        The paradigm for tyrosine kinase inhibition as treatment for cancer using smallmolecule        inhibitors was first established in the context of chronic myelogenous leukemia CML        associated with the         BCRABL gene rearrangement  Imatinib Gleevec a        phenylaminopyrimidine is a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the ABL kinase        thereby inhibiting the constitutively activated BCRABL tyrosine kinase Imatinib induces        complete remission in most patients with CML in stable phase  and also has activity in        CML that has progressed to blast crisis         Imatinib is also a potent inhibitor of the ARG KIT PDGFRA and PDGFRB tyrosine        kinases As a consequence there have been additional dividends from the United States        Federal Drug Administration approval of imatinib for treatment of BCRABLpositive CML For        example imatinib is effective in treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with gene        rearrangements that constitutively activate         PDGFRB  of hypereosinophilic syndrome with activating mutations in         PDGFRA  and of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors associated with        activating mutations in         KIT  all reviewed in         More recently this paradigm has been extended to treatment of nonsmall cell lung        cancer NSCLC Several mutations have been identified in the context of         epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR in patients with NSCLC that are        associated with clinical response to the smallmolecule EGFR inhibitors gefitinib Iressa        or erlotinib Tarceva  including inframe deletions such as del LEAP in        exon  or LR in exon  Although responses are often dramatic most responding        patients ultimately develop clinical resistance and relapse of disease  The basis        for resistance had not been known in part owing to the difficulty in obtaining tissue from        rebiopsy at time of relapse                    Resistance to SmallMolecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors        As might have been anticipated in treatment of cancer with any single agent resistance        to smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors has emerged as a significant clinical problem        This was first appreciated in patients with CML treated with imatinib whose tumors        developed resistance and has been most extensively studied in that context Although there        are many potential mechanisms for development of clinical resistance most cases of        imatinibresistant CML are due to point mutations in the         BCRABL kinase domain itself including TI  Similar mutations        in the homologous residues of the kinase domains of PDGFRA TI and KIT TI account        for imatinib resistance in some patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome and        gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors respectively  These findings suggest        strategies to overcome resistance that include the use of alternative smallmolecule        inhibitors Indeed about three years after the recognition of imatinib resistance        mutations in BCRABLpositive CML new drugs are now in clinical trials that are potent        inhibitors of imatinibresistant BCRABL mutants                     A Basis for Resistance to SmallMolecule EGFR Inhibitors in NSCLC        In an elegant new study in         PLoS Medicine  Pao and colleagues have identified acquired mutations in        patients with NSCLC that appear to explain clinical resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib         The mechanism of resistance in three patients was acquisition of a TM substitution        in EGFR that was not present at time of diagnosis but was detected with progression of        disease after initial response to gefitinib or erlotinib TM in the context of either        transiently expressed wildtype EGFR or the mutant alleles del LEAP or LR        impairs inhibition by gefitinib or erlotinib as assessed by autophosphorylation        Furthermore the NSCLC cell line H harbors both the LR and TM mutations and is        resistant to inhibition by gefitinib or erlotinib unlike cell lines that express the LR        allele alone In the H cell line it was possible to obtain adequate quantities of RNA        to confirm that the LR and TM mutations are present on the same allele as would be        predicted if TM confers resistance to inhibition of the LR allele        Structural models of EGFR provide structural insights into these biological data A        ribbon structure of erlotinib bound to the EGFR kinase domain Figure  shows the        threonine residue at position  in green and the positions of the exon  and LR        gainoffunction mutations Substitution of methionine for threonine at position  would        be predicted to result in steric hindrance of erlotinib binding to EGFR Figure         These observations provide convincing evidence that at least in some patients with        NSCLC resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib can be attributed to acquisition of a TM        mutation in the context of EGFR However three additional patients with clinical        resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib did not have the TM mutation nor did they have        mutant         KRAS alleles that have previously been shown by these same authors to        confer resistance to these inhibitors  Thus mechanisms of resistance are        heterogeneous                    Next Steps and Lessons Learned        It will be important to identify alternative smallmolecule inhibitors for the TM        resistance mutation Structural data suggest that one compound lapatinib may subserve        this purpose  but it has not been tested for biological activity in this context New        chemical screens andor rational drug design to identify alternative inhibitors is        warranted In addition only half of this small cohort of patients with NSCLC with clinical        resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib had the TM substitution Efforts to identify        alternative mechanisms for resistance may be guided by experience with imatinib resistance        in the context of BCRABL and should include fulllength sequencing of EGFR to identify        other resistance mutations and analysis for evidence of gene amplification as well as        investigation of other wellcharacterized mechanisms of drug resistance such as drug efflux        or increased drug metabolism        Pao and colleagues superb study also highlights several important points that may guide        development of kinasetargeted therapies in the future It is clear that to the extent        that smallmolecule kinase inhibitors are effective as single agents in treatment of        cancer resistance will develop Furthermore based on previous experience some of these        patients are likely to harbor acquired point mutations in the target kinase that confer        resistance Resistance mutations identified via in vitro screens have shown a high degree        of correlation with those that develop in vivo as shown in screens for imatinibresistant        BCRABL mutants  and PKCresistant FLT mutants  as well as the TM        resistance mutation to gefitinib in the context of EGFR  Thus in vitro screens for        mutations that confer resistance to kinase inhibitors are warranted followed by efforts to        identify drugs that overcome resistance This proactive approach should shorten the time        frame for new drug development        These findings also emphasize the critical need for rebiopsy of patients with cancer        treated with molecularly targeted therapies at time of relapse Tissue acquisition is more        challenging in solid tumors than for hematopoietic malignancies and may entail risk        Nonetheless it is clear that data derived from such analyses will be essential to inform        approaches to improving therapy for NSCLC and other solid tumors
