                                 In Search of Cronygate             You probably havent heardabout the latest scandal to rock Britain The American media have ignored itAnd that is part of the story            TheBritish press has named it Cronygate The gist of Cronygate is this A reporterfor the Observer newspaper posing as a representative of USbusinesses approached lobbyists with close ties to Tony Blairs government tosee what they were peddling One of the lobbyists was a callow and garrulousyoung man named Derek Draper who had been a close aide to Blair and hisdeputies Draper boasted that in exchange for an extortionate fee he couldarrange lunches at  Downing St and meetings with top ministers help theclient get appointed to a government advisory board and obtain early drafts ofparliamentary reports related to the clients industry            The press was apoplectic For a week the major dailiesbannered Cronygate It marked the Blair governments fall from grace itmarked Blairs worst week Tory leader William Hague flayed Blair in theHouse of Commons Blair declared that we must be pure and Labor leadersfloated a proposal to ban contact between lobbyists and top governmentofficials Cronygate overshadowed not only the violence in Northern Ireland butalso the longawaited meeting between Prince William and Camilla ParkerBowles            As ascandal Cronygate is inadequate in several ways First if you start from thepremise that there are lobbyists it is unsurprising to discover that what theydo is lobby A famous actress caught working as a prostitute is news Aprostitute caught working as a prostitute is a tautology Second unless youngDraper is unlike any other lobbyist in history he was exaggerating his abilityto infiltrate the government Third what Derek Draper promised is nothing thatformer Republican Chairman Haley Barbour doesnt do a dozen times before lunchfor Microsoft among other clients And it is nothing that would tax Clintonpal Vernon Jordans youngest associate            The American press has ignored Cronygate inother words because to Americans the behavior is not scandalous Its not thatmany Americans would actually approve of what amounts to trading money forinfluence or access or whatever you call it with the government Its thatweve decided to live with it We dont get shocked by it and we dont havelaws against it            In partthe overwrought reaction of the British media reflects their irritation withthe holierthanthou Blair and their impatience more than a year into hispremiership to catch him out at something  They have longed to showthat Blairs New Laborites are as scheming and moneygrubbing as the Old Torieswere But much of the fuss reflects genuine surprise and offense Lobbying is asmaller and less familiar industry in Britain than it is in the United StatesThe capacity for outrage hasnt yet withered            But wait The lesson is not that Americans are more cynicaland apathetic than the Brits about influence peddling how marvelous it is thatthey still rage at the rentseeking and smallbore sleaziness we take forgranted  Its not that simple One reason the lobbying culture is biggerin Washington than in London is the American separation of powers A companywishing to influence the government must work the executive branch and butterup both the majority and minority parties in the House and the SenateIn Britains elected dictatorship lobbying is limited because virtually allpower resides in a very few people at the top of the majority party            And the British are not sopure For example the American press can manage to generate a fair amount ofresentment over members of Congress accepting campaign contributions fromcorporationsthough not enough resentment apparently to reform the systemBut in Britain it is actually legal and accepted for Members of Parliamentthemselves to be paid lobbyists There are explanations MPs are poorly paidand those without additional government posts have almost no power anyway Butthe fact remains The British peoples elected representatives can be paidspecifically to influence legislationand no one cares            Anotherexample In Britain there are no limits on the size of political contributionsand no requirements that contributions be made public And corporations andunions may make political contributions directly out of their treasuries asopposed to raising the money from employees and members In the postWatergateUnited States it is unthinkable that people would shrug off large secretcontributions by corporations to the ruling party The British probably dontcare for it either to the extent they think about it But they dont make ascandal of it            So which society is more cynical and decadentand which more idealistic and pure No thats not the point The point is thatwhat becomes a scandaland what a society chooses to outlawis a bit randomIt may depend more on morally neutral cultural factors or historicalaccidents than on any moral or practical calculus about different types ofbehavior            This column as my first inthe Strange Bed is free of history It is also needless to say free of anytaint of bias or corruption Young and pure it can still aspire to moralclarity Also modest it will not attempt to solve all the problems relating tocampaign finance lobbying and other activities that allow money to buyinfluence in politics What it can do is suggest some general principles            Principle No  is theeasytoforget point that money shouldnt be able to buy influence witha democratic government Its wrong The world would be a better place ifgovernment decisions were made without reference to who has written a check orwho has hired a politicians former aide The people who profit from thesearrangements should find another way to make a living            But you dont outlaw everyactivity of which you morally disapprove Trying to prevent all exchanges ofmoney for political influence would be costly in terms of liberty as well asof more mundane considerations and futile Half measures are inevitable Youcan though aspire to half measures that do two things First they shoulddeliver maximum moral benefit at minimum practical cost And second you wantyour half measures to be reasonably consistent on an absolute scale ofmorality This notion of consistency is whats violated by Britains outrageabout lobbying and indifference about campaign contributions and Americasopposite treatment of both
