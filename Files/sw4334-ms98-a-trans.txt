        type of music is hot down in Texas   uh well i dont know exactly whats hot down in Texas i know whats hot down here with me so thats about all i can feel apt to discuss with you since i just know i dont ever listen to the radio and thats usually whats hot around here so   oh okay   so what kind of music do you like   uh mostly folk music   folk music   yeah i find myself uh listening to a lot of uh uh either old timer or New England uh dance bands as well as uh just more popular folk music and new artists coming up   uhhuh well were on totally different wavelengths   okay   im im more uh old rock and roll uh some new newer i guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type   uhhuh   you know uh Van Halen that kind of thing  any   yeah what about uh classic rock type stations   uh i dont listen to the radio at all we live in a fairly small town so uh classic rock for me is what i have which is like uh Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix   oh okay so some some of the older Eagles stuff was good   uh yeah   i i didnt like uh they started getting a little more you know the type of music at at least to me its uh sounds like its only sounds good at a high volumes and i dont like listening at high volumes   yeah yeah   but uh some of their older stuff stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me   yeah well its   you know Hotel Hotel California and that era   yeah yeah that does thats something you dont doesnt even sound good loud really   yeah   so yeah definitely so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some i might know of i dont know any folk music at all   well down in Texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then   yeah oh yeah we hear   im sure im sure theres a lot of that down there   oh plenty way way more than i can stand down here         i i dont care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it i   well there theres a Conway Twitty twang then theres the uh Dolly Parton uh Hollywood sound type   yeah yeah thats more even more commercialized form of country music but uh its getting uh uh getting pretty big everywhere as i see it Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses so its   yeah yeah i think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts   yeah its its kind of strange that its getting as big as it is concert tours for country and western singers is its its quite quite odd but uh i dont know its music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays i think its becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know its its its   hey i i i think most artists are in to make a few bucks   yeah and thats all its its   but theyre not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message      yeah yeah thats what it it was yeah thats what what you say and and then music is wrapped around now now its the other way around   yeah and i dont i dont think gun at least to my mind Guns and Roses doesnt have too much of a message too much to say     no no they dont have anything really important you want to hear but you know its kind of odd its like doesnt have to be good its just who does it you know you hear a you hear a Paula Abdul song and you and i think if somebody else were to play that   uhhuh   you know they wouldnt they nobody everybody would think thats lousy but because she did it its supposed to be good you know it comes to the point where its your name not what you do   right   more than anything Madonna can do anything and it would be considered good because its Madonna you know   right   Madonna could start playing folk music and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it so its its its really backwards how things are working now but   uhhuh yeah it it its the artist not the merit   yeah exactly so i dont know i i dont know that thats i dont think thats a good thing at all but thats  thats what the point weve reached so i dont know   yeah   how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least   well i dont know i know for myself that uh for the most part i dont know which artist is which so i listen to a song i either like the song or i dont like it and then if i really like the song eventually ill figure out who it was   yeah you yeah yeah thats about how i am on popular music i dont you know you dont i dont know enough about it because i just listen uh everything i listen to is what i buy not whatever they play on the radio so   well you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist and   uh i yeah i just mostly buy along the same lines all the time i dont really switch around to new things very often   yeah   its just its you know its way to hectic and too confusing its   yeah so you keep buying the same artists until you dont like an album then you stop   uh yeah generally or about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know will buy something new that i havent heard and i listen to it that way but   yeah   as far as yeah i dont go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless ive heard it   yeah see thats one thing i like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know theres a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in New Jersey   yeah   and its very nice you go into the coffee house and you know an artist is there and very often the artist will have a demo an album and so if you like the artist you buy the album   yeah   so you definitely get to try before you buy   yeah yeah thats definitely i thats   though it you you you dont always quite get it right
