                                 A Very UnSucky Year                        Dear Colleagues            Let me open with a flashback to the s which is when I started writingmovie reviews and when it seemed as if all my wrapups began with a variationon This has been the suckiest year for movies in history  We were on adownward spiral In the wake of Jaws and Star Wars  studios hadbeen infected with blockbuster fever Yes theyd always been profitorientedbut now they were run by publicly held corporations instead of whimsicalmoguls and development offices had only recently become umbilically attachedto marketing departments We were suddenly drowning in teenpixSimpsonBruckheimerstyle Go For It movies and mismatchedbuddy cop flicksThe MTV aesthetic hadnt enlarged the vocabulary of storytellingit had dumbedit down The indie movement was but a trickle Spike Lee hadnt emerged andif you believed the conventional wisdom never would Movies that many in mygeneration regard as touchstones were freaks Blue Velvet came aboutbecause a nutty guy named Dino wanted David Lynch to make another StarWars  Dune  My Beautiful Laundrette was financed by and forBritish TV Really interesting mainstream pictures Something Wild saywere seen by almost no one            I flash back to those dark times because I think of this past yearthe lastyear of cinemas first whole centuryas the most hopeful since the s Itsnot that there have been so many masterpieces Its that movies have becomeexpansive again Theres an anythinggoes quality to even studiopictures that suggests an impatience with old ways of telling storiesa desireto create a new syntax to capture a new kind of flickering consciousnessNarration has returned along with novelistic freeassociational leaps inimagery In part this is the upshot of digital editing technologies whichpermit noodling around as never before and in part its an indication that theaforementioned MTV aesthetic is beginning to come of age Thank GodandGodard In mainstream film you have to go back to the silents to find imagerythis unfettered            Im not talking about the undiscriminating amphetaminesoaked pyrotechnicsof Oliver Stone or even the discriminating amphetaminesoaked pyrotechnics ofMartin Scorsese Its David O Russell making a bigbudget war movie  ThreeKings  that revels in both physical and moral confusion Its Being JohnMalkovich  in which the fluid craziness turns audiences onthey love notknowing where theyre going Steven Soderberghs The Limey is one of myfavorites this year not because I think its such a great film or even as muchfun as Out of Sight  but because Im so exhilarated by its doubling andtripling and quadrupling back Soderbergh messes up its surface the way anartist hacks at a canvas with an Xacto blade reshuffling footage in a waythat ultimately dovetails with both the solution to the movies mystery andto its larger themes Im aware of the counterexample the dread HarmonyKorinne whose hacking at his canvas is an attempt to disguise his limitationsas bold artistic choices            Our colleague Jonathan Rosenbaum who shared this space last year willdoubtless make fun of my sanguinity He has argued in the Chicago Readerthat the most challenging foreign and independent films are not being bought byUS distributors or worse theyre being bought by Miramax and leftunreleased in the United States He might be rightI cant say But fromwhere I sit the medium looks damn healthy Maybe former indie titan Miramaxis busy churning out Britinflected Oscar vehicles but Warner Bros andParamount are putting their stamp on such gutsy fare as Three Kings Election  and South Park Bigger Longer  Uncut             Tomorrow I plan to talk about some of the amazing performances in thisyears moviesas well as responding to your comments and to those of ourreaders But first my choices for the best movies of              South Park Bigger Longer  Uncut  This breathlessly vulgarhyperbolic Swiftian satire of the notion that movies warp our fragile littleminds is our generations Duck Soup not to mention the most inventivemovie musical in decades My only question Why does the TV show blow chunksthis year             Three Kings  One of the most audacious war movies ever made withan original offkilter sensibility that captures the madness of Iraq and thebetrayal of the Kurds by the United States in the days following the Gulf WarIt might have been even better if it had been less bound by formula thewriterdirector David O Russell is working at such a high level ofinspirationand outragethat the structure he has employed cant fullycontain the emotions he kicks up             Being John Malkovich  Close to pure farce yet grounded inloneliness impotence selfloathing envy The action is surreal the emotionsare violently real The screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is a genius at findingslapstick correlatives for peoples nebulous senseor nonsenseofthemselves             Election  See the entry above Alexander Paynes caustic comedytells the story of a highschool election from four differentperspectivesnone of them remotely rational             The Iron Giant  Brad Birds cartoon evocation of leftist sscifi is uncannily lyrical It sums up an entire era of ideological genremoviemakingand transcends it             Boys Dont Cry  Starkly beautiful Kimberly Peirces debut filmhas at its core a tragicomic irony That the crossdressing Brandon Teena a ka Teena Brandon the rapturous Hillary Swank feels most at home among the sortof roughnecks who would kill her if they knew her true gender             The Buena Vista Social Club  A triumphant concert that in thehands of director Wim Wenders is also a triumphant act of reanimationof aculture a city a way of life             The Limey  See above             The Straight Story  David Lynchs implacably untwisty roadmoviecall it Found                Highway with a performance by RichardFarnsworth of unbounded soul                        Im leaving number ten symbolically blank because I couldnt decide amongso many terrific films Any other year it could have been Dogma Sweet and Lowdown  TopsyTurvy  All About My Mother Rosetta  or even laugh all you want you ungrateful swineMagnolia  It could have been A Map of the World  one of the mostpainful movies Ive ever had to sit through I couldnt finish the noveleither but one that ultimately pays off It could have been A Walk on theMoon  My Son the Fanatic  The End of the Affair  Dick Sleepy Hollow  Run Lola Run  Toy Story   PrincessMononoke  Cookies Fortune  American                Movie  or thebarelynoticed black comedy Six Ways to Sunday  It could havebeenwhatever their problems The Sixth Sense  American Beauty The Blair Witch Project backlash schmacklash it scared me OctoberSky  or The Matrix  It could have been a poignantly silly comicbookmovie that I seem to be alone in loving Mystery Men             It could have been Joel and Ethan Coens The Big Lebowski  which Iinexplicably missed last year but has given meand I suspect manyothersmore pleasure in repeated cable viewings than all but two or three ofthe movies above It will survive its boxoffice flop and become a classic            It could have been a movie I havent yet seen Tim Roths The WarZone  Hurricane  Any Given Sunday  Errol Morriss MrDeath             It could not have been anything on my Worst list                            Dates  which gives obnoxious heterosexual Jewish males a worsename than we deserve                           Life is Beautiful the English version Okay I admit it I didntactually see the English version I just think its cool that I can putthis movie on my worst list two years in a row Maybe I should make it apermanent fixture                           Julien DonkeyBoy  See above See anything but JulienDonkeyBoy                            The Haunting  The antithesis of The Blair Witch Project andeverything thats wrong with overexplicit bigbudget horror                           Star Wars The Phantom Menace  Jar Jar Binks Enough said                           Body Shots  A great case for date rape                           Happy Texas  How many lame homo jokes can fit into a singlemovie                           Playing by Heart  Just mediocre until a mother reads GoodnightMoon to a son on the verge of expiring from AIDS Then monstrous
