        okay go ahead     well i  i live were gonna compare notes um i uh i   yeah   myself often desire to exercise often believe i should and rarely do   dont do it well i tell you i i firmly believe in exercising i think its a i do it everyday on a regular basis i   what what what sort of of regiment do you have   well i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles but this time of year you cant get much biking in uh   umhum   but every morning i use this Presidents uh council of physical fitness and it really is   umhum   uh uh its worth doing and you can do it anywhere i i travel quite a bit in my in my business and you can do it   yes   you know wherever youre at and if you do it i i do it every morning after uh usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get you know dressed going you know to go to work   yes umhum   and uh now what i do i mean ive done this for you know like fifteen years so you dont start at this kind of regiment you know i so what im telling you isnt something you go out and do and because youll hurt yourself   yes     uh every every uh you know it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because i do it all the time but i uh i do twenty five um uh what where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch you know left and right toe   umhum right   then i do uh ten uh right and left uh trunk twisters   umhum   and i do uh about sixty uh uh you know bicycle type uh leg thrust type things   umhum   and i do uh twenty uh leg lifters on each side you know when youre prone laying on the floor   yes yes right   and then i do fifty pushups and do a hundred sit ups and uh then i do about uh   my goodness you do all of this in fifteen minutes   oh yeah oh yeah and then uh thirty uh now if you did football like like the old grass drills where youre on your stomach and you you know prone type things where youre kind of rocking on your stomach type thing   umhum   but that takes about really about maybe about thirteen minutes uh you know in the morning to do it but   yeah now what what keeps you doing that i mean i i sometimes start start little much less much more modest efforts  but i  give up i just find them boring and hard to   well um   find time for it on a given day and   years ago i used to uh referee football and uh to stay in condition i did that uh just as a normal basis and uh uh     yes yes   i tell you just by doing it uh well example this summer i i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be so i i increased i do three hundred sit ups a day now but not at that in the morning i do a hundred then and then i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed i lost fifteen pounds   umhum   just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you can you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you dont you know within within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical your physical being and uh   yes umhum yeah   i just you know youre ready to go at a i i i think its really important   well i i i whenever i do it i feel good   yeah   i mean good that i have done good because its it seems right and good because it has good effects but but its this maintaining a a regular habit that i just cant seem to do     well well thats why Chuck i think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you didnt need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like   yeah yeah   well i i like biking and during summer ill do you know at least seventy five miles a week and when i really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty but you cant   umhum umhum   you know theres excuses the weather or you dont have time or something like that   yeah   but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth youre gonna spend fifteen minutes or a half hour and you get up a half hour earlier   umhum umhum   and once you start getting into that one you just feel good and you look a whole lot better   yes yes do you do you does your wife participate in any of this or   unfortunately not and theres no way i can get her to so its a like its something you either just really want to do it or  you cant talk anyone into it if you dont like to exercise you know it isnt going to happen but   umhum   yes yes   i i sure wish she would shes you know unfortunately overweight and but shes a wonderful woman and you know no sense getting in arguments with her anybody about it   umhum yeah yeah well i uh i uh i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me i  that would be a little bit of peer pressure would help considerably   well   but you seemed to have solved solved that problem without any any external   no problem at all and uh if you get one of these mats you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these ABCs of physical fitness on them   help yes   my one of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year and uh   what what what whats on whats this mat i mean in   it it its just an exercise mat that rolls up so you can put it out you know just in the corner   is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it i mean its that its that kind of like half inch of foam or something   well yeah you can do that but but it doesnt yeah yeah its a foam thing yeah yeah and its its just about six feet long it rolls up   yeah yeah   and i dont take it on trips with me i you could but uh i dont mind uh you know if i do like sit ups ill throw a a towel down or something and you know so you dont have the abrasive   yeah
