                                 Clintons Peace Therapy            Last Friday after nine daysof talks under President Clintons supervision at the Wye River plantation inMaryland Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leaderYasser Arafat reached an agreement on the next phase of the Middle East peaceprocess Clinton rushed the two leaders to the White House to complete thesigning ceremony before sundown the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath Minutesafter the ceremony ended the sun set Jews all over the world ceased theirlabors and the White House spin doctors went to work lobbying reporters togive Clinton credit for pulling off the deal            Clintonscritics could have denied that the Wye deal was a triumph or that Clintondeserved credit for it But this would have been futile Instead theydiminished his achievement in a subtler and more effective way From apolitical standpoint Clintons true payoff for facilitating the peace deal isto put the Monica Lewinsky scandal behind him His enemies are trying todeprive him of that payoff by binding the two stories together            The Clinton camps spin in the days since the agreement hasmade clear that its game plan is to change the subject In campaignfundraising appearances Clinton portrayed himself as a peacemaker and saidthe agreement reminds us what counts On NBCs Meet the Press  whenconservative activist Gary Bauer denounced Clintons behavior in the Lewinskymatter Democratic Party Chairman Roy Romer paraphrased the king of Jordanspraise for Clintons performance at Wye This election is not about thatscandal said Romer This elections about leadership Its about apresident of whom King Hussein said Ive never seen his equal in all thepresidents Ive known  Strategist James Carville similarly brushed offquestions about Lewinsky When you see what King Hussein has said about thispresident asked Carville who do you believe has got more integrity andcharacter King Hussein and Nelson Mandela or Bill Bennett and Jerry FalwellPeople know this presidents doing the job            Clintonsympathizers in the media picked up this spin Clintons performance at WyeRiver disposes of the argument that because of the Lewinsky affair he cannot bean effective President wrote Anthony Lewis in the New York Times  Italso put that affair in perspective How trivial it looked compared with thestakes at Wye River On ABCs This Week  Sam Donaldson noted thatClinton would visit the Gaza Strip in triumph in December While theRepublicans are holding impeachment hearings in the House boastedDonaldson Mr President will be striding the world like a colossus            Far from denying Clintons triumphconservative pundits and politicians graciously acknowledged it On Fox NewsSunday  Sen Richard Shelby RAla credited Clinton for shepherding thetalks On CNNs Late Edition  Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah called it oneof Clintons grandest moments Foxs Brit Hume argued that Clintonsachievement shouldnt be underestimated Bill Clinton is good at peaceprocesses agreed ABCs Bill Kristol Lets give him credit            Insteadconservatives slyly appropriated the theme of a Sunday Washington Postfrontpage article which suggested that Clintons vices in the Lewinsky affairhad become virtues at the Wye summit The summit with its allnight sessionsand constant brushes with disaster was a setting in which Clintons penchantfor keeping all the balls in the air at once seemed to thrive said thePost  Clinton relied on a personal style of charm persistence andlanguage that could be artfully imprecise particularly when Netanyahu soughthis assurance that the United States would release Israeli spy JonathanPollard According to the Post  one Clinton adviser acknowledged thatClinton had been encouraging enough about the Pollard case in a vague way thatthe Israelis could have heard a pledge that was never precisely made In anacid reference to the Lewinsky coverup a confidant of Netanyahus suggestedthat Clinton after initially saying that Pollard is going to be releasedhad taken refuge in a dispute about the word is  On This Week former Clinton spinner George Stephanopoulos confirmed the Post sthesis The things that drive you most crazy about Bill Clinton in asituation like this work He can see gray He can understand both sides of theargument            Clintons enemies flattered him in the most sincerewayimitationby exploiting the ambiguity of the ambiguity thesis Ratherthan celebrate the transformation of his vices into virtues they argued thathis momentary virtues will revert to vices It depended on qualities that hereally had doggedness a willingness to stay up all night charm said HumeAnd yet like so much that he does it was somewhat stained by this seamylittle business about Jonathan Pollard in which you cant quite figure outwhos telling the truth but one suspects that it may not be the presidentCNN pundit Tucker Carlson agreed The two things he did during thisnegotiation were to stay up all night and to throw a temper tantrum Inthis light the traits for which Middle East leaders lauded Clinton at thesigning ceremony took on ironic shadows his tolerance his flexible mindand the fact that as Netanyahu put it he doesnt stop            The virtuesasvices argumenthurts Clinton not only by cementing the Lewinsky episode as the defining momentof his presidency but also by obscuring the ways in which he succeeded at Wyeby overcoming the vices he displayed in that episode By some accountsClintons chief contribution at Wye was his refusal to buckle in two showdownswith Netanyahu But over time this aspect of his success will be forgottenbecause it doesnt fit the pattern And as the public comes to believe insteadthat Clintons flexibility and artifice led to the Wye agreement theagreements antagonistsor even its reluctant signerswill be tempted todemand that the terms be revised arguing that Clinton deceived them andfiguring that he will bend under pressure            What willhelp conservatives most in their efforts to link Wye to Lewinsky is Clintonsincorrigible narcissism Hours after announcing the agreement he said in aspeech to a conference of religious leaders I felt that it was a part of myjob as president my mission as a Christian and my personal journey ofatonement Personal journey Atonement Perhaps Clintons enemies
