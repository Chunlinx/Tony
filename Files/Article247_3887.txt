                                 Reporting Tips From the Big Boys            Chatterbox is impressed that Robert G Kaiser former managing editor of theWashington Post  and Michael Janeway former editor of the BostonGlobe and author of the justreleased Republic of Denial Press Politics and Public Life at theMillennium  managed to conduct an entire interview with Washington lawyerlobbyist Harry McPhersonwithout once uttering the word tobacco            The interview occasioned by McPhersons  th birthday appearedin the Style section of Oct s Washington Post  McPherson wasintroduced quite properly as an important former aide to Lyndon Johnson andauthor of a muchpraised memoir A Political Education  Chatterbox will even go alongwith the interviews overall tone of deference headline The Long View of aChanging Capital from a distance McPherson has always struck Chatterbox asa kind thoughtful and for the most part honorable man The facts thatMcPherson was an old friend of Kaisers and a former boss of Janeways werenoted prominently and did not strike Chatterbox as disqualifying            But Chatterbox is at a loss to explain how anyone but a pair of formerlyhighranking newspaper executives could conceive of interviewing McPhersonwithout grilling him about his representation of the tobacco industry which in transformed McPhersons law firm Verner Liipfert Bernhard McPhersonand Hand into a gaudy lobbying powerhouse at least in terms of billablehours An appropriately tough Washington Monthly  article by Amanda Ripley aboutMcPhersons tobacco sellout reports that in  Verner Liipfert raked inmore revenue than any other Washington lobby firm According to theMonthly piece Verner Liipfert though hired to help sell to Congressthe settlement reached between state attorneys general and the tobacco industrywithout of course letting Congress make the minimal improvements required tomake it even a marginally acceptable deal was in fact mostly selling itsreputation The substantive negotiations were conducted by others the firmsapparent role mostly in the person of partner George Mitchell but also throughMcPherson himself was to lend prestige to the tobacco industrys side In thewords of one former Verner Liipfert partner quoted in the Monthlystory They were getting paid more for who they were than what they did            Here is the bold way Kaiser and Janeway approached this issue in theirMcPherson interview                                             Q Some would say that money talks loudest of all in the business yourenow in What about your practice and this firms practice Can you representpeople based on some ethical or political judgment about how much they deserveyour representation or is it really just a question of selling yourselves tothe highest bidders                                       Despite Kaiser and Janeways invitation to answer this question with breezygeneralities McPherson to his credit answers by getting into specifics abouthis firms tobacco business                                             A Well you hope that the people you represent will be those that youfeel ought to prevail or at least ought to be protected Let me take somethingthat has been an issue with our firm and with me personally Ive taken a fairnumber of hits for being one of the people who signed on to represent thetobacco industry when they started their negotiations with the state attorneysgeneral and the health groups back in  The initial contact with our firmwas made with George Mitchell Senator Mitchell is a man of tremendousintegrity and intelligence                                                      Chatterbox translation Dont blame me It was that greedy bastardMitchells idea                                             He was invited to involve his firm my firm in representing the tobaccoindustry as it began a negotiation in which it was prepared to pay an enormousan unbelievable amount of money to various state coffers which could be usedfor antismoking campaigns and all manner of such things It was prepared tomake all kinds of changes in its behaviorthe way it advertised particularlytoward young people In exchange for that it was hoping to get protection frombankruptcy which it feared would come if some of the state suits that had justbeen fashioned had succeeded                                                      Chatterbox translation Like I said it was Mitchells idea                                             Our job in this law firm was never to go to the Hill or to the executivebranch and say smoking doesnt cause illness It was never to say the tobaccoindustry is being mistreated It was simply to say the industry is prepared tomake revolutionary changes in its behavior if it gets some protection fromthese giant suits and this is a good deal for the public                                                      Chatterbox translation Of course tobacco companies representsomething close to pure evil But the real dirty work had already been done Wecould present ourselves as the good guysmidwives to a historic settlement ofhealth claimswhile downplaying the role we played in minimizing on ourclients behalf whatever sacrifice Big Tobacco had to make And if asultimately happened no settlement resulted we could shrug our shoulders sayHey we tried and act like unsuccessful brokers to an honorable peace                                             Some journalists wrote scathingly of me Mitchell former Texas GovAnn Richards also McPhersons partner because we had agreed to do that Weagreed to do it because we thought it made a lot of sense in terms of thepublic interest and secondly because it was very handsomely compensatedwork                                                      Chatterbox translation See how easy that is Look we can evenconcede publicly that we were getting paid a lot to do thisbetter thatwe should point that out rather than you and still makeour critics look like a bunch of braying jackals I bet you arent even goingto ask me a followup question            And they didnt             Chatterbox should here disclose that he is a contributing editor atthe Monthly  On the other hand Kaiser gave Mrs Chatterbox her start injournalism
