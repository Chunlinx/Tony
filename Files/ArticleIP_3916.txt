know however that my numbers have a source that has nothing todo with my admittedly arthritic arithmetic skills If McIntyre has a problemhe should consult the December   Taxing Issues column inBarrons

tenure at TNR  including but not limitedto his brilliant editing there of Stephen Glass I will take his comments as acompliment I will resist the urge to reply to my Nation colleague KathaPollitts comments about me and the mother of my daughter whom she soknowledgeably characterizes without ever having been introduced                  Slate                is not the place to air intra Nation feuds despiteKathas verbal incontinence I find it sad moreover to read the same tiredtripe over and over from the pen of a writer who once appeared on her way tobeing a great poet and gave it all up

Richard Nixons but it would be wrong isreally the classic example of what Safire calls tickling the wire how do youexplain the fact that no hush money was raised or paid as a result of the March Watergateera tape to which you refer Nixon detractors say the desultorycomments about raising money were the operative as they used to say part ofthe conversation Nixon defenders of which I as director of the Nixonlibrary of course am one stress that the president said it would be wrong andthat if memory serves the White House cant do it Seems that the only wayto resolve such ambiguity is to see what actually happened as a result of thetaped conversation Ditto one imagines with Hubbell             John Taylor                                       Affirmative Tracktion                        As aformer track wannabe and somebody with several postgraduate degrees I tookexception to this egregious statement in the May  Todays Papers            Letting slower whiteAmerican runners into races just because theyre white Americans is preciselyanalogous to letting blacks and Latinos with poor SATs and low grades intocolleges just because theyre blacks or Latinos            There isonly one criterion on which to judge road racing time posted Youcannot argue about home field advantage equipment differences or help fromteammates You are arguing there is only one criterion because it isprecisely analogous for determining a good college student SAT scores In aroad race you look to see who finished first and in determining who iseligible for race entry you go by the unbiased clock

remark was in response to the WashingtonPost frontpage story about a possible bias by insurance companies withregard to payment for Viagra vs oral contraceptives You state that since thesecond paragraph says that more than half of Viagra prescriptions are beingsubsidized by health plans and the sixth paragraph says that slightly morethan half of all birth control pills are there isnt really any bias andwhy do we need this story            I submitto you that you are overlooking a key fact in this statistic and that is theamount of time it took to get each of those plans to subsidize the drug inquestion How long have birth control pills been available by prescription years  years Yet only slightly more than half of all birth control pillsare subsidized by health plans according to the Post  By comparisonhow long has Viagra been availablea month How wonderful for impotent menthat in that short space of time it has already reached approximately the samelevel of subsidization by health plans             MicheleHarvey Centreville Va                           Antitrust and the Law                        In his piece Microsuits Jacob Weisberg shows he knows more about currentpolitics than about legal history He states The question whether regulationof commerce is a state or national affair was supposed to have been settled in            Of course this question wasby no means settled with either the Constitution  or the Bill of Rights As there were few firms large enough to cross state lines into federaljurisdiction in the  th century the nations founders generallyassumed the states would govern the economy Nineteenth century common lawrestraintoftrade prosecutions fell to the state courts as did the earliestantitrust cases Federal antitrust suits could not exist until Congress enacteda federal antitrust law in  and even after the question of jurisdictionremained Since the Constitution only permitted the national government toregulate commerce whole areas of economic life were outside federaljurisdiction This was the essence of the  EC Knight case whichheld manufacturing beyond the authority of federal courts The USSupreme Court did not enable wholesale federal intervention by definingcommerce more broadly until the New Deal cases such as NLRB vs Jones andLaughlin             Ofcourse the fact that state prosecutions have a long history does not mean theyare desirable On the other hand on the basis of Weisbergs article Im notcertain why he finds diverse legal climates so disturbing Are we to discountsuch antitrust prosecutions because the attorneys general are ambitious Thisseems a mighty high standard for any policy Though it may be inefficient Ithink it reasonable that each locality can set the legal conditions of its owneconomic life as American states do with regard to taxation infrastructureand a thousand other economic issues             Andrew WenderCohen Legal history fellowUniversity of
