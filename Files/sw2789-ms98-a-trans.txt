          okay are you on any kind of uh regular exercise plan   i i yeah im yeah i i do aerobics uh step classes and um toning classes yes   step classes whats that   its um its a new uh form i think uh its like low impact aerobics but at it   oh instead of hopping and jumping your just stepping   umhum yeah you you have a step and you literally step up on the step and move your arms its its its its new its fun   oh okay huh i probably couldnt do that because of my knee   uhhuh bad knee     yeah   um and uh i do toning a lot and uh some every once in a while i play tennis   yeah   im not too great at it but i i try to play   yeah ive ive kind of gotten out of the habit myself i mean its i guess what i do now is i play softball right now thats about well right now im on two teams so its four nights a week but uh   umhum gosh   uh so i enjoy it but   umhum   as far as you know uh instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there i went and bought a weight bench and dont ever hardly use it need to need to make myself do that   uhhuh right yeah yeah i slacked off a little because of um im about to graduate from college and so this past couple months have been really hectic so i havent really gone and ive really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out but   what school you going to   im at East Carolina   oh   but um no i uh my step classes and toning is about the only thing well i mean   now whats whats toning is that lifting lifting weights   its its um like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups you can do with   oh okay isometrics stuff like that   yeah you can do it with certain you know you can do it with weights if you wanted to but you know you leave out of there usually the next morning if you havent done it in a while you wake up the next morning youre like oh no what did i do to myself and your whole body aches you know um   yeah   i know im looking forward to getting back into getting into shape uh i feel like im out of shape but i feel guilty for not going because i really im im so used to going for you know three or four years now but um   umhum yeah i stayed in pretty good shape during school i played baseball all the way through and you know working out six hours a day usually six or seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape   uhhuh oh yeah oh yeah   but uh ever ever since i got out of school you know just jumped right into the job and   umhum   i guess the job that im in its stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule   uhhuh   because i work some weird hours and do some traveling and   uhhuh       no some um i walk a lot because uh you know being in in school we i dont know if your campus was anything like ours but our parking lots in one end of the of the campus and the school the buildings are all at the other end so   yeah        no i didnt have well much of a problem we i guess i went to a small Baptist school and we had about when i was there maybe thirteen hundred people  so its pretty small yeah   uhhuh oh okay thats if yeah yeah   but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant   umhum   so   yeah its uh i live i live on the second story apartments so i walk up and down stairs all day long so       uh   uh weve got a one story house now thats thats enough i guess i push the lawn mower around thats fairly regular   yeah thats one of the exercise now i i um   yeah   would like to start running ive never been much of a runner but i want to start i want to run but i dont i dont know if ill be able to to do it   what just because you you dont like to or because because you wont be able to   im  im afraid i wont be able to i wish id   oh if you do if you do aerobics you shouldnt have any problem running   yeah i hope not oh   weve weve ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough   uhhuh i dont even own a bike i think the last time i was on a bike when i was about twelve so         uh i dont know id be afraid  afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike you know   no you cant forget how to ride a bike   yeah but um no i guess thats about the only form im trying to think of of other things that i do that would be considered exercise  or things i should do   yeah now when i was going to i i went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred well when we were at this junior college uh   i know   our coach you know we one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting   uhhuh   so they uh i mean it was a regular i mean we had it for course credit but still i mean it was pretty high impact stuff   uhhuh those aerobic classes are are tough the the high impact   umhum   definitely are are tough classes   yeah and shed uh you know most of the guys were all in one class so shed kind of lay it on occasionally you know   uhhuh   first thing eight i think we had eight oclock in the morning was our class   uhhuh   wake up   well now they have those uh those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight you have like bands i dont know if youve seen them theyre   umhum yeah i think my wife has some   yeah theyre theyre weird theyre uh you get uh theyre just made of i guess its different kinds of rubber uh and they get   umhum or sand even some of them well no theyre elastic so i guess it wouldnt be sand   uhhuh and theres some that like the different colors denotes how much they how much the tension i guess they are and how easy they are to move   hum   uh theres like i know theres purple gray and uh green and some of them are real short and theyre the ones that are the tough ones to use you know   yeah   but uh those classes i i enjoy uh i think uh with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor thats fun if you dont have one thats fun and not enjoy it look not acting like shes enjoying what shes doing the class is not going to get out uh what they should get out of the class   yeah   uh if the   so are you going to get into instructing well what are you studying   oh im an interior design major   oh okay  not in the not in the aerobic instructor type field   oh no no no no oh i could never do that i dont think       id rather just be the student   yeah   and uh oh occasionally i do the weights at the health club but low weights just   yeah the uh the some of the Nautilus equipment that i started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting i mean they they they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups   umhum   with those things but man they are ah uh i dont know to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back   umhum right well they um i just noticed at our health club they they put on these computerized one these computerized machines and you set a speed on it and the weight and it and it makes you do it and it tells you like if youre going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you       and stuff like a turtle goes faster and um it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you   a little negative reinforcement there while youre going   yeah so uh do that stuff like that but just ive never used those machines i just use the regular machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights   yeah   just to do you know some bicep tricep exercises situps of course     yeah thats thats where im really starting to get noticeable im just getting real soft in the middle   uhhuh oh yeah i think thats uh number one problem with everyone   umhum i havent really started to put on a lot of weight im i guess i probably put on about ten nine or ten pounds since i stopped playing which was about four years ago   uhhuh   but ive just myself i just notice myself just really real soft and im sure i dont have near the endurance that i did   yeah   but i i intend i keep saying i intend to get back into it   uhhuh yeah   i just need to put the old nose to the grindstone i i i guess at that point it would turn into a task   umhum   i dont consider it fun doing that but   right yeah i plan on getting back once i graduate next weekend   next weekend all right   next weekend yeah one week  then i plan to get right back into it you know its it does a lot for you i think makes you feel a lot better   yeah oh no yeah there theres no no question the the end result is great and i i mean i enjoyed you know we when i was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired you know   uhhuh and i mean you feel so much better about yourself just that you know   yeah umhum   you dont feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner   oh i still dont but           oh yeah       yeah   well good luck on your graduation and your   alrighty well thank you it was nice talking to you okay byebye   yeah you too bye
