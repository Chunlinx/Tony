              okay where are you calling from   from North Carolina   im in California   yeah thats coast to coast  its a little little bit earlier there though   it sure is right its just uh about about twelve thirty here   but were talking about a national topic anyway   thats right and i think that anything we can do to improve the federal budget would be  a boon to everybody no matter where they are in the country   yeah    thats the truth and i know that weve weve just come off a national high with the Middle East but now were facing the same old problems that we had before and that is balancing the budget     absolutely   i dont know how Californias budget is but North Carolinas state budget is uh disastrous right now too   well so is ours we have just been told that were thirteen billion dollars in the red which is more than the entire state budgets of about half a dozen states   oh my   and theyre talking about uh cutting uh aid to the schools particularly the uh university systems      it   and i our local school district is going to have to fire all its teacher aides to balance the budget so i things are tough all over      oh California has always been a leader   well  i i hope in this case the rest of you will be spared     oh now what was the proposition number several years ago that you voted on for   oh prop thirteen is the one that uh   yes   limits the amount that uh real estate taxes can rise every year property taxes can only go up a certain amount per year uh until the house is sold or  the person dies and then its reevaluated   right right yeah that that i think was a a smart move i dont know how its worked out but it it seemed very logical in fact it raises one of the issues that ive thought about the national budget the budget relates to all of us and so does the tax law which usually is an offshoot of the budget process ive often thought   uhhuh   that Congress ought not to be allowed to pass any new tax laws say every four or five years instead of every year   uhhuh   an individual has no opportunity individual or corporation or any other business entity has no opportunity to plan long range   well thats certainly true we can get hit uh a lot of corporations at least seem to get blindsided by taxes that are sometimes even retroactive which i would have thought was then unconstitutional  but doesnt turn out to be   oh yeah to the beginning of right uh thats another thing too ive often often wondered seemed to be when i was growing up i learned in Civics or Government that uh the House of Representatives has to initiate all tax bills   right   and i dont think its working that way Kathleen   no its i dont know where some of these things come from but they look like theyre from out in left field to me   no what   i dont know what were going to do long range to solve the budgeting problem but there certainly has been proposals why are are you aware of the Grace Commission proposals from a few years back   uh refresh me   well the WR Grace uh was put in charge of a commission to find government waste uh this is about eight or ten years ago now and he came out with a whole book   umhum oh yeah okay right   of his group i mean it has his name but he was just the administrator of it of places where things like government purchasing could be rationalized where uh renting of space could be made much more efficient where a lot of the accounting is just you know incredibly Byzantine and could be straightened out and where lots of different government activities are redundant   oh   and where and there are billions of dollars in every years budget that are just totally wasted because nobody is running the government as if it were a business     thats exactly the point the business or personal budget either one ive   and uh we we couldnt afford to do that sort of thing we cant we dont have money to throw around personally   no and when youre not responsible and thats really what it comes down to because you know it a government uh agency really doesnt care about what the postage rate is   uhhum it has no incentive to hold back on expenses uh i happened many years ago to work for a state government for a while and it absolutely boggled my mind the way they budgeted because there was no uh an attempt to figure out what it really should cost to do what we should be doing   uhhuh   it was just take last years budget add X percentage ask for that and if you hadnt spent all your money by December run out and buy something quick so that you   buy something thats right because you you are afraid your allocation will be cut the next year and   thats right i can remember uh the entire office got new electric typewriters because we hadnt spent all our budget money in December that was just crazy   umhum and the mentality was and probably rightfully so because the people devising the budget uh didnt go back to a zero based budgeting they just did it on the basis of what they spend five percent increase and uh go on with it   thats right we might come up short next year if we havent spent everything this year and so no matter how foolish the expenditure be sure we get rid of that money   uhhuh uhhuh and you know grace uh type waste that you mentioned we see often highlighted in the military and the defense department but its uh im sure its widespread to every agency   absolutely i think uh probably if you just looked at congressional budgets the amount they waste on frivolous things uh with congressional office staff is       again mind boggling you read about what it costs the new uh house whip or uh the uh Speaker of the House to redecorate and my God those offices were just redecorated a few years ago   umhum oh yes   they it they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars theyre spending twenty five thousand dollars just this year for a feasibility study to determine whether they should build a second gym at the capitol for the staffs of the Congress   im surprised its that low Kathleen   well thats thats not to build one stick thats just   oh i know im surprised the feasibility study could be done for that   well it thats the kind of thing that makes me mad i want to vote the whole batch of them out of office if thats the way they think they should spend our money and just because its a few hundred thousand here   oh yes   who was it said a a billion here a billion there pretty soon were talking about real money   yeah  thats sad   i think that was old Everett Dirtyson or somebody   thats sad and people dont realize it weve become sort of blase about the uh amount of money because a billion if if the government paid a dollar a second back in the national debt just a dollar a second it would take thirty years to repay a billion dollars now you know thats thats a long time and thats a lot of money     yes it is   and when were talking about trillions   and when were talking about adding that mu ch to a budget where its just already in the hole just the think about the amount of interest well be paying on that well probably more than double it   um have you the uh banking crisis is another another case i was reading this week about the FDIC saying that they couldnt take on another large bank failure without going to government to Congress   um   and borrowing and i started thinking now wait a minute theyre in exactly the same shape uh that they criticized the banks that theyre dealing with  exactly the same shape but   thats right yeah the only difference is the the uh taxpayers thats right   FDIC cant go broke yeah because you and i will pay for it   uhhuh or our children and grandchildren   right right have we solved anything Kathleen   i doubt it  but then i doubt if we ever will just keep writing to your congressman and telling him that   i i moved here from Oklahoma im originally from Virginia and moved to Oklahoma for twenty years and just moved back to the southeast and Oklahoma just passed uh last year a law stating that uh or limiting the terms of the state representatives   yeah we did that this year too California just passed that in the last election   yeah it will be interesting to see if we have any any impetus to go on to the national   i hope it will   yeah i think so too i i get torn thinking about some of the good people all the people i think are good and having to lose them but on the other hand uh maybe theyll pay more serious attention to the process while theyre there instead of the reelection   im well the thing is yeah whats funny is that everybody says they want to throw out the rascals but nobody wants to throw out his own rascal  otherwise we wouldnt have ninety eight percent of the incumbents reelected   nobody does thats right nobody does all right right are you working   yes im an editor at a think tank   editor good oh i i would uh love to get into another conversation with you about that   well its a fascinating job i get to see all kinds of interesting ideas and i do my small bit to help in uh at least express themselves coherently even if i dont always agree with what theyre expressing   oh i i can imagine that that whole process is fascinating to me i think id like to observe if not participate sometime     well weve got some really really interesting people we get fifty different fellows every year from all around the world   umhum   and uh so we get just the year of intense interaction with these people and sometimes we really hate to see them go wed like to keep them for years and years and lots of times were not so
