                okay i hope you know more about the subject of baseball and where theyre going than i do because   oh i know a little bit about it im not a die hard fan but i i enjoy the i like the Boston Red Sox myself   well i of all the sports that there are that there is i like baseball the best however i havent been to a baseball game in years but i have kept uh my eye on the Rangers   uhhuh   you know and i guess they were doing pretty good up to a point and then they kind of fell on their face   well with uh their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately so   correct right theyve got a one man show going there  which is interesting you know um   right oh its amazing   i guess he can i guess he can really call down a salary  theyre so astronomical i cant even imagine  that kind of money you know its just uh phenomenal   right well fortunately the Red Sox last time i saw the paper earlier this week were in first place and doing quite well um i   well good   been really busy at work this past week and normally on my way into work ill pick up a newspaper and uh it so every day ill have a newspaper at work and when i take a break ill look at the newspaper but this week ive been so busy i didnt even bother to stop   i understand i understand   but hopefully hopefully next week ill get back to my normal routine   okay uh you are involved with TIs uh speech um   but   recognition   well not really i um i   how did you find out about it   i work at  laboratory from uh im an officer in the Air Force and uh   oh okay i see interesting   they have a speech lab across the hall from us   oh great   and uh the speech laboratory does some work with uh TI at uh not in my office but uh in my division they do   i see umhum   quite a bit of speech work   well thats good well thats interesting and the topics are interesting uh they run a whole gamut of of uh subjects and uh i think we can address every topic but the depth of knowledge is quite different   sure sure   so uh when they chose baseball i mean im im i can understand baseball you know i dont understand football um you know uh its such a rugged game that it uh   uhhuh   uh it seems to be too physical for my uh interest   oh i prefer to i i i like       i never used to really like watching football that much but more and more these days im i ill like a football game but ive always liked baseball i i prefer to watch   umhum   um i guess im one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football and i id much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game   well i i can relate to baseball because i used to play baseball but i cant relate to football because ive never played football and and dont and have have any interest and i said if i ever had a son he would not play football   uhhuh   and uh i had four daughters so that wasnt a question but now i have a grandson that is you know is gung ho for um football   umhum   and uh that doesnt please grandma too much   well   im always afraid because the injuries are so uh can be very very devastating   well theres injuries in a lot of sport   i understand that but i think they they happen more in football i think the odds are cut down you know i i know they can get hurt in baseball too   i i umhum   the bat is a very heavy object can do a lot of damage but uh i think that they have a a lower ratio of injuries ratio of injuries in baseball   oh baseball thats true i i would say that baseball tends to be one of the less troublesome sports but uh for some people its just uh   because the yeah   uh   a love for them   well that that not so much that but uh even in baseball you can like when i played baseball when i was uh growing up i had trouble uh uh just throwing the ball because my i was very i was always very strong and i could throw when i was young i could throw harder than my uh like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to and so i was always throwing my arm out and uh   umhum i see uhhuh   having trouble i and i was a catcher so i was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and and that kind of stuff so i   umhum   that was always a problem for me was just just the constant throwing so   did you did you sustain any permanent uh injury with that   no i did that wrestling     oh oh okay   no id well i i uh i always been quite an athlete and doing different things and um the other thing was id never really let injuries stop me but interestingly enough you mentioned football is like now i wont play football anymore because of the uh because i separate a shoulder wrestling so   umhum umhum   um but i stood the stood the injury wrestling but it as long as i let it heal it never really bothered me then playing football this fall   umhum   i it was just flag football too i separated it again and it seemed to be like the straw that broke the camels back so   oh boy um umhum well i have uh i have a broken arm that i had since i was three it was never set right   umhum   and uh uh i liked bowling as a as a kind of a relaxing sport and uh one of the men that was in our league in on our league uh noticed uh you know uh my broken arm and the way my ball would do and he says let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage and so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen i had my high game of two eighty seven   my God   so uh yeah  uh it was really funny you know that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and and how to uh keep uh follow through with my uh addressing that to put the ball the uh pins   umhum   so that was interesting so i really um i got a lot of uh recognition from the uh uh the bowling league i guess im not sure where all my pins came from but but its but that was quite awhile ago but i and i never pursued it and a lot of people said well you should have turned pro and i thought nah not um humum i dont   umhum   my love wasnt there for the game i liked to as a as a method of uh entertainment and i uh fellowship but uh outside of that no i didnt and i and i still i like to bowl but uh   sure   i dont have um Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do   are you uh you on any leagues now     no im not no no uh at TI they have a sponsor a junior league achievement and uh its true bowling and ive never uh shared shared that with them i would have to brush up on my bowling before i ev en   oh   tried to uh win a lot of money for the junior achievement uh organization but thats the only thing that i would you know be allowed to do   uhhuh right well my grandmother has been bowling for gosh maybe thirty forty years i dont know a long time and she still shes got to be   umhum um umhum still carries a good league uh average   well no she doesnt
