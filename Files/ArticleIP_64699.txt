peacenegotiations with Syria He went to Washington without a hearty sendoff fromall his political partners the paper said in an editorial Three parties represented in the governmenttemporarily joined the opposition which refused to place its trust in theprime minister who promised that he would do everything to achieve the bestagreement possible for Israel  The editorial concluded If they dont trusthim enough to give him a hearty sendoff they dont belong in the governmentThe JerusalemPost s editorial criticized the desire of considerable numbers ofIsraelis to negate the influence of Israeli Arab votes in an eventualreferendum on the return of the Golan Heights to Syria It is wrong  tosingle out any group as somehow disqualified to influence decisions evencritical ones that are being decided democratically the paper said            Inanother alarm about the peace negotiations the Jerusalem Post predicted thatIran will step up terrorist activities around the world in order to foil asettlement This was the conclusion of an Israeli intelligence assessmentdelivered Tuesday to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee itsaid The general tone of the Israeli press remained positive however Ananalysis in Haaretz by Aluf Ben said that Israel regardsthe public handshake between Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara asthe principal achievement of the Washington summit The photo of them togetherwill become the Rubicon from which there is no turning back Ben wrote Thatwas always the main card that the Syrians held closest to their chest in thepoker game of peace negotiations  Barak won his photoopportunity even atthe relatively low level of the Syrian foreign minister on the basis of secretunderstanding with the Syrians and Americansand without having to announcehis withdrawal lines            In areportfrom New York the Jerusalem Post said there are problems deciding whowill benefit from Germanys agreement to disburse  billion in compensationto slave laborers of the Nazi regime The paper said that approximately Jewish survivors will be eligible to draw from the fund but that a distinctionbetween slave and forced laborers is a sore point with central and easternEuropean governments It quoted an unnamed Czech official involved in the talksas saying that while no one denies that the slave laborers who were inconcentration camps suffered more than the forced laborers the latter shouldget compensation that is dignified The Czech official said infighting amongdifferent sets of victims has already begun and he dreads the talks onallocating the funds I have heard things I really didnt want to hear hesaid The most unfortunate thing would be if it became a fight between Jewishand nonJewish victims But this approachto set up a lump sumreally asksfor it            Thedeal received little play in the German pressand seemingly none at all in theFrankfurter AllgemeineZeitung  which led its front page Wednesday with Russian troops closingin on the Chechen capital Grozny Also leading on the Chechen war theGuardianof London reported The damage the Chechen campaign is wreaking on Russiasrelations with the West was accentuated by

not in his right mind His comment on Catalan TV was widelynoted across Europe as the most outspoken yet by a western official Yeltsinis not in possession of all his faculties Solana said Weve seen it ontelevision across the world and nobody can hide it Le Monde of Paris also ledWednesday on Chechnya but with an opinion poll showing that a majority ofFrench people want economic sanctions imposed on

Washington Wednesday the paper said that nextspring the Clinton administration will redouble efforts to get Congress to passthe Macau Policy Act which will formalize American support for Macausfreedoms culture and autonomy But it quoted the Chinese Embassy inWashington as saying We will brook no foreign intervention  The issue ofMacau and the affairs of Macau will be purely Chinas domestic affair            In aneditorial the SCMP said it was a pity that theMacau Policy Act wasnt passed before the Christmas recess because that wouldhave ensured the continuance of the territorys vital textile exports to theUnited States It also warned Congress when it reconvenes not to slant theact too heavily on political issues China has not intervened directly in HongKongs domestic affairs There is reason to suppose it will pursue the samepolicy with Macau A nonconfrontational approach is the best way to supportMacau as it moves into a new era The SCMP also reported Wednesday that China
