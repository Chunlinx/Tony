                okay Jerry uh  could you tell me what what type of a house you have   well at the moment i have a little vacation house back in the woods and its brick and it has its pine paneled   uh and its a vacation home   well kind of because its temporary   oh i see   okay and it but if you know if you want to talk about other kinds of homes my husband uh son is a builder in Oklahoma City and he was visiting a couple of weeks ago so we went around to see all uh the homes that how they build homes in Charlotte   okay so  are you new to are youre new to Charlotte   what kind of materials they use   kind of originally from this area uh from Virginia uh area but yeah   oh okay uh   but moved here from Oklahoma City   originally from Oklahoma City   well no but we spent twenty years in Oklahoma were a mobile society           wow twenty years is a long time   yes it is to love it   um so yours is your home right now is typical of the ones that are in the area   well in the immediate area because were in the county with the uh uh farmers kind of farmers theyre about you know around ninety already eighty nine or ninety but their children have grown up and they have built then more contemporary are more uh uh kind  some ostentatious homes   huh okay   uh but all traditional theyre theyre uh theyre some are contemporary contemporary but mostly traditional   yeah yeah oh   how about your home   um   are you interested in uh   its uh its a salt box thats a its a its a New England   oh gosh   type uh i was born and brought up in the area that that i lived in and it was very rural and there was nothing there but uh   uh farms   uhhuh   uh or orchards one or the other you know there was a lot of apple orchards so when we decided to build we built   uhhuh   about thirteen years ago uh we looked for a home and the things that we were seeing were uh not up to my standards they were still building homes back then like they have for a hundred and fifty years you know the very little insulation in the walls and very little insulation in the ceiling so   yes umhum that doesnt work these days   yeah and it was uh it wasnt what we wanted so we did some research and i knew the land theres a lot of ledge up here so you have to be careful   umhum   uh their septic systems when theres no uh uh public sewer system there is water however so we picked out a piece of land that we liked and bought it and then we decided to build so we we did a lot of research like i said and we and we built a typical New England salt box in the area and when we built we were the first home there there was like about ten acres of oak forest around us   oh my   and it was absolutely gorgeous uh since then however theyve torn it all down and were surrounded by homes you know thats a thats another long story   yes yes   but were the only typical New England home in the area theres a lot of theres an English Tudor right next to us and theres uh theres a colonial our streets on just a short street theres only like six homes on it   uhhuh   and theres a uh an English colonial down on the corner and the rest are raised ranches and you know the typical uh home   yes   but we built ours um  we made uh we did it ourselves uh i sent uh uh some rough plans out to an architect to have him draw it up and then i subbed out the things that i couldnt do like i had a crew come in and frame it and i did the rest i did the inside the wiring the plumbing and uh you know   umhum sure my goodness   so we built the walls huh   you are multitalented you are multitalented   uh my dad had built a couple when we were growing up so kind of got used to it and we did a lot of research   uhhuh sure sure well if you were to do it uh again today what would you have done differently name things say   uh   we made the kitchen a working kitchen i think i wouldve made the kitchen uh a lot bigger because both of us like to cook   uhhuh uhhuh   and right now a working kitchen is very efficient but two people kind of get in each others way yeah its similar to a galley kitchen yeah and then we have uh a like a little dining area off that we have a formal dining room   is that like a galley kitchen uhhuh uhhuh   um ive since added onto the house weve got like uh uh looks like an old rustic uh log cabin on the inside uh its all natural wood the ceilings pine the walls are pine you know its uh one of those type kick around rooms   umhum umhum   and we put a greenhouse on it it was uh designed to be heated by the sun   yes how does that work in the winter   um it works fine as long as you dont put any plants in it   exactly it burns it up im a plant uh former plant person and uh business uhhuh so uh you know   yes oh are you oh we raise orchids   oh my   which is a little bit tough to do up here in the north but its a solar greenhouse we put up you know like the walls are six inches thick   yeah yeah well do you not have shade cloths and so forth and uhhuh well   no no we used uh fiberglass were faced the the greenhouse faces solar south   yeah yeah   and its its double glazed fiberglass with a one inch airspace in between it   yeah   so its kind of opaque we dont use shading on it um  but we do have to uh have air a lot of air movement even in the wintertime it can get uh brutally hot in there so the way it was designed was to uh uh i put a four foot foundation under it and put in twenty two ton of rock with with uh hot air piped through it   umhum   and all day long it just heats up and then at night it just gives it back into the house   well great great   so its its not bad its its uh id like a little bit warm land id like to go up further north and id like to instead of having a salt box id like to have it all on on one floor   yes well come south and uh you will already you will be watching the azaleas bloom and go they are just about gone this time of the year   thats right  you guys must yeah because the actually the winter hasnt been really bad   were all no huhuh everythings green all the leaves are out and all that so its pret ty   so you got your garden planted   my spinach   yeah sir its its probably gotten just a little bit too warm now we have trouble up here with uh uh   really well for not summer crops summer crops its uh its really not time to plant okra not quite the ground isnt warm enough but uh some of those   yeah no i uh i put down black plastic   umhum umhum   to help heat it up you know put it on the radishes and spinach but spinach kind of bolts quick on us so we put it Swiss chard instead yeah   yeah right get that out early umhum umhum   so anyhow thats what weve done for our house weve left it all natural so theres no upkeep you know its white cedar shingle   sure yeah   and the trim is stained so i dont have to go out and scrape and paint because i figured when i got old and retire i dont want to be working i dont be a slave to the home   no no you dont want to be on ladders do you you dont want to be on a ladder   um right right because that peek is twenty eight feet high and you come off twenty eight feet and it hurts so   umhum umhum well it certainly has been enjoyable talking to you this morning and uh hope to hear from you again sometime if they do that   yes you too okay yeah all right you take care okay byebye   goodbye thank you
