                                 Bradley in a Box            A couple of months ago I described Al Gores attempt to create aloselose situation for Bill Bradley Through the use of relentless oftenunfair attacks Gore and his staff thought they could trap Bradley between arock and hard place If Bradley remained on the high road emphasizing hispositive message and ignoring the vice presidents hectoring the unansweredcriticism would damage him But if on the other hand Bradley responded toGore in kind he would be descending to his opponents level dispelling hisaura of moral superiority in the process            Gores tactic has worked perfectly During the past several months Bradleyhas remained Buddhalike on his mountaintop dismissing Gores attacks aspoliticsasusual but not criticizing his opponent directly or even answeringmost of his complaints The result has been ebbing momentum for the challengerBradley has suffered from both Gores specific chargessuch as the distortionthat he opposed flood relief for Iowa farmersand from the general sense thathe is a Michael Dukakis or Paul Tsongastype of political victim As if tounderscore the unhelpfulcomparison with Tsongas  the Bradley campaign has been runningsecond TV ads in which Niki Tsongas Pauls widow says that Bradley isfalling prey to the kind of smear that undermined her husband in             So with Plan A plainly failing Bradley has finally switched at to Plan BHis own revised strategy was on view in last nights WMURCNN debate in whichBradley pointedly went after Gore in a way he has not done previously Bradleyrepeatedly called Gore a liar though he only used the actual lword after thedebate sneakily compared him to Richard Nixon and Rudy Giuliani blasted himfor pandering to every special interest group under the sun and wondered howGore would muster enough public credibility to serve as president if electedAnd my question to you is why should we believe you that you will tell thetruth as president if you dont tell the truth as a candidate Bradley askedin one of many direct confrontations He also accused Gore of having onceopposed abortion of distorting Bradleys healthcare plan and of being toocozy with corporate lobbyists and special interests            After the debate Bradley congratulated himself for finally taking thegloves off I thought I was doing pretty well counterpunching tonight quitefrankly he told Larry King in a postgame appearance Today at a rally inManchester Bradley described his performance as a fresh start to hiscampaign Last night I decided Id had it he declared Were going to callmy opponent on what hes been doing            I expect that Bradleys satisfaction will be shortlived His newfoundpugnacity plays into Gores hands as much as his earlier pacifism did In thedebate Gore was completely ready for Bradley turning every accusation of foulplay back on his accuser If thats not negative I dont what it is Goresaid in response to Bradleys charge that he is a favorite of Washingtonlobbyists The vice president also brought up the fact that Bradley injectedWillie Horton into the campaign and was forced to apologize for an unfair adI have never mentioned your name in an ad I have never used your picture inan ad Gore said There is nothing I have said in this campaign that is inany way mean spirited Every time Bradley took a whack at him Gore appealedto the ref I didnt foul him he fouled me            Many who saw this debate judged the nonstop quarrelling about who started itto be childish But thats fine with Gore since it reduces the two men to thesame level The point of Gores litigiousness isnt to establish that Bradleyscampaign behavior really is worse than his ownthough he claims it is Its toestablish that theres no real difference in their behavior If theyre thesame then Gore is better because he doesnt hold himself out as a paragon ofpolitical saintliness By his own rules Gore can go negative so long as hedoesnt make it personal But if Bradley goes negative hes a sanctimonioushypocrite If youre going to talk about a higher standard youre going tohave to live by them Gore said clearly delighted to be yanking Bradley offhis high horse He knows that once Bradley has thrown even a few punches hecant reclaim the status of a conscientious objector            Is there any way for Bradley to escape from Gores box Not that I can thinkof                           Click                here forBallot Boxs review of the Republican debate
