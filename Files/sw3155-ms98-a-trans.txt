                i really havent seen any movies lately so when the computer picked this one i was a little bit surprised but i think i havent been to the movie theater here in about oh six months but um you know the last movies that ive seen were probably on video   oh well thats we rent a lot of videos too  um we saw i have two little babies and we saw one movie recently and that was um The Terminator movie um which i didnt like after all   yeah uhhuh yeah now i havent i havent seen The Terminator movie but and thats kind of blood and guts isnt it i dont particularly care for that sort of stuff   well i dont either it on all the the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesnt kill anybody in the movie he doesnt he maims them   yeah right yeah he maims them pretty good doesnt he   so umhum he he uh i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part  in the movie so   yeah uhhuh i i saw uh Sleeping with the Enemy oh um i saw it uh oh couple weeks ago i rented it and um   oh i havent seen that one yet   watched it and i was i was pretty disappointed in it because i i was told by several people that its pretty scary and intense and i was pretty disappointed in it now its its a good movie but i guess uh that they built me up too much   uhhuh oh yeah well its   for my expectations in it there   with all the commercials uh and everything i havent thats one we wanna see i i wanna see uh Dances With Wolves but we havent seen that one yet either on video   uhhuh uhhuh yeah now i havent seen it either but uh ive heard that its real long that its a good movie but its long like three hours   yeah three thats what i heard too yeah weve got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late   to watch it so we saw uh the the uh movie with uh Sylvester Stallone Oscar   thats right  thats right Oscar   supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy  which was an interesting movie but not very funny   uhhuh yeah i know my daughter saw that and she liked it so yeah   unfortunately did she well it was it was an  amusing movie it just i guess maybe it would have been better if  wed have been at the theater as opposed to uh just at the house watching it with with no one else around so   umhum uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh and of course i get to watch all these movies like Look Whos Talking and Whos Look Look Whos Talking Too and because i have a ten year old so we we watch a lot of movies     oh   around that category you know that she that she can watch   umhum my son just turned two and so The Little Mermaid is now our favorite movie   yeah we seen The Little Mermaid too   weve Little Mermaid and Peter Pan  i think are are his two favorites that weve got   umhum umhum and theres some i think theres some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video um Shipwrecked   so oh i havent i didnt hear that was coming out   uhhuh yeah its fixing to come out on video and boy i cant think of the other one thats fixing to come out   well they just had uh The Rescuers movie that was a Disney movie wasnt it i think i heard that was just one was just out hes uh he doesnt sit still for the whole movie yet but he likes to uh   umhum right   to listen to the music and stuff if theres a lot of that in the movie in the movie so thats   umhum well im glad to know that theres somebody else out there that doesnt get to go to the movie theater   well i well tell you ever since my my kids are just small babies and i tell you we we really want to go a lot and uh theres so much out on video now that its almost you know the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it   yeah umhum   sometimes   thats right and then they go to the dollar movies   so umhum  that seems to happen i noticed that Dances With Wolves was playing at the uh Granada Theater   uhhuh   and uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie i thought that might be kind of fun to do   yeah that does sound fun   and of course you need a babysitter for that  definitely but uh you know id really like to get out to the movies more often course its so expensive now too   right   that you cant hardly afford it i i dont know we get discount tickets   umhum   where my husband works but other than that it just seems like its so expensive and then the popcorn and everything else you almost cant afford to do it     thats right   no matter  what although we did actually get we went on vacation couple months ago and we got to go see What About Bob   umhum   that was kind of a funny movie with uh Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray   uhhuh   that was fun   golly i dont think that ive ever heard of that movie   oh hes a Richard Dreyfuss is a uh psychiatrist and Bob is his patient and Bob follows him on vacation its kind of   oh thats the thats the one where they burn down the house or something the house explodes   umhum umhum umhum   oh okay   yeah thats the one   okay yeah another movie that i wanna see if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is um oh i just forgot the title of it um oh its supposed to be a real scary one um darn well here heres another one that ive seen i saw um um i cant remember the title of it either  um  yeah it really did its uh     must have left an impression
