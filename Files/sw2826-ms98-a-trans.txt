          um i think life uh now i grew up on a farm i dont what kind did you grow up in the farm   i grew up in um well at that time i was in a uh Trenton New Jersey so and it was a suburb of Trenton so i really had mixture of suburb and urban living   uhhuh i see i see well little little bit different i think though it was much slower and uh   yeah   much much more selfcontained   i think youre right its interesting im um i work in a high school   uhhuh   so uh im comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing   yes   and the pressures on the children uh you know you hear this as an excuse but its true they are so much greater   unreal unreal by comparison   oh i cannot believe uh what theyre doing uh academically the demands on them and uh and i can see why children do drop out   yeah i think thats right i i can remember as a child you know nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go   i can see i can see uh you know uhhuh uhhuh   it wasnt it didnt occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me they were   and then you didnt you didnt have to lock your door   no no   and uh a live and some of these are urban worries but uh its uh its a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now in this area things were um similar because twenty years ago lets see it was after   its not all that long ago is it   yeah twenty twenty five years ago is when we had the Washington riots the first rights weve been having some problem now and it reminded me of that     uhhuh uhhuh yeah we were living in New Jersey   uhhuh   uh in uh twenty years ago   whereabouts   uh in uh Allendal   uhhuh   and uh i use to have to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on at sometimes um   uhhuh   i dont know though its its kind of hard to really know because of though the news media had those riots uh kind of blown up out of proportion   uhhuh well the Washington riots werent because   because i went there many times and i never i never saw a riot   the Washington riots werent because i lived right downtown Washington and uh and what you saw is was what you got im telling you   did you thats what yeah well huh   yeah but you know its it is interesting uh theyre so many more theyre different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures uh the pressures of drug is so much the prevalence is so much greater the the kinds of diseases that youve got out the   uhhuh   uh i mean the consequences is so much whats going on is so much more serious   yeah i think thats true i think thats true   then when we were younger   i think the other thing is that uh we have taken some rather drastic turns in our in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when when im number one you know and uh uh uh worrying about the self and not uh seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged uh closeness of families and uh support for young people that the kind of support that they need to help them take care of the things if you dont have some kind of   yes and   of basic belief or something down inside of you then its very difficult to   uhhuh   uh to have anything to turn to when you got when youve got something facing you like that   thats true i also being involved in the school system see so many of problem children coming from their parents um children who will lie and cheat and you approach their parents and their parents are constantly justify them rather than to   uhhuh   uh you know theyre constantly uh  uh excusing their child and you can see exactly why the child is that way you can as a teacher cant hold a child accountable   like right now exactly yeah   if youre not going to get reinforced by that at home   thats right thats right   and you cant make up in a classroom of one hour a day whats not been done for fifteen or sixteen years at home   no thats right oh   and youre get you get mixed signals so its its not always the schools systems i think a lot of it is the families and   no theres so much more then that it starts very much deeper then that i think that too i see some flickers of   the way you were mentioning yeah yeah   of uh of good directions turning but whether theyre soon enough and fast enough i dont know its just   course life is a lot more complicated too in ways um the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now   right   uh you know with farming being so mechanized uh people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way   uhhuh   if that uh becomes less and less likely factory jobs are so much more um uh sophisticated   yeah thats right   and the kinds of knowledge that uh you know it its requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force and some people just dont have it its uh   right and theres so much so so many people on the lower end of those who who are going to be the the drop outs and the   and you worry with you know the effects of   and the poor and the homeless and whatnot   the effect of drugs on the young children and the unborn children uh in terms of  what its going to mean to a society in the future its a some ways its rather frightening rather   yeah thats just another yeah it really is its just it it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think of   it certainly is   of the jobs that is out there to be done   well it sure is   in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be   it sure is   uh not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago but   it was a little easier though wasnt it   uh yeah just the volume makes a big difference i   thats yes   as uh as uh mother you know i use to think sometimes its not so much uh its not so much the kids its just the volume of it to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and you know and everything   yeah and they all the things demanded of the mother too i mean uh i look at my mothers life uh   right   i mean she she didnt work um um for a long time uh when i was very young she didnt drive uh she learned to drive i think when i was um a teenager and her life was a lot simpler and i   right and and and childrens lives were simpler because mother was there somebody was there   thats right thats right thats right   and and when theres nobody there i always thought too that you know people worrying about going to work when their child when their children are little and i and i think thats sad if they have to because they miss so much but i i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go to go work was when they were teenagers   they need you more as a teenager isnt that true thats why im working in a school system so that im home when theyre home um   right its not so much that they come to you every minute but its that you are there when they need you   thats exactly isnt that thats so true uh uh i find working in a high school   yeah   its very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do   yeah   and it keeps me from being the old foggy but at the same time it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes   yeah yes i think thats true   as to whats come but thats the same im home at the summers im home with the holidays   yeah thats   im home at three oclock when the children are at home or where home one is now a senior in high school and the others in college   yeah well   and uh its uh it does it   but that helps a lot i have a daughter who just uh had a second job she needed need to work and she opted to go into a day care center where she could take her children with her   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them and uh     thats right   and felt like they were getting  you know uh a good kind of experience as well   well im   but uh i think thats really important i dont think people realize how important it is   thats that is that is so true and its not that always that the children always say something but every once in awhile theyll come up and make a comment     yeah you yeah   and you realize uh its important that and and yet you know we have to make that choice i think um twenty thirty years ago a lot of women  didnt have to make that choice   yeah yeah i think thats right what was what is your name again   well Linda Lee uhhuh   Linda okay   and your name was   well i think probably that weve just about i dont havent change the world but   well i enjoyed talking with you well i enjoyed talking with you     yes its nice talking to you too bye now   okay byebye   uhhum
