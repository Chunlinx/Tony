                                 Clintons Catch            When Bob Woodwards bylineappears on Page One of the Washington Post  it generally means Itstime to pay attention And indeed Woodwards April  story anitsevenworsethanyouthought piece about the Clinton campaignfinancescandal sounded pretty sordid It reported that White House officials hadtipped off the Democratic National Committee in  about Grigori Loutchanskya badegg Latvian businessman with alleged ties to the Russian MafiaLoutchansky who had been invited to meet the president at a aplatefundraiser with a ticket paid for by an American business associate waspromptly uninvited The reason this is troublesome is that the news aboutLoutchanskys background came indirectly from the National SecurityAdministration and that folks at the DNC who lack security clearances werethus recipients of an unauthorized leak of highly classified information            CNNplayed this revelation all day and the other networks reported it on theevening news If this allegation proves true and this disclosure actuallytook place it constitutes a felony violation said Rep Porter Goss aRepublican from Florida who chairs the House intelligence committee I am verytroubled by the implications for breaches of longstanding security controls atthe White House and the apparent misuse of intelligence information forpolitical purposes            In this furor a few significant details were overlookedhowever The first was that the essence of Woodwards scoop had been reportedtwoandahalf weeks earlier in the Washington Times  The Timesrelied on what looks to have been the same sourcea leak from Indiana Rep DanBurtons Government Reform  Oversight Committee which had apparently gotwind of the issue via DNC documents handed over in response to a subpoena Whenthe story appeared in the Moonieowned Times  no one cared Only theWoodward imprimatur made it national news            A moresignificant problem with Woodwards story is that the DNC didnt need anyclassified leaks to find out that Loutchansky who had met the president at anearlier fundraiser in  was trouble Before the  dinner even tookplace none other than William Safire had written about Loutchansky in theNew York Times  noting that the Latvian had been refused entry intoCanada the previous year because of suspected Mafiya connections Safiressource was Comrade Criminal  a book about the Russian Mafia by thejournalist Stephen Handelman that was available months before the fundraiserat the HayAdams to which Loutchansky was given the invitation that was thenwithdrawn The DNC could have spared itself the need for NSA intercepts byreading the paper or visiting the library            But the larger irony of this turn in thescandal is that when Woodward wrote his story the Clintonites were still beingbeaten up in the press for not having communicated similar informationabout Chinese bad guys trying to sidle up to the president A month earlierthe hot new revelation in the scandal was that officials at the NationalSecurity Council had neglected to pass on to their superiors the contents of abriefing by FBI officials who warned that the Chinese government might betrying to funnel money into the  campaign Incidentally theChineseinfluence story had been broken by the same Bob Woodward            What would have constitutedproper handling of the FBI disclosure to the NSC Presumably the same type ofprocedure that draws bitter denunciations in the Loutchansky episode The NSCmight have told White House officials some of whom were supervising fundraising for the campaign to be on the lookout for Chinese bearing gifts Forthis warning to be effective those White House officials would have had to tipoff the DNC which was soliciting the money directly In a separate but relatedepisode the administration has been pilloried for failing to heed exactly sucha warning from NSC officials about Johnny Chung a Beijingconnected hustlerwho got six Chinese friends into the taping of a radio address by thepresident            Youreally are damned if you do and damned if you dont says one anonymous sourcequoted in the most recent Woodward story Its good of Woodward to acknowledgethis ironyif briefly A more prominent quotefrom one senior officialisless sympathetic to the double bind that the Clintonites now find themselvesin This was top secret and it further demonstrates the total politicizationof all intelligence and White House operations Anything and everything wasdone in the name of fundraising Had Loutchansky got to see the presidentWoodward would probably have written a story about lax screening procedures atthe White House            In fact this story was written though not by Woodward InFebruary Tim Weiner of the New York Times reported that theadministration was no longer using vetting procedures put in place by RonaldReagan to keep foreign ghouls away from the president In their eagerness toraise campaign money DNC officials invited friends of the Presidentsfundraisersincluding Chinas biggest arms merchant favorseeking Indonesianbusinessmen a reputed Russian mobster and other dubiously credentialeddealmakersto meet with Mr Clinton Weiner writes Nor did the White Housecheck the suitability of Americans invited by the Democratic National Committeeto meet the President allowing among others a twiceconvicted felon to sipcoffee with Mr Clinton The procedure Weiner complains was dropped wasessentially what Woodward complains happened with Loutchansky            The mostvociferous journalistic critics of the president preach it round or preach itflat when it comes to these kinds of contacts The Wall Street               Journal s editorials now oscillate between accusations that theadministration abused sensitive information on the one hand and allegationsthat it ignored intelligence warnings on the other Safire too has ricochetedbetween lambasting the administration for abusing quasiindependentintelligence and lawenforcement agencies and blasting it for ignoringintelligence so it could raise gobs of money In the case of the FBINSC Chinawarning Safire thinks that the Justice Department behaved too cautiouslybecause it didnt wish to tip off Chinese agents lurking inside theadministration            So whats a presidentor an attorneygeneralto do Safire suggests that Janet Reno should have asked to see thepresident alone warned him unequivocally of the penetration enlisted his aidin the investigationor if she thought it necessary read him his rightsRead him his rights for what crime Being a Chinese spy That bit of hysteriaaside its not hard to imagine Safire and the Journal waxing apoplecticif the attorney general had asked for a private meeting to warn thepresident Clintons critics would surely have portrayed such a meeting as acorrupt politicization of the Justice Department reminded us again of themisuse of the FBI in Travelgate and Filegate and called once more for anindependent counsel            The Clinton administrationhas done plenty to fuel suspicion of all kinds But at some point the skepticshave to choose Did the Clintonites abuse power by trafficking in classifiedinformation or by ignoring it You cant commit both crimesor at least notat the same time
