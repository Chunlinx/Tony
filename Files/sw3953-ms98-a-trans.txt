        you stand on gun control     um i dont know i dont use guns i mean and i dont you know i i dont have any occasion to ive never been much of a hunter and any of that so i guess i havent really felt real strongly one way or the other   uhhuh   how about you   i i did a fair bit of hunting when i was growing up i pretty well havent in the last uh fifteen or twenty years pretty well given it up so   uhhuh umhum   um now i do have some guns uh uh i enjoy shooting you know for as far as targets and all but i dont particularly enjoy hunting any more im not really opposed to it uh   uhhuh right   but i am i am in favor of uh some some form of of gun control   yeah well i guess i do too i um i think that law that they tried to pass im not even sure if they passed it or not the seven uh seven day waiting period   yeah   i i think thats a  a reasonable law and im not real sure why the NRA was against it um you know it it really didnt the only thing it restricted was that you couldnt pick up the gun right away   yeah   um     i i dont see why youd oppose it either you know the uh the um for people who want them for legitimate purposes i mean seven days or even even id even be in favor of a a yeah thirty days i mean you dont need a gun on short notice   yeah seven days shouldnt be a a big a big deal yeah right and if you do you want the gun for  something else other than than shooting target because you can always get a gun to go and shoot you know target with   yeah for   right thats right   or you know  even hunt you can borrow a gun to do that  but uh you know if you want it right away you you want it for a different reason than than the legitimate reason for having a gun   thats right and yeah and and uh yeah and uh and the automatic some of the automatic weapons that are sold yeah certainly have no purpose other than to uh kill humans you know when youre talking about some of these automatic weapons   yeah it yeah and i i wonder about that because the the the sale of automatic weapons because uh i mean how many  how many rounds does it take to kill a deer if   thats right yeah you get these twenty and thirty shot rounds   if you need thirty shots to kill a deer you should be uh you you should be shooting with a camera  because youre dangerous anyway   thats right right yeah thats even worse than the thats worse than the auto wind uh cameras   thats right so i yeah i guess we uh we kind of feel the same way about about that i uh its its funny because i was over at in McKinney the other day and picking up a dog   yeah   and um and i saw some women um practicing you know shooting   uhhuh was just was it just outside some place or   and just outside yeah out out in the uh range but um i it reminded me of uh you know i was listening to a talk show the other day and and heard that the majority of the accidents that happen or the shooting that happens happens right in the home with somebody that you know   yeah that thats true yeah uh and and its pretty pretty common that it happens with uh   misuse of a gun   kids too you know the parent think that the guns hidden or that their uh kids wont bother it but then when theyre left alone sometimes uh   yeah   gun a kid will show it off to a friend and theyll start handling it and pretty soon somebody gets shot   yeah a lot of that happened and yeah i i dont i dont really see why the NRA would oppose i guess its because they you know they dont want any any kind of uh of government restrictions on   i i  think what theyre afraid of is that uh not necessarily  of this one particular law  or about a waiting period but i think theyre afraid that once  you know uh you establish one  regulation theyre afraid others would get started   then its a lot easier to just keep going from there   yeah let me   but   let me switch from my  other phone here i i think my hand phone  is going dead here   is that your phone or mine     okay can you still hear me  okay yeah i was just shutting the other one down   yeah you you mustve had a cordless       hello hello hello   hello oh know know i dont know whos on that one   oh       hello     you there yeah i im getting a lot of static im not sure whats going on here i switched phones it may be mine um   you still there huh well ive ive switched phones so   okay  um i think they on on they were asking about a numbering system i guess
