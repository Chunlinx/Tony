                                 Tabloid King Altman Answers Critics            Alex Kuczynski of the New YorkTimes raked Roger C Altman over the coals yesterday forbecoming a tabloid tycoon Its about time somebody did Roger Altman is not to be confused with the three Robert Altmans who are respectively a celebrated film directora former law partner to Clark Clifford and a former Rolling Stone photographer who took these compelling shots of hippies during the scounterintuitively it is the lawyer who ismarried to Lynda Wonder Woman Carter RogerAltman is a former deputy treasury secretary and continuing Clinton intimatewhose investment company Evercore Partners owns American Media which in turn owns theNational Enquirer  the Star  andmost appalling of allbecause it is so clearly the most nutty tabloid in Americathe Weekly World News             Faithful readers of this column may recall thatChatterbox has been tracking Altmans new career as a sleazepeddler seeMan Bites Dog and Its the End of the World But Dont Panic with aneye to finding out whether Altman would attempt to make his new media holdingsmore proClinton or more respectable Chatterbox naively assumed that if Altmandidnt make his tabloids more proClinton he would be frozen out by theClintons and that if he didnt make his tabloids more respectable he would befrozen out by respectable society            But according to the Times Evercores purchase of three cheesy supermarket tabloids didnt prevent HillaryClinton from attending a dinner at Altmans home on the Upper East Side inApril Since then the National Enquirer has run apiece alleging that Hillary has committedadultery with Vince Foster and an unnamed longtime friend while serving asfirst lady Chatterbox who has no opinion about whether these rumors are truebut wouldnt blame Mrs Clinton if they were doesnt see how Hillary Clintoncan dine with Roger Altman ever again if she does Chatterbox will be forcedto conclude that she lacks even the small quantity of selfrespect required toserve in the US Senate            Chatterbox was clearly an idiot to think thatEvercores ownership of the Weekly World News coulddeny Altman a prominent role on Wall Street The peg to Kuczynskis article wasAltmans apparently major role in the CBSViacom deal on which Evercoreearned an estimated  million fee as the principal adviser to CBS and withwhich Altman sealed his growing reputation as a politically connected playeron the media merger scene Of Altmans new dominance in thesupermarkettabloid biz Goldman Sachs Robert Hormats told theTimes  rather charitably I do not think it iswidely known at all in this world            The most intriguing thing in Kuczynskis piece isAltmans own ambiguous stance about his stewardship of the supermarkettabloids                                             We think American Media is agood investment plain and simple We are not sitting there working on eachweeks copy We are not involved in the weekly or monthly or for that matterany editorial decision of any kind I think if you went around and asked anynumber of reasonably wellestablished buyout firms they approach it the sameway It is managements job to manage the company We are financial guys andwe do not manage the company                         On the most superficial level Altman appears to besignaling Please dont be mad at me Hillary and also perhaps PleaseBrooke Astor dont shut me out of the charityball circuit On a deeperlevel though its hard to tell whether Altman means to communicate Hey Imjust the pimp I dont turn the tricks or whether hes casting himselfabsurdly as some magnificently disinterested Sulzberger or Grahamesquefigure who refuses to compromise editorial integrity American Medias chiefexecutive David Pecker seems to hew to the latter interpretation because hetold the Times that Altman has done nothing tointerfere with the hardhitting stuff in the Enquirer and the Star about theClintons            Pecker might also have noted that the editorialintegrity of the Weekly World News remains largelyunmolested though Chatterbox did point out earlier a bizarre feint in thedirection of respectability in the Weekly WorldNews coverage of the imminent apocalypse Thisweeks issue includes headlines such as Your Family May Be Living Under aCurse  And Not Even Know It and Cement Mixer Rips Mans Penis Off andLast Living Neanderthal Family Found In Icelandic Cave            Altmans Evercore partner Austin Beutner told theTimes                                              American Media reaches anaudience of  million people each week We think the ability to deliverinteresting content to that large an audience and deliver that large anaudience to advertisers and providers of commercewhether throughdirectresponse marketing or Ecommerceis compelling And we think the scaleof that business can grow manyfold over the next several years                         Translation This is a dream advertising marketbecause practically by definition these readers willbelieve anything
