the source                        The lead story in todays New York Times quotes Bill Clintonsaying that the Republican budget passed yesterday by the House which heintends to veto totally bumfuzzled  American voters on the question ofwhether Social Security funds would be tapped for current spending Chatterboxdoesnt much care whether Social Security funds are tapped for currentspending but he knows the Republicans are making a big show of caring aboutthat and therefore are being somewhat dishonest in pretending that they wontBut what really interests Chatterbox is the presidents use of the wordbumfuzzled  which Chatterbox has never heard before            Here is precisely what Clinton said at an unrelated awards ceremony forblue ribbon schools at the Washington Hilton interestingly the transcription available on the White House Website spells it bumfusseled which is incorrect Chatterbox here uses thetext supplied by the Federal News Service which spelled bumfuzzledcorrectly                           They tried to say they werent spending the Social Securitysurpluschucklesand tried to blame us with wanting to which is a miraclehow they got that done Laughter

intimate actsometimes performed in the shower rooms of correctional facilities In factthough its a real word An Oct  Time article about Jim Morris ayearold rookie for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays quotes a

that the US Space and RocketCenter in Huntsville Ala might be for sale            Is bumfuzzled obscene Authoritative sources suggest it isnt TheAmerican Heritage dictionary says that bumfuzzle  apparently usedchiefly in the southern United States means to confuse and probably derivesfrom some combination of bamboozle fuddle and fuzzy The RandomHouse Unabridged dictionary says the term first came into use around and agrees with the American Heritage hypothesis about its derivationThe MerriamWebster Unabridged says bumfuzzle is an alterationof English dialect dumfoozle and dumfound             If there is an English link its possible the link is somewhat racy TimWeiner who wrote the Times piece wonders whether bumfuzzled hasat least some associative link to the British slang term bumf  ashortened version of bumfodder  or toilet paper Bumf isdefined in the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary as toilet paper worthlessliterature usually derog documents official papers Bumf would ofcourse be an especially insulting way for Clinton to refer to the HouseRepublicans budget and it does seem plausible that Clinton encountered theword when he was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford Weiner says he himself learnedthe term bumf from two friends who work at the Economist  Onreflection though this reading seems more entertaining than sound            Chatterbox was curious to see how bumfuzzled was used in thetraditional literature of the American South To that end Chatterbox searchedthe online collection at the University of North Carolinas Center for theStudy of the American South and found
