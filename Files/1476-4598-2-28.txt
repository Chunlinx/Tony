                    Background        The normal function of transforming growth factor           TGF           is essential for the entire        organism representing a multifunctional regulator of cell        growth and differentiation         TGF          is a potent inhibitor of epithelial        cell proliferation Upon binding of TGF           TGF          receptors phosphorylate SMAD or        SMAD           Phosphorylated SMAD        associates with SMAD and as a complex moves into the        nucleus where it regulates gene expression                     SMAD DPC is essential for this TGF          signaling and transcriptional        activation process     In epithelial cells TGF          decreases cmyc cdc and cyclin D        expression and it increases the expression of cjun and        cfos           Activation of the TGF          signal pathway in epithelial cells        leads to an increased expression of the cell cycle        inhibitors p WAFand p Inkband to a release of        formerly sequestered p KIP       It is assumed        that the cooperative action of these cell cycle inhibitors        results in the growth arrest mentioned above although p        Inkbdoes not seem to be necessary in this regard In        addition to mutations in the TGF          receptors in a large number of        carcinomas disruptions of this signaling pathway by the        alteration of a single protein such as p Inkb p and        p Wafare found                         This may result in resistance to the        growthinhibiting action of TGF                  In several cell lines particularly in pancreatic        carcinoma cells resistance to TGF          could be attributed to a loss of        function of the SMAD DPC protein               However the pancreatic carcinoma cell line BxPC        although homozygously deleted for SMAD is growth        inhibited by TGF               It is thus speculated that        alternative signaling pathways in addition to the SMAD        pathway may exist        After binding to          V           integrin latent TGF          is activated by processing of latent        TGF          by cleavage of the latencyassociated        Peptide LAP                        Recently the interaction of latent TGF          with          V           integrin has been shown     After        binding of latent TGF          to          V           integrin latent TGF          is activated by cleavage of the        latencyassociated peptide LAP     This          V           integrin is also expressed by        pancreatic carcinoma cells          We        hypothesized that there is a SMADindependent TGF          signaling pathway in TGF          sensitive carcinoma cells To address        this question several carcinoma cell lines with different        degrees of TGF          sensitivity were chosen as a model        system We investigated the interaction of TGF          with the          V           integrin and its influence on selected        target genes known to be involved in cell cycleregulated        growth inhibition Here we demonstrate an alternate TGF          signaling pathway via          V           integrin

In          contrast in the TGF            resistant AsPC and Capan cells          the interaction of mature TGF            with            V             integrin resulted in an

To explain the TGF            sensitivity of SMADdeleted cells          it is speculated that after binding of TGF            to its receptor activated SMAD          may translocate to the nucleus and activate gene          expression even in the absence of SMAD To exclude this          possibility cellular proteins were divided into          cytoplasmatic and nuclear fractions after TGF

completely abolished the effect of mature TGF            on the growth of Panc cells We          therefore postulate that the growth inhibition of TGF            is synergistically influenced by

interaction of latent        TGF          with          V           integrin which led to an activation        of latent TGF              Incubation of different tumor        cells with mature TGF          resulted in a direct binding of TGF          to          V           integrin Certain integrins appear to        be preferentially associated with specific growth factor        receptors     The interaction of these two receptor        classes seems to take place via the actin cytoskeleton We        were able to exclude such signal pathway association since        in our cytoskeletal preparations no TGF          receptors were detectable indicating        that mature TGF          is a ligand for          V                   It has been reported that activated integrins are        associated with the cytoskeleton Here we show that        binding of mature TGF          to          V           integrin resulted in an association of        the cytoskeleton Figure  In a variety of        integrinmediated signaling pathways        tyrosinephosphorylation of proteins immobilized to the        cytoskeleton is enhanced      The same was true in        our experimental settings only for the TGF          sensitive cells This upregulation of        tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by preincubation        with a TGF          neutralizing antibody or by blocking        of          V           integrin thus again proving mature        TGF          as an initial signaling ligand for          V                   Binding of mature TGF          to          V           integrin exerts several downstream        effects in TGF          sensitive cells Figure  One is a        marked phosphorylation of p FAK This phosphorylation is        dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton as        disruption of actin filaments by cytochalasin D completely        eliminated this effect findings which have also been        reported for several integrin signaling pathways             Moreover incubation of the TGF          sensitive carcinoma cells with TGF          caused immobilization of the docking        protein p casand of the guanine nucleotide exchange        factor SOS to the cytoskeleton Beyond this a marked        induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p WAFand p        KIPand a decrease in PCNA expression was detectable        Finally TGF          caused an activation of pRas and the        MAP kinases ERK and ERK This TGF          induced expression profile was not        affected by preincubation of SMAD deleted BxPC cells        with a TGF          RII blocking antibody which was able        to completely block TGF          induced SMAD phosphorylation thus        demonstrating the independence of the TGF          signaling from the known SMAD pathway        in BxPC cells In contrast preincubation with          V  and           blocking antibodies curbed the TGF          induced regulation of pWAF p        cfos and the pRas and ERK activation verifying that        the binding of TGF          to the          V           integrin is a prerequisite for the        activation of the signal pathway via the          V           integrin Preincubation of the cells        with the MEK inhibitor PD curbed the TGF          induced regulation of these genes as        well indicating the involvement of the MAP kinase pathway        in TGF          signaling in BxPC cells As shown        recently the growthstimulatory effect of the TGF        superfamily member BMPon CAPAN cells was blocked by        this inhibitor as well       supporting our        findings        Indeed cytoskeletal immobilization of pcas and SOS        was not prevented by the MEK inhibitor PD  Thus        these proteins are good candidates to link the        integrinmediated TGF          signaling to the MAP kinase pathway        as was shown previously for signaling events induced by        fluid stress or integrin mediated celladhesion in other        cell types                    In order to generalize the integrin mediated TGF          pathway identified in the SMAD        deleted pancreatic tumor cell line BxPC we investigated        TGF          signaling in the cervical carcinoma        cell line HeLa and the mammary carcinoma cell lines MCF        and MDAMB harboring a wildtype SMADgene TGF          bound to          V           integrin in these cells as well and        this interaction resulted both in an immobilization of        pCas and SOS and in tyrosine phosphorylation of        cytoskeletonassociated proteins such as pFAK TGF          stimulation of these cells acvtivated        pRas and MAPK ERK upregulated cfos cjunAP        pWAF and p expression and resulted a decrease of        PCNA similar to its actions in BxPC cells Preincubation        with a TGFRII blocking antibody attenuated the TGF          induced pattern contrary to SMAD         deleted BxPC cells This preincubation also decreased        activation of pRas and of MAPK ERK indicating the        participation of the RasMAPKpathway in TGF          induced transcriptional        activation        The same attenuation of TGF          induced gene expression and the        decrease in pRas and MAPK ERK activation was        observable after preincubation of SMAD wildtype cells with                 V           blocking antibodies demonstrating        that TGF          signaling via          V           integrin also is linked to the        RasMAPKpathway and that both pathways have synergistic        effects in TGF          signaling Full TGF          induced transcriptional activation is        only reached if both pathways are completed This finding        is supported by the observation that activation of pRas        and MAPK ERK induced by TGF          is only reverted to the control level        by the combination of the TGFRII blocking antibody and        the          V           blocking antibodies or by inhibition        of MEK        Linking of the TGFR pathway to the RasMAPK pathway is        dependent on a functional SMAD gene product because TGF          induced gene expression and activation        of Ras and ERK is attenuated by the TGFRII blocking        antibody only in SMAD wild type cells whereas in the        SMAD deleted BxPC cells no such influence was        observable        Based on our results we suggest the following model of        TGF          signaling which offers an        explanation for the different growth responses to TGF          Fig  In the TGF          sensitive cell lines with intact SMAD        pathway the TGF          response can be attributed to both the        common SMAD signaling pathway and the integrin pathway        described above In the cell line BxPC lacking the SMAD        gene product the SMADindependent pathway can explain the        TGF          sensitivity via          V           integrin the cytoskeleton and the        RasMAP kinase pathway resulting in an upregulation of the        cell cycle inhibitiors pWAF and p which in turn        results in the TGF          induced growth inhibition additional        file         The cell lines Capan and AsPC are not only resistant        to TGF          because of their alterations in the        SMAD pathway but also because they cannot complete the        alternate pathway as demonstrated above Furthermore this        alternate pathway may explain the TGF          resistance of cells with no detectable        defect in the SMAD pathway                     as one can imagine that the cooperative action of        the both pathways is necessary to exert the complete growth        inhibitory effect of TGF           Comparable effects have been        described for the synergistic operation of growth factor        receptor and anchorage dependent integrin signaling                                           Recombinant mature TGF          does not contain a RGD motif and thus        binding of TGF          to the          V           integrin and the subsequent activation        of this integrin must rely on a novel motif distinct from        RGD For          V           integrin a novel nonRGD ligand        recognition motif was recently described with the consensus        motif DLXXL            This motif has been detected on several proteins        including laminin collagen and fibrinogen     A        BLAST search for this sequence in TGF          revealed a  similar motif in two        parts of the molecule one in the LAP data not shown and        one in the mature TGF           In mature TGF           the DLXXL motif is freely accessible        for interactions on the outside of the molecule Therefore        it may be speculated that TGF          binding to          V           via this novel ligand recognition        motif is facilitating the signaling Moreover a nonRGD        ligand binding pocket in addition to the usual RGD binding        site has been demonstrated for fibrinogen and the          IIb           integrin     supporting our        findings                    Conclusions        We demonstrate an alternate TGF          signaling pathway via          V           integrin independent of SMAD This        pathway seems to be required for full TGF          induced transcriptional activation        which explains the TGF          sensitivity of those cells lacking        DPCSMAD function that still react with growth        inhibition                    Methods                  Cell Culture and TGF stimulation          All
