                            There has been a recent and dramatic rise in global funding for HIVAIDS from US        billion in  to US billion in   thanks to several new funding mechanisms        Box  These funds coupled with reduced drug costs make it feasible to roll out        antiretroviral therapy ART even in resourcepoor settings Nevertheless the total number        of people living with HIV rose in  to reach its highest level ever an estimated         million people are living with the virus including  million who acquired it in          Therefore the debate over the appropriate distribution of money between prevention        efforts such as voluntary counseling and testing VCT or behavior change and treatment        efforts the provision of ART is now more topical than ever                    Balancing Prevention and Treatment        The scale of the proposed increase in the number of patients receiving ART raises        numerous questions about the treatment itself Which drugs will be used How much will it        cost How will their quality be monitored and assured How will they be distributed Who        will be eligible How will the desired level of treatment be sustained Is there adequate        infrastructure and human resources to support the expanded services        The commitment of substantial funding to treatment in resourcepoor countries also has        implications for the prevention efforts in those same countries In many Western countries        and Brazil the sources of the majority of the available data on the subject the        impressive drop in mortality due to HIV following increased access to ART is coupled with a        disheartening rise in the number of new cases of HIV as emphasis and funding are shifted        from prevention to treatment  Countries in which this pattern has been seen are        evidence of the pitfalls of failing to adapt prevention efforts once lifeextending        treatment becomes widely available        Of course prevention and treatment are not mutually exclusive Successful prevention        efforts mean fewer patients will need the costly drug treatment programs helping extend        the sustainability of ART In turn the success of ART in prolonging healthy living helps        prevention efforts by reducing the stigma associated with selfeducation and responsible        behaviors                    Measuring Prevention and Treatment Effects        In their study in the January  issue of         PLoS Medicine  Integrating HIV Prevention and Treatment From Slogans        to Impact Salomon and colleagues use mathematical modeling to assess the epidemiologic        impact of treatment and prevention efforts and to quantify the opportunities and potential        risks of largescale treatment rollout Using a variety of different scenarios they        propose methods for establishing the most effective balance between spending on prevention        and spending on treatment        Modeling is a technique used by many scientists including epidemiologists and        statisticians to create a mathematical equation that can be used to determine which        variables affect an outcome of interest and to what extent Once the influential variables        are determined a baseline model is established that includes those variables and reflects        their relative importance to the outcome The effect of changing the value of any of these        variables or several of them can then be tested and new outcomes projected HIV modeling        is inexact and requires far better data but can nevertheless provide important        insights        Salomon and colleagues used mathematical modeling to assess the effect of changing        aspects of the HIVAIDS equation on the future course of the HIVAIDS epidemic First a        baseline model was created to fit expected HIVAIDS projections for the year  if there        were to be no change in the current epidemiologic trendsno ART scaleup and no changes in        prevention efforts or behavior Heterosexual contact is the predominant mode of HIV        transmission across Africa and Salomon and colleagues study modeled the disease only        within the heterosexual population The model was also tailored to take into account        epidemiologic demographic and sociologic patterns in the eastern centralwestern and        southern regions of Africa Using the baseline models tailored to each region the effects        of prevention and treatment efforts were then measured        Two treatmentcentered scenarios were tested in which the World Health Organizations         by  initiative see Box  was achieved In these treatmentcentered scenarios the        reduction of transmissibility the number of partners of each patient and condom use were        either optimal reduced transmissibility reduced partners and increased condom use or        less than optimal The preventioncentered scenario tested the impact of a comprehensive        package of  prevention tools such as VCT and peer counseling for sex workers modeling        only partial effectiveness at the population level to reflect weaker political and social        support for HIV control efforts Finally combined response scenarios were tested In the        first scenario treatment efforts strengthened prevention efforts as for example when the        availability of ART increases peoples willingness to undergo testing In the second an        emphasis on treatment led to less effective implementation of prevention efforts        Baseline projections in Salomon and colleagues study showed that without any behavioral        change or ART scaleup the HIVAIDS prevalence rate would remain relatively stable but        the number of new infections would increase by  million by  Treatmentcentered        scenarios reduced the total number of new infections through  by a maximum of         million or  while indicating that the number of AIDS deaths through  would decline        by  to  million A preventioncentered strategy would provide greater reductions in        incidence  and similar mortality reductions by  but more modest mortality        benefits over the next five to ten years        The scenarios in which all of these statistics were most improved however were those        that combined both prevention and treatment efforts In the scenario in which treatment        enhanced prevention Salomon and colleagues projected  million averted infections         and  million averted deaths  through the year  However if a narrow focus on        treatment scaleup leads to reduced effectiveness of prevention efforts the benefits of a        combined response would be considerably smaller million averted infections  and         million averted deaths  Figure         Combining treatment with effective prevention efforts could reduce the resource needs        for treatment dramatically in the long term In the various scenarios the numbers of people        being treated in  ranges from  million in a treatmentonly scenario with mixed        effects to  million in a combined response with positive treatmentprevention        synergies                    Moving Forward        The authors have demonstrated through mathematical modeling that the integration of        treatment and prevention is epidemiologically sound However an integrated and        comprehensive program Figure  is not only logical but makes sense from the service        delivery point of view it can be costeffective and ideal for the community                Effective prevention makes treatment more affordable and        sustainable Effective prevention can lead to a substantial reduction in the number of        new infections and therefore ultimately will lead to a reduction in the number of people        who will need treatment The reduction of adult HIVAIDS prevalence in Uganda from  to         over the last several years has reduced the number of those eventually needing treatment        by nearly   Unless the incidence of HIV is sharply reduced HIV treatment will not        be able to keep pace with all those who will need therapy  Salomon and colleagues        reaffirmation that only effective prevention will make treatment affordable is critically        important                Successful treatment and care can make prevention more acceptable and        effective Widespread access to treatment could bring millions of people into        healthcare settings providing new opportunities for healthcare workers to deliver and        reinforce HIV prevention messages and interventions  Improved access to HIV testing        provides an entry point to both prevention and treatment services and provides a unique        opportunity to identify and target the infected vulnerable and uninfected with more        appropriate interventions All healthcare settings including HIV treatment sites should        deliver HIV prevention services                 Prevention can make treatment more accessible The early establishment of        communitybased prevention services in rural Ghana was instrumental in reducing the stigma        of AIDS and improving the knowledge and attitude of the community prior to the development        of ART and VCT services K Torpey personal communication This process also made it        easier for community and implementing agencies to identify and refer patients needing        treatment services                Expanded care and prevention activities have synergistic        effects Continued effective treatment care and prevention programs will reduce the        number of orphans and vulnerable children reduce mother to child transmission of the        virus and improve the lives of families and the strength of communities                Integration ensures that prevention activities are not neglected The        world has a unique opportunity as ART services are launched and expanded to        simultaneously bolster prevention efforts  Experience in the United States indicates        that availability of treatment can lead to increased risk behavior  In addition the        improvement in the health wellbeing and longevity of people living with AIDS could        increase the opportunities for HIV transmission Integration can help reduce these        potential negative impacts of treatment                Integration can provide opportunities to address vulnerable groups more        effectively A commitment to providing largescale treatment helps to focus attention        on communities at greatest risk particularly in lower prevalence contexts This provides        an opportunity to address the prevention and treatment needs of vulnerable groups more        effectively                Treatment resources can help improve infrastructure for prevention and other        health services The training of health providers and improvements in laboratory        services pharmacy logistics commodity management and health information systems can        benefit both treatment and prevention services Further in many countries a large number        of healthcare workers are themselves infected Treatment can help to preserve the lives        and productivity of these critically needed AIDS prevention and treatment workers as well        as those of other health professionals                A longterm decline in AIDS deaths may be preventing new infections The        shortterm decline in AIDS deaths is driven by effective care and treatment programs but a        longterm decline may be driven by the prevention of new infections Integrated and        comprehensive strategies are more likely to lead to affordable sustainable programs                Success requires dramatic expansion of both ART and prevention Globally        fewer than one in five people at high risk of infection have access to proven HIV        prevention interventions  and less than  have access to ART  Unless there is a        substantial increase in commitment and resources for both prevention and ART efforts to        control HIVAIDS and mitigate its impact will only meet with partial and limited success        In addition to increase resources intensified commitment is required to ensure every        opportunity is taken to integrate prevention and treatment Future analysis and debate        should move from comparisons of prevention and treatment priorities to a sustained analysis        of how we can reciprocally integrate and strengthen prevention and care and use every        opportunity provided by one to reinforce the other We must focus on the development of        training monitoring and quality assurance systems that ensure that prevention and care        are integrated whenever possible                The results of Salomon and colleagues model need to be        validated Further operational research is needed to validate the findings of this        study
