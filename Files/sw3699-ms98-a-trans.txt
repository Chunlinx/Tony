            okay uh do you live in a home   yes we we its a house we bought uh about two and a half years ago now   uhhuh   oh did you uhhuh weve weve lived in ours for about six years we had it built actually and um   uhhuh the first house uhhuh   yeah it its our first home too   uhhuh so what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to   yeah huh   to renting somebody elses   um well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in and um that was quite an experience   huh     i i much prefer having my own home and and uh just the space and and more privacy   yeah umhum   yeah   do you have is it a fairly large house   um its uh oh its like twenty four fifty square feet its a two story yeah how about yours   oh thats a pretty good size yeah uhhuh its tiny  its not much bigger actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is so yeah its uh its only like eleven hundred square feet   is it small oh really oh uhhuh do you do you have children   just one yeah but it it uh all the rooms are small i i mean but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted yeah and uh use an extra one for an office   just one huh oh oh uhhuh yeah   which is handy id rather have have more rooms and less space in each one i guess rather have lots of rooms and lots lots of space but uh that ends up costing me   oh yeah yeah well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood     well theyre the its pretty typical i mean its its a very very middle class neighborhood uh lots of lots of young couples with you know usually oh im sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood thats their first homes and uh   oh uhhuh   lots of kids and and stuff and so it it fits well in the neighborhood its its certainly not a real upscale neighborhood but on the other hand its clean and kind of suburban   yeah   little bit more than i want   yeah uh   is is yours also pretty much in conformance with a neighborhood or is it   um yeah it it it it does it it seems about oh probably average um   uhhuh   that our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of um people and you know theres older people here and and um people that are about our age were in our thirties and um theres a lot of kids a lot of kids people the people across the street have eight   uhhuh uhhuh wow eight kids oh my gosh   yeah uhhuh yeah their home just burned down matter of fact and um last summer and theyre just rebuilding and um their house is going to be really big  theyre   ooh im sure with eight gosh   yeah theyre building it up bigger hes at um uh oh not an obstetrician an an orthopedic surgeon and um so since the house did burn theyre theyre going its quite different than it was before and its its a lot bigger   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   and um but ours is about its you know its a nice nice home its its definitely not one of the the smaller ones and um its not the biggest either but   yeah neighborhoods i mean theyll theyll theyll tend to to be real tight about that uh especially newer neighborhoods my my brother just built a new house uh um he he lives in Wichita Kansas and the um uh the neighborhood actually fought him on it because he he was um the house was gonna cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood   oh   now thats because he was hes doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff and his house actually ends up being nicer than lots of other in the neighborhood but but they were they were pretty touchy on it he was a little surprised   yeah yeah you you know thats interesting you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here and when we um put our house in um they wanted us to have there was one   uhhuh   we have part siding it on on the two story part and then on the back and they there was one side where our chimney was and just the chimney was gonna be brick and they wanted us to have more brick so we ended up having to go halfway up   umhum uhhuh uhhuh   which it does look nicer and you know we would have liked to have had all brick but of course at that point we couldnt afford it and but its funny that youd say that because there were homes in here that didnt have any brick at all so its kind of like they were   right kind of depends on when they get in you know   yeah yeah and i and so it was kind of like its they ours is the last street that they built on so the houses actually on our street are a little bit theyve kind of gone a little bit nicer   umhum oh they have its got yeah yeah oh   yeah i mean just they you know its like the second phase and and so theyve kind of changed the the codes a little bit and so thats kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didnt have any and   uhhuh hum well my see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in in South Austin and um   oh uhhuh   and  what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one and they they kind of give it a very upscale and and very tightly controlled um codes and and and stuff and then they come back in and and and then they sell
