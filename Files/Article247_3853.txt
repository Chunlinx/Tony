                                 Stop Putting Words in Greenspans Mouth                        Among the many factors that sent the stock markettumbling last week was Fed Chairman Alan Greenspans speech Thursday night to aconference sponsored by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Imassuming thats the United States Comptroller of the Currency though Im notreally sure what the comptroller of the currency as opposed to a comptrollerof a company does            Greenspans speech which dealt with the fundamentalsources of risk and the limitations of the traditional riskmanagement modelsfinancial institutions use did not spook an already nervous stock marketbecause anyone actually read or listened to the speech It spooked the marketbecause Greenspan mentioned the reality of market panics and because he linkedDutch tulip bulbs with Russian equities God only knows what would havehappened had he mentioned tulip bulbs and Internet stocks in the samephrase            Greenspan didnt make that connection but a lot ofoutside observers did leading to the inevitable conclusion that in histypically oblique way the Fed chairman was trying to talk down stock prices ingeneral and Internet stock priceswhich though not quite as gaudy as theywere back in April are still pretty heftyin particular            This is the wrong conclusion Although Greenspan didspeak to the idea that investors are starting to see stocks as not much morerisky than bonds an idea associated with the authors of Dow  see                   Slate               s Crapshoot for a critique of this idea the real focus of hisspeech was something much broader namely the way financial panics tend toeradicate the delicate distinctions between different classes of assetsdistinctions that any market system needs in order to invest for thefuture            The two most striking things about financial panics atleast in the modern economic world are that they happen more often than onewould expect in a normal bellcurveshaped distribution of events and thatwhen they happen they tend to spread rather than remain localized WhatGreenspan was arguing was that we have to take these considerations into effectwhen we think about managing risk in the future Specifically he said bankshave to set aside higher contingency resourcesreserves or capital andrecognize the limits of the models theyre using Panics cant be anticipatedafter all Thats what makes them panics            Now you might say that this speech should have spooked the stock market since the Fed chairman wassaying that sudden crises of investor confidence can descend without warningBut that is something we all knew already More to the point saying a crisiscan descend without warning is not the same as saying that it can descendwithout causes Talking about the current stock market as a bubble withouttaking into account the extraordinary performance of corporate AmericawhichGreenspan himself cited in his speechis to treat all episodes of investorconfidence as identical They arent            More important Greenspans real point was that thereare few safe havens once a financial crisis starts Last year for exampleduring global crisis investors flocked to the year Treasury bond but weretotally unwilling to buy the year bond even though the difference in riskbetween the two assets was presumably minimal In that sense saying thatstocks are riskier than bonds because the stock market could crash is wrong Ifcrashes determine risk then there are very few assets that you can really callsafe In that sense if Greenspan was trying to talk down the stock market hewas trying to talk down all markets Which I think tells us that he wasnttrying to do anything of the sort His message was a simpler one Be morecareful than you think you have to be
