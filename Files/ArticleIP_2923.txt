                                 Heavenly Rectangles             Negotiating the serpentinecorridors of the big Rothko show at the National Gallery is like going througha tunnel that keeps getting darker only to find that the light at the end is anoncoming train The show opens amid New York subway platforms a favoritesubject of Rothkos during the s Isolated figures descend the stairs inthis twilit realm hemmed in by a geometric cage of bars and pillars Entrance toSubway  In an interesting catalog essay the curator of the showJeffrey Weiss points out that subways had a special meaning forJewishAmerican artists like Rothko In Alfred Kazins memoir A Walker inthe City  the subway ride from Brownsville to Manhattan quantified thevast physical and social distance that existed between the Jews of Brooklyn andthe real New York For Rothko born Marcus Rothkowitz in Dvinsk Russia in the distance was even greater and once hed made it to the realManhattanhis Museum of Modern Art show of

presence criticshave discerned in some of his early paintings watched over Marcus and histhree siblings A precocious student Rothko went to Yale on scholarship anddropped out after two years moving to New York in  where except for abrief stint studying acting back in Portland he lived for the rest of hislife For the next  years Rothko was a struggling artist in every waygroping for an appropriate medium to convey his intense inner life He studiedat the Art Students League taught sporadically and exhibited with variousnetworks of artists including one group who called themselveswhen one oftheir number leftThe Ten Who Are Nine In  he married Edith Sachar whowas far more successful in her business of designing jewelry than he was inselling his paintings            The war years brought a radical shift in Rothkos style Hewent from painting realistic New York scenes to concocting mythological motifswith titles like Archaic Idol and Tentacles of Memory  In a waythe shift was less abrupt than it seemed for Rothko traded in one set ofunderground subjects the subway for another the depth psychology strata ofthe unconscious with dreamscape bricabrac lifted from Surrealist paintersJoan Mir and Yves Tanguy In paintings such as Hierarchical Birds  the messy profusion of feathers andtails and eyes is meant to convey the tangle of the psyche while the threelayers of color in the background might correspond to Freuds tripartitedivision of superego ego and id            ThenRothko made a decisive discovery one of the turning points in the history ofAmerican art He realized that the weird birds and body parts and eyes addednothing to his paintings The boldly simplified work of friends such as BarnettNewman and Clyfford Still the California abstractionist hed met on a tripwest in  may have encouraged him to banish imagery from his work Rothkomade the background of paintings such as Hierarchical Birds the richlypainted stacked rectangles of contrasting colorsthe foreground and he neverlooked back By  he had established the classic format he would explorefor the next  years He also had a new name having shortened MarcusRothkowitz to Mark Rothko in  a new wife and a new gallery His motherdied in  however and Rothko went into a prolonged depression an earlyepisode of the periodic despondency he would continue to suffer            During the s the paintings just kept

Clement Greenbergs influential claim that Rothko seemsto soak his paint into the canvas to get a dyers effect and avoid theconnotations of a discrete layer of paint on top of the surface Greenbergwanted to enlist Rothko in his own narrative of American painting movingirrevocably toward flatness and socalled colorfield painting            Some ofRothkos s work does look stained rather than painted but its not the mostpowerful work As painter Brice Marden notes in a lively interview in theexhibition catalog Rothkos brushwork is the most compelling thing about himHe was one of the last painterly painters maintains Marden adding thatRothkos great composition of purple white and red  Untitled   islike an impressionist work because of the kind of touch involved Thesepaintings have an almost calligraphic energy            By the late s Rothko was a very successful painter andhe hated it At least he distrusted the grounds of his success Ever since themythological paintings he had aimed somehow to go beyond painting to pluginto the inner recesses of the soul He refused to talk about techniqueangrily denied that he was a colorist and challenged his viewers to find thetragedy lurking in the canvases Nietzsches The Birth of Tragedy washis favorite book I have imprisoned the most utter violence in every inch oftheir surface he claimed But the more violence Rothko pumped into thepictures the more plush and collectible they turned out to be Greenbergwriting in  took pains to deny that Rothkos paintings wereluxuryobjects arguing rather mysteriously that they managed to
