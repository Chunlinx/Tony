                think the Cowboys are gonna go further or is this the end of the line   no i think the Cowboys have a good chance to really um possibly take it all the way theyre one of the theyre one of two teams that actually beat Washington Redskins ah however Washington has been uh what do you call it has been resting up and uh that could really hurt the Cowboys especially if they have a lot of injuries coming into uh  the next two games   well there was a uh article in the Wall Street Journal oh a couple weeks ago before the playoffs started and it said their long shot prediction was Cowboys versus Oilers in the Super Bowl         then they gave their reasons why they thought both of those teams had a       had a decent chance at it   well uh that would be an interesting game i think that game would be sold out what do you think   yeah i dont think thered be any problem there the only question is would the rest of the country be interested in watching two Texas teams slug it out   yes i think so because uh i think Warren Moon and uh Steve Beuerlein and Troy Aikman are some of the hottest quarterbacks for the uh for the nineteen nineties   yeah theyll probably want to see Emmett Smith and uh and uh see Novacek and see Irwin out there and and the no name defense so who knows   yeah the no name defense thats pretty good   well and then Houstons got a a good core of about good five good receivers out there that uh that Moon likes to likes to throw to   well did you see in the paper last Sunday about uh the salaries for the different um uh players   yeah i sure did   well what do you think about uh Montana being paid so much for not playing this year     well he he had himself a good contract       you know if hes got a contract that pays him regardless of injuries hes in good shape well you know that Michael Irvins going to get a big boost and already uh Jones has said that uh they anticipate that hell be giving Michael Irvin a big pay raise so i think thatll be coming   sure sure i think it will be too and i think Steve Beuerlein might get a little raise too hes uh um Troy Aikman i wonder even though hes a real good player i wonder if hes going to be able to uh stand the physical abuse that the NFL offers he might not make it   well his problem is that he since he doesnt seem as mobile as some of the other quarterbacks he seems to get one bad injury every year so Beuerlein or someone like Beuerlein is going to be a necessity while Aikmans around   yep so what do you think about uh the games thats going to be played uh tomorrow Buffalo and who they playing the uh   uh Buffalos playing um Kansas City   Kansas City Chiefs   well i i really think Buffalo will will win the game ill be surprised if Kansas City wins it but uh Houston Denver um that one might be more even than than people would otherwise think i dont think that ones gonna be uh blow out for anybody it might be a pretty close game   yeah i think John Elway still has a hot hand the trouble is is sometimes its cold and uh hes not consistent he he has a good day he has a bad day   and you and you never know   um i like that these other quarterbacks that that are are more consistent i think Beuerlein has been more consistent   well Beuerleins only had interceptions in one of the six games hes played and although he isnt throwing that many passes or completing that many you know if youre completing them to the right people at the right time youve got a running game you dont have to throw fifty times   right   you know you know were watching the Bowl games yesterday and theres some amazing Bowl games some of those guysll be pros theres one fellow plays for my wifes school East Carolina named uh Jeff Blake and hes gonna  almost surely be drafted by the pros he had an incredible day yesterday   right hm   he um threw for four touchdown passes and ran for one and he had an amazing day he rallied the team down from seventeen points in the middle of the fourth quarter to score three unanswered touchdowns in less than six minutes it was an amazing performance   i missed the name who was that again   it was Jeff Blake B L A K E hes the quarterback East Carolina hes pretty well rewritten the record books and i guess the pros will pay a good attention to him   i didnt i didnt watch that game uh i did watch the Notre Dame game   well they certainly came from behind to pull it off didnt they   yes i i think that um the coach there is uh really made a name for himself with Arkansas now with Notre Dame   well both those games were the only two exciting Bowl games yesterday i think the other six games were either blowouts or like the Cotton Bowl a disaster   yeah that was a low scoring game   but well it was it was a disaster a total disaster well i dont i dont know about Detroit they theyve got a lot of injuries they may have beaten the Cowboys thirty four to to ten
