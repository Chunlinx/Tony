                        COUNTERTERRORISM EVOLVES            In chapter  we described the growth of a new kind of terrorism and a new terrorist                organizationespecially from  to  when Usama Bin Ladin declared war and                organized the bombing of two US embassies In this chapter we trace the parallel                evolution of government efforts to counter terrorism by Islamic extremists against                the United States            We mention many personalities in this report As in any study of the US government                some of the most important characters are institutions We will introduce various                agencies and how they adapted to a new kind of terrorism            FROM THE OLD TERRORISM TO THE NEW THE FIRST WORLD TRADE CENTER                BOMBING            At  minutes after noon on February  a huge bomb went off beneath the two                towers of the World Trade Center This was not a suicide attack The terrorists                parked a truck bomb with a timing device on Level B of the underground garage                then departed The ensuing explosion opened a hole seven stories up Six people                died More than a thousand were injured An FBI agent at the scene described the                relatively low number of fatalities as a miracle                        President Bill Clinton ordered his National Security Council to coordinate the                response Government agencies swung into action to find the culprits The                Counterterrorist Center located at the CIA combed its files and queried sources                around the world The National Security Agency NSA the huge Defense Department                signals collection agency ramped up its communications intercept network and                searched its databases for clues                        The New York Field Office of the FBI took control of the local investigation and in                the end set a pattern for future management of terrorist incidents            Four features of this episode have significance for the story of  First the                bombing signaled a new terrorist challenge one whose rage and malice had no limit                Ramzi Yousef the Sunni extremist who planted the bomb said later that he had hoped                to kill  people                        Second the FBI and the Justice Department did excellent work investigating the                bombing Within days the FBI identified a truck remnant as part of a Ryder rental                van reported stolen in Jersey City the day before the bombing                        Mohammed Salameh who had rented the truck and reported it stolen kept calling the                rental office to get back his  deposit The FBI arrested him there on March                  In short order the Bureau had several plotters in custody including Nidal                Ayyad an engineer who had acquired chemicals for the bomb and Mahmoud Abouhalima                who had helped mix the chemicals                        The FBI identified another conspirator Ahmad Ajaj who had been arrested by                immigration authorities at John F Kennedy International Airport in September                 and charged with document fraud His traveling companion was Ramzi Yousef who had                also entered with fraudulent documents but claimed political asylum and was                admitted It quickly became clear that Yousef had been a central player in the                attack He had fled to Pakistan immediately after the bombing and would remain at                large for nearly two years                        The arrests of Salameh Abouhalima and Ayyad led the FBI to the Farouq mosque in                Brooklyn where a central figure was Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman an extremist Sunni                Muslim cleric who had moved to the United States from Egypt in  In speeches and                writings the sightless Rahman often called the Blind Sheikh preached the                message of Sayyid Qutbs Milestones characterizing the United States as the                oppressor of Muslims worldwide and asserting that it was their religious duty to                fight against Gods enemies An FBI informant learned of a plan to bomb major New                York landmarks including the Holland and Lincoln tunnels Disrupting this                landmarks plot the FBI in June  arrested Rahman and various                    confederates                        As a result of the investigations and arrests the US Attorney for the Southern                District of New York prosecuted and convicted multiple individuals including Ajaj                Salameh Ayyad Abouhalima the Blind Sheikh and Ramzi Yousef for crimes related                to the World Trade Center bombing and other plots An unfortunate consequence of                this superb investigative and prosecutorial effort was that it created an impression                that the law enforcement system was wellequipped to cope with terrorism Neither                President Clinton his principal advisers the Congress nor the news media felt                prompted until later to press the question of whether the procedures that put the                Blind Sheikh and Ramzi Yousef behind bars would really protect Americans against the                new virus of which these individuals were just the first symptoms                        Third the successful use of the legal system to address the first World Trade Center                bombing had the side effect of obscuring the need to examine the character and                extent of the new threat facing the United States The trials did not bring the Bin                Ladin network to the attention of the public and policymakers            The FBI assembled and the US Attorneys office put forward some evidence showing                that the men in the dock were not the only plotters Materials taken from Ajaj                indicated that the plot or plots were hatched at or near the Khaldan camp a                terrorist training camp on the AfghanistanPakistan border Ajaj had left Texas in                April  to go there to learn how to construct bombs He had met Ramzi Yousef in                Pakistan where they discussed bombing targets in the United States and assembled a                terrorist kit that included bombmaking manuals operations guidance videotapes                advocating terrorist action against the United States and false identification                    documents                        Yousef was captured in Pakistan following the discovery by police in the Philippines                in January  of the Manila air plot which envisioned placing bombs on board a                dozen transPacific airliners and setting them off simultaneously Khalid Sheikh                MohammedYousef s uncle then located in Qatarwas a fellow plotter of Yousef s in                the Manila air plot and had also wired him some money prior to the Trade Center                bombing The US Attorney obtained an indictment against KSM in January  but                an official in the government of Qatar probably warned him about it Khalid Sheikh                Mohammed evaded capture and stayed at large to play a central part in the                 attacks The law enforcement process is concerned with proving the guilt of                persons apprehended and charged Investigators and prosecutors could not present all                the evidence of possible involvement of individuals other than those charged                although they continued to pursue such investigations planning or hoping for later                prosecutions The process was meant by its nature to mark for the public the                events as finishedcase solved justice done It was not designed to ask if the                events might be harbingers of worse to come Nor did it allow for aggregating and                analyzing facts to see if they could provide clues to terrorist tactics more                generallymethods of entry and finance and mode of operation inside the United                States            Fourth although the bombing heightened awareness of a new terrorist danger                successful prosecutions contributed to widespread underestimation of the threat The                governments attorneys stressed the seriousness of the crimes and put forward                evidence of Yousef s technical ingenuity Yet the public image that persisted was                not of clever Yousef but of stupid Salameh going back again and again to reclaim his                 truck rental deposit            ADAPTATIONAND NONADAPTATIONIN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY            Legal processes were the primary method for responding to these early manifestations                of a new type of terrorism Our overview of US capabilities for dealing with it                thus begins with the nations vast complex of law enforcement agencies            The Justice Department and the FBI At the federal level much law enforcement                activity is concentrated in the Department of Justice For countering terrorism the                dominant agency under Justice is the Federal Bureau of Investigation The FBI does                not have a general grant of authority but instead works under specific statutory                authorizations Most of its work is done in local offices called field offices                There are  of them each covering a specified geographic area and each quite                separate from all others Prior to  the special agent in charge was in general                free to set his or her offices priorities and assign personnel accordingly                        The offices priorities were driven by two primary concerns First performance in                the Bureau was generally measured against statistics such as numbers of arrests                indictments prosecutions and convictions Counterterrorism and counterintelligence                work often involving lengthy intelligence investigations that might never have                positive or quantifiable results was not careerenhancing Most agents who reached                management ranks had little counterterrorism experience Second priorities were                driven at the local level by the field offices whose concerns centered on                traditional crimes such as whitecollar offenses and those pertaining to drugs and                gangs Individual field offices made choices to serve local priorities not national                    priorities                        The Bureau also operates under an office of origin system To avoid duplication and                possible conflicts the FBI designates a single office to be in charge of an entire                investigation Because the New York Field Office indicted Bin Ladin prior to the                East Africa bombings it became the office of origin for all Bin Ladin cases                including the East Africa bombings and later the attack on the USS Cole Most of the                FBIs institutional knowledge on Bin Ladin and al Qaeda resided there This office                worked closely with the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York to                identify arrest prosecute and convict many of the perpetrators of the attacks and                plots Field offices other than the specified office of origin were often reluctant                to spend much energy on matters over which they had no control and for which they                received no credit                        The FBIs domestic intelligence gathering dates from the s With World War II                looming President Franklin D Roosevelt ordered FBI Director J Edgar Hoover to                investigate foreign and foreigninspired subversionCommunist Nazi and Japanese                Hoover added investigation of possible espionage sabotage or subversion to the                duties of field offices After the war foreign intelligence duties were assigned to                the newly established Central Intelligence Agency Hoover jealously guarded the                FBIs domestic portfolio against all rivals Hoover felt he was accountable only to                the president and the FBIs domestic intelligence activities kept growing In the                s the FBI was receiving significant assistance within the United States from                the CIA and from Army Intelligence The legal basis for some of this assistance was                dubious            Decades of encouragement to perform as a domestic intelligence agency abruptly ended                in the s Two years after Hoovers death in  congresCOUNTERTERRORISM            sional and news media investigations of the Watergate scandals of the Nixon                administration expanded into general investigations of foreign and domestic                intelligence by the Church and Pike committees                        They disclosed domestic intelligence efforts which included a covert action program                that operated from  to  against domestic organizations and eventually                domestic dissidents The FBI had spied on a wide range of political figures                especially individuals whom Hoover wanted to discredit notably the Reverend Martin                Luther King Jr and had authorized unlawful wiretaps and surveillance The shock                registered in public opinion polls where the percentage of Americans declaring a                highly favorable view of the FBI dropped from  percent to  percent The FBIs                Domestic Intelligence Division was dissolved                        In  Attorney General Edward Levi adopted domestic security guidelines to                regulate intelligence collection in the United States and to deflect calls for even                stronger regulation In  Attorney General William French Smith revised the Levi                guidelines to encourage closer investigation of potential terrorism He also                loosened the rules governing authorization for investigations and their duration                Still his guidelines like Levis took account of the reality that suspicion of                terrorism like suspicion of subversion could lead to making individuals                targets for investigation more because of their beliefs than because of their acts                Smiths guidelines also took account of the reality that potential terrorists were                often members of extremist religious organizations and that investigation of                terrorism could cross the line separating state and church                        In  Congress authorized the FBI to investigate terrorist attacks against                Americans that occur outside the United States Three years later it added                authority for the FBI to make arrests abroad without consent from the host country                Meanwhile a task force headed by Vice President George HW Bush had endorsed a                concept already urged by Director of Central Intelligence William Caseya                Counterterrorist Center where the FBI the CIA and other organizations could work                together on international terrorism While it was distinctly a CIA entity the FBI                detailed officials to work at the Center and obtained leads that helped in the                capture of persons wanted for trial in the United States            The strengths that the FBI brought to counterterrorism were nowhere more brilliantly                on display than in the case of Pan American Flight  bound from London to New                York which blew up over Lockerbie Scotland in December  killing  people                Initial evidence pointed to the government of Syria and later Iran The                Counterterrorist Center reserved judgment on the perpetrators of the attack                Meanwhile FBI technicians working with UK security services gathered and                analyzed the widely scattered fragments of the airliner In  with the help of                the Counterterrorist Center they identified one small fragment as part of a timing                deviceto the technicians as distinctive as DNA It was a Libyan device Together                with other evidence the FBI put together a case pointing conclusively to the Libyan                government Eventually Libya acknowledged its responsibility                        Pan Am  became a cautionary tale against rushing to judgment in attributing                responsibility for a terrorist act It also showed again howgiven a case to                solvethe FBI remained capable of extraordinary investigative success            FBI Organization and Priorities In  President Clinton chose Louis Freeh as the                Director of the Bureau Freeh who would remain Director until June  believed                that the FBIs work should be done primarily by the field offices To emphasize this                view he cut headquarters staff and decentralized operations The special agents in                charge gained power influence and independence                        Freeh recognized terrorism as a major threat He increased the number of legal                attach offices abroad focusing in particular on the Middle East He also urged                agents not to wait for terrorist acts to occur before taking action In his first                budget request to Congress after the  World Trade Center bombing he stated that                merely solving this type of crime is not enough it is equally important that the                FBI thwart terrorism before such acts can be perpetrated Within headquarters he                created a Counterterrorism Division that would complement the Counterterrorist                Center at the CIA and arranged for exchanges of senior FBI and CIA counterterrorism                officials He pressed for more cooperation between legal attachs and CIA stations                    abroad                        Freehs efforts did not however translate into a significant shift of resources to                counterterrorism FBI Justice and Office of Management and Budget officials said                that FBI leadership seemed unwilling to shift resources to terrorism from other                areas such as violent crime and drug enforcement other FBI officials blamed                Congress and the OMB for a lack of political will and failure to understand the                FBIs counterterrorism resource needs In addition Freeh did not impose his views                on the field offices With a few notable exceptions the field offices did not apply                significant resources to terrorism and often reprogrammed funds for other                    priorities                        In  the FBI issued a fiveyear strategic plan led by its deputy director Robert                Bear Bryant For the first time the FBI designated national and economic                security including counterterrorism as its top priority Dale Watson who would                later become the head of the new Counterterrorism Division said that after the East                Africa bombingsthe light came on that cultural change had to occur within the                FBI The plan mandated a stronger intelligence collection effort It called for a                nationwide automated system to facilitate information collection analysis and                dissemination It envisioned the creation of a professional intelligence cadre of                experienced and trained agents and analysts If successfully implemented this would                have been a major step toward addressing terrorism systematically rather than as                individual unrelated cases But the plan did not succeed                        First the plan did not obtain the necessary human resources Despite                desCOUNTERTERRORISM            ignating national and economic security as its top priority in  the FBI did                not shift human resources accordingly Although the FBIs counterterrorism budget                tripled during the mids FBI counterterrorism spending remained fairly constant                between fiscal years  and  In  there were still twice as many agents                devoted to drug enforcement as to counterterrorism                        Second the new division intended to strengthen the FBIs strategic analysis                capability faltered It received insufficient resources and faced resistance from                senior managers in the FBIs operational divisions The new division was supposed to                identify trends in terrorist activity determine what the FBI did not know and                ultimately drive collection efforts However the FBI had little appreciation for                the role of analysis Analysts continued to be used primarily in a tactical                fashionproviding support for existing cases Compounding the problem was the FBIs                tradition of hiring analysts from within instead of recruiting individuals with the                relevant educational background and expertise                        Moreover analysts had difficulty getting access to the FBI and intelligence                community information they were expected to analyze The poor state of the FBIs                information systems meant that such access depended in large part on an analysts                personal relationships with individuals in the operational units or squads where the                information resided For all of these reasons prior to  relatively few                strategic analytic reports about counterterrorism had been completed Indeed the                FBI had never completed an assessment of the overall terrorist threat to the US                    homeland                        Third the FBI did not have an effective intelligence collection effort Collection                of intelligence from human sources was limited and agents were inadequately                trained Only three days of a week agents course were devoted to                counterintelligence and counterterrorism and most subsequent training was received                on the job The FBI did not have an adequate mechanism for validating source                reporting nor did it have a system for adequately tracking and sharing source                reporting either internally or externally The FBI did not dedicate sufficient                resources to the surveillance and translation needs of counterterrorism agents It                lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and other key languages                resulting in a significant backlog of untranslated intercepts                        Finally the FBIs information systems were woefully inadequate The FBI lacked the                ability to know what it knew there was no effective mechanism for capturing or                sharing its institutional knowledge FBI agents did create records of interviews and                other investigative efforts but there were no reports officers to condense the                information into meaningful intelligence that could be retrieved and                    disseminated                        In  the FBI created separate Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence divisions                Dale Watson the first head of the new Counterterrorism Division recognized the                urgent need to increase the FBIs counterterrorism capability His plan called                MAXCAP  was unveiled in  it set the goal of bringing the Bureau to its                maximum feasible capacity in counterterrorism by  Field executives told                Watson that they did not have the analysts linguists or technically trained                experts to carry out the strategy In a report provided to Director Robert Mueller                in September  one year after Watson presented his plan to field executives                almost every FBI field office was assessed to be operating below maximum capacity                The report stated that the goal to prevent terrorism requires a dramatic shift in                emphasis from a reactive capability to highly functioning intelligence capability                which provides not only leads and operational support but clear strategic analysis                and direction                        Legal Constraints on the FBI and the Wall The FBI had different tools for law                enforcement and intelligence                        For criminal matters it could apply for and use traditional criminal warrants For                intelligence matters involving international terrorism however the rules were                different For many years the attorney general could authorize surveillance of                foreign powers and agents of foreign powers without any court review but in                 Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance ActThis law regulated                intelligence collection directed at foreign powers and agents of foreign powers in                the United States In addition to requiring court review of proposed surveillance                and later physical searches the  act was interpreted by the courts to                require that a search be approved only if its primary purpose was to obtain                foreign intelligence information In other words the authorities of the FISA law                could not be used to circumvent traditional criminal warrant requirements The                Justice Department interpreted these rulings as saying that criminal prosecutors                could be briefed on FISA information but could not direct or control its                    collection                        Throughout the s and early s Justice prosecutors had informal arrangements                for obtaining information gathered in the FISA process the understanding being that                they would not improperly exploit that process for their criminal cases Whether the                FBI shared with prosecutors information pertinent to possible criminal                investigations was left solely to the judgment of the FBI                        But the prosecution of Aldrich Ames for espionage in  revived concerns about the                prosecutors role in intelligence investigations The Department of Justices Office                of Intelligence Policy and Review OIPR is responsible for reviewing and presenting                all FISA applications to the FISA Court It worried that because of the numerous                prior consultations between FBI agents and prosecutors the judge might rule that                the FISA warrants had been misused If that had happened Ames might have escaped                conviction Richard Scruggs the acting head of OIPR complained to Attorney General                Janet Reno about the lack of informationsharing controls On his own he began                imposing informationsharing procedures for FISA material The Office of Intelligence                Policy and Review became the gatekeeper for the flow of FISA information to criminal                    prosecutors                        In July  Attorney General Reno issued formal procedures aimed at managing                information sharing between Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI They were                developed in a working group led by the Justice Departments Executive Office of                National Security overseen by Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick                        These procedureswhile requiring the sharing of intelligence information with                prosecutorsregulated the manner in which such information could be shared from the                intelligence side of the house to the criminal side            These procedures were almost immediately misunderstood and misapplied As a result                there was far less information sharing and coordination between the FBI and the                Criminal Division in practice than was allowed under the departments procedures                Over time the procedures came to be referred to as the wall The term the wall                is misleading however because several factors led to a series of barriers to                information sharing that developed                        The Office of Intelligence Policy and Review became the sole gatekeeper for passing                information to the Criminal Division Though Attorney General Renos procedures did                not include such a provision the Office assumed the role anyway arguing that its                position reflected the concerns of Judge Royce Lamberth then chief judge of the                Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court The Office threatened that if it could not                regulate the flow of information to criminal prosecutors it would no longer present                the FBIs warrant requests to the FISA Court The information flow withered                        The  procedures dealt only with sharing between agents and criminal prosecutors                not between two kinds of FBI agents those working on intelligence matters and those                working on criminal matters But pressure from the Office of Intelligence Policy                Review FBI leadership and the FISA Court built barriers between agentseven agents                serving on the same squads FBI Deputy Director Bryant reinforced the Offices                caution by informing agents that too much information sharing could be a career                stopper Agents in the field began to believeincorrectlythat no FISA information                could be shared with agents working on criminal investigations                        This perception evolved into the still more exaggerated belief that the FBI could not                share any intelligence information with criminal investigators even if no FISA                procedures had been used Thus relevant information from the National Security                Agency and the CIA often failed to make its way to criminal investigators Separate                reviews in   and  concluded independently that information sharing was                not occurring and that the intent of the  procedures was ignored                    routinely                        We will describe some of the unfortunate consequences of these accumulated                institutional beliefs and practices in chapter             There were other legal limitations Both prosecutors and FBI agents argued that they                were barred by court rules from sharing grand jury information even though the                prohibition applied only to that small fraction that had been presented to a grand                jury and even that prohibition had exceptions But as interpreted by FBI field                offices this prohibition could conceivably apply to much of the information                unearthed in an investigation There were also restrictions arising from executive                order on the commingling of domestic information with foreign intelligence Finally                the NSA began putting caveats on its Bin Ladinrelated reports that required prior                approval before sharing their contents with criminal investigators and prosecutors                These developments further blocked the arteries of information sharing                        Other Law Enforcement Agencies The Justice Department is much more than the FBI It                also has a US Marshals Service almost  strong on  and especially expert                in tracking fugitives with much local police knowledge The departments Drug                Enforcement Administration had as of  more than  agents                        There were a number of occasions when DEA agents were able to introduce sources to                the FBI or CIA for counterterrorism use            The Immigration and Naturalization Service INS with its  Border Patrol                agents  inspectors and  immigration special agents had perhaps the                greatest potential to develop an expanded role in counterterrorism However the INS                was focused on the formidable challenges posed by illegal entry over the southwest                border criminal aliens and a growing backlog in the applications for naturalizing                immigrants The White House the Justice Department and above all the Congress                reinforced these concerns In addition when Doris Meissner became INS Commissioner                in  she found an agency seriously hampered by outdated technology and                insufficient human resources Border Patrol agents were still using manual                typewriters inspectors at ports of entry were using a paper watchlist the asylum                and other benefits systems did not effectively deter fraudulent applicants                        Commissioner Meissner responded in  to the World Trade Center bombing by                providing seed money to the State Departments Consular Affairs Bureau to automate                its terrorist watchlist used by consular officers and border inspectors The INS                assigned an individual in a new lookout unit to work with the State Department in                watchlisting suspected terrorists and with the intelligence community and the FBI in                determining how to deal with them when they appeared at ports of entry By                  suspected terrorists had been denied admission at US ports of entry because of the                    watchlist                        How to conduct deportation cases against aliens who were suspected terrorists caused                significant debate The INS had immigration law expertise and authority to bring the                cases but the FBI possessed the classified information sometimes needed as                evidence and informationsharing conflicts resulted New laws in  authorized                the use of classified evidence in removal hearings but the INS removed only a                handful of the aliens with links to terrorist activity none identified as                associated with al Qaeda using classified evidence                        Midlevel INS employees proposed comprehensive counterterrorism proCOUNTERTERRORISM            posals to management in   and  No action was taken on them In  a                National Security Unit was set up to handle alerts track potential terrorist cases                for possible immigration enforcement action and work with the rest of the Justice                Department It focused on the FBIs priorities of Hezbollah and Hamas and began to                examine how immigration laws could be brought to bear on terrorism For instance it                sought unsuccessfully to require that CIA security checks be completed before                naturalization applications were approved                        Policy questions such as whether resident alien status should be revoked upon the                persons conviction of a terrorist crime were not addressed Congress with the                support of the Clinton administration doubled the number of Border Patrol agents                required along the border with Mexico to one agent every quarter mile by  It                rejected efforts to bring additional resources to bear in the north The border with                Canada had one agent for every  miles Despite examples of terrorists entering                from Canada awareness of terrorist activity in Canada and its more lenient                immigration laws and an inspector generals report recommending that the Border                Patrol develop a northern border strategy the only positive step was that the                number of Border Patrol agents was not cut any further                        Inspectors at the ports of entry were not asked to focus on terrorists Inspectors                told us they were not even aware that when they checked the names of incoming                passengers against the automated watchlist they were checking in part for                terrorists In general border inspectors also did not have the information they                needed to make factbased determinations of admissibility The INS initiated but                failed to bring to completion two efforts that would have provided inspectors with                information relevant to counterterrorisma proposed system to track foreign student                visa compliance and a program to establish a way of tracking travelers entry to and                exit from the United States                        In  a new law enabled the INS to enter into agreements with state and local law                enforcement agencies through which the INS provided training and the local agencies                exercised immigration enforcement authority Terrorist watchlists were not available                to them Mayors in cities with large immigrant populations sometimes imposed limits                on city employee cooperation with federal immigration agents A large population                lives outside the legal framework Fraudulent documents could be easily obtained                Congress kept the number of INS agents static in the face of the overwhelming                    problem                        The chief vehicle for INS and for state and local participation in law enforcement                was the Joint Terrorism Task Force JTTF first tried out in New York City in                 in response to a spate of incidents involving domestic terrorist organizations This                task force was managed by the New York Field Office of the FBI and its existence                provided an opportunity to exchange information and as happened after the first                World Trade Center bombing to enlist local officers as well as other agency                representatives as partners in the FBI investigation The FBI expanded the number                of JTTFs throughout the s and by  there were  While useful the JTTFs                had limitations They set priorities in accordance with regional and field office                concerns and most were not fully staffed Many state and local entities believed                they had little to gain from having a fulltime representative on a JTTF                        Other federal law enforcement resources also not seriously enlisted for                counterterrorism were to be found in the Treasury Department Treasury housed the                Secret Service the Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and                Firearms Given the Secret Services mission to protect the president and other high                officials its agents did become involved with those of the FBI whenever terrorist                assassination plots were rumored The Customs Service deployed agents at all points                of entry into the United States Its agents worked alongside INS agents and the two                groups sometimes cooperated In the winter of  as will be detailed in                chapter  questioning by an especially alert Customs inspector led to the arrest of                an al Qaeda terrorist whose apparent mission was to bomb Los Angeles International                Airport            The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms was used on occasion by the FBI as a                resource The ATFs laboratories and analysis were critical to the investigation of                the February  bombing of the World Trade Center and the April  bombing of                the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City                        Before  with the exception of one portion of the FBI very little of the                sprawling US law enforcement community was engaged in countering terrorism                Moreover law enforcement could be effective only after specific individuals were                identified a plot had formed or an attack had already occurred Responsible                individuals had to be located apprehended and transported back to a US court for                prosecution As FBI agents emphasized to us the FBI and the Justice Department do                not have cruise missiles They declare war by indicting someone They took on the                lead role in addressing terrorism because they were asked to do so                            AND IN THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION            The Federal Aviation Administration FAA within the Department of Transportation had                been vested by Congress with the sometimes conflicting mandate of regulating the                safety and security of US civil aviation while also promoting the civil aviation                industry The FAA had a security mission to protect the users of commercial air                transportation against terrorism and other criminal acts In the years before                 the FAA perceived sabotage as a greater threat to aviation than hijacking First no                domestic hijacking had occurred in a decade Second the commercial aviation system                was perceived as more vulnerable to explosives than to weapons such as firearms                Finally explosives were perceived as deadlier than hijacking and therefore of                greater consequence In  a presidential commission on aviation safety and                security chaired by Vice President Al Gore reinforced the prevailing concern about                sabotage and explosives on aircraft The Gore Commission also flagged as a new                danger the possibility of attack by surfacetoair missiles Its  final report                did not discuss the possibility of suicide hijackings                        The FAA set and enforced aviation security rules which airlines and airports were                required to implement The rules were supposed to produce a layered system of                defense This meant that the failure of any one layer of security would not be                fatal because additional layers would provide backup security But each layer                relevant to hijackingsintelligence passenger prescreening checkpoint screening                and onboard securitywas seriously flawed prior to  Taken together they did                not stop any of the  hijackers from getting on board four different aircraft at                three different airports                        The FAAs policy was to use intelligence to identify both specific plots and general                threats to civil aviation security so that the agency could develop and deploy                appropriate countermeasures The FAAs person intelligence unit was supposed to                receive a broad range of intelligence data from the FBI CIA and other agencies so                that it could make assessments about the threat to aviation But the large volume of                data contained little pertaining to the presence and activities of terrorists in the                United States For example information on the FBIs effort in  to assess the                potential use of flight training by terrorists and the Phoenix electronic                communication of  warning of radical Middle Easterners attending flight school                were not passed to FAA headquarters Several top FAA intelligence officials called                the domestic threat picture a serious blind spot                        Moreover the FAAs intelligence unit did not receive much attention from the                agencys leadership Neither Administrator Jane Garvey nor her deputy routinely                reviewed daily intelligence and what they did see was screened for them She was                unaware of a great amount of hijacking threat information from her own intelligence                unit which in turn was not deeply involved in the agencys policymaking process                Historically decisive security action took place only after a disaster had occurred                or a specific plot had been discovered                        The next aviation security layer was passenger prescreening The FAA directed air                carriers not to fly individuals known to pose a direct threat to civil aviation                But as of  the FAAs nofly list contained the names of just  terrorist                suspects including  mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed even though government                watchlists contained the names of many thousands of known and suspected terrorists                This astonishing mismatch existed despite the Gore Commissions having called on the                FBI and CIA four years earlier to provide terrorist watchlists to improve                prescreening The longtime chief of the FAAs civil aviation security division                testified that he was not even aware of the State DepartmentsTIPOFF list of known                and suspected terrorists some  before  until he heard it mentioned                during the Commissions January   public hearing The FAA had access to some                TIPOFF data but apparently found it too difficult to use                        The second part of prescreening called on the air carriers to implement an                FAAapproved computerized algorithm known as CAPPS for Computer Assisted Passenger                Prescreening System designed to identify passengers whose profile suggested they                might pose more than a minimal risk to aircraft Although the algorithm included                hijacker profile data at that time only passengers checking bags were eligible to                be selected by CAPPS for additional scrutiny Selection entailed only having ones                checked baggage screened for explosives or held off the airplane until one had                boarded Primarily because of concern regarding potential discrimination and the                impact on passenger throughput selectees were no longer required to undergo                extraordinary screening of their carryon baggage as had been the case before the                system was computerized in  This policy change also reflected the perception                that nonsuicide sabotage was the primary threat to civil aviation            Checkpoint screening was considered the most important and obvious layer of security                Walkthrough metal detectors and Xray machines operated by trained screeners were                employed to stop prohibited items Numerous government reports indicated that                checkpoints performed poorly often failing to detect even obvious FAA test items                Many deadly and dangerous items did not set off metal detectors or were hard to                distinguish in an Xray machine from innocent everyday items                        While FAA rules did not expressly prohibit knives with blades under  inches long                the airlines checkpoint operations guide which was developed in cooperation with                the FAA explicitly permitted them The FAAs basis for this policy was  the                agency did not consider such items to be menacing  most local laws did not                prohibit individuals from carrying such knives and  such knives would have been                difficult to detect unless the sensitivity of metal detectors had been greatly                increased A proposal to ban knives altogether in  had been rejected because                small cutting implements were difficult to detect and the number of innocent                alarms would have increased significantly exacerbating congestion problems at                    checkpoints                        Several years prior to  an FAA requirement for screeners to conduct continuous                and random hand searches of carryon luggage at checkpoints had been replaced by                explosive trace detection or had simply become ignored by the air carriers                Therefore secondary screening of individuals and their carryon bags to identify                weapons other than bombs was nonexistent except for passengers who triggered the                metal detectors Even when small knives were detected by secondary screening they                were usually returned to the traveler Reportedly the  hijackers were                instructed to use items that would be undetectable by airport checkpoints                        In the pre security system the air carriers played a major role As the            Inspector General of the Department ofTransportation told us there were great                pressures from the air carriers to control security costs and to limit the impact                of security requirements on aviation operations so that the industry could                concentrate on its primary mission of moving passengers and aircraft    Those                counterpressures in turn manifested themselves as significant weaknesses in                security A longtime FAA security official described the air carriers approach to                security regulation as decry deny and delay and told us that while the air                carriers had seen the enlightened hand of selfinterest with respect to safety they                hadnt seen it in the security arena                        The final layer security on board commercial aircraft was not designed to counter                suicide hijackings The FAAapproved Common Strategy had been elaborated over                decades of experience with scores of hijackings beginning in the s It taught                flight crews that the best way to deal with hijackers was to accommodate their                demands get the plane to land safely and then let law enforcement or the military                handle the situation According to the FAA the record had shown that the longer a                hijacking persisted the more likely it was to end peacefully The strategy operated                on the fundamental assumption that hijackers issue negotiable demands most often                for asylum or the release of prisoners and that as one FAA official put                itsuicide wasnt in the game plan of hijackers FAA training material provided no                guidance for flight crews should violence occur                        This prevailing Common Strategy of cooperation and nonconfrontation meant that even a                hardened cockpit door would have made little difference in a hijacking As the                chairman of the Security Committee of the Air Line Pilots Association observed when                proposals were made in early  to install reinforced cockpit doors in commercial                aircraft Even if you make a vault out of the door if they have a noose around my                flight attendants neck Im going to open the door Prior to  FAA regulations                mandated that cockpit doors permit ready access into and out of the cockpit in the                event of an emergency Even so rules implemented in the s required air crews to                keep the cockpit door closed and locked in flight This requirement was not always                observed or vigorously enforced                        As for law enforcement there were only  armed and trained federal air marshals as                of  They were not deployed on US domestic flights except when in transit to                provide security on international departures This policy reflected the FAAs view                that domestic hijacking was in checka view held confidently as no terrorist had                hijacked a UScommercial aircraft anywhere in the world since                         In the absence of any recent aviation security incident and without specific and                credible evidence of a plot directed at civil aviation the FAAs leadership                focused elsewhere including on operational concerns and the everpresent issue of                safety FAA Administrator Garvey recalled that every day in  was like the day                before Thanksgiving Heeding calls for improved air service Congress concentrated                its efforts on a passenger bill of rights to improve capacity efficiency and                customer satisfaction in the aviation system There was no focus on terrorism                            AND IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY            The National Security Act of  created the position of Director of Central                Intelligence DCI Independent from the departments of Defense State Justice and                other policy departments the DCI heads the USintelligence community and provides                intelligence to federal entities            The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is                the CIA As an independent agency it collects analyzes and disseminates                intelligence from all sources The CIAs number one customer is the president of the                United States who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert                    operations                        Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agencys entire                budget these operations have at times been controversial and over time have                dominated the publics perception of the CIA The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but                is not technically a member of the presidents cabinet The directors power under                federal law over the loose confederated intelligence community is limited                        He or she states the communitys priorities and coordinates development of                intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress            This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority                over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these                budgets as the need arises Neither is true In fact the DCIs real authority has                been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president which has                waxed and waned over the years and to others in government especially the                secretary of defense            Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately                 percent of all US spending for intelligence including some that supports a                national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or                military service needs                        As they are housed in the Defense Department these agencies are keenly attentive to                the militarys strategic and tactical requirements            One of the intelligence agencies in Defense with a national customer base is the                National Security Agency which intercepts and analyzes foreign communications and                breaks codes The NSA also creates codes and ciphers to protect government                information Another is the recently renamed National GeospatialIntelligence Agency                NGA which provides and analyzes imagery and produces a wide array of products                including maps navigation tools and surveillance intelligence A third such agency                in Defense is the National Reconnaissance Office It develops procures launches                and maintains in orbit informationgathering satellites that serve other government                agencies The Defense Intelligence Agency supports the secretary of defense Joint                Chiefs of Staff and military field commanders It does some collection through                human sources as well as some technical intelligence collection The Army Navy Air                Force and Marine Corps have their own intelligence components that collect                information help them decide what weapons to acquire and serve the tactical                intelligence needs of their respective services            In addition to those from the Department of Defense other elements in the                intelligence community include the national security parts of the FBI the Bureau of                Intelligence and Research in the State Department the intelligence component of the                Treasury Department the Energy Departments Office of Intelligence and                Counterintelligence the former of which through leveraging the expertise of the                national laboratory system has special competence in nuclear weapons the Office of                Intelligence of the Coast Guard and today the Directorate of Intelligence                Analysis and Infrastructure Protection in the Department of Homeland Security            The National Security Agency The National Security Agencys intercepts of terrorist                communications often set off alarms elsewhere in the government Often too its                intercepts are conclusive elements in the analysts jigsaw puzzle NSA engineers                build technical systems to break ciphers and to make sense of todays complex                signals environment Its analysts listen to conversations between foreigners not                meant for them They also perform traffic analysisstudying technical                communications systems and codes as well as foreign organizational structures                including those of terrorist organizations            Cold War adversaries used very hierarchical familiar and predictable military                command and control methods With globalization and the telecommunications                revolution and with loosely affiliated but networked adversaries using commercial                devices and encryption the technical impediments to signals collection grew at a                geometric rate At the same time the end of the Cold War and the resultant cuts in                national security funding forced intelligence agencies to cut systems and seek                economies of scale Modern adversaries are skilled users of communications                technologies The NSAs challenges and its opportunities increased exponentially                in volume variety and velocity                        The law requires the NSA to not deliberately collect data on US citizens or on                persons in the United States without a warrant based on foreign intelligence                requirements Also the NSA was supposed to let the FBI know of any indication of                crime espionage or terrorist enterprise so that the FBI could obtain the                appropriate warrant Later in this story we will learn that while the NSA had the                technical capability to report on communications with suspected terrorist facilities                in the Middle East the NSA did not seek FISA Court warrants to collect                communications between individuals in the United States and foreign countries                because it believed that this was an FBI role It also did not want to be viewed as                targeting persons in the United States and possibly violating laws that governed                NSAs collection of foreign intelligence                        An almost obsessive protection of sources and methods by the NSA and its focus on                foreign intelligence and its avoidance of anything domestic would as will be seen                be important elements in the story of             Technology as an Intelligence Asset and Liability The application of newly developed                scientific technology to the mission of US war fighters and national security                decisionmakers is one of the great success stories of the twentieth century It did                not happen by accident Recent wars have been waged and won decisively by brave men                and women using advanced technology that was developed authorized and paid for by                conscientious and diligent executive and legislative branch leaders many years                earlier            The challenge of technology however is a daunting one It is expensive sometimes                fails and often can create problems as well as solve them Some of the advanced                technologies that gave us insight into the closedoff territories of the Soviet                Union during the Cold War are of limited use in identifying and tracking individual                terrorists            Terrorists in turn have benefited from this same rapid development of communication                technologies They simply could buy off the shelf and harvest the products of a                 trillion a year telecommunications industry They could acquire without great                expense communication devices that were varied global instantaneous complex and                encrypted            The emergence of the World Wide Web has given terrorists a much easier means of                acquiring information and exercising command and control over their operations The                operational leader of the  conspiracy Mohamed Atta went online from Hamburg                Germany to research US flight schools Targets of intelligence collection have                become more sophisticated These changes have made surveillance and threat warning                more difficult            Despite the problems that technology creates Americans love affair with it leads                them to also regard it as the solution But technology produces its best results                when an organization has the doctrine structure and incentives to exploit it For                example even the best information technology will not improve information sharing                so long as the intelligence agencies personnel and security systems reward                protecting information rather than disseminating it The CIA The CIA is a descendant                of the Office of Strategic Services OSS which President Roosevelt created early                in World War II after having first thought the FBI might take that role The father                of the OSS was William J Wild Bill Donovan a Wall Street lawyer He recruited                into the OSS others like himselfwell traveled well connected welltodo                professional men and women                        An innovation of Donovans whose legacy remains part of US intelligence today was                the establishment of a Research and Analysis Branch There large numbers of scholars                from USuniversities pored over accounts from spies communications intercepted by                the armed forces transcripts of radio broadcasts and publications of all types                and prepared reports on economic political and social conditions in foreign                theaters of operation            At the end of World War II to Donovans disappointment President Harry Truman                dissolved the Office of Strategic Services Four months later the President                directed that all Federal foreign intelligence activities be planned developed and                coordinated so as to assure the most effective accomplishment of the intelligence                mission related to the national security under a National Intelligence Authority                consisting of the secretaries of State War and the Navy and a personal                representative of the president This body was to be assisted by a Central                Intelligence Group made up of persons detailed from the departments of each of the                members and headed by a Director of Central Intelligence                        Subsequently President Truman agreed to the National Security Act of  which                among other things established the Central Intelligence Agency under the Director                of Central Intelligence Lobbying by the FBI combined with fears of creating a US                    Gestapo led to the FBIs being assigned                responsibility for internal security functions and counterespionage The CIA was                specifically accorded no police subpoena or law enforcement powers or internal                security functions This structure built in tensions                between the CIA and the Defense Departments intelligence agencies and between the                CIA and the FBI            Clandestine and Covert Action             With this history the CIA brought to the era of  many attributes of an elite                organization viewing itself as serving on the nations front lines to engage                Americas enemies Officers in its Clandestine Service under what became the                Directorate of Operations fanned out into stations abroad Each chief of station                was a very important person in the organization given the additional title of the                DCIs representative in that country He occasionally she was governed by an                operating directive that listed operational priorities issued by the relevant                regional division of the Directorate constrained by centrally determined                allocations of resources            Because the conduct of espionage was a highrisk activity decisions on the                clandestine targeting recruitment handling and termination of secret sources and                the dissemination of collected information required Washingtons approval and                action But in this decentralized system analogous in some ways to the culture of                the FBI field offices in the United States everyone in the Directorate of                Operations presumed that it was the job of headquarters to support the field rather                than manage field activities            In the s the CIA suffered exposure of its botched effort to land Cuban exiles at                the Bay of Pigs The Vietnam War brought on more criticism A prominent feature of                the Watergate era was investigations of the CIA by committees headed by Frank Church                in the Senate and Otis Pike in the House They published evidence that the CIA had                secretly planned to assassinate Fidel Castro and other foreign leaders The                President had not taken plain responsibility for these judgments CIA officials had                taken most of the blame saying they had done so in order to preserve the                Presidents plausible deniability                        After the Watergate era Congress established oversight committees to ensure that the                CIA did not undertake covert action contrary to basic American law Case officers in                the CIAs Clandestine Service interpreted legislation such as the HughesRyan                Amendment requiring that the president approve and report to Congress any covert                action as sending a message to them that covert action often leads to trouble and                can severely damage ones career Controversies surrounding Central American covert                action programs in the mids led to the indictment of several senior officers of                the Clandestine Service During the s tension sometimes arose as it did in the                effort against al Qaeda between policymakers who wanted the CIA to undertake more                aggressive covert action and wary CIA leaders who counseled prudence and making sure                that the legal basis and presidential authorization for their actions were                undeniably clear            The Clandestine Service felt the impact of the postCold War peace dividend with                cuts beginning in  As the number of officers declined and overseas facilities                were closed the DCI and his managers responded to developing crises in the Balkans                or in Africa by surging or taking officers from across the service to use on the                immediate problem In many cases the surge officers had little familiarity with the                new issues Inevitably some parts of the world and some collection targets were not                fully covered or not covered at all This strategy also placed great emphasis on                close relations with foreign liaison services whose help was needed to gain                information that the United States itself did not have the capacity to collect            The nadir for the Clandestine Service was in  when only  trainees became new                    officers                        In  the DCI was able to persuade the administration and the Congress to endorse                a longrange rebuilding program It takes five to seven years of training language                study and experience to bring a recruit up to full performance                        Analysis             The CIAs Directorate of Intelligence retained some of its original character of a                university gone to war Its men and women tended to judge one another by the                quantity and quality of their publications in this case classified publications                Apart from their own peers they looked for approval and guidance to policymakers                During the s and today particular value is attached to having a contribution                included in one of the classified daily newspapers the Senior Executive                Intelligence Briefor better still selected for inclusion in the Presidents Daily                    Brief                        The CIA had been created to wage the Cold War Its steady focus on one or two primary                adversaries decade after decade had at least one positive effect it created an                environment in which managers and analysts could safely invest time and resources in                basic research detailed and reflective Payoffs might not be immediate But when                they wrote their estimates even in brief papers they could draw on a deep base of                knowledge            When the Cold War ended those investments could not easily be reallocated to new                enemies The cultural effects ran even deeper In a more fluid international                environment with uncertain changing goals and interests intelligence managers no                longer felt they could afford such a patient strategic approach to longterm                accumulation of intellectual capital A university culture with its versions of                books and articles was giving way to the culture of the newsroom            During the s the rise of roundtheclock news shows and the Internet reinforced                pressure on analysts to pass along fresh reports to policymakers at an everfaster                pace trying to add context or supplement what their customers were receiving from                the media Weaknesses in allsource and strategic analysis were highlighted by a                panel chaired by Admiral David Jeremiah that critiqued the intelligence                communitys failure to foresee the nuclear weapons tests by India and Pakistan in                 as well as by a  panel chaired by Donald Rumsfeld that discussed the                communitys limited ability to assess the ballistic missile threat to the United                States Both reports called attention to the dispersal of effort on too many                priorities the declining attention to the craft of strategic analysis and security                rules that prevented adequate sharing of information Another Cold War craft had                been an elaborate set of methods for warning against surprise attack but that too                had faded in analyzing new dangers like terrorism                        Security Another set of experiences that would affect the capacity of the CIA to                cope with the new terrorism traced back to the early Cold War when the Agency                developed a concern bordering on paranoia about penetration by the Soviet KGB                James Jesus Angleton who headed counterintelligence in the CIA until the early                s became obsessed with the belief that the Agency harbored one or more Soviet                moles Although the pendulum swung back after Angletons forced retirement it did                not go very far Instances of actual Soviet penetration kept apprehensions                    high                        Then in the early s came the Aldrich Ames espionage case which intensely                embarrassed the CIA Though obviously unreliable Ames had been protected and                promoted by fellow officers while he paid his bills by selling to the Soviet Union                the names of US operatives and agents a number of whom died as a result            The concern about security vastly complicated information sharing Information was                compartmented in order to protect it against exposure to skilled and technologically                sophisticated adversaries There were therefore numerous restrictions on handling                information and a deep suspicion about sending information over newfangled                electronic systems like email to other agencies of the US government                        Security concerns also increased the difficulty of recruiting officers qualified for                counterterrorism Very few American colleges or universities offered programs in                Middle Eastern languages or Islamic studies The total number of undergraduate                degrees granted in Arabic in all US colleges and universities in  was                    six                        Many who had traveled much outside the United States could expect a very long wait                for initial clearance Anyone who was foreignborn or had numerous relatives abroad                was welladvised not even to apply With budgets for the CIA shrinking after the end                of the Cold War it was not surprising that with some notable exceptions new hires                in the Clandestine Service tended to have qualifications similar to those of serving                officers that is they were suited for traditional agent recruitment or for                exploiting liaison relationships with foreign services but were not equipped to seek                or use assets inside the terrorist network            Early Counterterrorism Efforts In the s and s terrorism had been tied to                regional conflicts mainly in the Middle East The majority of terrorist groups                either were sponsored by governments or like the Palestine Liberation Organization                were militants trying to create governments            In the mids on the basis of a report from a task force headed by Vice President                George Bush and after terrorist attacks at airports in Rome and Athens the DCI                created a Counterterrorist Center to unify activities across the Directorate of                Operations and the Directorate of Intelligence The Counterterrorist Center had                representation from the FBI and other agencies In the formal table of organization                it reported to the DCI but in fact most of the Centers chiefs belonged to the                Clandestine Service and usually looked for guidance to the head of the Directorate                of Operations                        The Center stimulated and coordinated collection of information by CIA stations                compiled the results and passed selected reports to appropriate stations the                Directorate of Intelligence analysts other parts of the intelligence community or                to policymakers The Center protected its bureaucratic turf The Director of Central                Intelligence had once had a national intelligence officer for terrorism to                coordinate analysis that office was abolished in the late s and its duties                absorbed in part by the Counterterrorist Center Though analysts assigned to the                Center produced a large number of papers the focus was support to operations A CIA                inspector generals report in  criticized the Centers capacity to provide                warning of terrorist attacks                        Subsequent chapters will raise the issue of whether despite tremendous talent                energy and dedication the intelligence community failed to do enough in coping                with the challenge from Bin Ladin and al Qaeda Confronted with such questions                managers in the intelligence community often responded that they had meager                resources with which to work                        Cuts in national security expenditures at the end of the Cold War led to budget cuts                in the national foreign intelligence program from fiscal years  to  and                essentially flat budgets from fiscal years  to  except for the socalled                Gingrich supplemental to the FY budget and two later smaller supplementals                These cuts compounded the difficulties of the intelligence agencies Policymakers                were asking them to move into the digitized future to fight against                computertocomputer communications and modern communication systems while                maintaining capability against older systems such as highfrequency radios and                ultrahigh and veryhighfrequency line of sight systems that work like oldstyle                television antennas Also demand for imagery increased dramatically following the                success of the  Gulf War Both these developments in turn placed a premium on                planning the next generation of satellite systems the cost of which put great                pressure on the rest of the intelligence budget As a result intelligence agencies                experienced staff reductions affecting both operators and analysts                        Yet at least for the CIA part of the burden in tackling terrorism arose from the                background we have described an organization capable of attracting extraordinarily                motivated people but institutionally averse to risk with its capacity for covert                action atrophied predisposed to restrict the distribution of information having                difficulty assimilating new types of personnel and accustomed to presenting                descriptive reportage of the latest intelligence The CIA to put it another way                needed significant change in order to get maximum effect in counterterrorism                President Clinton appointed George Tenet as DCI in  and by all accounts                terrorism was a priority for him But Tenets own assessment when questioned by the                Commission was that in  the CIAs clandestine service was still at least five                years away from being fully ready to play its counterterrorism role                        And while Tenet was clearly the leader of the CIA the intelligence communitys                confederated structure left open the question of who really was in charge of the                entire US intelligence effort     AND IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE                DEFENSE DEPARTMENT The State Department The Commission asked Deputy Secretary of                State Richard Armitage in  why the State Department had so long pursued what                seemed and ultimately proved to be a hopeless effort to persuade the Taliban                regime in Afghanistan to deport Bin Ladin Armitage replied We do what the State                Department does we dont go out and fly bombers we dont do things like that                   we do our part in these things                        Fifty years earlier the person in Armitages position would not have spoken of the                Department of State as having such a limited role Until the late s the                department dominated the processes of advising the president and Congress on US                relations with the rest of the world The National Security Council was created in                 largely as a result of lobbying from the Pentagon for a forum where the                military could object if they thought the State Department was setting national                objectives that the United States did not have the wherewithal to pursue            The State Department retained primacy until the s when the Kennedy and Johnson                administrations turned instead to Robert McNamaras Defense Department where a                ministate department was created to analyze foreign policy issues President                Richard Nixon then concentrated policy planning and policy coordination in a                powerful National Security Council staff overseen by Henry Kissinger            In later years individual secretaries of state were important figures but the                departments role continued to erode State came into the s overmatched by the                resources of other departments and with little support for its budget either in the                Congress or in the presidents Office of Management and Budget Like the FBI and the                CIAs Directorate of Operations the State Department had a tradition of emphasizing                service in the field over service in Washington Even ambassadors however often                found host governments not only making connections with the US government through                their own missions in Washington but working through the CIA station or a Defense                attach Increasingly the embassies themselves were overshadowed by powerful                regional commanders in chief reporting to the Pentagon                        Counterterrorism In the s and s the State Department managed                counterterrorism policy It was the official channel for communication with the                governments presumed to be behind the terrorists Moreover since terrorist                incidents of this period usually ended in negotiations an ambassador or other                embassy official was the logical person to represent US interests            Keeping US diplomatic efforts against terrorism coherent was a recurring challenge                In  at the direction of Congress the department elevated its coordinator for                combating terrorism to the rank equivalent to an assistant secretary of state As an                ambassador at large this official sought to increase the visibility of                counterterrorism matters within the department and to help integrate US policy                implementation among government agencies The prolonged crisis of  when                 Americans were held hostage at the US embassy in Tehran ended the State                Department leadership in counterterrorism President Carters assertive national                security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski took charge and the coordination function                remained thereafter in the White House President Reagans second secretary of                state George Shultz advocated active US efforts to combat terrorism often                recommending the use of military force Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger                opposed Shultz who made little headCOUNTERTERRORISM            way against Weinberger or even within his own department Though Shultz elevated the                status and visibility of counterterrorism coordination by appointing as coordinator                first L Paul Bremer and then Robert Oakley both senior career ambassadors of high                standing in the Foreign Service the department continued to be dominated by                regional bureaus for which terrorism was not a firstorder concern            Secretaries of state after Shultz took less personal interest in the problem Only                congressional opposition prevented President Clintons first secretary of state                Warren Christopher from merging terrorism into a new bureau that would have also                dealt with narcotics and crime The coordinator under Secretary Madeleine Albright                told the Commission that his job was seen as a minor one within the department                        Although the description of his status has been disputed and Secretary Albright                strongly supported the August  strikes against Bin Ladin the role played by the                Department of State in counterterrorism was often cautionary before  This was a                reflection of the reality that counterterrorism priorities nested within broader                foreign policy aims of the US government            State Department consular officers around the world it should not be forgotten were                constantly challenged by the problem of terrorism for they handled visas for travel                to the United States After it was discovered that Abdel Rahman the Blind Sheikh                had come and gone almost at will State initiated significant reforms to its                watchlist and visaprocessing policies In  Congress passed legislation                allowing State to retain visaprocessing fees for border security those fees were                then used by the department to fully automate the terrorist watchlist By the late                s State had created a worldwide realtime electronic database of visa law                enforcement and watchlist information the core of the post border screening                systems Still as will be seen later the system had many holes                        The Department of Defense The Department of Defense is the behemoth among federal                agencies With an annual budget larger than the gross domestic product of Russia it                is an empire The Defense Department is part civilian part military The civilian                secretary of defense has ultimate control under the president Among the uniformed                military the top official is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is                supported by a Joint Staff divided into standard military staff compartmentsJ                intelligence J operations and so on            Because of the necessary and demanding focus on the differing mission of each                service and their long and proud traditions the Army Navy Air Force and Marine                Corps have often fought ferociously over roles and missions in war fighting and over                budgets and posts of leadership Two developments diminished this competition            The first was the passage by Congress in  of the GoldwaterNichols Act which                among other things mandated that promotion to high rank required some period of                duty with a different service or with a joint ie multiservice command This had                strong and immediate effects loosening the loyalties of senior officers to their                separate services and causing them to think more broadly about the military                establishment as a whole                        However it also may have lessened the diversity of military advice and options                presented to the president The GoldwaterNichols example is seen by some as having                lessons applicable to lessening competition and increasing cooperation in other                parts of the federal bureaucracy particularly the law enforcement and intelligence                communities            The second related development was a significant transfer of planning and command                responsibilities from the service chiefs and their staffs to the joint and unified                commands outside of Washington especially those for Strategic Forces and for four                regions Europe the Pacific the Center and the South Posts in these commands                became prized assignments for ambitious officers and the voices of their five                commanders in chief became as influential as those of the service chiefs            Counterterrorism The Pentagon first became concerned about terrorism as a result of                hostage taking in the s In June  Palestinian terrorists seized an Air                France plane and landed it at Entebbe in Uganda holding  Israelis and other Jews                as hostages A special Israeli commando force stormed the plane killed all the                terrorists and rescued all but one of the hostages In October  a West German                special force dealt similarly with a Lufthansa plane sitting on a tarmac in                Mogadishu every terrorist was killed and every hostage brought back safely The                White House members of Congress and the news media asked the Pentagon whether the                United States was prepared for similar action The answer was no The Army                immediately set about creating the Delta Force one of whose missions was hostage                rescue            The first test for the new force did not go well It came in April  during the                Iranian hostage crisis when Navy helicopters with Marine pilots flew to a site                known as Desert One some  miles southeast of Tehran to rendezvous with Air                Force planes carrying Delta Force commandos and fresh fuel Mild sandstorms disabled                three of the helicopters and the commander ordered the mission aborted But                foulups on the ground resulted in the loss of eight aircraft five airmen and                three marines Remembered as Desert Onethis failure remained vivid for members of                the armed forces It also contributed to the later GoldwaterNichols reforms            In  came Hezbollahs massacre of the Marines in Beirut President Reagan quickly                withdrew US forces from Lebanona reversal later routinely cited by jihadists as                evidence of US weakness A detailed investigation produced a list of new                procedures that would become customary for forces deployed abroad They involved a                number of defensive measures including caution not only about strange cars and                trucks but also about unknown aircraft overhead Force protection became a                significant claim on the time and resources of the Department of Defense            A decade later the military establishment had another experience that evoked both                Desert One and the withdrawal from Beirut The first President Bush had authorized                the use of US military forces to ensure humanitarian relief in wartorn Somalia                Tribal factions interfered with the supply missions By the autumn of  US                commanders concluded that the main source of trouble was a warlord Mohammed Farrah                Aidid An Army special force launched a raid on Mogadishu to capture him In the                course of a long night two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down  Americans were                wounded  were killed and the worlds television screens showed images of an                American corpse dragged through the streets by exultant Somalis Under pressure from                Congress President Clinton soon ordered the withdrawal of US forces Black Hawk                down joined Desert One as a symbol among Americans in uniform code phrases used                to evoke the risks of daring exploits without maximum preparation overwhelming                force and a welldefined mission            In  the Defense Department began to invest effort in planning how to handle                the possibility of a domestic terrorist incident involving weapons of mass                destruction WMD The idea of a domestic command for homeland defense began to be                discussed in  and in  the Joint Chiefs developed a concept for the                establishment of a domestic Unified Command Congress killed the idea Instead the                Department established the Joint Forces Command located at Norfolk Virginia                making it responsible for military response to domestic emergencies both natural                and manmade                        Pursuant to the NunnLugarDomenici Domestic Preparedness Program the Defense                Department began in  to train first responders in  of the nations largest                cities As a key part of its efforts Defense created National Guard WMD Civil                Support Teams to respond in the event of a WMD terrorist incident A total of                 such National Guard teams were authorized by fiscal year  Under the command of                state governors they provided support to civilian agencies to assess the nature of                the attack offer medical and technical advice and coordinate state and local                    responses                        The Department of Defense like the Department of State had a coordinator who                represented the department on the interagency committee concerned with                counterterrorism By the end of President Clintons first term this official had                become the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and lowintensity                    conflict                        The experience of the s had suggested to the military establishment that if it                were to have a role in counterterrorism it would be a traditional military roleto                act against state sponsors of terrorism And the military had what seemed an                excellent example of how to do it In  a bomb went off at a disco in Berlin                killing two American soldiers Intelligence clearly linked the bombing to Libyas                Colonel Muammar Qadhafi President Reagan ordered air strikes against Libya The                operation was not cost free the United States lost two planes Evidence accumulated                later including the  bombing of Pan Am  clearly showed that the operation                did not curb Qadhafis interest in terrorism However it was seen at the time as a                success The lesson then taken from Libya was that terrorism could be stopped by the                use of US air power that inflicted pain on the authors or sponsors of terrorist                acts            This lesson was applied using Tomahawk missiles early in the Clinton                administration George HW Bush was scheduled to visit Kuwait to be honored for his                rescue of that country in the Gulf War of  Kuwaiti security services warned                Washington that Iraqi agents were planning to assassinate the former president                President Clinton not only ordered precautions to protect Bush but asked about                options for a reprisal against Iraq The Pentagon proposed  targets for Tomahawk                missiles Debate in the White House and at the CIA about possible collateral damage                pared the list down to three then to one Iraqi intelligence headquarters in                central Baghdad The attack was made at night to minimize civilian casualties                Twentythree missiles were fired Other than one civilian casualty the operation                seemed completely successful the intelligence headquarters was demolished No                further intelligence came in about terrorist acts planned by Iraq                        The  attack in Libya and the  attack on Iraq symbolized for the military                establishment effective use of military power for counterterrorism limited                retaliation with air power aimed at deterrence What remained was the hard question                of how deterrence could be effective when the adversary was a loose transnational                network                AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE            Because coping with terrorism was not and is not the sole province of any component                of the US government some coordinating mechanism is necessary When terrorism was                not a prominent issue the State Department could perform this role When the                Iranian hostage crisis developed this procedure went by the board National                Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski took charge of crisis management            The Reagan administration continued and formalized the practice of having                presidential staff coordinate counterterrorism After the killing of the marines in                Beirut President Reagan signed National Security Directive  calling for a                shift    from passive to active defense measures and reprogramming or adding                new resources to effect the shift It directed the State Department to intensify                efforts to achieve cooperation of other governments and the CIA to intensify use                of liaison and other intelligence capabilities and also to develop plans and                capability to preempt groups and individuals planning strikes against US                    interests                        Speaking to the American Bar Association in July  the President characterized                terrorism as an act of war and declaredThere can be no place on earth left where                it is safe for these monsters to rest to train or practice their cruel and deadly                skills We must act together or unilaterally if necessary to ensure that                terrorists have no sanctuaryanywhere The air strikes                against Libya were one manifestation of this strategy            Through most of President Reagans second term the coordination of counterterrorism                was overseen by a highlevel interagency committee chaired by the deputy national                security adviser But the Reagan administration closed with a major scandal that                cast a cloud over the notion that the White House should guide counterterrorism            President Reagan was concerned because Hezbollah was taking Americans hostage and                periodically killing them He was also constrained by a bill he signed into law that                made it illegal to ship military aid to anticommunist Contra guerrillas in                Nicaragua whom he strongly supported His national security adviser Robert                McFarlane and McFarlanes deputy Admiral John Poindexter thought the hostage                problem might be solved and the US position in the Middle East improved if the                United States quietly negotiated with Iran about exchanging hostages for modest                quantities of arms Shultz and Weinberger united for once opposed McFarlane and                Poindexter            A staffer for McFarlane and Poindexter Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North                developed a scheme to trade US arms for hostages and divert the proceeds to the                Contras to get around US law He may have had encouragement from Director of                Central Intelligence William Casey                        When the facts were revealed in  and  it appeared to be the s all over                again a massive abuse of covert action Now instead of stories about poisoned                cigars and Mafia hit men Americans heard testimony about a secret visit to Tehran                by McFarlane using an assumed name and bearing a chocolate cake decorated with                icing depicting a key An investigation by a special counsel resulted in the                indictment of McFarlane Poindexter North and ten others including several                highranking officers from the CIAs Clandestine Service The investigations                spotlighted the importance of accountability and official responsibility for                faithful execution of laws For the story of  the significance of the                IranContra affair was that it made parts of the bureaucracy reflexively skeptical                about any operating directive from the White House                        As the national security advisors function expanded the procedures and structure of                the advisors staff conventionally called the National Security Council staff                became more formal The advisor developed recommendations for presidential                directives differently labeled by each president For President Clinton they were                to be Presidential Decision Directives for President George W Bush National                Security Policy Directives These documents and many others requiring approval by                the president worked their way through interagency committees usually composed of                departmental representatives at the assistant secretary level or just below it The                NSC staff had senior directors who would sit on these interagency committees often                as chair to facilitate agreement and to represent the wider interests of the                national security advisor When President Clinton took office he decided right away                to coordinate counterterrorism from the White House On January   Mir Amal                Kansi an Islamic extremist from Pakistan shot and killed two CIA employees at the                main highway entrance to CIA headquarters in Virginia Kansi drove away and was                captured abroad much later Only a month afterward came the World Trade Center                bombing and a few weeks after that the Iraqi plot against former President Bush            President Clintons first national security advisor Anthony Lake had retained from                the Bush administration the staffer who dealt with crime narcotics and terrorism                a portfolio often known as drugs and thugs the veteran civil servant Richard                Clarke President Clinton and Lake turned to Clarke to do the staff work for them in                coordinating counterterrorism Before long he would chair a midlevel interagency                committee eventually titled the Counterterrorism Security Group CSG We will later                tell of Clarkes evolution as adviser on and in time manager of the US                counterterrorist effort When explaining the missile strike against Iraq provoked by                the plot to kill President Bush President Clinton statedFrom the first days of                our Revolution Americas security has depended on the clarity of the message Dont                tread on us A firm and commensurate response was essential to protect our                sovereignty to send a message to those who engage in statesponsored terrorism to                deter further violence against our people and to affirm the expectation of                civilized behavior among nations                        In his State of the Union message in January  President Clinton promised                comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists whether                they strike at home or abroad In February he sent Congress proposals to extend                federal criminal jurisdiction to make it easier to deport terrorists and to act                against terrorist fundraising In early May he submitted a bundle of strong                amendments The interval had seen the news from Tokyo in March that a doomsday cult                Aum Shinrikyo had released sarin nerve gas in a subway killing  and injuring                thousands The sect had extensive properties and laboratories in Japan and offices                worldwide including one in New York Neither the FBI nor the CIA had ever heard of                it In April had come the bombing of the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City                immediate suspicions that it had been the work of Islamists turned out to be wrong                and the bombers proved to be American antigovernment extremists named Timothy Mc                Veigh and Terry Nichols President Clinton proposed to amend his earlier proposals                by increasing wiretap and electronic surveillance authority for the FBI requiring                that explosives carry traceable taggants and providing substantial new money not                only for the FBI and CIA but also for local police                        President Clinton issued a classified directive in June  Presidential Decision                Directive  which said that the United States should deter defeat and respond                vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our territory and against our citizens The                directive called terrorism both a matter of national security and a crime and it                assigned responsibilities to various agencies Alarmed by the incident in Tokyo                President Clinton made it the very highest priority for his own staff and for all                agencies to prepare to detect and respond to terrorism that involved chemical                biological or nuclear weapons                        During  and  President Clinton devoted considerable time to seeking                cooperation from other nations in denying sanctuary to terrorists He proposed                significantly larger budgets for the FBI with much of the increase designated for                counterterrorism For the CIA he essentially stopped cutting allocations and                supported requests for supplemental funds for counterterrorism                        When announcing his new national security team after being reelected in                 President Clinton mentioned terrorism first in a list of several challenges facing                the country                        In  after Bin Ladins fatwa and other alarms President Clinton accepted a                proposal from his national security advisor Samuel Sandy Berger and gave Clarke                a new position as national coordinator for security infrastructure protection and                counterterrorism He issued two Presidential Decision Directives numbers  and                 that built on the assignments to agencies that had been made in Presidential                Decision Directive  laid out ten program areas for counterterrorism and                enhanced at least on paper Clarkes authority to police these assignments Because                of concerns especially on the part of Attorney General Reno this new authority was                defined in precise and limiting language Clarke was only to provide advice                regarding budgets and to coordinate the development of interagency agreed                guidelines for action                        Clarke also was awarded a seat on the cabinetlevel Principals Committee when it met                on his issuesa highly unusual step for a White House staffer His interagency body                the CSG ordinarily reported to the Deputies Committee of subcabinet officials                unless Berger asked them to report directly to the principals The complementary                directive number  defined the elements of the nations critical infrastructure                and considered ways to protect it Taken together the two directives basically left                the Justice Department and the FBI in charge at home and left terrorism abroad to                the CIA the State Department and other agencies under Clarkes and Bergers                coordinating hands Explaining the new arrangement and his concerns in another                commencement speech this time at the Naval Academy in May  the President                said First we will use our new integrated approach to intensify the fight against                all forms of terrorism to capture terrorists no matter where they hide to work                with other nations to eliminate terrorist sanctuaries overseas to respond rapidly                and effectively to protect Americans from terrorism at home and abroad Second we                will launch a comprehensive plan to detect deter and defend against attacks on our                critical infrastructures our power systems water supplies police fire and                medical services air traffic control financial services telephone systems and                computer networks    Third we will undertake a concerted effort to prevent the                spread and use of biological weapons and to protect our people in the event these                terrible weapons are ever unleashed by a rogue state a terrorist group or an                international criminal organization    Finally we must do more to protect our                civilian population from biological weapons                        Clearly the Presidents concern about terrorism had steadily risen That heightened                worry would become even more obvious early in  when he addressed the National                Academy of Sciences and presented his most somber account yet of what could happen                if the United States were hit unprepared by terrorists wielding either weapons of                mass destruction or potent cyberweapons                AND IN THE CONGRESS            Since the beginning of the Republic few debates have been as hotly contested as the                one over executive versus legislative powers At the Constitutional Convention the                founders sought to create a strong executive but check its powers They left those                powers sufficiently ambiguous so that room was left for Congress and the president                to struggle over the direction of the nations security and foreign policies            The most serious question has centered on whether or not the president needs                congressional authorization to wage war The current status of that debate seems to                have settled into a recognition that a president can deploy military forces for                small and limited operations but needs at least congressional support if not                explicit authorization for large and more openended military operations            This calculus becomes important in this story as both President Clinton and President                Bush chose not to seek a declaration of war on Bin Ladin after he had declared and                begun to wage war on us a declaration that they did not acknowledge publicly Not                until after  was a congressional authorization sought            The most substantial change in national security oversight in Congress took place                following World War II The Congressional Reorganization Act of  created the                modern Armed Services committees that have become so powerful today One especially                noteworthy innovation was the creation of the Joint HouseSenate Atomic Energy                Committee which is credited by many with the development of our nuclear deterrent                capability and was also criticized for wielding too much power relative to the                executive branch            Ironically this committee was eliminated in the s as Congress was undertaking                the next most important reform of oversight in response to the Church and Pike                investigations into abuses of power In  the House and Senate created select                committees to exercise oversight of the executive branchs conduct of intelligence                operations            The Intelligence Committees The House and Senate select committees on intelligence                share some important characteristics They have limited authorities They do not                have exclusive authority over intelligence agencies Appropriations are ultimately                determined by the Appropriations committees The Armed Services committees exercise                jurisdiction over the intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense and                in the case of the Senate over the Central Intelligence Agency One consequence is                that the rise and fall of intelligence budgets are tied directly to trends in                defense spending            The president is required by law to ensure the congressional Intelligence committees                are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United                States The committees allow the CIA to some extent to withhold information in order                to protect sources methods and operations The CIA must bring presidentially                authorized covert action Findings and Memoranda of Notification to the Intelligence                committees and it must detail its failures The committees conduct their most                important work in closed hearings or briefings in which security over classified                material can be maintained Members of the Intelligence committees serve for a                limited time a restriction imposed by each chamber Many members believe these                limits prevent committee members from developing the necessary expertise to conduct                effective oversight            Secrecy while necessary can also harm oversight The overall budget of the                intelligence community is classified as are most of its activities Thus the                Intelligence committees cannot take advantage of democracys best oversight                mechanism public disclosure This makes them significantly different from other                congressional oversight committees which are often spurred into action by the work                of investigative journalists and watchdog organizations Adjusting to the PostCold                War Era The unexpected and rapid end of the Cold War in  created trauma in the                foreign policy and national security community both in and out of government While                some criticized the intelligence community for failing to forecast the collapse of                the Soviet Union and used this argument to propose drastic cuts in intelligence                agencies most recognized that the good news of being relieved of the substantial                burden of maintaining a security structure to meet the Soviet challenge was                accompanied by the bad news of increased insecurity In many directions the                community faced threats and intelligence challenges that it was largely unprepared                to meet            So did the intelligence oversight committees New digitized technologies and the                demand for imagery and continued capability against older systems meant the need to                spend more on satellite systems at the expense of human efforts In addition denial                and deception became more effective as targets learned from public sources what our                intelligence agencies were doing There were comprehensive reform proposals of the                intelligence community such as those offered by Senators Boren and McCurdy That                said Congress still took too little action to address institutional                    weaknesses                        With the Cold War over and the intelligence community roiled by the Ames spy                scandal a presidential commission chaired first by former secretary of defense Les                Aspin and later by former secretary of defense Harold Brown examined the                intelligence communitys future After it issued recommendations addressing the                DCIs lack of personnel and budget authority over the intelligence community the                Intelligence committees in  introduced implementing legislation to remedy these                problems            The Department of Defense and its congressional authorizing committees rose in                opposition to the proposed changes The President and DCI did not actively support                these changes Relatively small changes made in  gave the DCI consultative                authority and created a new deputy for management and assistant DCIs for collection                and analysis These reforms occurred only after the Senate Select Committee on                Intelligence took the unprecedented step of threatening to bring down the defense                authorization bill Indeed rather than increasing the DCIs authorities over                national intelligence the s witnessed movement in the opposite direction                through for example the transfer of the CIAs imaging analysis capability to the                new imagery and mapping agency created within the Department of Defense            Congress Adjusts Congress as a whole like the executive branch adjusted slowly to                the rise of transnational terrorism as a threat to national security In particular                the growing threat and capabilities of Bin Ladin were not understood in Congress As                the most representative branch of the federal government Congress closely tracks                trends in what public opinion and the electorate identify as key issues In the                years before September  terrorism seldom registered as important To the extent                that terrorism did break through and engage the attention of the Congress as a                whole it would briefly command attention after a specific incident and then return                to a lower rung on the public policy agenda            Several points about Congress are worth noting First Congress always has a strong                orientation toward domestic affairs It usually takes on foreign policy and national                security issues after threats are identified and articulated by the administration                In the absence of such a detailedand repeatedarticulation national security tends                not to rise very high on the list of congressional priorities Presidents are                selective in their use of political capital for international issues            In the decade before  presidential discussion of and congressional and public                attention to foreign affairs and national security were dominated by other                issuesamong them Haiti Bosnia Russia China Somalia Kosovo NATO enlargement                the Middle East peace process missile defense and globalization Terrorism                infrequently took center stage and when it did the context was often terrorists                tacticsa chemical biological nuclear or computer threatnot terrorist                    organizations                        Second Congress tends to follow the overall lead of the president on budget issues                with respect to national security matters There are often sharp arguments about                individual programs and internal priorities but by and large the overall funding                authorized and appropriated by the Congress comes out close to the presidents                request This tendency was certainly illustrated by the downward trends in spending                on defense intelligence and foreign affairs in the first part of the s The                White House to be sure read the political signals coming from Capitol Hill but                the Congress largely acceded to the executive branchs funding requests In the                second half of the decade Congress appropriated some  percent of what the                administration requested for intelligence programs Apart from the Gingrich                supplemental of  billion for overall intelligence programs in fiscal year                 the key decisions on overall allocation of resources for national security issues in                the decade before including counterterrorism fundingwere made in the                presidents Office of Management and Budget                        Third Congress did not reorganize itself after the end of the Cold War to address                new threats Recommendations by the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress                were implemented in part in the House of Representatives after the  elections                but there was no reorganization of national security functions The Senate undertook                no appreciable changes Traditional issuesforeign policy defense                intelligencecontinued to be handled by committees whose structure remained largely                unaltered while issues such as transnational terrorism fell between the cracks                Terrorism came under the jurisdiction of at least  different committees in the                House alone and budget and oversight functions in the House and Senate concerning                terrorism were also splintered badly among committees Little effort was made to                consider an integrated policy toward terrorism which might range from identifying                the threat to addressing vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and the                piecemeal approach in the Congress contributed to the problems of the executive                branch in formulating such a policy                        Fourth the oversight function of Congress has diminished over time In recent years                traditional review of the administration of programs and the implementation of laws                has been replaced by a focus on personal investigations possible scandals and                issues designed to generate media attention The unglamorous but essential work of                oversight has been neglected and few members past or present believe it is                performed well DCI Tenet told us We ran from threat to threat to threat                   There was not a system in place to sayYou got to go back and do this and this                and this Not just the DCI but the entire executive branch needed help from                Congress in addressing the questions of counterterrorism strategy and policy                looking past daytoday concerns Members of Congress however also found their                time spent on such everyday matters or in looking back to investigate mistakes and                often missed the big questionsas did the executive branch Staff tended as well to                focus on parochial considerations seeking to add or cut funding for individual                often small programs instead of emphasizing comprehensive oversight                    projects                        Fifth on certain issues other priorities pointed Congress in a direction that was                unhelpful in meeting the threats that were emerging in the months leading up to                 Committees with oversight responsibility for aviation focused overwhelmingly                on airport congestion and the economic health of the airlines not aviation                security Committees with responsibility for the INS focused on the Southwest                border not on terrorists Justice Department officials told us that committees with                responsibility for the FBI tightly restricted appropriations for improvements in                information technology in part because of concerns about the FBIs ability to                manage such projects Committees responsible for South Asia spent the decade of the                s imposing sanctions on Pakistan leaving presidents with little leverage to                alter Pakistans policies before  Committees with responsibility for the                Defense Department paid little heed to developing military responses to terrorism                and stymied intelligence reform All committees found themselves swamped in the                minutiae of the budget process with little time for consideration of longerterm                questions or what many members past and present told us was the proper conduct of                    oversight                        Each of these trends contributed to what can only be described as Congresss slowness                and inadequacy in treating the issue of terrorism in the years before  The                legislative branch adjusted little and did not restructure itself to address                changing threats                        Its attention to terrorism was episodic and splintered across several committees                Congress gave little guidance to executive branch agencies did not reform them in                any significant way and did not systematically perform oversight to identify                address and attempt to resolve the many problems in national security and domestic                agencies that became apparent in the aftermath of             Although individual representatives and senators took significant steps the overall                level of attention in the Congress to the terrorist threat was low We examined the                number of hearings on terrorism from January  to September  The Senate                Armed Services Committee held ninefour related to the attack on the USS Cole The                House Armed Services Committee also held nine six of them by a special oversight                panel on terrorism The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its House counterpart                both held four The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in addition to its                annual worldwide threat hearing held eight its House counterpart held perhaps two                exclusively devoted to counterterrorism plus the briefings by its terrorist working                group The Senate and House intelligence panels did not raise public and                congressional attention on Bin Ladin and al Qaeda prior to the joint inquiry into                the attacks of September  perhaps in part because of the classified nature of                their work Yet in the context of committees that each hold scores of hearings every                year on issues in their jurisdiction this list is not impressive Terrorism was a                second or thirdorder priority within the committees of Congress responsible for                national security                        In fact Congress had a distinct tendency to push questions of emerging national                security threats off its own plate leaving them for others to consider Congress                asked outside commissions to do the work that arguably was at the heart of its own                oversight responsibilities                        Beginning in  the reports of these commissions made scores of recommendations to                address terrorism and homeland security but drew little attention from Congress                Most of their impact came after              RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS            BEFORE THE BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA            Although the  National Intelligence Estimate had warned of a new type of                terrorism many officials continued to think of terrorists as agents of states                Saudi Hezbollah acting for Iran against Khobar Towers or as domestic criminals                Timothy Mc Veigh in Oklahoma City As we pointed out in chapter  the White House                is not a natural locus for program management Hence government efforts to cope                with terrorism were essentially the work of individual agencies            President Bill Clintons counterterrorism Presidential Decision Directives in                 no  and May  no  reiterated that terrorism was a national security                problem not just a law enforcement issue They reinforced the authority of the                National Security Council NSC to coordinate domestic as well as foreign                counterterrorism efforts through Richard Clarke and his interagency                Counterterrorism Security Group CSG Spotlighting new concerns about                unconventional attacks these directives assigned tasks to lead agencies but did not                differentiate types of terrorist threats Thus while Clarke might prod or push                agencies to act what actually happened was usually decided at the State Department                the Pentagon the CIA or the Justice Department The efforts of these agencies were                sometimes energetic and sometimes effective Terrorist plots were disrupted and                individual terrorists were captured But the United States did not before                 adopt as a clear strategic objective the elimination of al Qaeda Early Efforts                against Bin Ladin Until  hardly anyone in the US government understood that                Usama Bin Ladin was an inspirer and organizer of the new terrorism In  the CIA                noted that he had paid for the training of some Egyptian terrorists in Sudan The                State Department detected his money in aid to the Yemeni terrorists who set a bomb                in an attempt to kill US troops in Aden in  State Department sources even saw                suspicious links with Omar Abdel Rahman the Blind Sheikh in the New York area                commenting that Bin Ladin seemed committed to financing Jihads against anti                Islamic regimes worldwide After the department designated Sudan a state sponsor                of terrorism in  it put Bin Ladin on its TIPOFF watchlist a move that might                have prevented his getting a visa had he tried to enter the United States As late                as  however even the CIAs Counterterrorist Center continued to describe him                as an extremist financier                        In  the CIA set up a special unit of a dozen officers to analyze intelligence on                and plan operations against Bin Ladin David Cohen the head of the CIAs                Directorate of Operations wanted to test the idea of having a virtual stationa                station based at headquarters but collecting and operating against a subject much as                stations in the field focus on a country Taking his cue from National Security                Advisor Anthony Lake who expressed special interest in terrorist finance Cohen                formed his virtual station as a terrorist financial links unit He had trouble                getting any Directorate of Operations officer to run it he finally recruited a                former analyst who was then running the Islamic Extremist Branch of the                Counterterrorist Center This officer who was especially knowledgeable about                Afghanistan had noticed a recent stream of reports about Bin Ladin and something                called al Qaeda and suggested to Cohen that the station focus on this one                individual Cohen agreed Thus was born the Bin Ladin unit                        In May  Bin Ladin left Sudan for Afghanistan A few months later as the Bin                Ladin unit was gearing up Jamal Ahmed al Fadl walked into a US embassy in Africa                established his bona fides as a former senior employee of Bin Ladin and provided a                major breakthrough of intelligence on the creation character direction and                intentions of al Qaeda Corroborating evidence came from another walkin source at a                different USembassy More confirmation was supplied later that year by                intelligence and other sources including material gathered by FBI agents and Kenyan                police from an al Qaeda cell in Nairobi                        By  officers in the Bin Ladin unit recognized that Bin Ladin was more than just                a financier They learned that al Qaeda had a military committee that was planning                operations against US interests worldwide and was actively trying to obtain                nuclear material Analysts assigned to the station looked at the information it had                gathered and found connections everywhere including links to the attacks on US                troops in Aden and Somalia in  and  and to the Manila air plot in the                Philippines in                         The Bin Ladin station was already working on plans for offensive operations against                Bin Ladin These plans were directed at both physical assets and sources of finance                In the end plans to identify and attack Bin Ladins money sources did not go                    forward                        In late  when Bin Ladin was still in Sudan the State Department and the CIA                learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the                possibility of expelling Bin LadinUS Ambassador Timothy Carney encouraged the                Sudanese to pursue this course The Saudis however did not want Bin Ladin giving                as their reason their revocation of his citizenship                        Sudans minister of defense Fatih Erwa has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin                Ladin over to the United States The Commission has found no credible evidence that                this was so Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel                Bin Ladin Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese                since at the time there was no indictment outstanding            The chief of the Bin Ladin station whom we will call Mike saw Bin Ladins move to                Afghanistan as a stroke of luck Though the CIA had virtually abandoned Afghanistan                after the Soviet withdrawal case officers had reestablished old contacts while                tracking down Mir Amal Kansi the Pakistani gunman who had murdered two CIA                employees in January  These contacts contributed to intelligence about Bin                Ladins local movements business activities and security and living arrangements                and helped provide evidence that he was spending large amounts of money to help the                Taliban The chief of the Counterterrorist Center whom we will call Jeff told                Director George Tenet that the CIAs intelligence assets were near to providing                realtime information about Bin Ladins activities and travels in Afghanistan One                of the contacts was a group associated with particular tribes among Afghanistans                ethnic Pashtun community                        By the fall of  the Bin Ladin unit had roughed out a plan for these Afghan                tribals to capture Bin Ladin and hand him over for trial either in the United States                or in an Arab country In early  the cabinetlevel Principals Committee                apparently gave the concept its blessing                        On their own separate track getting information but not direction from the CIA the                FBIs New York Field Office and the US Attorney for the Southern District of New                York were preparing to ask a grand jury to indict Bin Ladin The Counterterrorist                Center knew that this was happening                        The eventual charge conspiring to attack US defense installations was finally                issued from the grand jury in June as a sealed indictment The indictment was                publicly disclosed in November of that year            When Bin Ladin moved to Afghanistan in May  he became a subject of interest to                the State Departments South Asia bureau At the time as one diplomat told us                South Asia was seen in the department and the government generally as a low                priority In  as Madeleine Albright was beginning her tenure as secretary of                state an NSC policy review concluded that the United States should pay more                attention not just to India but also to Pakistan and Afghanistan                        With regard to Afghanistan another diplomat said the United States at the time had                no policy                        In the State Department concerns about IndiaPakistan tensions often crowded out                attention to Afghanistan or Bin Ladin Aware of instability and RESPONSES TO AL                QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS  growing Islamic extremism in Pakistan State Department                officials worried most about an arms race and possible war between Pakistan and                India After May  when both countries surprised the United States by testing                nuclear weapons these dangers became daily firstorder concerns of the State                    Department                        In Afghanistan the State Department tried to end the civil war that had continued                since the Soviets withdrawal The South Asia bureau believed it might have a carrot                for Afghanistans warring factions in a project by the Union Oil Company of                California UNOCAL to build a pipeline across the country While there was probably                never much chance of the pipeline actually being built the Afghan desk hoped that                the prospect of shared pipeline profits might lure faction leaders to a conference                tableUS diplomats did not favor the Taliban over the rival factions Despite                growing concerns US diplomats were willing at the time as one official said to                give the Taliban a chance                        Though Secretary Albright made no secret of thinking the Taliban despicable the                US ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson led a delegation to South                Asiaincluding Afghanistanin April  No US official of such rank had been to                Kabul in decades Ambassador Richardson went primarily to urge negotiations to end                the civil war In view of Bin Ladins recent public call for all Muslims to kill                Americans Richardson asked the Taliban to expel Bin Ladin They answered that they                did not know his whereabouts In any case the Taliban said Bin Ladin was not a                threat to the United States                        In sum in late  and the spring of  the lead US agencies each pursued                their own efforts against Bin Ladin The CIAs Counterterrorist Center was                developing a plan to capture and remove him from Afghanistan Parts of the Justice                Department were moving toward indicting Bin Ladin making possible a criminal trial                in a New York court Meanwhile the State Department was focused more on lessening                IndoPakistani nuclear tensions ending the Afghan civil war and ameliorating the                Talibans human rights abuses than on driving out Bin Ladin Another key actor                Marine General Anthony Zinni the commander in chief of the US Central Command                shared the State Departments view                        The CIA Develops a Capture Plan Initially the DCIs Counterterrorist Center and its                Bin Ladin unit considered a plan to ambush Bin Ladin when he traveled between                Kandahar the Taliban capital where he sometimes stayed the night and his primary                residence at the time Tarnak Farms After the Afghan tribals reported that they had                tried such an ambush and failed the Center gave up on it despite suspicions that                the tribals story might be fiction Thereafter the capture plan focused on a                nighttime raid on Tarnak Farms                        A compound of about  concrete or mudbrick buildings surrounded by a foot wall                Tarnak Farms was located in an isolated desert area on the outskirts of the Kandahar                airport CIA officers were able to map the entire site identifying the houses that                belonged to Bin Ladins wives and the one where Bin Ladin himself was most likely to                sleep Working with the tribals they drew up plans for the raid They ran two                complete rehearsals in the United States during the fall of                         By early  planners at the Counterterrorist Center were ready to come back to the                White House to seek formal approval Tenet apparently walked National Security                Advisor Sandy Berger through the basic plan on February  One group of tribals                would subdue the guards enter Tarnak Farms stealthily grab Bin Ladin take him to                a desert site outside Kandahar and turn him over to a second group This second                group of tribals would take him to a desert landing zone already tested in the                 Kansi capture From there a CIA plane would take him to New York an Arab capital                or wherever he was to be arraigned Briefing papers prepared by the Counterterrorist                Center acknowledged that hitches might develop People might be killed and Bin                Ladins supporters might retaliate perhaps taking US citizens in Kandahar                hostage But the briefing papers also noted that there was risk in not acting                Sooner or later they said Bin Ladin will attack US interests perhaps using                WMD weapons of mass destruction                        Clarkes Counterterrorism Security Group reviewed the capture plan for Berger Noting                that the plan was in a very early stage of development the NSC staff then told                the CIA planners to go ahead and among other things start drafting any legal                documents that might be required to authorize the covert action The CSG apparently                stressed that the raid should target Bin Ladin himself not the whole compound                        The CIA planners conducted their third complete rehearsal in March and they again                briefed the CSG Clarke wrote Berger on March  that he saw the operation as                somewhat embryonic and the CIA as months away from doing anything                        Mike thought the capture plan was the perfect operation It required minimum                infrastructure The plan had now been modified so that the tribals would keep Bin                Ladin in a hiding place for up to a month before turning him over to the United                Statesthereby increasing the chances of keeping the US hand out of sight Mike                trusted the information from the Afghan network it had been corroborated by other                means he told us The lead CIA officer in the field Gary Schroen also had                confidence in the tribals In a May  cable to CIA headquarters he pronounced their                planning almost as professional and detailed    as would be done by any US                military special operations element He and the other officers who had worked                through the plan with the tribals judged it about as good as it can be By that                Schroen explained he meant that the chance of capturing or killing Bin Ladin was                about  percent Although the tribals thought they could pull off the raid if the                operation were approved by headquarters and the policymakers Schroen wrote there                was going to be a point when we step back and keep our fingers crossed that the                tribals prove as good and as lucky as they think they will be                        Military officers reviewed the capture plan and according to Mike found no                showstoppers The commander of Delta Force felt uncomfortable with having the                tribals hold Bin Ladin captive for so long and the commander of Joint Special                Operations Forces Lieutenant General Michael Canavan was worried about the safety                of the tribals inside Tarnak Farms General Canavan said he had actually thought the                operation too complicated for the CIAout of their leagueand an effort to get                results on the cheap But a senior Joint Staff officer described the plan as                generally not too much different than we might have come up with ourselves No                one in the Pentagon so far as we know advised the CIA or the White House not to                    proceed                        In Washington Berger expressed doubt about the dependability of the tribals In his                meeting with Tenet Berger focused most however on the question of what was to be                done with Bin Ladin if he were actually captured He worried that the hard evidence                against Bin Ladin was still skimpy and that there was a danger of snatching him and                bringing him to the United States only to see him acquitted                        On May  CIAs managers reviewed a draft Memorandum of Notification MON a legal                document authorizing the capture operation A  presidential finding had                authorized worldwide covert action against terrorism and probably provided adequate                authority But mindful of the old rogue elephant charge senior CIA managers may                have wanted something on paper to show that they were not acting on their own            Discussion of this memorandum brought to the surface an unease about paramilitary                covert action that had become ingrained at least among some CIA senior managers                James Pavitt the assistant head of the Directorate of Operations expressed concern                that people might get killed it appears he thought the operation had at least a                slight flavor of a plan for an assassination Moreover he calculated that it would                cost several million dollars He was not prepared to take that money out of hide                and he did not want to go to all the necessary congressional committees to get                special money Despite Pavitts misgivings the CIA leadership cleared the draft                memorandum and sent it on to the National Security Council                        Counterterrorist Center officers briefed Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director                Louis Freeh telling them that the operation had about a  percent chance of                success The Centers chief Jeff joined John ONeill the head of the FBIs New                York Field Office in briefing Mary Jo White the US Attorney for the Southern                District of New York and her staff Though Jeff  also used the  percent success                figure he warned that someone would surely be killed in the operation Whites                impression from the New York briefing was that the chances of capturing Bin Ladin                alive were nil                        From May  to  the CIA ran a final graded rehearsal of the operation spread                over three time zones even bringing in personnel from the region The FBI also                participated The rehearsal went well The Counterterrorist Center planned to brief                cabinetlevel principals and their deputies the following week giving June  as                the date for the raid with Bin Ladin to be brought out of Afghanistan no later than                July                         On May  Director Tenet discussed the high risk of the operation with Berger and                his deputies warning that people might be killed including Bin Ladin Success was                to be defined as the exfiltration of Bin Ladin out of Afghanistan                        A meeting of principals was scheduled for May  to decide whether the operation                should go ahead            The principals did not meet On May  Jeff  informed Mike that he had just met                with Tenet Pavitt and the chief of the Directorates Near Eastern Division The                decision was made not to go ahead with the operation Mike cabled the field that                he had been directed to stand down on the operation for the time being He had                been told he wrote that cabinetlevel officials thought the risk of civilian                casualtiescollateral damagewas too high They were concerned about the tribals                safety and had worried that the purpose and nature of the operation would be                subject to unavoidable misinterpretation and misrepresentationand probably                recriminationsin the event that Bin Ladin despite our best intentions and efforts                did not survive                        Impressions vary as to who actually decided not to proceed with the operation Clarke                told us that the CSG saw the plan as flawed He was said to have described it to a                colleague on the NSC staff as halfassed and predicted that the principals would                not approve it Jeff  thought the decision had been made at the cabinet level                Pavitt thought that it was Bergers doing though perhaps on Tenets advice Tenet                told us that given the recommendation of his chief operations officers he alone had                decided to turn off  the operation He had simply informed Berger who had not                pushed back Bergers recollection was similar He said the plan was never presented                to the White House for a decision                        The CIAs senior management clearly did not think the plan would work Tenets deputy                director of operations wrote to Berger a few weeks later that the CIA assessed the                tribals ability to capture Bin Ladin and deliver him to US officials as low But                workinglevel CIA officers were disappointed Before it was canceled Schroen                described it as the best plan we are going to come up with to capture Bin Ladin                while he is in Afghanistan and bring him to justice                        No capture plan before  ever again attained the same level of detail and                preparation The tribals reported readiness to act diminished And Bin Ladins                security precautions and defenses became more elaborate and formidable At this                time  was more than three years away It was the duty of Tenet and the CIA                leadership to balance the risks of inaction against jeopardizing the lives of their                operatives and agents And they had reason to worry about failure millions of                dollars down the drain a shootout that could be seen as an assassination and if                there were repercussions in Pakistan perhaps a coup The decisions of the US                government in May  were made as Berger has put RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL                ASSAULTS  it from the vantage point of the driver looking through a muddy                windshield moving forward not through a clean rearview mirror                        Looking for Other Options The Counterterrorist Center continued to track Bin Ladin                and to contemplate covert action The most hopeful possibility seemed now to lie in                diplomacy but not diplomacy managed by the Department of State which focused                primarily on IndiaPakistan nuclear tensions during the summer of  The CIA                learned in the spring of  that the Saudi government had quietly disrupted Bin                Ladin cells in its country that were planning to attack US forces with                shoulderfired missiles They had arrested scores of individuals with no publicity                When thanking the Saudis Director Tenet took advantage of the opening to ask them                to help against Bin Ladin The response was encouraging enough that President                Clinton made Tenet his informal personal representative to work with the Saudis on                terrorism and Tenet visited Riyadh in May and again in early June                        Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah who had taken charge from the ailing King Fahd promised                Tenet an allout secret effort to persuade the Taliban to expel Bin Ladin so that he                could be sent to the United States or to another country for trial The Kingdoms                emissary would be its intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal Vice President Al                Gore later added his thanks to those of Tenet both making clear that they spoke                with President Clintons blessing Tenet reported that it was imperative to get an                indictment against Bin Ladin The New York grand jury issued its sealed indictment a                few days later on June  Tenet also recommended that no action be taken on other                US options such as the covert action plan                        Prince Turki followed up in meetings during the summer with Mullah Omar and other                Taliban leaders Apparently employing a mixture of possible incentives and threats                Turki received a commitment that Bin Ladin would be expelled but Mullah Omar did                not make good on this promise                        On August  Clarke chaired a CSG meeting on Bin Ladin In the discussion of what                might be done the note taker wrote there was a dearth of bright ideas around the                table despite a consensus that the government ought to pursue every avenue it can                to address the problem                        CRISIS AUGUST              On August   National Security Advisor Berger woke President Clinton with a                phone call at  AM to tell him of the almost simultaneous bombings of the US                embassies in Nairobi Kenya and Dar es Salaam Tanzania Suspicion quickly focused                on Bin Ladin Unusually good intelligence chiefly from the yearlong monitoring of                al Qaedas cell in Nairobi soon firmly fixed responsibility on him and his                    associates                        Debate about what to do settled very soon on one option Tomahawk cruise missiles                Months earlier after cancellation of the covert capture operation Clarke had                prodded the Pentagon to explore possibilities for military action On June                 General Hugh Shelton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had directed                General Zinni at Central Command to develop a plan which he had submitted during                the first week of July Zinnis planners surely considered the two previous times                the United States had used force to respond to terrorism the  strike on Libya                and the  strike against Iraq They proposed firing Tomahawks against eight                terrorist camps in Afghanistan including Bin Ladins compound at Tarnak Farms                        After the embassy attacks the Pentagon offered this plan to the White House            The day after the embassy bombings Tenet brought to a principals meeting                intelligence that terrorist leaders were expected to gather at a camp near Khowst                Afghanistan to plan future attacks According to Berger Tenet said that several                hundred would attend including Bin Ladin The CIA described the area as effectively                a military cantonment away from civilian population centers and overwhelmingly                populated by jihadists Clarke remembered sitting next to Tenet in a White House                meeting asking Tenet You thinking what Im thinking and his nodding yes The principals quickly reached a consensus on attacking                the gathering The strikes purpose was to kill Bin Ladin and his chief                    lieutenants                        Berger put in place a tightly compartmented process designed to keep all planning                secret On August  General Zinni received orders to prepare detailed plans for                strikes against the sites in Afghanistan The Pentagon briefed President Clinton                about these plans on August  and  Though the principals hoped that the missiles                would hit Bin Ladin NSC staff recommended the strike whether or not there was firm                evidence that the commanders were at the facilities                        Considerable debate went to the question of whether to strike targets outside of                Afghanistan including two facilities in Sudan One was a tannery believed to belong                to Bin Ladin The other was al Shifa a Khartoum pharmaceutical plant which                intelligence reports said was manufacturing a precursor ingredient for nerve gas                with Bin Ladins financial support The argument for hitting the tannery was that it                could hurt Bin Ladin financially The argument for hitting al Shifa was that it                would lessen the chance of Bin Ladins having nerve gas for a later attack                        Ever since March  American officials had had in the backs of their minds Aum                Shinrikyos release of sarin nerve gas in the Tokyo subway President Clinton                himself had expressed great concern about chemical and biological terrorism in the                United States Bin Ladin had reportedly been heard to speak of wanting a                Hiroshimaand at least  casualties The CIA reported RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS                INITIAL ASSAULTS  that a soil sample from the vicinity of the al Shifa plant had                tested positive for EMPTA a precursor chemical for VX a nerve gas whose lone use                was for mass killing Two days before the embassy bombings Clarkes staff wrote                that Bin Ladin has invested in and almost certainly has access to VX produced at a                plant in Sudan Senior State Department officials                believed that they had received a similar verdict independently though they and                Clarkes staff were probably relying on the same report Mary McCarthy the NSC                senior director responsible for intelligence programs initially cautioned Berger                that the bottom line was that we will need much better intelligence on this                facility before we seriously consider any options She added that the link between                Bin Ladin and al Shifa was rather uncertain at this point Berger has told us that                he thought about what might happen if the decision went against hitting al Shifa                and nerve gas was used in a New York subway two weeks later                        By the early hours of the morning of August  President Clinton and all his                principal advisers had agreed to strike Bin Ladin camps in Afghanistan near Khowst                as well as hitting al Shifa The President took the Sudanese tannery off the target                list because he saw little point in killing uninvolved people without doing                significant harm to Bin Ladin The principal with the most qualms regarding al Shifa                was Attorney General Reno She expressed concern about attacking two Muslim                countries at the same time Looking back she said that she felt the premise kept                    shifting                        Later on August  Navy vessels in the Arabian Sea fired their cruise missiles                Though most of them hit their intended targets neither Bin Ladin nor any other                terrorist leader was killed Berger told us that an afteraction review by Director                Tenet concluded that the strikes had killed  people in the camps but probably                missed Bin Ladin by a few hours Since the missiles headed for Afghanistan had had                to cross Pakistan the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was sent to meet with                Pakistans army chief of staff to assure him the missiles were not coming from                India Officials in Washington speculated that one or another Pakistani official                might have sent a warning to the Taliban or Bin Ladin                        The air strikes marked the climax of an intense hour period in which Berger                notified congressional leaders the principals called their foreign counterparts                and President Clinton flew back from his vacation on Marthas Vineyard to address                the nation from the Oval Office The President spoke to the congressional leadership                from Air Force One and he called British Prime Minister Tony Blair Pakistani Prime                Minister Nawaz Sharif and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from the White                    House                        House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott initially supported                the President The next month Gingrichs office dismissed the cruise missile                attacks as pinpricks                        At the time President Clinton was embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal which continued                to consume public attention for the rest of that year and the first months of                 As it happened a popular  movie Wag the Dog features a president who fakes a                war to distract public attention from a domestic scandal Some Republicans in                Congress raised questions about the timing of the strikes Berger was particularly                rankled by an editorial in the Economist that said that only the future would tell                whether the US missile strikes had created  new fanatics where there would                have been none                        Much public commentary turned immediately to scalding criticism that the action was                too aggressive The Sudanese denied that al Shifa produced nerve gas and they                allowed journalists to visit what was left of a seemingly harmless facility                President Clinton Vice President Gore Berger Tenet and Clarke insisted to us                that their judgment was right pointing to the soil sample evidence No independent                evidence has emerged to corroborate the CIAs assessment                        Everyone involved in the decision had of course been aware of President Clintons                problems He told them to ignore them Berger recalled the President saying to him                that they were going to get crap either way so they should do the right                    thing All his aides testified to us that they based                their advice solely on national security considerations We have found no reason to                question their statements            The failure of the strikes the wag the dog slur the intense partisanship of the                period and the nature of the al Shifa evidence likely had a cumulative effect on                future decisions about the use of force against Bin Ladin Berger told us that he                did not feel any sense of constraint                        The period after the August  embassy bombings was critical in shaping US policy                toward Bin Ladin Although more Americans had been killed in the  KhobarTowers                attack and many more in Beirut in  the overall loss of life rivaled the worst                attacks in memory More ominous perhaps was the demonstration of an operational                capability to coordinate two nearly simultaneous attacks on US embassies in                different countries            Despite the availability of information that al Qaeda was a global network in                 policymakers knew little about the organization The reams of new information that                the CIAs Bin Ladin unit had been developing since  had not been pulled together                and synthesized for the rest of the government Indeed analysts in the unit felt                that they were viewed as alarmists even within the CIA A National Intelligence                Estimate on terrorism in  had only briefly mentioned Bin Ladin and no                subsequent national estimate would authoritatively evaluate the terrorism danger                until after  Policymakers knew there was a dangerous individual Usama Bin                Ladin whom they had been trying to capture and bring to trial Documents at the                time referred to Bin Ladin and his associates or Bin Ladin and his network They                did not emphasize the existence of a structured worldwide organization gearing up to                train thousands of potential terrorists                        In the critical days and weeks after the August  attacks senior policymakers in                the Clinton administration had to reevaluate the threat posed by Bin RESPONSES TO AL                QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS  Ladin Was this just a new and especially venomous                version of the ordinary terrorist threat America had lived with for decades or was                it radically new posing a danger beyond any yet experienced            Even after the embassy attacks Bin Ladin had been responsible for the deaths of                fewer than  Americans most of them overseas An NSC staffer working for Richard                Clarke told us the threat was seen as one that could cause hundreds of casualties                not thousands                        Even officials who acknowledge a vital threat intellectually may not be ready to act                on such beliefs at great cost or at high risk            Therefore the government experts who believed that Bin Ladin and his network posed                such a novel danger needed a way to win broad support for their views or at least                spotlight the areas of dispute The Presidential Daily Brief and the similar more                widely circulated daily reports for high officialsconsisting mainly of brief                reports of intelligence news without much analysis or context did not provide                such a vehicle The national intelligence estimate has often played this role and                is sometimes controversial for this very reason It played no role in judging the                threat posed by al Qaeda either in  or later In the late summer and fall of                 the US government also was worrying about the deployment of military power                in two other ongoing conflicts After years of war in the Balkans the United States                had finally committed itself to significant military intervention in                 Already maintaining a NATOled peacekeeping force in Bosnia US officials were                beginning to consider major combat operations against Serbia to protect Muslim                civilians in Kosovo from ethnic cleansing Air strikes were threatened in October                 a fullscale NATO bombing campaign against Serbia was launched in March                                            In addition the Clinton administration was facing the possibility of major combat                operations against Iraq Since  the UN inspections regime had been increasingly                obstructed by Saddam Hussein The United States was threatening to attack unless                unfettered inspections could resume The Clinton administration eventually launched                a largescale set of air strikes against Iraq Operation Desert Fox in December                 These military commitments became the context in which the Clinton                administration had to consider opening another front of military engagement against                a new terrorist threat based in Afghanistan            A FollowOn Campaign            Clarke hoped the August  missile strikes would mark the beginning of a sustained                campaign against Bin Ladin Clarke was as he later admitted obsessed with Bin                Ladin and the embassy bombings gave him new scope for pursuing his obsession                Terrorism had moved high up among the Presidents concerns and Clarkes position                had elevated accordingly The CSG unlike most standing interagency committees did                not have to report through the Deputies Committee Although such a reporting                relationship had been prescribed in the May  presidential directive after                expressions of concern by Attorney General Reno among others that directive                contained an exception that permitted the CSG to report directly to the principals                if Berger so elected In practice the CSG often reported not even to the full                Principals Committee but instead to the socalled Small Group formed by Berger                consisting only of those principals cleared to know about the most sensitive issues                connected with counterterrorism activities concerning Bin Ladin or the Khobar Towers                    investigation                        For this inner cabinet Clarke drew up what he called PoliticalMilitary Plan                Delenda The Latin delenda meaning that something must be destroyed evoked the                famous Roman vow to destroy its rival Carthage The overall goal of Clarkes paper                was to immediately eliminate any significant threat to Americans from the Bin                Ladin networkThe paper called for diplomacy to deny Bin Ladin sanctuary covert                action to disrupt terrorist activities but above all to capture Bin Ladin and his                deputies and bring them to trial efforts to dry up Bin Ladins money supply and                preparation for followon military action The status of the document was and                remained uncertain It was never formally adopted by the principals and                participants in the Small Group now have little or no recollection of it It did                however guide Clarkes efforts The military component of Clarkes plan was its                most fully articulated element He envisioned an ongoing campaign of strikes against                Bin Ladins bases in Afghanistan or elsewhere whenever target information was ripe                Acknowledging that individual targets might not have much value he cautioned Berger                not to expect ever again to have an assembly of terrorist leaders in his sights But                he argued that rolling attacks might persuade the Taliban to hand over Bin Ladin                and in any case would show that the action in August was not a oneoff  event It                would show that the United States was committed to a relentless effort to take down                Bin Ladins network                        Members of the Small Group found themselves unpersuaded of the merits of rolling                attacks Defense Secretary William Cohen told us Bin Ladins training camps were                primitive built with rope ladders General Shelton called them jungle gym                camps Neither thought them worthwhile targets for very expensive missiles                President Clinton and Berger also worried about the Economists pointthat attacks                that missed Bin Ladin could enhance his stature and win him new recruits After the                United States launched air attacks against Iraq at the end of  and against                Serbia in  in each case provoking worldwide criticism Deputy National Security                Advisor James Steinberg added the argument that attacks in Afghanistan offered                little benefit lots of blowback against a bombhappy US                        During the last week of August  officials began considering possible followon                strikes According to Clarke President Clinton was inclined to launch further                strikes sooner rather than later On August  Under Secretary of Defense for                Policy Walter Slocombe advised Secretary Cohen that the availRESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS                INITIAL ASSAULTS  able targets were not promising The experience of the previous                week he wrote has only confirmed the importance of defining a clearly articulated                rationale for military action that was effective as well as justified But Slocombe                worried that simply striking some of these available targets did not add up to an                effective strategy                        Defense officials at a lower level in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for                Special Operations and LowIntensity Conflict tried to meet Slocombes objections                They developed a plan that unlike Clarkes called not for particular strikes but                instead for a broad change in national strategy and in the institutional approach of                the Department of Defense implying a possible need for largescale operations                across the whole spectrum of US military capabilities It urged the department to                become a lead agency in driving a national counterterrorism strategy forward to                champion a national effort to take up the gauntlet that international terrorists                have thrown at our feet The authors expressed concern that we have not                fundamentally altered our philosophy or our approach even though the terrorist                threat had grown They outlined an eightpart strategy to be more proactive and                aggressive The future they warned might bring horrific attacks in which case                we will have no choice nor unfortunately will we have a plan The assistant                secretary Allen Holmes took the paper to Slocombes chief deputy Jan Lodal but                it went no further Its lead author recalls being told by Holmes that Lodal thought                it was too aggressive Holmes cannot recall what was said and Lodal cannot remember                the episode or the paper at all                        DIPLOMACY            After the August missile strikes diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no                more promising than military options The United States had issued a formal warning                to the Taliban and also to Sudan that they would be held directly responsible for                any attacks on Americans wherever they occurred carried out by the Bin Ladin                network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it                        For a brief moment it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the                Taliban into thinking of giving up Bin Ladin On August  the reclusive Mullah                Omar told a workinglevel State Department official that the strikes were                counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United                States on Bin Ladins presence in Afghanistan                        Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam the US ambassador to Pakistan Taliban                delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but                asked what would happen to Bin Ladin should he be sent to Saudi Arabia                        Yet in September  when the Saudi emissary Prince Turki asked Mullah Omar                whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Ladin the Taliban leader                said no Both sides shouted at each other with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi                government Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime                Saudi Arabia Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that                recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan Crown Prince                Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited                Washington in late September His account confirmed reports that the US government                had received independently                        Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing                and permitting US agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody The history of                such cooperation in  and  had been strained                        Several officials told us in particular that the United States could not get direct                access to an important al Qaeda financial official Madani al Tayyib who had been                detained by the Saudi government in Though US officials repeatedly raised                the issue the Saudis provided limited information In his September  meeting                with Crown Prince Abdullah Vice President Gore while thanking the Saudi government                for their responsiveness renewed the request for direct US access to Tayyib                        The United States never obtained this access An NSC staffled working group on                terrorist finances asked the CIA in November  to push again for access to Tayyib                and to see if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin                Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia including especially the Bin Ladin                    family One result was two NSCled interagency trips                to Persian Gulf states in  and  During these trips the NSC Treasury and                intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials and later interviewed                members of the Bin Ladin family about Usamas inheritance The Saudis and the Bin                Ladin family eventually helped in this particular effort and US officials                ultimately learned that Bin Ladin was not financing al Qaeda out of a personal                    inheritance                        But Clarke was frustrated about how little the Agency knew complaining to Berger                that four years after we first asked CIA to track down Bin Ladins finances and                two years after the creation of the CIAs Bin Ladin unit the Agency said it could                only guess at how much aid Bin Ladin gave to terrorist groups what were the main                sources of his budget or how he moved his money                        The other diplomatic route to get at Bin Ladin in Afghanistan ran through Islamabad                In the summer before the embassy bombings the State Department had been heavily                focused on rising tensions between India and Pakistan and did not aggressively                challenge Pakistan on Afghanistan and Bin Ladin But State Department                counterterrorism officials wanted a stronger position the departments acting                counterterrorism coordinator advised Secretary Albright to designate Pakistan as a                state sponsor of terrorism noting that despite highlevel Pakistani assurances the                countrys military intelligence service continued activities in support of                international terrorismby supporting attacks on civilian targets in Kashmir This                recommendation was opposed by the State Departments South Asia bureau which was                concerned that it would damage already RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS                 sensitive relations with Pakistan in the wake of the May  nuclear tests by both                Pakistan and India Secretary Albright rejected the recommendation on August                  just two days before the embassy bombings                        She told us that in general putting the Pakistanis on the terrorist list would                eliminate any influence the United States had over them                        In October an NSC counterterrorism official noted that Pakistans proTaliban                military intelligence service had been training Kashmiri jihadists in one of the                camps hit by US missiles leading to the death of Pakistanis                        After flying to Nairobi and bringing home the coffins of the American dead Secretary                Albright increased the departments focus on counterterrorism According to                Ambassador Milam the bombings were a wakeup call and he soon found himself                spending  to  percent of his time working the Taliban Bin Ladin portfolio                        But Pakistans military intelligence service known as the ISID InterServices                Intelligence Directorate was the Talibans primary patron which made progress                difficult            Additional pressure on the Pakistanisbeyond demands to press theTaliban on Bin                Ladinseemed unattractive to most officials of the State Department Congressional                sanctions punishing Pakistan for possessing nuclear arms prevented the                administration from offering incentives to Islamabad                        In the words of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott Washingtons Pakistan                policy was stickheavy Talbott felt that the only remaining sticks were                additional sanctions that would have bankrupted the Pakistanis a dangerous move                that could have brought total chaos to a nucleararmed country with a significant                number of Islamic radicals                        The Saudi government which had a long and close relationship with Pakistan and                provided it oil on generous terms was already pressing Sharif with regard to the                Taliban and Bin Ladin A senior State Department official concluded that Saudi Crown                Prince Abdullah put a tremendous amount of heat on the Pakistani prime minister                during the princes October  visit to Pakistan                        The State Department urged President Clinton to engage the Pakistanis Accepting this                advice President Clinton invited Sharif to Washington where they talked mostly                about India but also discussed Bin Ladin After Sharif went home the President                called him and raised the Bin Ladin subject again This effort elicited from Sharif                a promise to talk with the Taliban                        Mullah Omars position showed no sign of softening One intelligence report passed to                Berger by the NSC staff quoted Bin Ladin as saying that Mullah Omar had given him a                completely free hand to act in any country though asking that he not claim                responsibility for attacks in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia Bin Ladin was described as                grabbing his beard and saying emotionally By Allah by God the Americans will                still be amazed The socalled United States will suffer the same fate as the                Russians Their state will collapse too                        Debate in the State Department intensified after December  when Michael Sheehan                became counterterrorism coordinator A onetime special forces officer he had worked                with Albright when she was ambassador to the United Nations and had served on the                NSC staff with Clarke He shared Clarkes obsession with terrorism and had little                hesitation about locking horns with the regional bureaus Through every available                channel he repeated the earlier warning to the Taliban of the possible dire                consequencesincluding military strikesif Bin Ladin remained their guest and                conducted additional attacks Within the department he argued for designating the                Taliban regime a state sponsor of terrorism This was technically difficult to do                for calling it a state would be tantamount to diplomatic recognition which the                United States had thus far withheld But Sheehan urged the use of any available                weapon against the Taliban He told us that he thought he was regarded in the                department as a onenote Johnny nutcase                        In early  the State Departments counterterrorism office proposed a                comprehensive diplomatic strategy for all states involved in the Afghanistan                problem including Pakistan It specified both carrots and hardhitting sticks                among them certifying Pakistan as uncooperative on terrorism Albright said the                original carrots and sticks listed in a decision paper for principals may not have                been used as described on paper but added that they were used in other ways or in                varying degrees But the papers author Ambassador Sheehan was frustrated and                complained to us that the original plan had been watered down to the point that                nothing was then done with it                        The cautiousness of the South Asia bureau was reinforced when in May  Pakistani                troops were discovered to have infiltrated into an especially mountainous area of                Kashmir A limited war began between India and Pakistan euphemistically called the                Kargil crisis as India tried to drive the Pakistani forces out Patience with                Pakistan was wearing thin inside both the State Department and the NSC Bruce                Riedel the NSC staff member responsible for Pakistan wrote Berger that Islamabad                was behaving as a rogue state in two areasbacking TalibanUBL terror and provoking                war with India                        Discussion within the Clinton administration on Afghanistan then concentrated on two                main alternatives The first championed by Riedel and Assistant Secretary of State                Karl Inderfurth was to undertake a major diplomatic effort to end the Afghan civil                war and install a national unity government The second favored by Sheehan Clarke                and the CIA called for labeling the Taliban a terrorist group and ultimately                funneling secret aid to its chief foe the Northern Alliance This dispute would go                back and forth throughout  and ultimately become entangled with debate about                enlisting the Northern Alliance as an ally for covert action                        Another diplomatic option may have been available nurturing Afghan exile groups as a                possible moderate governing alternative to theTaliban In late  Washington                provided some support for talks among the leaders of exile Afghan groups including                the ousted Romebased King Zahir Shah and Hamid Karzai about bolstering                antiTaliban forces inside Afghanistan and linking the RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS                INITIAL ASSAULTS  Northern Alliance with Pashtun groups One US diplomat later                told us that the exile groups were not ready to move forward and that coordinating                fractious groups residing in Bonn Rome and Cyprus proved extremely difficult                        Frustrated by the Talibans resistance two senior State Department officials                suggested asking the Saudis to offer the Taliban  million for Bin Ladin Clarke                opposed having the United States facilitate a huge grant to a regime as heinous as                the Taliban and suggested that the idea might not seem attractive to either                Secretary Albright or First Lady Hillary Rodham Clintonboth critics of the                Talibans record on womens rights                        The proposal seems to have quietly died            Within the State Department some officials delayed Sheehan and Clarkes push either                to designateTalibancontrolled Afghanistan as a state sponsor of terrorism or to                designate the regime as a foreign terrorist organization thereby avoiding the issue                of whether to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistans government Sheehan and Clarke                prevailed in July  when President Clinton issued an executive order effectively                declaring the Taliban regime a state sponsor of terrorism                        In October a UN Security Council Resolution championed by the United States added                economic and travel sanctions                        With UN sanctions set to come into effect in November Clarke wrote Berger that the                Taliban appear to be up to something Mullah Omar had                shuffled his cabinet and hinted at Bin Ladins possible departure Clarkes staff                thought his most likely destination would be Somalia Chechnya seemed less appealing                with Russia on the offensive Clarke commented that Iraq and Libya had previously                discussed hosting Bin Ladin though he and his staff had their doubts that Bin Ladin                would trust secular Arab dictators such as Saddam Hussein or Muammar Qadhafi Clarke                also raised the remote possibility of Yemen which offered vast uncontrolled                spaces In November the CSG discussed whether the sanctions had rattled the                Taliban who seemed to be looking for a facesaving way out of the Bin Ladin                    issue                        In fact none of the outside pressure had any visible effect on Mullah Omar who was                unconcerned about commerce with the outside world Omar had virtually no diplomatic                contact with the West since he refused to meet with non Muslims The United States                learned that at the end of  theTaliban Council of Ministers unanimously                reaffirmed that their regime would stick by Bin Ladin Relations between Bin Ladin                and theTaliban leadership were sometimes tense but the foundation was deep and                    personal                        Indeed Mullah Omar had executed at least one subordinate who opposed his proBin                Ladin policy                        The United States would try tougher sanctions in  Working with Russia a country                involved in an ongoing campaign against Chechen separatists some of whom received                support from Bin Ladin the United States persuaded the United Nations to adopt                Security Council Resolution  which included an embargo on arms shipments to the                Taliban in December                         The aim of the resolution was to hit the Taliban where it was most sensitive on the                battlefield against the Northern Allianceand criminalize giving them arms and                providing military advisers which Pakistan had been doing                        Yet the passage of the resolution had no visible effect on Omar nor did it halt the                flow of Pakistani military assistance to the Taliban                        US authorities had continued to try to get cooperation from Pakistan in pressing                the Taliban to stop sheltering Bin Ladin President Clinton contacted Sharif again                in June  partly to discuss the crisis with India but also to urge Sharif in                the strongest way I can to persuade the Taliban to expel Bin Ladin                        The President suggested that Pakistan use its control over oil supplies to the                Taliban and over Afghan imports through Karachi Sharif suggested instead that                Pakistani forces might try to capture Bin Ladin themselves Though no one in                Washington thought this was likely to happen President Clinton gave the idea his                    blessing                        The President met with Sharif in Washington in early July Though the meetings main                purpose was to seal the Pakistani prime ministers decision to withdraw from the                Kargil confrontation in Kashmir President Clinton complained about Pakistans                failure to take effective action with respect to the Taliban and Bin Ladin Sharif                came back to his earlier proposal and won approval for US assistance in training a                Pakistani special forces team for an operation against Bin Ladin Then in October                 Sharif was deposed by General Pervez Musharraf and the plan was                    terminated                        At first the Clinton administration hoped that Musharraf s coup might create an                opening for action on Bin Ladin A career military officer Musharraf was thought to                have the political strength to confront and influence the Pakistani military                intelligence service which supported the Taliban Berger speculated that the new                government might use Bin Ladin to buy concessions from Washington but neither side                ever developed such an initiative                        By late  more than a year after the embassy bombings diplomacy with Pakistan                like the efforts with the Taliban had according to Under Secretary of State Thomas                Pickering borne little fruit                        COVERT ACTION            As part of the response to the embassy bombings President Clinton signed a                Memorandum of Notification authorizing the CIA to let its tribal assets use force to                capture Bin Ladin and his associates CIA officers told the tribals that the plan to                capture Bin Ladin which had been turned off  three months earlier was back on                The memorandum also authorized the CIA to attack Bin Ladin in other ways Also an                executive order froze financial holdings that could be linked to Bin Ladin                        The counterterrorism staff at CIA thought it was gaining a better understanding of                Bin Ladin and his network In preparation for briefing the Senate RESPONSES TO AL                QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS  Select Committee on Intelligence on September  Tenet                was told that the intelligence community knew more about Bin Ladins networkthan                about any other top tier terrorist organization                        The CIA was using this knowledge to disrupt a number of Bin Ladinassociated cells                Working with Albanian authorities CIA operatives had raided an al Qaeda forgery                operation and another terrorist cell in Tirana These operations may have disrupted                a planned attack on the US embassy in Tirana and did lead to the rendition of a                number of al Qaedarelated terrorist operatives After the embassy bombings there                were arrests in Azerbaijan Italy and Britain Several terrorists were sent to an                Arab country The CIA described working with FBI operatives to prevent a planned                attack on the US embassy in Uganda and a number of suspects were arrested On                September  Abu Hajer one of Bin Ladins deputies in Sudan and the head of his                computer operations and weapons procurement was arrested in Germany He was the                most important Bin Ladin lieutenant captured thus far Clarke commented to Berger                with satisfaction that August and September had brought the greatest number of                terrorist arrests in a short period of time that we have ever                    arrangedfacilitated                        Given the Presidents August Memorandum of Notification the CIA had already been                working on new plans for using the Afghan tribals to capture Bin Ladin During                September and October the tribals claimed to have tried at least four times to                ambush Bin Ladin Senior CIA officials doubted whether any of these ambush attempts                had actually occurred But the tribals did seem to have success in reporting where                Bin Ladin was                        This information was more useful than it had been in the past since the August                missile strikes Bin Ladin had taken to moving his sleeping place frequently and                unpredictably and had added new bodyguards Worst of all al Qaedas senior                leadership had stopped using a particular means of communication almost immediately                after a leak to the Washington Times                        This made it much more difficult for the National Security Agency to intercept his                conversations But since the tribals seemed to know where Bin Ladin was or would be                an alternative to capturing Bin Ladin would be to mark his location and call in                another round of missile strikes            On November  the Small Group met to discuss these problems among other topics                Preparing Director Tenet for a Small Group meeting in mid November the                Counterterrorist Center stressed At this point we cannot predict when or if a                capture operation will be executed by our assets                        US counterterrorism officials also worried about possible domestic attacks Several                intelligence reports some of dubious sourcing mentioned Washington as a possible                target On October  Clarkes CSG took the unusual step of holding a meeting                dedicated to trying to evaluate the threat of a terrorist attack in the United                States by the Usama bin Ladin networkThe CSG members were urged to be as                creative as possible in their thinking about preventing a Bin Ladin attack on US                territory Participants noted that while the FBI had been given additional resources                for such efforts both it and the CIA were having problems exploiting leads by                tracing US telephone numbers and translating documents obtained in cell                disruptions abroad The Justice Department reported that the current guidelines from                the Attorney General gave sufficient legal authority for domestic investigation and                    surveillance                        Though intelligence gave no clear indication of what might be afoot some                intelligence reports mentioned chemical weapons pointing toward work at a camp in                southern Afghanistan called Derunta On November   the US Attorneys Office                for the Southern District of New York unsealed its indictment of Bin Ladin charging                him with conspiracy to attack US defense installations The indictment also                charged that al Qaeda had allied itself with Sudan Iran and Hezbollah The                original sealed indictment had added that al Qaeda had reached an understanding                with the government of Iraq that al Qaeda would not work against that government and                that on particular projects specifically including weapons development al Qaeda                would work cooperatively with the Government of Iraq                This passage led Clarke who for years had read intelligence reports on                IraqiSudanese cooperation on chemical weapons to speculate to Berger that a large                Iraqi presence at chemical facilities in Khartoum was probably a direct result of                the IraqAl Qida agreement Clarke added that VX precursor traces found near al                Shifa were the exact formula used by IraqThis language about al Qaedas                understanding with Iraq had been dropped however when a superseding indictment                was filed in November                         On Friday December   the CIA included an article in the Presidential Daily                Brief describing intelligence received from a friendly government about a                threatened hijacking in the United States This article was declassified at our                request                            The following is the text of an item from the Presidential Daily Brief received                    by President William J Clinton on December   Redacted material is                    indicated in brackets                SUBJECT Bin Ladin Preparing to Hijack US Aircraft and Other Attacks                 Reporting  suggests Bin Ladin and his allies are preparing for attacks in                    the US including an aircraft hijacking to obtain the release of Shaykh Umar                    Abd alRahman Ramzi Yousef and Muhammad Sadiq Awda One source quoted a                    senior member of the Gamaat alIslamiyya IG saying that as of late October                    the IG had completed planning for RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS                     an operation in the US on behalf of Bin Ladin but that the operation was on                    hold A senior Bin Ladin operative from Saudi Arabia was to visit IG                    counterparts in the US soon thereafter to discuss optionsperhaps including an                    aircraft hijacking                                    IG leader Islambuli in late September was planning to hijack a US airliner                        during the next couple of weeks to free Abd al Rahman and the other                        prisoners according to what may be a different source                    The same source late last month said that Bin Ladin might implement plans                        to hijack US aircraft before the beginning of Ramadan on  December and                        that two members of the operational team had evaded security checks during a                        recent trial run at an unidentified New York airport                                  Some members of the Bin Ladin network have received hijack training according                    to various sources but no group directly tied to Bin Ladins alQaida                    organization has ever carried out an aircraft hijacking Bin Ladin could be                    weighing other types of operations against US aircraft According to  the IG                    in October obtained SA missiles and intended to move them from Yemen into                    Saudi Arabia to shoot down an Egyptian plane or if unsuccessful a US military                    or civilian aircraft                                    A  in October told us that unspecified extremist elements in Yemen                        had acquired SAs                                   indicate the Bin Ladin organization or its allies are moving closer to                    implementing antiUS attacks at unspecified locations but we do not know                    whether they are related to attacks on aircraft A Bin Ladin associate in Sudan                    late last month told a colleague in Kandahar that he had shipped a group of                    containers to Afghanistan Bin Ladin associates also talked about the movement                    of containers to Afghanistan before the East Africa bombings                                    In other  Bin Ladin associates last month discussed picking up a                        package in Malaysia One told his colleague in Malaysia that they were in                        the ninth month of pregnancy                     An alleged Bin Ladin supporter in Yemen late last month remarked to his                        mother that he planned to work in commerce from abroad and said his                        impending marriage which would take place soon would be a                        surpriseCommerce and marriage often are codewords for terrorist                        attacks                                         The same day Clarke convened a meeting of his CSG to discuss both the hijacking                concern and the antiaircraft missile threat To address the hijacking warning the                group agreed that New York airports should go to maximum security starting that                weekend They agreed to boost security at other East coast airports The CIA agreed                to distribute versions of the report to the FBI and FAA to pass to the New York                Police Department and the airlines The FAA issued a security directive on December                 with specific requirements for more intensive air carrier screening of passengers                and more oversight of the screening process at all three New York City area                    airports                        The intelligence community could learn little about the source of the information                Later in December and again in early January  more information arrived from the                same source reporting that the planned hijacking had been stalled because two of                the operatives who were sketchily described had been arrested near Washington                DC or New York After investigation the FBI could find no information to support                the hijack threat nor could it verify any arrests like those described in the                report The FAA alert at the New York area airports ended on January                          On December  the day after the United States and Britain began their Desert Fox                bombing campaign against Iraq the Small Group convened to discuss intelligence                suggesting imminent Bin Ladin attacks on the US embassies in Qatar and Ethiopia                The next day Director Tenet sent a memo to the President the cabinet and senior                officials throughout the government describing reports that Bin Ladin planned to                attack US targets very soon possibly over the next few days before Ramadan                celebrations began Tenet said he was greatly concerned                        With alarms sounding members of the Small Group considered ideas about how to                respond to or prevent such attacks Generals Shelton and Zinni came up with military                options Special Operations Forces were later told that they might be ordered to                attempt very highrisk inandout raids either in Khartoum to capture a senior Bin                Ladin operative known as Abu Hafs the Mauritanian who appeared to be engineering                some of the plotsor in Kandahar to capture Bin Ladin himself Shelton told us that                such operations are not risk free invoking the memory of the  Black Hawk down                fiasco in Mogadishu                        The CIA reported on December  that Bin Ladin might be traveling to Kandahar and                could be targeted there with cruise missiles Vessels with Tomahawk cruise missiles                were on station in the Arabian Sea and could fire within a few hours of receiving                target data                        On December  intelligence indicated Bin Ladin would be spending the night at the                Haji Habash house part of the governors residence in Kandahar The chief of the                Bin Ladin unit Mike told us that he promptly briefed Tenet and his deputy John                Gordon From the field the CIAs Gary Schroen advisedHit him tonightwe may not                get another chance An urgent teleconference of principals was arranged                        The principals considered a cruise missile strike to try to kill Bin Ladin One issue                they discussed was the potential collateral damagethe number of innocent bystanders                who would be killed or wounded General Zinni predicted a number well over  and                was concerned about damage to a nearby mosque The senior intelligence officer on                the Joint Staff apparently made a different calculation estimating half as much                collateral damage and not predicting damage to the mosque By the end of the                meeting the principals decided against recommending to the President that he order                a strike A few weeks later in January  Clarke wrote that the principals had                thought the intelligence only half reliable and had worried about killing or                injuring perhaps  people Tenet said he remembered doubts about the reliability                of the source and concern about hitting the nearby mosque Mike remembered Tenet                telling him that the military was concerned that a few hours had passed since the                last sighting of Bin Ladin and that this persuaded everyone that the chance of                failure was too great                        Some lowerlevel officials were angry Mike reported to Schroen that he had been                unable to sleep after this decision Im sure well regret not acting last night                he wrote criticizing the principals for worrying that some stray shrapnel might                hit the Habash mosque and offend Muslims He commented that they had not shown                comparable sensitivity when deciding to bomb Muslims in Iraq The principals he                said were obsessed with trying to get others Saudis Pakistanis Afghan                tribalsto do what we wont do Schroen was disappointed too We should have done                it last night he wrote We may well come to regret the decision not to go                    ahead The Joint Staff s deputy director for                operations agreed even though he told us that later intelligence appeared to show                that Bin Ladin had left his quarters before the strike would have occurred Missing                Bin Ladin he said would have caused us a hell of a problem but it was a shot we                should have taken and we would have had to pay the price                        The principals began considering other more aggressive covert alternatives using the                tribals CIA officers suggested that the tribals would prefer to try a raid rather                than a roadside ambush because they would have better control it would be less                dangerous and it played more to their skills and experience But everyone knew that                if the tribals were to conduct such a raid guns would be blazing The current                Memorandum of Notification instructed the CIA to capture Bin Ladin and to use lethal                force only in selfdefense Work now began on a new memorandum that would give the                tribals more latitude The intention was to say that they could use lethal force if                the attempted capture seemed impossible to complete successfully                        Early drafts of this highly sensitive document emphasized that it authorized only a                capture operation The tribals were to be paid only if they captured Bin Ladin not                if they killed him Officials throughout the government approved this draft But on                December  the day after principals decided not to launch the cruise missile                strike against Kandahar the CIAs leaders urged strengthening the language to allow                the tribals to be paid whether Bin Ladin was captured or killed Berger and Tenet                then worked together to take this line of thought even further                        They finally agreed as Berger reported to President Clinton that an extraordinary                step was necessary The new memorandum would allow the killing of Bin Ladin if the                CIA and the tribals judged that capture was not feasible a judgment it already                seemed clear they had reached The Justice Department lawyer who worked on the                draft told us that what was envisioned was a group of tribals assaulting a location                leading to a shootout Bin Ladin and others would be captured if possible but                probably would be killed The administrations position was that under the law of                armed conflict killing a person who posed an imminent threat to the United States                would be an act of selfdefense not an assassination On Christmas Eve  Berger                sent a final draft to President Clinton with an explanatory memo The President                approved the document                        Because the White House considered this operation highly sensitive only a tiny                number of people knew about this Memorandum of Notification Berger arranged for the                NSCs legal adviser to inform Albright Cohen Shelton and Reno None was allowed                to keep a copy Congressional leaders were briefed as required by law Attorney                General Reno had sent a letter to the President expressing her concern she warned                of possible retaliation including the targeting of US officials She did not pose                any legal objection A copy of the final document along with the carefully crafted                instructions that were to be sent to the tribals was given to Tenet                        A message from Tenet to CIA field agents directed them to communicate to the tribals                the instructions authorized by the President the United States preferred that Bin                Ladin and his lieutenants be captured but if a successful capture operation was not                feasible the tribals were permitted to kill them The instructions added that the                tribals must avoid killing others unnecessarily and must not kill or abuse Bin Ladin                or his lieutenants if they surrendered Finally the tribals would not be paid if                this set of requirements was not met                        The field officer passed these instructions to the tribals word for word But he                prefaced the directions with a messageFrom the American President down to the                average man in the street we want him Bin Ladin stopped If the tribals captured                Bin Ladin the officer assured them that he would receive a fair trial under US                law and be treated humanely The CIA officer reported that the tribals said they                fully understand the contents implications and the spirit of the message and that                that their response wasWe will try our best to capture Bin Ladin alive and will                have no intention of killing or harming him on purpose The tribals explained that                they wanted to prove that their standards of behavior were more civilized than those                of Bin Ladin and his band of terrorists In an additional note addressed to Schroen                the tribals noted that if they were to adopt Bin Ladins ethicswe would have                finished the job long before RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS  but they                had been limited by their abilities and by our beliefs and laws we have to                    respect                        Schroen and Mike were impressed by the tribals reaction Schroen cabled that the                tribals were not in it for the money but as an investment in the future of                Afghanistan Mike agreed that the tribals reluctance to kill was not a                showstopper From our view he wrote that seems in character and fair                    enough                        Policymakers in the Clinton administration including the President and his national                security advisor told us that the Presidents intent regarding covert action                against Bin Ladin was clear he wanted him dead This intent was never well                communicated or understood within the CIA Tenet told the Commission that except in                one specific case discussed later the CIA was authorized to kill Bin Ladin only                in the context of a capture operation CIA senior managers operators and lawyers                confirmed this understanding We always talked about how much easier it would have                been to kill him a former chief of the Bin Ladin unit said                        In February  another draft Memorandum of Notification went to President Clinton                It asked him to allow the CIA to give exactly the same guidance to the Northern                Alliance as had just been given to the tribals they could kill Bin Ladin if a                successful capture operation was not feasible On this occasion however President                Clinton crossed out key language he had approved in December and inserted more                ambiguous language No one we interviewed could shed light on why the President did                this President Clinton told the Commission that he had no recollection of why he                rewrote the language                        Later in  when legal authority was needed for enlisting still other                collaborators and for covering a wider set of contingencies the lawyers returned to                the language used in August  which authorized force only in the context of a                capture operation Given the closely held character of the document approved in                December  and the subsequent return to the earlier language it is possible to                understand how the former White House officials and the CIA officials might disagree                as to whether the CIA was ever authorized by the President to kill Bin Ladin                        The dispute turned out to be somewhat academic as the limits of available legal                authority were not tested Clarke commented to Berger that despite expanded                authority for CIAs sources to engage in direct action they have shown no                inclination to do so He added that it was his impression that the CIA thought the                tribals unlikely to act against Bin Ladin and hence relying on them was                    unrealistic Events seemed to bear him out since                the tribals did not stage an attack on Bin Ladin or his associates during  The                tribals remained active collectors of intelligence however providing good but not                predictive information about Bin Ladins whereabouts The CIA also tried to improve                its intelligence reporting on Bin Ladin by what Tenets assistant director for                collection the indefatigable Charles Allen called an allout allagency                sevendaysaweek effort                        The effort might have had an effect On January   Clarke wrote Berger that                the CIAs confidence in the tribals reporting had increased It was now higher than                it had been on December                         In February  Allen proposed flying a U mission over Afghanistan to build a                baseline of intelligence outside the areas where the tribals had coverage Clarke                was nervous about such a mission because he continued to fear that Bin Ladin might                leave for someplace less accessible He wrote Deputy National Security Advisor                Donald Kerrick that one reliable source reported Bin Ladins having met with Iraqi                officials who may have offered him asylum Other intelligence sources said that                some Taliban leaders though not Mullah Omar had urged Bin Ladin to go to Iraq If                Bin Ladin actually moved to Iraq wrote Clarke his network would be at Saddam                Husseins service and it would be virtually impossible to find him Better to get                Bin Ladin in Afghanistan Clarke declared                        Berger suggested sending one U flight but Clarke opposed even this It would                require Pakistani approval he wrote and Pakistans intelligence service is in                bed with Bin Ladin and would warn him that the United States was getting ready for                a bombing campaign Armed with that knowledge old wily Usama will likely boogie to                BaghdadThough told also by Bruce Riedel of the NSC staff that Saddam Hussein                wanted Bin Ladin in Baghdad Berger conditionally authorized a single U flight                Allen meanwhile had found other ways of getting the information he wanted So the                U flight never occurred                        SEARCHING FOR FRESH OPTIONS            Boots on the Ground            Starting on the day the August  strikes were launched General Shelton had issued                a planning order to prepare followon strikes and think beyond just using cruise                    missiles                        The initial strikes had been called Operation Infinite Reach The followon plans                were given the code name Operation Infinite Resolve            At the time any actual military action in Afghanistan would have been carried out by                General Zinnis Central Command This command was therefore the locus for most                military planning Zinni was even less enthusiastic than Cohen and Shelton about                followon cruise missile strikes He knew that the Tomahawks did not always hit                their targets After the August  strikes President Clinton had had to call                Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif to apologize for a wayward missile that had killed                several people in a Pakistani village Sharif had been understanding while                commenting on American overkill                        Zinni feared that Bin Ladin would in the future locate himself in cities where US                missiles could kill thousands of Afghans He worried also lest Pakistani authorities                not get adequate warning think the missiles came from India RESPONSES TO AL                QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS  and do something that everyone would later regret                Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility                Zinni said It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it We                had to live there                        Zinnis distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities                in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan But he told us that he could not drum                up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington partly he thought                because these countries had dictatorial governments                        After the decisionin which fear of collateral damage was an important factor not to                use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December  Shelton and officers in the                Pentagon developed plans for using an AC gunship instead of cruise missile                strikes Designed specifically for the special forces the version of the AC                known as Spookycan fly in fast or from high altitude undetected by radar guided                to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics it is capable of rapidly firing                precisionguided   and  mm projectiles Because this system could target                more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles it had a much lower risk of causing                collateral damage After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed                Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker who headed the Special                Operations Command to develop plans for an AC mission against Bin Ladins                headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan The Joint Staff prepared a decision                paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft                        Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option the ACs                were never deployed Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use and John                Maher the Joint Staff s deputy director of operations agreed that this was                Zinnis position Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option He told us that                he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good                enough to justify actually moving ACs into position Schoomaker says on the                contrary that he thought the AC option feasible                        The most likely explanation for the two generals differing recollections is that                both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a                longterm redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South                Asia The ACs would need bases because the aircrafts unrefueled range was only                a little over  miles They needed searchandrescue backup which would have                still less range Thus an AC deployment had to be embedded in a wider political                and military concept involving Pakistan or other neighboring countries to address                issues relating to basing and overflight No one ever put such an initiative on the                table Zinni therefore cautioned about simply ordering up AC deployments for a                quick strike Schoomaker planned for what he saw as a practical strike option and                the underlying issues were not fully engaged The Joint Staff decision paper was                never turned into an interagency policy paper            The same was true for the option of using ground units from the Special Operations                Command Within the command some officerssuch as Schoomakerwanted the mission of                putting boots on the ground to get at Bin Ladin and al Qaeda At the time Special                Operations was designated as a supporting command not a supported command that                is it supported a theater commander and did not prepare its own plans for dealing                with al Qaeda Schoomaker proposed to Shelton and Cohen that Special Operations                become a supported command but the proposal was not adopted Had it been accepted                he says he would have taken on the al Qaeda mission instead of deferring to Zinni                Lieutenant General William Boykin the current deputy under secretary of defense for                intelligence and a founding member of Delta Force told us that opportunities were                missed because of an unwillingness to take risks and a lack of vision and                    understanding                        President Clinton relied on the advice of General Shelton who informed him that                without intelligence on Bin Ladins location a commando raids chance of failure                was high Shelton told President Clinton he would go forward with boots on the                ground if the President ordered him to do so however he had to ensure that the                President was completely aware of the large logistical problems inherent in a                military operation                        The Special Operations plans were apparently conceived as another quick strike                optionan option to insert forces after the United States received actionable                intelligence President Clinton told the Commission that if we had had really good                intelligence about    where Usama Bin Ladin was I would have done it Zinni                and Schoomaker did make preparations for possible very high risk inandout                operations to capture or kill terrorists Cohen told the Commission that the notion                of putting military personnel on the ground without some reasonable certitude that                Bin Ladin was in a particular location would have resulted in the missions failure                and the loss of life in a fruitless effort                        None of these officials was aware of the ambitious plan developed months earlier by                lowerlevel Defense officials            In our interviews some military officers repeatedly invoked the analogy of Desert                One and the failed  hostage rescue mission in Iran                        They were dubious about a quick strike approach to using Special Operations Forces                which they thought complicated and risky Such efforts would have required bases in                the region but all the options were unappealing ProTaliban elements of Pakistans                military might warn Bin Ladin or his associates of pending operations With nearby                basing options limited an alternative was to fly from ships in the Arabian Sea or                from land bases in the Persian Gulf as was done after  Such operations would                then have to be supported from long distances overflying the airspace of nations                that might not have been supportive or aware of US efforts                        However if these hurdles were addressed and if the military could then operate                regularly in the region for a long period perhaps clandestinely it might RESPONSES                TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS  attempt to gather intelligence and wait for an                opportunity One Special Operations commander said his view of actionable                intelligence was that if you give me the action I will give you the                    intelligence But this course would still be risky                in light both of the difficulties already mentioned and of the danger that US                operations might fail disastrously We have found no evidence that such a longterm                politicalmilitary approach for using Special Operations Forces in the region was                proposed to or analyzed by the Small Group even though such capability had been                honed for at least a decade within the Defense Department Therefore the debate                looked to some like bold proposals from civilians meeting hypercaution from the                military Clarke saw it this way Of the military he said to usThey were very                very very reluctant But from another perspective                poorly informed proposals for bold action were pitted against experienced                professional judgment That was how Secretary of Defense Cohen viewed it He said to                usI would have to place my judgment call in terms of do I believe that the                chairman of the Joint Chiefs former commander of Special Forces command is in a                better position to make a judgment on the feasibility of this than perhaps Mr                    Clarke                        Beyond a largescale politicalmilitary commitment to build up a covert or                clandestine capability using American personnel on the ground either military or                CIA there was a still larger option that could have been consideredinvading                Afghanistan itself Every official we questioned about the possibility of an                invasion of Afghanistan said that it was almost unthinkable absent a provocation                such as  because of poor prospects for cooperation from Pakistan and other                nations and because they believed the public would not support it Cruise missiles                were and would remain the only military option on the table            The Desert Camp February             Early in  the CIA received reporting that Bin Ladin was spending much of his                time at one of several camps in the Afghan desert south of Kandahar At the                beginning of February Bin Ladin was reportedly located in the vicinity of the                Sheikh Ali camp a desert hunting camp being used by visitors from a Gulf state                Public sources have stated that these visitors were from the United Arab                    Emirates                        Reporting from the CIAs assets provided a detailed description of the hunting camp                including its size location resources and security as well as of Bin Ladins                smaller adjacent camp                        Because this was not in an urban area missiles launched against it would have less                risk of causing collateral damage On February  the military began to ready itself                for a possible strike                        The next day national technical intelligence confirmed the location and description                of the larger camp and showed the nearby presence of an official aircraft of the                United Arab Emirates But the location of Bin Ladins quarters could not be pinned                down so precisely                        The CIA did its best to answer a host of questions about the larger camp and its                residents and about Bin Ladins daily schedule and routines to support military                contingency planning According to reporting from the tribals Bin Ladin regularly                went from his adjacent camp to the larger camp where he visited the Emiratis the                tribals expected him to be at the hunting camp for such a visit at least until                midmorning on February                         Clarke wrote to Bergers deputy on February  that the military was then doing                targeting work to hit the main camp with cruise missiles and should be in position                to strike the following morning                        Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert appears to have been briefed on the                    situation                        No strike was launched By February  Bin Ladin had apparently moved on and the                immediate strike plans became moot                        According to CIA and Defense officials policymakers were concerned about the danger                that a strike would kill an Emirati prince or other senior officials who might be                with Bin Ladin or close by Clarke told us the strike was called off after                consultations with Director Tenet because the intelligence was dubious and it                seemed to Clarke as if the CIA was presenting an option to attack Americas best                counterterrorism ally in the Gulf The lead CIA official in the field Gary Schroen                felt that the intelligence reporting in this case was very reliable the Bin Ladin                unit chief Mike agreed Schroen believes today that this was a lost opportunity                to kill Bin Ladin before                         Even after Bin Ladins departure from the area CIA officers hoped he might return                seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up                The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity                        On March   Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible                associations between Emirati officials and Bin Ladin Clarke later wrote in a                memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency                meeting and cleared with the CIA                        When the former Bin Ladin unit chief found out about Clarkes call he questioned CIA                officials who denied having given such a clearance                        Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarkes phone call the camp was                hurriedly dismantled and the site was deserted                        CIA officers including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt were irate Mike                thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting Bin                    Ladin                        The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the                United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem From  through early                 the United States and President Clinton personally pressed the UAE one of                the Talibans only travel and financial outlets to the outside world to break off                its ties and enforce sanctions especially those relating to flights to and from                    Afghanistan                        These efforts achieved little before  In July  UAE Minister of State for                Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over                Bin Ladin                        The Taliban did not take him seriously however Bin Zayid later told an American                diploRESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS  mat that the UAE valued its                relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to                Iranian dangers in the region but he also noted that the UAE did not want to                upset the United States                        Looking for New Partners            Although not all CIA officers had lost faith in the tribals capabilitiesmany judged                them to be good reportersfew believed they would carry out an ambush of Bin Ladin                The chief of the Counterterrorist Center compared relying on the tribals to playing                the lottery                        He and his associates supported by Clarke pressed for developing a partnership with                the Northern Alliance even though doing so might bring the United States squarely                behind one side in Afghanistans longrunning civil war            The Northern Alliance was dominated by Tajiks and drew its strength mainly from the                northern and eastern parts of Afghanistan In contrast Taliban members came                principally from Afghanistans most numerous ethnic group the Pashtuns who are                concentrated in the southern part of the country extending into the NorthWest                Frontier and Baluchistan provinces of Pakistan                        Because of the Talibans behavior and its association with Pakistan the Northern                Alliance had been able at various times to obtain assistance from Russia Iran and                India The alliances leader was Afghanistans most renowned military commander                Ahmed Shah Massoud Reflective and charismatic he had been one of the true heroes                of the war against the Soviets But his bands had been charged with more than one                massacre and the Northern Alliance was widely thought to finance itself in part                through trade in heroin Nor had Massoud shown much aptitude for governing except as                a ruthless warlord Nevertheless Tenet told us Massoud seemed the most interesting                possible new ally against Bin Ladin                        In February  Tenet sought President Clintons authorization to enlist Massoud                and his forces as partners In response to this request the President signed the                Memorandum of Notification whose language he personally altered Tenet says he saw                no significance in the Presidents changes So far as he was concerned it was the                language of August  expressing a preference for capture but accepting the                possibility that Bin Ladin could not be brought out alive We were plowing the same                groundTenet said                        CIA officers described Massouds reaction when he heard that the United States wanted                him to capture and not kill Bin Ladin One characterized Massouds body language as                a wince Schroen recalled Massouds response as You guys are crazyyou havent                changed a bit In Schroens opinion the capture proviso inhibited Massoud and his                forces from going after Bin Ladin but did not completely stop them                        The idea however was a long shot Bin Ladins usual base of activity was near                Kandahar far from the front lines ofTaliban operations against the Northern                Alliance            Kandahar May             It was in Kandahar that perhaps the last and most likely the best opportunity arose                for targeting Bin Ladin with cruise missiles before  In May  CIA assets in                Afghanistan reported on Bin Ladins location in and around Kandahar over the course                of five days and nights The reporting was very detailed and came from several                sources If this intelligence was not actionable workinglevel officials said at                the time and today it was hard for them to imagine how any intelligence on Bin                Ladin in Afghanistan would meet the standard Communications were good and the                cruise missiles were ready This was in our strike zone a senior military officer                said It was a fat pitch a home run He expected the missiles to fly When the                decision came back that they should stand down not shoot the officer saidwe all                just slumped He told us he knew of no one at the Pentagon or the CIA who thought                it was a bad gamble Bin Ladin should have been a dead man that night he                    said                        Workinglevel CIA officials agreed While there was a conflicting intelligence report                about Bin Ladins whereabouts the experts discounted it At the time CIA                workinglevel officials were told by their managers that the strikes were not                ordered because the military doubted the intelligence and worried about collateral                damage Replying to a frustrated colleague in the field the Bin Ladin unit chief                wrotehaving a chance to get Bin Ladin three times in  hours and foregoing the                chance each time has made me a bit angry    The DCI finds himself alone at the                table with the other principals basically saying well go along with your                decision Mr Director and implicitly saying that the Agency will hang alone if the                attack doesnt get Bin Ladin But the military officer                quoted earlier recalled that the Pentagon had been willing to act He told us that                Clarke informed him and others that Tenet assessed the chance of the intelligence                being accurate as  This officer believed that Tenets assessment was the key                to the decision                        Tenet told us he does not remember any details about this episode except that the                intelligence came from a single uncorroborated source and that there was a risk of                collateral damage The story is further complicated by Tenets absence from the                critical principals meeting on this strike he was apparently out of town his                deputy John Gordon was representing the CIA Gordon recalled having presented the                intelligence in a positive light with appropriate caveats but stating that this                intelligence was about as good as it could get                        Berger remembered only that in all such cases the call had been Tenets Berger felt                sure that Tenet was eager to get Bin Ladin In his view Tenet did his job                responsibly George would call and sayWe just dont have it Berger said                        The decision not to strike in May  may now seem hard to understand In fairness                we note two points First in December  the principals wariness about ordering                a strike appears to have been vindicated Bin Ladin left his room unexpectedly and                if a strike had been ordered he would not have been RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL                ASSAULTS  hit Second the administration and the CIA in particular was in the                midst of intense scrutiny and criticism in May  because faulty intelligence had                just led the United States to mistakenly bomb the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during                the NATO war against Serbia This episode may have made officials more cautious than                might otherwise have been the case                        From May  until September  policymakers did not again actively consider a                missile strike against Bin Ladin                        The principals did give some further consideration in  to more general strikes                reviving Clarkes Delenda notion of hitting camps and infrastructure to disrupt al                Qaedas organization In the first months of  the Joint Staff had developed                broader target lists to undertake a focused campaign against the infrastructure of                Bin Ladins network and to hit Taliban government sites as well General Shelton                told us that the Taliban targets were easier to hit and more substantial                        Part of the context for considering broader strikes in the summer of  was renewed                worry about Bin Ladins ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction In May and                June the US government received a flurry of ominous reports including more                information about chemical weapons training or development at the Derunta camp and                possible attempts to amass nuclear material at Herat                        By late June US and other intelligence services had concluded that al Qaeda was in                preattack mode perhaps again involving Abu Hafs the Mauritanian On June  at                Clarkes request Berger convened the Small Group in his office to discuss the                alert Bin Ladins WMD programs and his location Should we preempt by attacking                UBL facilities Clarke urged Berger to ask his colleagues                        In his handwritten notes on the meeting paper Berger jotted down the presence of                 to  families in the Tarnak Farms facility which could mean  casualties                Berger noted the possible slight impact on Bin Ladin and added if he responds                were blamed                        The NSC staff raised the option of waiting until after a terrorist attack and then                retaliating including possible strikes on the Taliban But Clarke observed that Bin                Ladin would probably empty his camps after an attack                        The military route seemed to have reached a dead end In December  Clarke urged                Berger to ask the principals to ask themselvesWhy have there been no real options                lately for direct US military actionThere are no notes recording whether the                question was discussed or if it was how it was answered Reports of possible                attacks by Bin Ladin kept coming in throughout  They included a threat to blow                up the FBI building in Washington DC In September the CSG reviewed a possible                threat to a flight out of Los Angeles or New York                        These warnings came amid dozens of others that flooded in With military and                diplomatic options practically exhausted by the summer of  the US government                seemed to be back where it had been in the summer of relying on the CIA to find                some other option That picture also seemed discouraging Several disruptions and                renditions aimed against the broader al Qaeda network had succeeded                        But covert action efforts in Afghanistan had not been fruitful            In mid new leaders arrived at the Counterterrorist Center and the Bin Ladin                unit The new director of CTC replacing Jeff was Cofer Black The new head of                the section that included the Bin Ladin unit was Richard Black Richard and                their colleagues began working on a new operational strategy for attacking al Qaeda                their starting point was to get better intelligence relying more on the CIAs own                sources and less on the tribals                        In July  President Clinton authorized the CIA to work with several governments                to capture Bin Ladin and extended the scope of efforts to Bin Ladins principal                lieutenants The President reportedly also authorized a covert action under                carefully limited circumstances which if successful would have resulted in Bin                Ladins death                        Attorney General Reno again expressed concerns on policy grounds She was worried                about the danger of retaliation The CIA also developed the shortlived effort to                work with a Pakistani team that we discussed earlier and an initiative to work with                Uzbekistan The Uzbeks needed basic equipment and training No action could be                expected before March  at the earliest                        In fall  DCI Tenet unveiled the CIAs new Bin Ladin strategy It was called                simply the Plan The Plan proposed continuing disruption and rendition operations                worldwide It announced a program for hiring and training better officers with                counterterrorism skills recruiting more assets and trying to penetrate al Qaedas                ranks The Plan aimed to close gaps in technical intelligence collection signal and                imagery as well In addition the CIA would increase contacts with the Northern                Alliance rebels fighting the Taliban                        With a new operational strategy the CIA evaluated its capture options None scored                high marks The CIA had no confidence in the Pakistani effort In the event that Bin                Ladin traveled to the Kandahar region in southern Afghanistan the tribal network                there was unlikely to attack a heavily guarded Bin Ladin the Counterterrorist                Center rated the chance of success at less than  percent To the northwest the                Uzbeks might be ready for a crossborder sortie in six months their chance of                success was also rated at less than  percent                        In the northeast were Massouds Northern Alliance forcesperhaps the CIAs best                option In late October a group of officers from the Counterterrorist Center flew                into the Panjshir Valley to meet up with Massoud a hazardous journey in rickety                helicopters that would be repeated several times in the future Massoud appeared                committed to helping the United States collect intelligence on Bin Ladins                activities and whereabouts and agreed to try to capture him if the opportunity                arose The Bin Ladin unit was satisfied that its reporting on Bin Ladin would now                have a second source But it also knew that Massoud would act against Bin Ladin only                if his own interests and those of the RESPONSES TO AL QAEDAS INITIAL ASSAULTS                 United States intersected By early December the CIA rated this possibility at less                than  percent                        Finally the CIA considered the possibility of putting US personnel on the ground                in Afghanistan The CIA had been discussing this option with Special Operations                Command and found enthusiasm on the working level but reluctance at higher levels                CIA saw a  percent chance of Special Operations Command forces capturing Bin Ladin                if deployedbut less than a  percent chance of such a deployment Sending CIA                officers into Afghanistan was to be considered if the gain clearly outweighs the                riskbut at this time no such gains presented themselves to warrant the risk                        As mentioned earlier such a protracted deployment of US Special Operations Forces                into Afghanistan perhaps as part of a team joined to a deployment of the CIAs own                officers would have required a major policy initiative probably combined with                efforts to secure the support of at least one or two neighboring countries to make                a longterm commitment establish a durable presence on the ground and be prepared                to accept the associated risks and costs Such a military plan was never developed                for interagency consideration before  As  came to a close the CIA had a                new strategic plan in place for capturing Bin Ladin but no option was rated as                having more than a  percent chance of achieving that objective
