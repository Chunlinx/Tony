                                             A wave of antiAmericanfeeling swept through the European press this week fueled by a mixture ofMonica Lewinsky Karla Faye Tucker Saddam Hussein and the cablecar disasterat Cavalese in the Italian Dolomites AntiAmericanism was exceptionally strongin Italy where a US Prowler jet on a lowflying exercise from the US airbase at nearby Aviano cut through the wire of a cable car Tuesday and sent skiers plunging to their deaths Thursdays Italian papers were packed for thesecond day running with negative comment about the United States taking theirlead from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Prime Minister Romano Prodi bothof whom despite President Clintons apology had used harsh undiplomaticlanguage to condemn the US role in the tragedy            InLa Repubblica of Romethe respected columnist Giorgio Bocca accused the US commanders at Aviano of manifest andinexcusable arrogance For months on end Bocca said they had ignoredrepeated civilian warnings and protests about the lowflying exercises Thereis a fundamental contradiction in American foreign policy he wrote On theone hand the United States has realized that the world cannot be entrustedsolely to the pursuit of profit and to the indiscriminate use of the globalcapital market and it has breathed new life into supranational institutionslike the IMF and the UN Security Council On the other hand the Americanmilitary continue to regard their host countries as subject to their militaryneeds or to their war games while they live in superb isolation in theiruncontrollable inaccessible bases Perhaps imperial powers have always behavedlike that but its not pleasant and its not dignified for those who have tobear the consequencesin this case tragically            In

raises his voice against his countrys Cold War enemy in tonesthat havent been heard in the Kremlin for years An astute politician Yeltsinrecognizes the sad face of America and seizes the opportunity to appear as awise elder statesman There was now a risk Riotta added that the Europeanswould see only this sad face and forget the millions of respectableAmericans more interested in debating issues than in oral sex            La Stampa of Turin Wednesdayattacked the US military as Rambos in a headline and published a frontpagecolumn the next day titled in English Yankee GoHome This was not a call for action however but a nostalgic evocationof the Italian antiAmericanism of the past All Italian newspapers prominentlyreported the Communist Partys new demand for the closure of US bases onItalian soil and the remarks made by the parish priest of Cavalese aboutPresident Clinton whom he called variously a womanizer a warmonger anda man without moral or political principles            In France Germany and Spain the execution ofTucker in Huntsville Texas was the subject of much adverse comment In Parisboth Le Monde andLibration featured itin their frontpage lead stories and their main editorials InLibration  a smiling photograph of Tucker filled twothirds of thefront beneath the headline A Frightening America The editorial inside described Tucker as a manifestly sincerepenitent and said One couldnt imagine a better argument against the deathpenalty than Karla Tucker or a better demonstration of the absurdity of asocial vengeance that is taken after  years not against the author of thecrime but against this other person the criminal has become in the meantimeThe editorial said that Gov George Bush Jr had made the right decision fromhis own point of view to show no mercyafter all he might wish to run forthe US presidency which is probably how Bill Clinton thought when he wasgovernor of Arkansas and didnt once exercise his power of clemency                           LeMonde s frontpage cartoon showed the traditional figure of death with asyringe in one hand and a scythe sporting the stars and stripes in the otherfacing a sea of television cameras and announcing somewhat obscurely MeIve had an adventure with the Governor of Texas The newspapers mainheadline was The execution of Karla Tucker underlines thebanalization of the death penalty in the

United Stateshas never radically questioned deepens the barbarism of the Americanexception It is common knowledge among criminologists that the death penaltystrikes first and foremost at the

      As he departed for Washington on an official visit BritishPrime Minister Tony Blair published an oped article in the conservativeDaily Telegraph ofLondon reaffirming Britains readiness to take part in military action againstIraq He wrote that an American journalist had recently asked him if he hadconsidered cancelling the visit in the light of the media frenzy that hassurrounded President Clinton over the past couple of weeks The thought hadnot even crossed my mind Mr Blair wrote The idea that we should distanceourselves from an ally and a friend because of shortterm media turbulence isabsurd Two days earlier Hugo Young chief columnist of the liberal Guardian and normally verysympathetic to Blair had written What is unfolding between London andWashington shows the same submissive respect by the lesser for the strongerpartner as prevailed in the ReaganThatcher years highlighted now by Britainssolitary potentially catastrophic part in a joint venture against Iraq            The Independent of Londonreported Thursday that air strikes against targets in Iraq willstart in  days time on  February if current diplomatic moves to defuse thecrisis fail Quoting sources in Washington the Independent sJerusalem correspondent Patrick Cockburn said planners considered this theoptimum date for attack because by then  the United States would have threecarriers in the Gulf and  the United States and Britain would be able to saythey had given ample time for diplomatic moves by Russia and France to bearfruit In the Daily                Telegraph  British military historian JohnKeegan wrote that a new air campaign against Iraq would probably have to benastier than it was before directed at civilian targets which the coalitionforces deliberately spared in  He proposed the targeting of the Iraqielectricity grid but acknowledged that a lengthy interruption of service wouldinflict much misery on the Iraqi masses            In Asia and Africa the MonicaLewinsky scandal was still alive and kicking The Post Express of Nigeriasaid in an editorial that it would like to commend the Americanpeople for their watchful insistence on probity and moral rectitude for publicoffice holders but proposed caution in pursuing Clinton because it will befoolhardy for America to cut its nose to spite its face The Pioneer ofIndia said it was appalled not by the idea of Clinton and
