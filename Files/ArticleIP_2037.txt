                                 Be Fruitful and Multiply            The day you were born youbrought both costs and benefits into this world The costs include the demandsyou made and continue to make on the worlds resources The benefits includeyour ongoing contributions to the worlds stock of ideas love friendship anddiversity            Do the costs outweigh thebenefits or vice versa In other words Should the rest of us consider yourbirth or any childs birth a blessing or a curse            Lets not try tosettle this by listing all the costs and benefits of sharing the world withother people After an evening stuck in summer traffic youll remember thatthe driver in front of you imposed a cost but you might forget that the guywho invented your cars air conditioner conferred a benefit New Yorkersremember to complain about the crowds but sometimes forget that without thecrowds New York would be Cedar Rapids            Insteadof making a list lets think about the decision your parents faced when theywere considering whether to conceive a child Is it more likely that theyundercounted costs or that they undercounted benefits            Ill start with benefits The clearest benefit of yourbirth is that it gave your parents a child to love they certainly counted thatone But the other benefits are spread far and wide If you build a bettermousetrap millions will be in your debt If all you do is smile youll stillbrighten thousands of days We dont know how to list those benefits but we doknow that many of them fall on total strangers That makes it unlikely thatyour parents took them fully into account            Now lets look at costs Thecosts of your existence fall into two categories First you consume privatelyowned resources like food and land Second you might consume resources towhich you have no clear property rightfor example you might open a factorythat pollutes the air I breathe or you might become a burglar who steals mystereo system            You mightimagine that there are also costs associated with your competing in themarketplace bidding some prices up and others down applying for the job Iwanted and so forth But each of those costs has an offsetting benefit If youbid up the price of cars sellers will gain as much as buyers lose If youprove a stronger job candidate than I do my loss is the employers gain            Stealing and polluting clearly impose costs onstrangers But if youre at all typical your consumption of staples like foodand land will far exceed your consumption of other peoples air and otherpeoples property In other words for most people the first category of costsis the big one So lets concentrate on that            Where do you get all thoseresources you own and consume Some you create those dont cost anybodyanything Some you trade for again those dont cost anybody anything Therest you inherit and those come from your siblings share That means yoursiblingsnot strangersbear most of the costs of your birth            Thats apoint thats often missed When people think about overcrowding oroverpopulation they typically imagine that if for example I had not beenborn everyone else would have a slightly bigger share of the pie But thatsnot right If I had not been born both my sisters would have substantiallybigger shares of the pie and everybody elses share would be exactly what itis now            So when parents are deciding whether to have a thirdfourth or fifth child they are generally more conscious of the costs than ofthe benefits Most of the costs are imposed on their other beloved childrenwhile many of the benefits are dispersed among strangers            When a decisionmaker is moreconscious of costs than of benefits he tends to make decisions that are overlyconservative That almost surely means that parents have fewer children than issocially desirable and that therefore the population grows too slowly Mydaughter is an only child which makes me part of the problem            Somewherethere is a young lady whose life has been impoverished by my failure to sirethe son who would someday sweep her off her feet If I cared as much about thatyoung lady as I do about my own daughter Id have produced that son Butbecause I selfishly acted as if other peoples children are less important thanmy own I stopped reproducing too soon            Population growth is like pollution in reverseThe owner of a polluting steel mill weighs all its benefits that is hisprofits against only a portion of its costs he counts his expenses but notthe neighbors health Therefore he overproduces Parents weigh allor atleast mostof the costs of an additional child resources diverted from theirother children against only a portion of the benefits they count their ownlove for their children but not others love for their children Thereforethey under produce            This argument seems tosuggest that I should have had more children for the sake of strangers Asecond completely separate argument says I should have had more children forthe sake of those children themselves Presumably theyd have been grateful forthe gift of life Im not sure how far to push that argument Theres obviouslynothing close to a consensus on how to assign rights to the unborn so we canhardly hope for a consensus on how to assign rights to the unconceived But thesecond argument does tend to buttress the first            Personally I ignored botharguments when I selfishly limited the size of my family I understandselfishness But I cant understand encouraging others to be selfishwhich is the entire purpose of organizations like Zero Population GrowthInstead we should look for ways to subsidize reproduction A world with manypeople offers more potential friends who share our interests more small actsof kindness between strangers and a better chance of finding love Thats thekind of world we owe our children
