              well were just starting a family through adoption so i dont really have a lot of um concrete um opinions just what i know out of my peer group uh has gone through and none of its been good   oh really   yeah uh the ones that can afford to have live in nannies they seem to be having an okay time   huh uhhuh   uh but a lot of the other ones that have are professional um id say fifty percent of you know my peers that im in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until theyre you know going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade   umhum   uh but i there must be some good service out there if you really look and pay for it   right what what age child are you thinking in in terms of   in terms of what theyre talking about   no for for yourselves   oh infant um   oh okay so youre starting from the baseline  from the baseline   infant yeah after eleven years of marriage yeah we are were actually its happening now so were just going through the process   i see   so and and actually the question is uh very appropriate because im not sure whether um how strong the maternal instincts going to be they tell me its going to be strong do you have children   right i have one son   and did you put him in day care or is he older now or younger or   well hes now hes now eighteen and in in you know has completed a couple of years of university   sure so hes out of day care   i right and and so that but i was working fulltime uh when he was born but i was very lucky because i was a a college professor   you uhhuh oh   and so i was able to you know and i it was walking distance from my from my apartment so i went up there and i sort of left him with with a neighbor   flex yeah umhum   and i left him in a carry cot when he was very little and i said you know he doesnt need anything except you know look look at him if he cries but you know dont pick him up and and this sort of stuff because i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half   yeah oh thats wonderful   and i was able to you know get his his schedule just uh cooperated and   right thats wonderful yeah and and i guess um that uh because of your um your uh profession i mean i um im in corporate communications but ive done freelance writing in the past   yeah uhhuh   so what were hoping is that um i mean my husband thinks i can do it ive just never worked out of a domestic base you know ive always been in a corporate uh environment   umhum   um but im hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or parttime or if they dont have that um my boss im very lucky though again too my boss is very akin to family building so i think thats something that something that couples need in going into this   umhum right   um i dont know i do think theres good day care out there what part of the country are you in   im in Maryland but but i was out of the country when um my my son was little but but the thing is if you have this flextime and that you might be able to do something similar to what i did which is   youre in Maryland right thats what im hoping   you know be there short times and then later on when he was you know i mean this were talking about uh i went back to work and or taught some some classes like a week after he was born   umhum oh my goodness you were fortunate yeah   and so yeah and so thats when i was saying you know dont dont pick him up and stuff but then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house   yeah umhum sure   and she was she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the babys laundry and this sort of stuff   uhhuh   and then i also came home and sort of was was able to see from a distance what she was doing and you know in a sense she she carried him around a lot too much uh you know for for my taste it was constantly no i dont want him to explore anything he might   uhhuh uhhuh right     uh he might hurt himself   so do you think that i mean do you think that that was in a way though good objectivity good objectivity that now thats doesnt really thats not a correct English but um you know in a sense you see what im saying though from a mothers standpoint i mean in a way it it was quote unquote good objectivity objectivity     i think it worked out very well a very well because what he learned to do by the time he was   umhum   two or so he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers or writing lesson plans and he had asked for a paper and you know sort of scribble and then he realized that there were quiet times and there were active times   see umhum yeah right and then he learned he he also learned that um there were times that you had to be gone so you probably minimized well were actually um were getting ready i mean youre far enough away now i can tell you this just locally i make sure were going to Romania in a few weeks   oh   and thats um just   did you say Romania or Armenia   Romania Romania   oh okay yeah yeah   as in like what  and um but we were real excited because weve just developed a contact   oh good   through professional people and its private and its hospital its were just very excited um   oh great   and well it it whats the word im looking for when you deal with issues like that um in terms of family building through adoption um and then you have people responding to you well if you go through that why would you put them in day care   oh thats silly   um issues are being raised prematurely in my mind but i guess theyre not because its something ill have to deal with sooner than later um and i what ive learned to do is just tune out everybodys opinion i feel that if the childs healthy um you know as long as we make it feel secure id love to do something like with what you did   umhum   um i dont think i could be a dumper where i could take it from you know eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there   right right   uh maybe after two or three or  years old i dont know um   oh i  in my opinion its even then i mean uh kids need you   but yeah i just well they need a schedule i think i dont think the United States what country were you um in Europe when you were uh uh   no i was in the Middle East   um oh thats sort of well thats the same thing i mean i dont know how they are there but uh in eastern Europe my stepfathers from England it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or geriatrics or elder care as i call it   right right   um and were just not set up for that um with the   i yeah   go ahead   no i was just going to say i guess uh my sensitivities are are much more with the you know to be at home because actually i had my grandmother with me fro m the time she was from the time she was ninety two until she died at ninety seven   umhum see i think thats wonderful   and i mean that was recently after my son son was going off and i mean yes in a sense i went to work and she was at home alone some of the time but but still you know it was much better than being shipped   uhhuh to a   to a day care center   right   you know which is much my feelings on kids and the elderly i think were too were too too much towards its somebody elses problem you know i want to work shove them in in some school for twelve hours a day   we cast off right right that im that way yeah right its easier and i agree with that thats why i you you know what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown but you can probably empathize with this   yeah   its amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts   right right   in terms of what to do um and i just dont think there is a day a good day care system um my company im particularly fortunate that they have theyre in tune with that but ive been at companies where um you know the decision the the trend is or the definite mood is well we made conscious decisions not to have children   and thats sad   you know and in and a couple like us building through adoption there its almost radical to some people   right   and what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out and um and i respect there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they you know they may have the need for child care like that   umhum   but i agree with you that its just i call it dumping  i mean i   yeah no i i think that certainly there is a role uh for this type of help and and as long as one can can supervise it and and you know make it work   umhum   into into ones own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or uh giving it you know the whole job to somebody else to take care of   umhum then yeah its are its in tandem then   and yeah yeah   i just um and there are tradeoffs too i think one of the things that is a problem is that um in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers   umhum   um its just you know its so low but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis its prohibitive and some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year   yeah   um   actually there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood is there seem there are several uh uh mothers mothers who stay home   really umhum   and they take you know its probably not completely legal uh i maybe its legal up to one or two additional kids   sure   but and they they take care of another child and i i can actually name could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this   uhhuh and they yeah   and i mean thats another possibility and you know you might want to stay home one year and some other lady might want to stay home for a a few years and   i havent thought about that yeah and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old and shes an at home parttime paralegal so im thinking hm  and we get along fantastically so im thinking you know and thats the way you have to um how was im just real curious how was the Middle East in terms of that with children   yeah yeah   is that is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them   no well actually there was a day care center um where my son did go for a year i think from when he was two to three   umhum   but then he actually started kindergarten at age three   umhum   and so and it you know it wasnt like pre kindergarten it was real kindergarten   oh really he must be smart yeah   yeah so he was he was ready to to go to school at that point   umhum   but yeah theyre they do have such facilities but for the most part uh the with the extended family you know you can usually find somebody which is much like our neighbor you know to sharing responsibility and im and also there arent that many women who who do who work   uhhuh the professional yeah i was wondering about that um there im in Dallas and there was just a very big um series about Moslem women and   yeah umhum   there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts im digressing here but uh i was just real curious when you said Middle East if you didnt mind me asking   yeah no no and i didnt mean Israel so you you assumed right   oh no thats okay  well even if you did thats okay actually i think   well no because at first thought uh when i said uh you know i said that not many people work im im thinking oh well shes going to you know because certainly in Israel the women do work   right right they fight they work
