                       HitlersWilling Historiographers                        In Goldhagens WillingExecutioners his review of my A Nation on Trial hereafterANOT  Adam Shatz suggests that I am a mirror image of Daniel GoldhagenMy essay is equally biased and inflammatory he writes and whereas Goldhagendelivered a fierce attack on the Germans my own essay is effectively anapologia for them            Before turning to Shatzsspecific criticisms I want to remind readers of the approach I adopted in myanalysis of Goldhagens book Throughout I simply juxtapose Goldhagens claimsagainst the sources he cites or compare his claims to the standard mainstreamscholarly findings Until Shatzs review no one disputed my account of thescholarly record Indeed his vehement criticisms of my essay notwithstandingGoldhagen himself does not accuse me of misrepresenting current scholarlywisdom Thus Shatzs altogether novel critique merits close scrutiny            Shatz reports thatFinkelstein acknowledges the Nazi state was a brutal dictatorship but heglosses over its disturbingly popular character            What canShatz possibly mean Goldhagen claims that the Nazi regime was on the wholeconsensual and that Germans generally accepted the system and Hitlersauthority as desirable and legitimate I report that according to Goldhagensown main authority Robert Gellately fear was prevalent among the Germanpeople and that to pretend otherwise is foolish  ANOT   Clearlythe principal question however is how central was antiSemitism to what Shatzcalls the disturbingly popular character of the Nazi state I quote thistypical passage from Goldhagens main source Ian Kershaw            AntiSemitism despite itspivotal place in Hitlers world view was of only secondary importance incementing the bonds between Fuhrer and people which provided the Third Reichwith its popular legitimation and basis of plebiscitary acclamation At thesame time the principle of excluding the Jews from German society was itselfwidely and increasingly popular and Hitlers hatred of the Jewsbaleful inits threats but linked to the condoning of lawful rational action not theunpopular crude violence and brutality of the Partys gutter elementswascertainly an acceptable component of his popular image even if it was anelement taken on board rather than forming a centrally motivating factor formost Germans            I add that according toKershaw during the s  when his popularity was soaring to dizzyheights Hitler was extremely careful to avoid public association with thegenerally unpopular pogromtype antiSemitic outrages  ANOT              Shatz is surely within hisright to question these findings But he ought to have directed his ire not atme but at the leading authorities on the subject Gellately who was justappointed to the Holocaust chair at Clark University and Kershaw author ofthe forthcoming twovolume biography of Hitler            Shatz alleges thatantiSemitism permeated Nazi ideology and Finkelstein is deaf to itsnuances Thus he proposes that antiSemitism was crucial to Hitlers rise topower Citing a raft of scholarly studies I report the consensus thatantiSemitism did not figure centrally in Hitlers electoral successes in and thereafter  ANOT   I also note the scholarly consensus thatbeginning in the sto quote Saul Friedlander in his authoritativestudy  Nazi Germany and the Jews the Jewish theme did become lessfrequent in Hitlers rhetoric Finally I report that a careful review ofMax Domarus standard collection of Hitlers public pronouncements and speechesshows that during these years the main negative theme was antiMarxism andantiSocial Democracy  ANOT    Shatz seems to believe that he hasscooped all the experts in the field with his clever insight that the Nazisperceived Social Democracy as a Jewish party and Marxism as a Jewish creedThe scholarly question however is why did Hitler tone down the explicitlyJewish theme if not because it didnt resonate well with the German publicShatz doesnt answer this question indeed he cant even comprehend it ToGoldhagens credit he never gainsays this commonplace of the scholarlyliterature Unlike Shatz he is familiar enough with the discipline to knowthat it would be preposterous to do so            According to ShatzFinkelstein deduces from some Germans disgust at the destruction of Jewishlives and property during Nazisponsored pogroms such as Kristallnacht thatGermans overwhelmingly condemned the Nazi antiSemitic atrocities If theydid they gave new meaning to the term silent majority             Of all Shatzs distortionsthis is the most outrageous Where does he get his reading of KristallnachtHeres where mine comes from In assessing the popular German reaction to Naziviolence generally and Kristallnacht in particular I quoted Goldhagensauthoritative scholarly source Israeli historian David Bankier as well asKershaw            During the first years ofNazi antiSemitic incitement says Bankier most Germans large sectorsthe bulk sizable parts found the form of persecution abhorrentexpressed misgivings about the brutal methods employed remained on thesidelines severely condemned the persecution etc With the revival of NaziantiSemitic terror in  large sections of the population were repelled bythe Sturmer methods and refused to comply with demands to take action againstthe Jews Indeed the vast majority of the population approved the Nuremberglaws not only because they identified with the racialist policy butespecially because a permanent framework of discrimination had been createdthat would end the reign of terror and set precise limits to antisemiticactivities Sturmer methods and the violence in the years  met withthe same disapproval as in the past The overwhelming majority approvedsocial segregation and economic destruction of the Jews on the eve ofKristallnacht in  but not the outbursts of brute force  It was notJewhatred in the Nazi sense All sections of the population Bankierfurther reports reacted with shock to Kristallnacht There were fewoccasions if any in the Third Reich Kershaw similarly recalls whichproduced such a widespread wave of revulsion reaching deep into the ranksof the Nazi party itself The motives behind these outpourings of populardisgust to be sure were not unalloyed Some Germans evinced moral outrageSome recoiled from the sheer brutality of the violence which also defacedGermanys image Some opposed the destruction only because it squanderedmaterial resources  ANOT              The opinions Shatz ascribesto me are simply the scholarly consensus Significantly he adduces not a jotof counterevidence for his novel claim that only some Germans opposedKristallnacht Alas there is none Shatz also violently dissents from thescholarly consensus on civilian German attitudes toward Jews during World WarII Yet again however he cites precisely zero evidence to support hisobjections            Tosustain his claim that my essay is effectively an apologia Shatz substitutesappeals to popular prejudice for scholarship Shatz calls me Goldhagensdoppelganger It would seem that this honorific more properly belongs tohim             Norman GFinkelstein Brooklyn NY                           AdamShatz replies                        In his reply NormanFinkelsteins modus operandi is to cite authority and where he cannot hidebehind authority he distorts the points I made in my review He insinuatesthat Im a friend of Daniel Goldhagen even though I made my hostility toGoldhagens views amply clear elsewhere in the review But Finkelsteinsattempt to tar me with the brush of Goldhagenism is telling To Finkelsteinanyone who views German antiSemitism as in any way significant to the historyof National Socialism is an accomplice of Goldhagen             Nowhere in my review do I argue thatantiSemitism was crucial to Hitlers rise to power Rather I argue that itcannot be blithely discounted as is Finkelsteins wont In wooing Germanvoters the Nazis did tone down their antiSemitism emphasizing instead theirnationalist and antiBolshevik credentials But unlike Finkelstein I see achange in degree not in kind AntiSemitism remained a constant theme of Naziideology which associated Jews with the ills of modern capitalisminternationalism socialism and the Versailles Treaty While its true thatGermans were often alienated by violent expressions of antiSemitism enough ofthem were willing to look past Nazi rhetoric about the Jewish problem to makethe Nazis Germanys most significant mass party As Ian Kershaw writes in thepassage cited by Finkelstein antiSemitism was an acceptable component ofHitlers popular image In recent years a similar development has occurredin France where JeanMarie Le Pen of the National Front has softened hisantiArab racism in order to attract more votes Employing Finkelsteins logicone would have to argue racism hasnt really figured in Le Pens surge inpopularity But its a distinction without a differencemore and more votersare backing a party known for its racist program Its a wonder thatFinkelstein doesnt see how damning this is But then Finkelstein findsreassurance in Goldhagens observation that  of  antiSemitic ideologuesadvocated the annihilation of the Jews One would perhaps also want to notethat an overwhelming majority did not Finkelstein writes             Finkelsteinsinterpretation of Kristallnacht is not simply the scholarly consensus Whileevoking German outrage at such statesponsored pogroms the historians DavidBankier and Kershaw do not conclude that the Germans overwhelmingly condemnedthe Nazi antiSemitic atrocities Where does Finkelstein find evidence of suchcondemnation Were there such protests as later surrounded the euthanasiaprograms for the retarded Were Germans moved to speak out against the popularlegal restrictions on Jewish rights In a study much cited by FinkelsteinHitler Germans and the Jewish Question historian Sarah Gordon writesthat Most Germans were apathetic to the persecution of the Jews and no studypast or future can ever change that fact One does not have to acceptGoldhagens views to see that the Germans disgust at Kristallnacht seldomresulted in action on behalf of their Jewish neighbors            Finally does Finkelstein suppose that a brutal dictatorship cannot also be apopular one As most historians have recognized Hitlers triumphs in foreignpolicy and the economy earned him the admiration of many if not most GermansIf the Nazi state had rested only on coercion its doubtful that Hitler couldhave persuaded millions of Germans to remain loyal to him and to fightheroically to the end of the war As Kershaw writes in the passage quoted byFinkelstein the Nazi state enjoyed a certain popular legitimation and basisof plebiscitary acclamation Although antiSemitism was less significant thannationalism and antiBolshevism to the Nazis mass appeal Hitler and his peerswere able to execute the Final Solution because they could count on theallegiance and sometimes even the love of the German people To be sureGoldhagens vision of a consensual dictatorship glosses over the repressionof the labor movement the killing and imprisonment of Hitlers opponents ButFinkelsteins view of a Nazi terror state forcing its programs on a helplesspeople is equally onesided The Nazis were homegrown populists even if theirwish to murder Jews was not widely shared by Germans and the Germans must inturn bear some of the responsibility for the horrors the Nazis inflicted                           Editors noteGoldhagensWilling Executioners incorrectly stated that the Canadian Jewish Congressis trying to have Ruth Bettina Birn coauthor of A Nation on Trial TheGoldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth  removed from her job at the warcrimes division at the Canadian Department of Justice The Canadian JewishCongress did contact the department with its concerns about Birns involvementin the book But the CJC has lodged no formal complaint against Birn                                       GrossMonica Product
