back into the islands historyCarnavalFor ten days each year Carnaval is the time when thousands of Canarios celebrate the spring Shops and businesses close and young and old flood the streets in fancy dress dancing to pulsating Latin rhythmsVillages and groups of one kind or another dress according to chosen themes with magnificent and often outrageous costumes that can take a whole year to put together Bands and dancers mingle with the elaborate floats Tourists are treated with goodnatured humor and many don masks and costumes to join in the fun The music and dancing continue until late with parties everywhereCarnaval is biggest and best in Santa Cruz and Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife and in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria where it has all the razzmatazz of Rios Carnaval and the Mardi Gras of New Orleans Visitors come from all over the world for these events and hotels are often full so book well ahead if you plan to visit at this time of yearCorpus ChristiAfter Carnaval this is the most spectacular celebration on the islands though it is of a completely different natureAs an act of devotion at this religious time colored volcanic sand colored salt or flower petals are painstakingly arranged on central paved areas to make up enormous artworks in the form of either elaborate abstract patterns or religious pictures possibly copied from an Old Master The most extravagant are to be seen in La Orotava and La Laguna on Tenerife but Las Palmas on Gran Canaria and many other towns and villages throughout the islands also participate The pictures are ruined sometimes in a matter of moments by the feet of the ensuing procession and certainly by the first rainfall Only photographs preserve the memory of months of hard workColorful fiestas of song and dance food and wine known as Romeras follow hard on the heels of Corpus Christi to redress the sobrietyFor ChildrenWith almost guaranteed sunshine soft sandy beaches and lots of amusement options off the

main resorts stock cameras calculators watches perfume jewelry leather goods spirits and tobaccoin fact all the things that you can buy in airport dutyfree shops Aside from spirits and local tobacco however there are few real bargainsBest BuysSpirits and tobacco are the best bargains Local brands of spirits are the cheapest though rarely of high quality and most international brands are also bargains Local cigarettes are fairly rough but cigar smokers can find both price and quality The cigars of La Palma in particular draw high praiseFor the really keen shopper uncut gems silver jewelry silks leatherwear and furs may be of interestIndian Bazaars Many of the shops selling luxury goods are owned by Indian entrepreneurs Generally prices are flexible and haggling is accepted as part of the shopping process You may assume that this is the case in any shop where prices are not markedMercados The most colorful shopping opportunities in the Canaries are at the openair markets usually held on Sunday mornings The Sunday morning rastro flea market near the port in Las Palmas is particularly good and the Mercado de Nuestra Seora de Africa at Santa Cruz de Tenerife is recommended at
