                    Background        The cysteineloop family of ligand gated ion channels        LGIC is comprised of receptors with pentameric quaternary        structure and at least two ligand binding sites present at        the subunit interfaces      This receptor family is        characterized by the presence of a critical disulfide loop        structure within the binding site and an integral ion        selective channel LGIC receptors are found in both the        peripheral and central nervous systems Members of this        family include the acetylcholine receptors      the        amino butyric acid type A receptor GABA         A R     and the glycine receptor        GlyR            The first subunit of the HT          R was cloned in      The        sequence of this subunit was shown to be highly homologous        to LGIC receptors and thus identified the HT          R receptor as another member of this        superfamily       Similar to other LGIC receptors        more than one subtype has been identified Two splice        variants of an A subunit long and short forms and a        single B subunit have been cloned        Both        the long and short forms of the A subunit are capable of        forming functional homomeric receptors HT         AL R and HT         AS R although some differences between        an agonist and partial agonist activity have been observed            A third subtype is formed by a combination of the        A and B subunits to produce a heteromeric receptor of        unknown stoichiometry     Heteromeric receptors are        pharmacologically and functionally distinct from the        homomeric HT         AL and HT         AS receptors            HT          Rs are distributed throughout the        central and peripheral nervous system playing a        significant role in phenomenon such as anxiety emesis and        alcoholism Antagonists to HT          Rs are clinically efficacious in the        treatment of chemotherapyinduced emesis    and recent        studies on human subjects have suggested their potential        application in the treatment of early onset alcoholism                    Hibert         et al proposed an early model for the        antagonist pharmacophore of the HT          R     According to this model        all HT          R antagonists contain an aromatic        ring a carbonyl oxygen or bioisosteric equivalent and a        basic nitrogen According to Hiberts model the basic        nitrogen is located A from the centre of the aromatic        ring and approximately A above plane of the ring The        carbonyl oxygen and the aromatic ring are coplanar and        separated by a distance of A Recent studies have        expanded on this model to include another lipophilic region        and a second hydrogen bonding interaction two atoms away        from the first       A compound that contains all        five pharmacophoric regions was synthesized by Orjales         et al     This compound        phenylmethylpiperizinyl benzimidazole or        lerisetron is shown in figure and is a potent HT          R antagonist Functional groups on        this compound capable of forming interactions with the        receptor are the distal amino group a benzimidazole and a        benzyl group in the N position of the benzimidazole While        Lerisetron contains no carbonyl group the second nitrogen        contained in the benzimidazole heterocycle could act as        bioisostere of this functional group     Orjales        demonstrated the importance of the Nbenzyl group by        synthesizing several N substituted analogs of Lerisetron        Removal of the Nbenzyl group produced a fold decrease        in affinity indicating a role for this group in        interacting with the HT          R Other studies have supported this        observation and suggest a more specific electrostatic        interaction            While structureactivity relationship studies and        molecular modeling have led to the development of a        detailed pharmacophore model determining specific point        interactions between HT          antagonists and binding site amino        acids has proven difficult Mutagenesis studies have        identified the interaction of amino acids W and R in        the binding of HT          R ligands      Studies        conducted in our laboratory have identified three        additional putative binding site residues Y Y and        Y     W and R are present in a conserved        region of LGIC receptors often referred to as loop D             Similarly Y Y and Y are located in the        region homologus to E loop region of nicotinic AchR        In this study we have endeavoured to identify the amino        acids interacting with the different functional groups        present on the lerisetron molecule in order to develop a        model for interaction of this compound with the HT          R Using site directed mutagenesis in        combination with analogs of lerisetron we have identified        amino acids that appear to interact selectively with the        terminal amino group the Nbenzyl group and the aromatic        benzimidazole                    Results                  Functional activity of lerisetron          Whole cell patchclamp experiments were performed to          test the functional activity of lerisetron No response          was observed when lerisetron was applied alone data not          shown When coapplied with HT lerisetron inhibited          the absolute magnitude of the response with no apparent          alteration of the response profile Figure  The          combination of several identical inhibition experiments          produced a K           i value of    nM for          lerisetron inhibition of the HT induced response These          data correspond well with previously reported data for          this compound    and verify the competitive          antagonist action of lerisetron Analogs of lerisetron          have been shown to inhibit HT            Rs in a similar manner                              Importance of the Nbenzyl and distal piperazine          nitrogen to binding of lerisetron          The K           i value for lerisetron inhibition of           Hgranisetron binding to wildtype receptors was          determined to be    nM Figure and Table           This value agrees with previously published data for this          compound The K           i values for analogs  and  under          identical conditions are    nM and    nM          respectively Figure A Table  The observed change in          K           i represents the decreases in binding          energy resulting from removal of the Nbenzyl group          analog  and the distal piperazine nitrogen analog                                    Identification of amino acids interacting with          Lerisetron          In order to determine the nature of the amino acids          interacting with the distal amino and Nbenzyl groups of          lerisetron we constructed HT           AS Rs containing mutations at W          R Y Y and Y Figure shows inhibition of           Hgranisetron binding by lerisetron on wildtype and          mutant receptors For most amino acids an alanine          substitution was constructed in order to effectively          remove any amino acid interaction with the ligand For          W an alanine substitution has been shown to prevent          binding of  Hgranisetron therefore a less severe          mutation was constructed          The WF mutation produces a fold change in K           d for  Hgranisetron binding             nM and the WY mutation produces a fold change in          K           d    nM Mutation of amino          acid R to alanine produced a fold change in K           d for  Hgranisetron binding             nM Table  These data agree well with previously          reported values     Alanine mutations at the          tyrosine positions Y Y and Y also produced          minor increases in K           d for  Hgranisetron binding             nM    nM and    nM respectively             Table           Only small changes in K           i for lerisetron were observed for the          YA mutation while the YA and YA mutations          produced large increases in the K           i Table and Figure  For WF and          WY the changes in K           i observed for lerisetron were much          smaller than for the alanine mutations at YA and          YA as would be expected for the less severe nature of          these mutations The changes were however significant p            in both cases and are similar to the changes          in K           d reported for  Hgranisetron The          increase in K           i on the WF mutant receptor was             fold and the increase in K           i on the WY receptor was             fold The RA mutant produced an increase in K           i of    fold as compared to the          wildtype receptor These data indicated potential          interactions of lerisetron with W R Y and          Y                          Mutation of W          As mentioned above the lack of  Hgranisetron          binding to WA mutant receptors necessitated the use of          WF and WY mutations to analyze functional group          interactions The effects of these mutations on the K           i for analogs  and  are shown in          figure B Cand Table  Analog  inhibited           Hgranisetron binding to WF receptors with a K           i of    nM    fold          increase p   and WY receptors with a K           i of    nM    fold          increase p   This reflects a significant          increase in K           i and reflects a potential interaction          of analog  with W The strength of this interaction is          apparently similar to the strength of the interaction          with  Hgranisetron and lerisetron since the magnitude          of the change is similar in both cases Analog  also          showed a significant increase in K           i as a result of the WF and WY          mutations The magnitude of the change for WF             fold p   was similar to that observed for          lerisetron and analog  The WY mutation produced a             fold change in K           i p   Thus all three          compounds appear to form similar interactions with          W                          Mutation of R          Mutation of R to alanine RA resulted in a          significant but small increase in K           i for lerisetron of    fold p            Figure Dshows the inhibition of           Hgranisetron binding by analogs  and  at RA mutant          receptors No significant change in K           i was observed on these receptors for          either analog     fold or analog              fold Table  as compared to the wildtype          receptor                          Mutation of Y          Mutation of Y to alanine produced one of the          largest observed changes in K           i for lerisetron Figure and Table           The K           i obtained for lerisetron was             nM reflecting a change of    fold compared to          wildtype receptors The K           i value for analog  in contrast          increased only    fold p   as a result          of this mutation Figure Eand Table  The K           i for analog  showed a similar change          of    fold p   While these K           i values are significantly different          from wildtype values for each analog the lack of larger          effects suggests that neither analog  nor analog  bind          as strongly as lerisetron to Y                          Mutation of Y          The YA mutation showed the most variability in its          effects on K           i values for lerisetron analog  and          analog  Figure  Figure Fand Table  Lerisetron          inhibited  Hgranisetron binding with a K           i value of    an increase of             fold compared to wildtype values The K           i value for analog  increased from             nM wildtype to    M This change of             fold is slightly smaller but not significantly          different from the relative change observed for          lerisetron The K           i for analog  increased from             M on wildtype to    M on YA mutant          receptors    fold increase The increase observed          for analog  was significantly less than that observed          for both lerisetron and analog  The smaller change in K                    i for analog  suggests that analog           binds weakly to Y while lerisetron and analog  bind          more tightly                            Discussion                  Functional group interactions of W          The WF mutation produced a significant increase in K                    i for all three compounds The          magnitude of the change was similar in all cases In          addition the increase in K           i was identical to the increase in K           d that has been observed for           Hgranisetron binding on this mutant              Alterations in K           i resulting from the WY mutation          were slightly less however the change was again the same          for lerisetron analog  and analog  These data suggest          that all three compounds form binding site interactions          with W The interaction between lerisetron and W is          unlikely to be via the Nbenzyl functional group since          the K           i for analog  was also altered by          this mutation The same argument can be made for the          distal piperazine nitrogen since the K           i for analog  also increased The          portion of the molecule common to all three compounds          the aromatic benzimidazole is thus the most likely point          of interaction for W                          Functional group interactions of R          The RA mutation increased the K           i value for lerisetron inhibition of           Hgranisetron binding by  fold This is a moderately          small change for an alanine mutation particularly          considering that the smallest change in K           i for removal of a functional group on          lerisetron the Nbenzyl group was  fold It is          therefore likely that this interaction is either          extremely weak or the change in K           i is the result of a structural change          in the binding site Previous studies concluded that R          was an important interaction for the HT            R agonist hydroxytryptamine          HT since the K           i for HT inhibition increased over           fold as a result of the RA mutation     A          change in K           d for  Hgranisetron binding to RA          was also observed In order to determine whether the          Nbenzyl or distal piperazine nitrogen of lerisetron was          involved in an interaction with R we tested both          analog  and  on RA mutant receptors No change in K           i was observed for either compound          This result makes it much more difficult to assign the          correct functional group to this amino acid since it          suggests that one or both of the compounds is no longer          binding the receptor in precisely the same manner as          lerisetron Considering the small change observed for          lerisetron binding as a result of this mutation even a          slight reorientation of the molecule in the binding site          could result in the loss of this interaction                          Functional group interactions of Y          The K           i values for inhibition of           Hgranisetron binding by analogs  and  were altered          only slightly by the YA mutation The magnitude of the          increase in K           i for lerisetron however was          considerably larger  fold and is indicative of an          important interaction of the compound with Y The lack          of a large change in K           i for both analogs makes it difficult          to interpret this data since one or both of the compounds          appears to be interacting differently with the binding          site than lerisetron          Analogs  and  differ from each other both in the          functional groups contained in the molecule and their          structural similarity to lerisetron Analog  is most          similar in overall structure The substitution of oxygen          for the distal amino nitrogen alters the potential          interactions formed at this position but is likely to          have a small effect on the overall size and shape of the          molecule Analog  is far less similar to lerisetron and          more similar to the HT            R antagonist granisetron Previous          studies have shown that the binding of granisetron is not          affected by the YA mutation     Analog  may bind          more similar to granisetron than lerisetron and thus          would be unaffected by mutations at Y This is less          likely to be the case with analog           The strength of the putative interaction at Y can          be identified by examining the change in binding of          lerisetron as a result of the YA mutation The YA          mutation produced a  fold change in K           i  This change reflects the binding          energy lost as a result of the alanine substitution The          observed change in Ki on wt receptors is much larger than          that observed for removal of the Nbenzyl group           fold but is similar to that observed for substitution          of the distal amino nitrogen in analog   fold          Taken together with the close structural similarity of          analog  to lerisetron it can be concluded that          comparison of analog  and lerisetron should provide the          best means of identifying the interaction at Y No          change in K           i was observed for analog  as a          result of the YA mutation indicating a lack of any          significant interaction of this compound with Y These          data support our hypothesis that Y interacts with the          distal piperazine nitrogen of lerisetron A second amino          acid may also be involved since the change in K           i for lerisetron binding as a result          of the YA mutation was smaller than the change          produced by substitution of the piperazine nitrogen As          described below one candidate for this second amino acid          is Y                          Functional group interactions of Y          The YA mutation produced increases in K           i for all three compounds although the          magnitude of the change differed The increases in the K           i values were  fold for lerisetron           fold for analog  and only  fold for analog  Thus          analog  retains much of its ability to interact with          Y despite the absence of the Nbenzyl group while          analog  interacts more weakly with this amino acid          Since the K           i for analog  is increased by the          YA mutation it is unlikely that the Nbenzyl group          interacts with Y The small change in K           i for analog  supports a partial          interaction of Y with the distal piperazine nitrogen          although some interaction with another group is also          apparent This other group would be expected to be in          close proximity to the distal nitrogen The most likely          candidate is the other nitrogen of the piperazine ring          Thus YA may form a partial interaction with both          piperazine nitrogens                            Conclusions        Figure shows a hypothetical model of the        lerisetronbinding site supported by our observations The        model illustrates the secondary structure of the region of        the receptor from Y  Y in a loop configuration This        structure is supported by sitedirected mutagenesis data           as well as structural predictions obtained from other        LGIC receptors     The recent determination of the        structure of a nicotinic acetylcholine binding protein           that shares significant homology with the LGIC family        also supports a loop structure in this part of the protein        The region from W through Y is shown as a sheet as        has been hypothesized based on sitedirected mutagenesis        studies of this strand of the HT          R     Our data indicate the        functional groups of lerisetron that may interact with W        R Y and Y        W is shown interacting with the aromatic benzimidazole        group of lerisetron although the precise position of W        relative to this group is not known The W interaction        with this group is supported by the observed increase in K         i for lerisetron analog  and analog         Since the benzimidazole group is common to all three        compounds it is the most likely point of interaction W        also represents a common interaction in the binding site        for both lerisetron and Hgranisetron        Y is shown interacting with the distal piperazine        nitrogen possibly through a cation interaction This        orientation of an amino group interacting with an aromatic        amino acid in a cation interaction has been shown for the        nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and has been hypothesized        for many LGIC receptors        This conclusion        is based on both the magnitude of the change observed on        the wild type receptor for removal of the amino group         fold compared to the effect of the YA mutation on        lerisetron binding  fold and the lack of any major        change in K         i for analog  as a result of this        mutation Our data does not support an interaction of this        amino acid with either the Nbenzyl or benzimidazole        portions of lerisetron        Y is shown positioned between the two piperazine        nitrogens This conclusion is supported by the smaller        increase in K         i for analog   fold compared to        that observed for lerisetron  fold These results        suggest a partial interaction of Y with the distal        piperazine nitrogen Since some change was observed a        second interaction is also likely The functional group in        closest proximity to the distal piperazine nitrogen is the        other nitrogen on the piperazine ring Another possibility        would be the Nbenzyl interaction however since the YA        mutation also produced a large increase in K         i for analog  this conclusion is not        supported by our data        R is shown as interacting with the Nbenzyl group        This is a difficult conclusion to make considering the        small effect of the RA mutation on lerisetron binding        The interaction is included in the model based on        structural information obtained from the crystal structure        of AChBP     The region of this protein homologous to        loop E and loop D of the HT         A receptor suggests a loop structure        from Y to Y and a residue turn containing a glycine        at position  and the strand from W through Y        oriented as shown in Figure  The orientation of        lerisetron between W and YA as shown would enable the        Nbenzyl group to be positioned in close proximity to R        If this is the case then a small alteration in position of        analog  or  in the binding site could result in the loss        of this presumably weak interaction The apparent        alterations in the binding site location of analog  would        be consistent with this hypothesis An alternate hypothesis        would place the Nbenzyl group in a different position        interacting with another amino acid either solely or in        concert with R        Our data support a binding site for lerisetron on the        HT          R that spans the D and E loop regions        Table shows the sequence alignment for the HT          R the  receptor and the AChBP for        these loops Sequence alignment of mouse HT          AR  nAchR and AChBP result in        alignment of the proposed D and E loop of the HT          AR with corresponding regions of the         nAchR and AChBP The amino acids W R Y Y and        Y of the HT          A R can be aligned with W Q        L R and M of the AChBP Figure  These amino        acids form a cluster in the proposed acetylcholine binding        domain of AChBP similar to that proposed in our model Both        loops have been identified on the complementary face of the        binding site of the nAChR It is unknown if lerisetron        utilizes amino acids on the principal face although none        have been identified The model for lerisetron binding will        be further refined as its interactions with other binding        site amino acids are investigated       Of        particular interest would be potential interactions of the        Nbenzyl group that would account for the decrease in        binding affinity of analog  Additional information gained        from comparison of our model with the recent crystal        structure of the AChBP demonstrates that lerisetron can be        roughly fit into the binding site such that all the        residues line up as shown in our model While this is not        direct evidence that the model is correct subsequent        molecular modeling of the data presented in this paper may        provide further support for our hypothesis Our current        model provides an initial working hypothesis that can form        the basis of further investigation Also while it is        unclear whether the information obtained in this study can        be extended to other HT          R ligands a similar approach would be        useful in identifying functional group interactions for        mCPBG HT dtC and granisetron                    Materials and Methods                  Mutagenesis          Wild type HT           AS mouse
