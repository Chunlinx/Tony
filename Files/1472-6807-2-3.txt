                    Background                  The state of blind protein structure          prediction          The communitywide experiment on methods to test          protein structure prediction CASP was first initiated          in  as a means of evaluating structure prediction          methods in a blind and rigourous manner     This was          motivated in part by claims in the literature of the          protein folding problem being solved without producing          tangible benefits since most of the solutions included          a strong dependence on the test set These experiments          evaluate prediction techniques by asking modellers to          construct models for a number of protein sequences before          the experimental result is known over a period of           months We have taken part in all four CASP experiments          including the most recent one CASP that finished in          December  httppredictioncenterllnlgov The CASP          results provide a benchmark as to what level of model          accuracy we can currently expect from our approaches          There are three primary categories of methods for          predicting protein structure from sequence comparative          modelling fold recognition and           ab initio prediction In the          comparative modelling and fold recognition categories          the methodologies rely on the presence of one or more          evolutionarily related template protein structures that          are used to construct a model the evolutionary          relationship can be deduced from sequence similarity                or by threading a sequence against a library of          structures and selecting the best match       For          both of these approaches a sequence alignment between          the target protein to be modelled and the evolutionarily          related protein with known structure is used to create          the initial or seed model In the           ab initio category there is no          strong dependence on database information and prediction          methods are based on general principles that govern          protein structure and energetics         The          categories vary in difficulty and consequently methods          in each of these categories produce models with different          levels of accuracy relative to the experimental          structures          Since the inception of CASP predictors all over the          world have built models for  proteins using the          methodologies described above Before the first CASP          experiment published results in comparative modelling in          the literature usually were obtained by applying          structure prediction methods in the context of the exact          experimental structure for example rebuilding side          chains on the native main chain or rebuilding regions          of main chain keeping the rest of the experimental          structure fixed This practice continues to this day           Ab initio methodologies          parameterised extensively on small test sets failed when          given novel types of sequences          CASP was an eyeopener in terms of understanding the          difficulty of making accurate predictions on approximate          templates in comparative modelling     The main          problems in creating a good comparative or fold          recognition model were related to alignment between the          template and target sequences and building of          nonconserved variable regions side chains and main          chain loops In the           ab initio category it appeared          that methods could not sample conformational space          accurately and select nativelike conformations for all          but very small fragments The highlight of CASP was the          recognition of threading as viable method for predicting          folds     and the success of neuralnetwork based          secondary structure prediction methods              The second CASP showed some improvement in two areas          In comparative modelling loops were being built better          and the use of handinspected alignments greatly          increased model accuracy     In the fold recognition          category alignments as well as prediction of folds          improved     The results in the           ab initio category remained          virtually unchanged except for one model of the          alphahelical protein NKLysin predicted to within            C            RMSD capturing the correct topology                       The third CASP saw consistent but little progress          relative to CASP in both comparative modelling and fold          recognition categories      but the most dramatic          results were observed in the           ab initio category Here multiple          groups predicted large parts of a few protein sequences          at a crude topological level within   C            RMSD for   residues                              Performance of our methods at CASP Comparative          modelling          Table shows a general estimate of how well our          comparative modelling prediction methods have performed          at different CASP experiments               Even though our methods produced mediocre results at          CASP we realised that a major problem with accurate          comparative modelling had to do with the interconnected          nature of protein structures     If a certain region          of the protein varied with respect to the homologue then          it was likely that a structurally interacting region          would also vary even if that region was conserved in          sequence We therefore developed a graphtheory based          approach to address this problem which demonstrated          significant progress in loop building at CASP Table               The CASP and CASP results are minor          improvements over the CASP results since the          enhancements made to the graph theory method have been          minimal                          Performance of methods at CASP Ab initio          prediction          In the           ab initio category as with          comparative modelling the first CASP experiments did not          live up to the results previously published in the          literature      It was not until CASP the first          time where we took part in this category that the first          consistent positive results were seen several groups          were able to predict the correct topologies for small          proteins or large fragments of a protein           residues to about   C            RMSD relative to the experimental          conformation                               CASP          The fourth CASP was held in December  CASP          demonstrated further improvement in our methodologies in          both comparative modelling and           ab initio prediction     Our          approaches combine a Monte Carlo procedure simulated          annealing genetic algorithms graph theory and          semiexhaustive searches with move sets consisting of          fragments and discrete state models and scoring          functions consisting of all atombased pairwise          functions hydrophobicity indices secondary structure          preferences and hydrogen bonding The goal was to          develop components that form a structure prediction          engine combining and innovating upon previously          developed approaches by observing what methods work well          at the previous CASP experiments and adding new          components of our own          We focus here on the results of our prediction          methodologies on all of the  sequences for which an          experimental answer was later available Unlike the          assessors evaluations at CASP which has recently          appeared in the special issue S of           Proteins Structure Function and          Genetics  which focus on how well a particular          group performs we treat CASP as a testbed for how well          an individual method performs Using the lessons learnt          from CASP successes and failures we suggest a unified          approach that mixes and matches between the best          predictions to produce the best results The aim of this          work is to illustrate when our prediction methods work          when they fail and what this means in the context of          building models for all proteins encoded by the genome of          an organism at the present time                            Results and Discussion                  What went right what went wrong                      Comparative modelling and fold recognition            Table compares all the predictions we made for            CASP using comparative modelling and fold recognition            methods The results are qualitatively assessed as            being one of excellent good useful and            failure In the comparative modelling category we            made  predictions for targets that had sequence            identities ranging from  to  to the nearest            related protein with known structure For  of these            proteins we produced models ranging from  to              root mean square deviation RMSD for the C              atoms between the model and the            corresponding experimental structure for all or large            parts of the protein with model accuracies scaling            fairly linearly with respect to sequence identity            ie the higher the sequence identity the better the            prediction These  proteins ranged in accuracy from            excellent to useful Figure shows some examples of            the comparative modelling predictions with different            difficulties made at CASP            The comparative modelling and fold recognition            targets are in Table are sorted by the difficulty            index The percentage identities for alignments between            several comparative modelling targets and their            corresponding templates fall in the twilight zone or            below alignments with percentage identities              In fact such targets belong more in the category            of fold recognition since it is clear that even a             identity alignment can easily result in a wrong fold            assignment The percentage identity is used for            illustration purposes onlyBLAST evalues follow a            similar trend but are most robust            Our comparative modelling methods produce excellent            models when the percentage identity between the target            and corresponding template sequence is high usually            within   C              RMSD for   identity In            several cases where the alignment falls into the            twilight zone  sequence identity models around              C              RMSD are produced Ttrpa            Tdhso Tspl Tmalk            In one case Tyeco the percentage identity            between the target and template proteins in the            alignment we used was  but we predict  residues            to within   C              RMSD However not all cases where            we assumed a homology relationship provided similar            results and the failures are indicated as F in Table                        While the graphtheory methods have been fairly            successful at handling the interconnectedness problem            to build nonconserved side chains and main chains                other major problems preventing the construction of            accurate comparative models have to do with inaccurate            alignments and using the template structure as a static            model upon which to build variable main chains In the            former case if a region of the alignment is incorrect            but is assumed to be correct then no amount of further            model building will fix this error In the latter case            the loop and side chain construction methods even if            interconnectedness is taken into account are limited            by the approximate nature of the template framework In            other words alignment errors are irrecoverable Even            though  of the regions of up to  residues we            thought would vary with respect to the parent homologue            structure were predicted to within   C              RMSD this is mostly in cases            where the approximate template is wellpredicted            within   C              RMSD                                    Ab initio prediction          Table compares all the predictions we made for CASP          using our           ab initio methods We made eleven          predictions for targets that had no detectable sequence          relationships when we began the modelling process We          produced nine models with accuracies ranging from  to            C            RMSD for  residue proteins or          large fragments of a protein Figure illustrates some          of our more successful predictions          At CASP we were consistently able to predict           residue consecutive fragments to within   and at          times to within   C            RMSD These results are much more          consistent than at CASP and are also of better          quality          While these predictions are a significant improvement          compared to the previous CASP results we still have to          make much progress before we can produce models rivalling          that of experiment in accuracy Given the range of RMSDs          for the population of conformations sampled ie          decoys for each of the proteins average range for the          eleven predictions was     C            RMSD for the entire protein and              C            RMSD when only the best fragments          are considered it is clear that devising          representations that will allow us to explore protein          conformational space such that nearnative conformations          are encountered is a major bottleneck Our filterbased          scoring function approach generally picks conformations          from the lower end of the RMSD distribution usually          within the top  and no worse than the  of the          conformations sampled but further improvements can be          made                          Caveats regarding the use of results from CASP          experiments                      Averaging over different methods and            contexts            The results provided by the CASP organisers and            assessors show how well a particular group did but do            not measure performance of individual methods in            separate contexts This makes it harder to determine            which methods work well and places an inherent penalty            on trying different nonconservative approaches For            example even successful loop and side chain building            methods will fail on comparative models based on            incorrect alignments in our case we tried six            different approaches in the three categories combined            the results for only two of which are listed in Figures            and  This problem has been alleviated to some            degree by the CAFASP experiment     which provides            a strict methodbymethod automatic evaluation but it            requires that models be prepared by the means of an            automated server in a relatively short timeframe            Ranking results by methods used based on keywords            provided when the model is submitted which could be            standardised and considering subsets of the target            relevant to particular methods would help            significantly in identifying the methods that work            best                                Subjective quality of evaluations            Once a certain evaluation measure is chosen then            evaluating all models submitted by that measure is            objective However particular methods appear to            perform better depending on the choice of evaluation            criteria used for example C              RMSD over a contiguous set of            residues which we prefer vs C              RMSD over noncontiguous            residues This illustrates the need for more than one            measure but even with that taken into account there            exists an inherent subjectivity in measurement            especially given the assessors visual evaluation of            the models during the CASP experiment one of the            authors of the paper ML was an assessor at CASP            The reason there is a problem is because the results            are not entirely clear ie the problem has not been            solved Until predictions with accuracies rivalling            that of experiment are made assessment of predictions            must be done automatically using limited and stringent            criteria most relevant to biologists interested in            function Such a criteria could include for example            how well the model picks out structurally similar            proteins from the database of known structures            relative to the experimental result                                    What can be done                      Promising future areas            While the CASP experiments provide for an            environment where rapid testing of ideas is possible in            a rigourous manner a lot of the development is ad hoc            guided by intuition and not all parameter choices are            explored thoroughly            The CASP experiments also show that there is not one            single algorithm that can solve the protein structure            prediction problem The most successful methods are            those that combine and build upon the techniques            developed by several researchers in the last thirty            years special issues of             Proteins Structure Function            Genetics    and  Generally            the methods have incorporated different sampling            techniques and a variety of scoring functions each of            which aids prediction of structure only to a limited            degree when used individually but are producing models            useful for further biological study when combined            together in a coherent manner            To provide a guidance for future work we analysed            some of the more promising paths that we discovered to            assess their viability in improving our methods and            making better predictions focusing on four major            areas alignment refinement sampling and selection            An analysis of the results generated by our methods at            the next CASP evaluated in December  will provide            a measure of the effectiveness of these            improvements                                Comparative modelling and fold recognition            Alignment and template selection using allatom scoring            functions            A major reason for alignment methods failing at CASP            has to do with using sequence information only and not            incorporating structural information For example            while modelling Tubc sequence alignments generated            by several methods have an alignment error relative to            the structural alignment     The sequence            identitysimilarity scores would have been lower with            the new alignment since the number of identical            residues decreases by six in a region of fourteen            residues This phenomenon has been observed time and            again at CASP illustrated in Figure by three            examples including Tucb We were later able to            readily distinguish between the correct and incorrect            alignments when an allatom scoring function was            applied to the models constructed using both            alignments and justify the changes by detailed            environment analysis The score for the models based on            the correct alignments were better by  on average            relative to the model with the original alignment This            would indicate that a sequence alignment algorithm that            incorporates structural information in a rigourous            manner is useful and necessary to handle the alignment            problem            Historically in comparative modelling the template            with the highest sequence identity or similarity to the            target sequence being modelled has been used for            further analysis However a comparison of members of a            family with known structures shows that sequence only            measures do not correlate absolutely with the            structural similarity    even in cases where the            evolutionary relationships are obvious            We thus devised an experiment where we constructed            models for protein families with large numbers of known            structures specifically the globin and the            immunoglobulin families We then conducted an            allagainstall homology modelling exercise where every            member of the family was modelled on every other            template resulting in  and  models for each member            of the globin and immunoglobulin families            respectively We compared the performance of the            allatom scoring function to two sequence only metrics            The results for the globin family are given in Figure             On average using the allatom function improves            model quality by   C              RMSD compared to only using            sequence identity The theoretical best improvement            that could have been achieved on average is   C              RMSD Similar improvements are            observed for the immunoglobulin family            Taken together with previously published results                 these results strongly indicate that the            allatom scoring function is a powerful method to            handle the alignment problem the template selection            problem the construction of side chains and main            chains and potentially helpful in refining models when            continuous forms of the function are used                                Ab initio prediction Sampling conformational            space            At CASP we mixed and matched different move sets            and search methods for sampling protein conformational            space Since we did not have the time to test the            performance of each move set or search method we            assumed they would work equally well on average and            combined them sequentially which generally resulted in            improvements            Table shows the average results of different            combinations of move sets and search methods for a set            of six proteins PDB codes ctf e eh nkl            pgb sro four of these were CASP targets The            results shown are for  trajectories with            different starting random seeds While some of the            combinations do not necessarily enhance the simple            approach of using only residue fragments with a            straightforward monte carlo procedure the combination            of using fragments and the state model for making            moves with MC and GA search techniques for the            sampling shows a significant improvement which we            hope to demonstrate at CASP by further extending the            preliminary studies described here Since these            combinations were tried with equal weighting further            improvement may be obtained by parameterising how the            different move sets and search techniques are applied            depending on the trajectory landscape                                Ab initio prediction Selecting nativelike            conformations            Even though our allatom function is readily able to            distinguish nativelike conformations in certain            scenarios it is not adequate for large sets of decoys            where the closest conformation generated is represented            at the topological level    C              RMSD relative to the experimental            result Using the allatom function alone to select            nativelike conformations is not likely to suffice when            it is also used in the actual minimisationsearch            process since all conformations generated in such            searches represent local minima of this function Thus            our method has incorporates multiple functions and uses            hierarchical filtering to reduce the number of            conformations from a large sample to a tiny fraction to            enhance the signal and eliminate false positives            At CASP we used our expertise to manually devise a            single hierarchical filtering scheme where we            successively eliminated  of the conformations with            each filter until we were left with one conformation            In the experiment in Table  we compare the average            performance of each of the individual filters to our            final hierarchical combination when reducing the             conformations generated for each protein by our search            method corresponding to the last entry in Table  to             conformations The hierarchical combination first            reduces the  conformations to  by applying            the density function which is then reduced to  by            applying the hydrophobic compactness function which is            then reduced to    and  in the same            order as presented in Table             Table shows that particularly promising filters            include the use of densitybased scoring functions            hydrophobic compactness allatom pairwise preferences            and match of the final conformation to the predicted            secondary structure Physicsbased functions based on            electrostatics and van der Waals interactions do not            discriminate well on their own and only do so when an            explicit solvation term is added to the functions            Table also shows that even though some of the            individual functions perform well the combination of            all the functions applied in a hierarchical manner            performs the best As mentioned earlier this            combination was developed through intuition under            pressure from the CASP experiment though here the goal            was to reduce the total number of conformations to            five This suggests that there exists more optimal            linear and nonlinear combinations of these            functions                                    Computational issues          Table lists the times taken for the computational          tasks outlined in this paper Times are given per           MHz Pentium III processor and for a cluster of  such          processors when the algorithm can run in parallel For          CASP predictions were made with computing power th          of the capability shown                          Application of structure prediction methods to          whole genomes          The qualitative assessment of our methods considered          independently of the difficulty of the prediction ranks           models as useful good or excellent Similar          results are likely to be observed when these methods are          applied to large numbers of sequences if we assume that          the sample of  proteins roughly reflects the          distribution of proteins seen in a genome In practice          it is likely that we will encounter more homologous          proteins in a genome since experimentalists are not as          likely to solve a structure for which there clearly          exists a homolog          This is a long way from our predictions at CASP              and our initial implementations of these          methodologies      Yet there is much room for          further improvement Besides improving the existing          methodologies and developing new ones we can also          integrate other existing algorithms such that consensus          predictions can be used to assign confidence levels as          well as having multiple choices for an outcome that can          be tested experimentally          Analyses of small genomes show that about  of          the proteins within the genome can be modelled by          comparative modelling and fold recognition methods                An additional  of the sequences are or          contain small domains with simple secondary structures          that are viable candidates for           ab initio structure prediction              The remaining proteins are usually not amenable to          structure prediction and sometimes even structure          determination a significant fraction of the latter are          membrane proteins          It is thus possible to construct a genome prediction          engine using the computational resources available where          we can take the protein sequences encoded by an          organisms genome and attempt to predict their          structures and use the modelled structures to predict          functions The goal of this endeavour is to improve          existing methods and develop new ones to perform various          facets of the genomeproteome modelling task in an          automated fashion To this end our predictions for the          next CASP are almost entirely focused on the          fullyautomated CAFASP aspect via the use of a          prediction server          httpprotinfocompbiowashingtonedu                          Using predicted structures to annotate          function          The reason for obtaining structures for proteins          encoded by a genome is that they can be used to          understand function and further our knowledge about the          organisms biology Even though structure prediction          methods need further development it is possible to          produce models where functional hypotheses can be tested          in a rational manner for example with mutagenesis          experiments through detailed analysis              Additionally structure comparisons can be used to detect          functional relationships that cannot be detected by          sequence information alone     and microenvironment          analyses that parse models for particular          threedimensional motifs    can be used to discern          molecular function Both of these structurebased          approaches used complementarily in conjunction with          sequenceonly motiffinding approaches      and          experimental data will enable to us better assign          function to all or large parts of a proteome                            Conclusions                  Why is proteinproteome modelling important          Even given the ongoing structural genomics projects          the continually increasing amount of DNA and protein          sequence data from genome projects makes it infeasible          for NMR and xray crystallography techniques to rapidly          provide information about the D structures of the          sequences determined     Thus there is an urgent          need for reliably predicting structure from amino acid          sequence          Proteins in a cell do not work in isolation of one          another Thus to understand the function of multiprotein          complexes or whole proteomes from a structural          viewpoint it is necessary to have a model for many          proteins encoded by the genome of an organism The CASP          results indicate that structure prediction methods have          matured to a point where they can be applied on a          genomewide scale and that these structures can be used          with novel but straightforward approaches to annotate          and understand function        The resulting          models and annotations when combined with other          genomicproteomic data including that from gene          expression arrays     genomewide twohybrid          experiments     and other proteomics studies              will provide us with a dynamic picture of organismal          structure function and evolution                                Methods                  Comparative modelling and fold recognition                      Template selection and alignment            Target sequences related to proteins that have            conformations determined by experiment Xray            crystallography or NMR were candidates for comparative            modelling If the sequence relationship between the            template and target proteins was unambiguous usually            when the sequence identity is   or if there            was only one protein with known structure in the            family the template structure was used to construct            the sole initial model If there were many possible            template structures models were constructed using all            available templates            PSIBLAST alignments and other publicly available            servers such as GenTHREADER    and SAMT                available as part of the CAFASP metaserver                were also used to generate a variety of choices for            alignments These alternate alignments were used to            construct initial models Thus for a given protein in            a family with at least one known representative            structure there could be many template and alignment            choices for constructing the initial models                                Constructing initial models            Following the sequence alignment an initial model            was generated for each template structure and            corresponding alignment by copying atomic coordinates            for the main chain excluding any insertionsloops and            for the side chains of identical residues in the target            and template proteins Residues that differed in side            chain type were constructed using a minimum            perturbation MP technique     The MP method            changes a given amino acid to the target amino acid            preserving the values of equivalent torsion angles            between the two side chains where available The other            angles were constructed for each residue type using            internally developed library based on the most            frequently observed  values in a database of known            structures                                    Manual inspection to improve alignments            An allagainstall structure comparison between all            the initial models was used to produce a multiple            sequence alignment based on structural similarity for a            given family This alignment was used in conjunction            with sequence information and interactive graphics to            create new sequence alignments                                Constructing variable side chains and main            chains            Multiple side chain conformations for residue            positions that differ in type between the template and            target proteins were generated by exploring all the            possibilities in a rotamer library     The most            probable conformations based on the interactions of a            given conformation with the local main chain were            selected using an allatom distance dependent            conditional probability discriminatory function                           A set of possible conformations were generated for            main chain regions loops considered to vary in the            target with respect to the template structures            including insertions and deletions Main chain sampling            was performed using an exhaustive enumeration technique            based on  discrete torsion angle states     For            longer main chain regions   residues fragments            from a database of protein structures are used to            generate the torsion angle values Developments in our             ab initio sampling protocol were            incorporated into our loop sampling technique            In CASP experiments main chain regions and side            chains selected for sampling were determined visually            using interactive computer graphics We partially            automated this procedure by developing programs to            identify side chains with implausible packing clashes            and unfavorable electrostatic interactions with other            side chains andor main chain                                Allatom conditional probability scoring            function            The allatom scoring function is the core of many            aspects of this project where identification of            nativelike conformations is required The function            calculates the probability of a conformation being            nativelike given a set of interatomic distances                The conditional probabilities are compiled by            counting frequencies of distances between pairs of atom            types in a database of protein structures All            nonhydrogen atoms are considered and a            residuespecific description of the atoms is used            ie the C              of an alanine is different from            the C              of a giycine This results in a            total of  atom types The distances observed are            divided into   bins ranging from   to              Contacts between atom types in the   range are            placed in a separate bin resulting in a total of             distance bins Distances between atoms within a single            residue are not included in the counts            We then compile tables of scores proportional to the            negative log conditional probability that one is            observing a native conformation given an interatomic            distance for all possible pairs of the  atom types            for the  distance ranges Given a set of distances in            a conformation the probability that the conformation            represents a correct fold is evaluated by summing the            scores for all distances and the corresponding atom            pairs                                Using graph theory to generate consistent            conformations            We use a graphtheoretic approach to assemble the            sampled side chain and main chain conformations            together in a consistent and optimal manner Each            possible conformation of a residue is represented using            the notion of a node in a graph Each node is given a            weight based on the degree of the interaction between            its side chain atoms and the local main chain atoms            The weight is computed using the allatom scoring            function     Edges are then drawn between pairs of            residuesnodes that are consistent with each other            ie clashfree and satisfying geometrical            constraints The edges are also weighted according to            the probability of the interaction between atoms in the            two residues Once the entire graph is constructed all            the maximal sets of completely connected nodes            cliques are found using a cliquefinding algorithm                The cliques with the best total weights            represent the optimal combinations of mixing and            matching among the various possibilities taking the            respective environments into account     The            cliquefinding approach for generating conformations is            fast since it precalculates all the scores In its            present implementation it can sample up to             conformations in a hour period on a  MHz Intel            processor                                Selecting the most nativelike            conformations            All models produced are refined using the Energy            Calculation and Dynamics ENCAD package     For a            given protein sequence there could be more than one            allatom model produced For such cases all models            were ranked using the allatom pairwise scoring            function    and the best scoring models are            considered to be the most nativelike ones                                    Ab initio prediction                      Sampling protein conformational space            We initially start with an allatom conformation            where the torsion values for residues predicted to be            in helixsheet by PSIPRED secondary structure            prediction    are set to idealised values                The remaining  values are set in an extended            conformation Side chain conformations are predicted by            simply using the most frequently observed rotamer in a            database of protein structures     New            conformations are generated by perturbing the existing            conformation at an arbitrary residue by one of two            methods              i  the torsion values for three            residues with identical sequence from a known structure            are used to modify the current conformation similar in            spirit to that of Baker and colleagues                  ii  one of possible  torsion             values derived based on the most frequently            occurring torsion values for a given residue in a            database of known structures The move sets were            combined sequentially ie where a certain number of            iterations consisted of copying torsion values for            residue fragments and the next few iterations would            use torsion values from the state  model            The scoring function for minimisation is primarily a            combination of the allatom function a hydrophobic            compactness function and a bad contacts function                The primary search technique we used was a            Metropolis Monte Carlo MC procedure where            conformations are accepted or rejected based on the            Boltzmanns equation     Each trajectory was            allowed  iterations starting with a high            temperature such that  of the moves were accepted            for the first  steps and cooled linearly until            only  of the moves were accepted for the last             steps            At particular points in the trajectory every             steps a fragment from another trajectory was copied            at random similar in spirit to genetic algorithms GA            strategies      The standard Metropolis            criterion would then apply ie if the selected            fragment enhanced the score of the conformation            relative to the previous conformation it would be            accepted If not its probability of acceptance would            be determined by the difference in score between the            current conformation and the previous conformation The            probability is calculated by the Boltzmannlike            equation where              E is the difference in scores and                        kT representing the product of            Boltzmanns constant and temperature is set to a value            calculated using the standard deviation of the scores            of the first  steps in a given trajectory                                Selecting biologically relevant            conformations            The conformations generated were minimised using            ENCAD    and scored using a combination of scoring            functions that hierarchically reduces the total number            of conformations produced to one final conformation            The scoring functions used for the final filtering            include the allatom function     hydrophobic            compactness     a simple residueresidue contact            function     a densityscoring function that is            based on the distance of a conformation to all its            relatives in the conformation pool contact order                a secondary structure based scoring function that            evaluates the match between the predicted structure and            the secondary structure of a final energyminimised            conformation and standard physicsbased electrostatics            and Van der Waals terms                                        Internal testing and comparison of models to the          experimental result          We initially ran our algorithms on test sets          consisting of  proteins To minimise bias of a          particular algorithm to a fixed test set new proteins          were added to the test sets regularly In all cases where          a threedimensional model must be compared to an          experimental structure we use the root mean square          deviation RMSD between corresponding atoms of the          prediction and the experimental answer usually          calculated using the C            atoms                          Availability of software and decoys          The ensembles of structures that were generated and          much of the software used to generate them are available          at httpcompbiowashingtonedu                            Authors contributions        RS performed the algorithm development carried out the        computations
