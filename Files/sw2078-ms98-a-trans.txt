        here goes Sharon   okay   well  what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars thats the only thing i found out tonight   oh you found that out tonight i hadnt even heard that thats great i think he deserves every penny of it   yeah yeah   but there are some others out there that i dont believe deserve the money theyre getting   well isnt it funny how baseballs getting less than like football players would   oh yeah   wonder because football   and they play a lot they play a lot longer season too   and a lot more games right   yep thats exactly right   uhhuh   but i think lets see the teams that were there last year were see somebody from California i dont even know who won the pennant last year   beats me i mean i know Yankees have won a lot of games through the years   yeah  not lately though   we have been talking about this i tried to call earlier   uhhuh   and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from then i started cleaning and i dont know where i even put that paper i yeah i was just cleaning and throwing   threw it away  oh gosh lets see the teams that  i think the As were in it last year the Oakland As and i think it was i dont think it was an all California baseball   well have you ever played baseball   i play softball   well thats what i did when i was growing up   yeah   that was fun   yeah thats fun  thats a whole different sport   uhhuh   yeah lets see but i think i think the Rangers need to go and i think the Pirates will go and uh lets see Rangers have got a new guy this year i dont remember his name either   do you ever go see the Rangers   every once in a while i i like to go on the nights when theres not anybody out there not very many people out there its a lot more fun when youre not fighting a crowd   yeah i think its fun i like just looking at the billboards   yeah but sometimes when i if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun     yeah its nice at night   yeah   thats when ive been   it is       and and do you know anything about that new stadium have you seen all those pictures that theyre going to put out there   well no   yeah that that huge its suppose to be a huge stadium and its going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it and uh theyre going to try to make it a real community center out there   and youre going to be able to buy your what was no wait   of course   what was it about the liquor   thats thats in uh Texas stadium where the football players play   was that   oh yeah see you just   and theyre never going to let liquor in there   well theyre trying   i know but they try every year and every year they get thrown out its so stupid because they let you take it in there but they dont they dont allow you to sell it dont allow them to sell it there   uhhuh   but uh that new stadiums going to be real nice and i heard that theres uh that you can bid on that stadium last night on the news i heard they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you   kind of right   its going to its going to go to the highest bidder   oh       well thats the way to do it   so yeah so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame   you hear that thats my kids turning on their music let me see  Holly turn it down   oh   i think its the Bartman the Simpsons   oh God  i stay away from them     i wish i could   i bet you do   yeah well where are you   in Plano   okay im in Garland   oh you are   yeah my husband my husband teaches in Plano   oh whats he teach   C V A E   uhhuh so what do you do   i teach but i teach for Dallas   oh you do   for right now im trying to get out   is that a tough system to be in   uhhuh   real hard   uhhuh i mean its good because they they try new things you know but its like   yeah i would think it   theyll try something and then they throw it out and get something else you know and you get tired of that   yeah thats typical bureaucracy though thats thats i think its going to be any where you go its just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones i dont know sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad     yeah well but they cant be though they dont have as much money   yeah but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes   most the time oh man but in Dallas you dont even know whos in in administration theres so many of them   you dont even know who to payoff huh   i mean somebody walks in the classroom and you dont know what theyre there for you know when theyre coming how long theyre going to be   yeah oh how funny   you know its just them there they are and theyre writing the whole time   no communication whatsoever   no i had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything and i finally got to where i go okay im Debbie Moore you know may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for       you know because you know you never know where theyre going  what theyll report or   yeah i know   and theyll tell you theyve written something down and you   and you havent you and you never see it   hope theyre telling you   no huhuh   thats got to be frustrating   oh it is   how long have you taught taught Dallas schools   uh this is my eleventh year   ooh thats about uh ten too many   no actually its now my jobs good much better than a lot   yeah uhhuh   because im Chapter One and all i do is teach reading all day long   yeah oh   and its just ten children at a time   well thats not bad   no its good and youve got a lot of federal money too   but hasnt it changed a lot over the years   teaching  oh yes   yeah or working in the system   yes when i first started teaching i remember i went up to my job and i said okay i want to see a curriculum guide you know so ill know what im suppose to teach and they go we dont have one of we dont even know where one is     oh God   and  i go okay i mean you just you did what you  wanted to do   oh how funny   and now they tell you what to teach and how long and you know what day   yeah you dont know which is you dont know which is worse   what period yeah no i know which is worse   yeah i guess so yeah being told what to do is worse     umhum   so how long are we suppose to talk for   well you can talk for ten minutes but you dont have to   oh you can   yeah and no if you talk to ten then they come over on and say oh youve extended your limit and please say goodbye within the next five seconds   oh i havent ever talked that long   well you know i hadnt either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland Ohio we started talking about gangs you know   oh how funny he lives in Cleveland   yeah   wow   and everybody else that ive talked to has been right around here   yeah   but she was real interesting   huh   and then tonight this woman called have you taken any incoming calls   the yours is my second one   okay so hers was the first one i got gotten and uh oh she was telling me all her problems       and it went over ten minutes   did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all   well yeah we did but the topic was boring i thought what would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party   oh oh gosh   what was im trying to remember oh the other the one i talked about the other night was good it was um about movies you know who what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that   oh yeah i could go on and on about that   me too because we go all the time the guy i was talking to never goes he was boy it sounds like your really up on this and i said i see at least two a week  so   ooh neat   that was real good to talk about that have you seen like uh Silence Of The Lambs   no   youve got to go see that   the last one i saw was Dances Of The With The Wolves Of The Wolves   yeah we talked about that one too and he he said he didnt think it should of gotten all those awards he thought it was too long but   oh i enjoyed it i mean it was just more for my money   i i did too yeah i didnt think it was too long at all um he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch   huh   the other one you need to go see is Sleeping With The Enemy   uhhuh   and how old are your kids   one is eight and one is eleven   you probably dont want to take them to see Silence Of The Lambs its its not its not too cool for kids   they usually pick their own   i bet they do   you know theyve got it all figured out   yeah they want to see all the horror movies   well and Ninja Turtles   yeah Ninja Turtles got to have those   but most of the time really we watch them on the video dont you just massive rental   oh yeah you bring thats well heck thats a lot cheaper then uh taking them out to the show   going to i know   especially if you get them for a couple of nights you dont have to watch them all at one night one time   thats what we do especially when its bad weather man just   yeah   plug it in   of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything   i know   decent well   its good when you go to Tom Thumb though and theyre cheap and nobodys got them yet unbelievable   thats true thats true we saw um Heroes Has Always Been Cowboys tonight   uhhuh   it was okay it was kind of slow and i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know it just it and i dont know it one of those movies its not going to be around long itll be a dollar movie in no time   do you read   not very much no   no   i dont have the patience to read   see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night   yeah oh my mom and dad read all the time   you saw Field Of the Dreams right a long time ago   yeah sure did   so i was reading the book and its called Shoeless Joe   oh really   it was so wonderful and then i was um i decided well i like this author so i got a uh book of his short stories and thats been real good   whos the whos the author   dont dont ask me  The Ghost Of Shoeless Joe was the name of the book   oh   Shoeless Joe was it like the movie   yes quite a quite a bit but you know in the movie the guy was black   okay right   he wasnt in the book   huh   thats one difference there really wasnt a lot of difference   i didnt uh see i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie   umhum   thats interesting   so   that was a good movie too   well do you think weve covered baseball   i think so   okay well have a good night
