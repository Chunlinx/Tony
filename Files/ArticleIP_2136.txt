                                 Future Splash            Seattle fantasized aboutbecoming the first city of the  st century when it hosted theWorlds Fair of  But the fairs organizers were less than prescient aboutwhat the next century would bring The newfangled monorail that ferriedvisitors from Seattles dowdy downtown to the fairs gleaming pavilions owedmore to Disneyland of the s than it did to the future Inside the fair theexhibits hawked a similarly conservative tomorrow Easytomaintain kitchensdirectdial longdistance telephone service and a machine that made changefrom a greenback were among the big hits Even the fairs futurist symboltheskyscrapertall Space Needle that contains a revolving restauranthad more todo with selling overpriced and overcooked food than it did with space or spacetravel            A decadeafter the fair Seattle was on the move again but it was moving backwardSeattle of  had more in common with the Great Depression of the s thanwith the  st century Boeing the areas largest employer wallowedin the deepest of its periodic slumps dragging the entire economy down withit Seattles selfimage as a bigleague city had taken a separate beating twoyears previously when its majorleaguebaseball franchisethe SeattlePilotsfled to Milwaukee  after just one season The city seemed on theverge of slipping into Puget Sound and disappearing forever            But Seattle didnt disappear Far from it Threeandahalfdecades after its fair the city has emerged as an international destinationfor the ambitious and the fashionable Visiting the city last weekend for ascience convention I smelled the unmistakable air of selfimportance whereverI went Downtown was filled with people noshing trendy food late into thenight Tourists wandered the streets wondering which incipient Seattle trendwould be the next big thing The science journalists attending the conventionwith me made their pilgrimage to the technological Mecca of Microsoft just afew miles away in Seattles eastside suburbs Other conference goers taking acue from Sleepless in Seattle  hatched plans to move into their ownhouseboats on Lake Union            How didthis happen I wondered How did this timber fish and airplane town of myyouth transform itself into a strutting moneyed harddriving city of thefuture            Igrew up in the s and early s in a towncalled Gig Harbor about an hour south of Seattle Back then Seattle was asisolated provincial insecure and wet as it is connected worldly smug andwet today Growing up as kids in the Northwest we rightly ignored Seattle andconcentrated our energies on snowshoeing the Cascade and Olympic rangesfishing for salmon from dinghies or just prowling the mysterious undergrowthof the rainforest Seattle back then was like the small towns of comingofagenovelsanybody with the slightest ambition longed to leave Nobody wassurprised if after charting nationally regional hit makers like the KingsmenPaul Revere and the Raiders and the Sonics chose to jet to Los Angeles Whocould blame them            For thatmatter who could blame me for decamping to attend college back East In myabsence Seattle slowly changed its mind about how to get to the st century Maybe the idea dawned on young Seattle entrepreneursas they watched ships heavy with fir and cedar depart for Japan and returnfilled with exotic electronic goods The Japanese lesson was clear Makingmoney by extracting natural resources was capitalism for chumps The way to getrich was to add value to commodities            Several local fortunes were made based on this concept Ashoe store called Nordstrom for example reinvented the department store byadding service and took the idea nationally A few musicians updated theby noise of the Sonics and invented grunge temporarily making Seattlemusic city and this time the citys rock n roll stars stayed put ratherthan fleeing to Los Angeles Salmon glorified tuna fish in my youth becameexportable haute cuisine  thanks to cheap air transport Then Starbucksfigured out how to sell a  cent product for  and took the conceptinternationally Its only a matter of time before the timberfolk steal a pagefrom this playbook and start peddling gourmet wood            Thefuturists of  were on safe ground when they predicted that the st century would be shaped by computers like the UNIVAC mainframethey displayed at the Worlds Fair What they couldnt have foreseen was thatlocal son Bill Gates and other software developers would figure out how tomarket bits of plastic worth just a couple of cents each floppy disks forhundreds of dollars Gates as is well known started Microsoft in Albuquerquebefore relocating to his hometown I often wonder if the future would haveburst upon Seattle with quite the same ferocity if New Mexicos sun had castthe sort of spell on him that Washingtons rain obviously did            Seattles spacey  fantasy about itself isfinally coming true these days as Gates and another homegrown billionaireCraig McCaw have partnered in a telecommunications company by the name ofTeledesic which intends to loft  satellites into orbit by  to create anInternet in the sky Thirtyfive years ago Seattle invited the world tovisit Now the citys entrepreneurs plan to encircle it            With the passing of eachyear the Space Needle looks more and more like a prop from a badsciencefiction movie Although it hasnt dominated Seattles skyline since thes when the economic boom sprouted a host of taller buildings it remainsthe citys symbol of progress My family insists on calling the big blackskyscraper that soars over downtown the box that the Space Needle arrivedin
