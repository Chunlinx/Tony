        im Doug   hi how you doing Doug my names Brad where where you from   from Pennsylvania   oh okay im from New York   yeah okay so anyway now were talking about drug testing an all that and you ready okay  so what do you think about it   right right yep okay oh i definitely i i think it shouldnt be if it may be the only exception is when theres public safety involved you know bus drivers uh train train motormen stuff like that you know   right right i agree with you basically so might be a boring conversation  but um but anyway i agree that   right   um only when theres any question of safety does the employer have a right because otherwise i feel that the measure of whether someone is to stay employed or not it is just performance whether youre able to do the job up to par and that and if that can be done it shouldnt matter whatever the employee might do in his private life   yes um youre right its probably is gonna be boring i agree with you a hundred percent   okay   uh you know but i i i think that uh i mean people think that they have an interest in in finding things like this out about their employers because its probably and and maybe its true that that if if you if you tested people and if they were drug users   yeah   probably  i mean i might even agree with you that theyre probably gonna to be less productive employees um im not sure about that but i would say that that that may be that might be a good indication   yeah that well probably at least on the average   but but you could also you might be able to tell by a persons uh you know whether theyre overweight or underweight   uhhuh   uh you know you might make certain  value judgments about that you can make value judgments probably about about a number of different things that are clearly within the realm of someones private ability   yeah   you know private you know private interest or or you know im trying looking for a word  in other words you know maybe maybe uh heavier people uh   umhum   tend to not be as good workers you know or maybe maybe extra uh uh ultra thin people tend to not be as good workers maybe people that smoke cigarettes  arent as good workers uh you know   right certainly and certainly in any case people who drink alcohol a lot are probably not as good workers i think that most drug testing programs dont include that   sure   theyre really interested in looking for illegal drugs it seems to be more for the purpose of law enforcement than for   yeah yeah   the purpose of the employers best interest for the job   thats true thats true   yeah um   so  we could talk about pets that was my last subject you know   oh  i see um well were supposed   whats that music in the background   uh thats Miles Davis yeah   oh okay a little tribute to him or   uh right exactly its on the radio um so   ah thats a good background for this conversation  all right well anyhow nice talking to you i i dont think we have to stay on the whole time and weve weve agreed too much   anyway right okay yeah i guess not and i think weve said about what we have to say sure thing bye bye   okay take care  have a good day bye bye
