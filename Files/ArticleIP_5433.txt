                                 The Modern Library            The battle over Internetcensorship has taken up residence in your neighborhood public libraryConservatives in Congress and elsewhere are demanding that libraries applyfilters to Internet terminals available to minors Ernest Istook aRepublican representative from Oklahoma recently proposed denying federalfunds to any library that fails to use filters Istooks amendment wound up onthe cutting room floor when the budget bill was finalized this week but it mayreemerge next year Meanwhile in Virginia someone has sued his local libraryfor filtering Internet content In California someone else has sued hers fornot doing so The American Library Association along with the American CivilLiberties Union takes the absolutist position that any restriction on libraryInternet accessincluding one narrowly tailored to keep children away frompornographyviolates First Amendment freedoms            Thisdebate became inevitable when public libraries began to get wired adevelopment that Al Gore and Newt Gingrich both consider crucial to ourcountrys future and which Bill Gates has set up a foundation to support Butdown the road public libraries face a bigger and more vexing question thanthis rehash of old censorship debates Why if libraries are growing moreconcerned about the provision of Internet access and less concerned about thecirculation of books must they be housed in buildings with walls Someone whouses his neighborhood branch to surf the Net doesnt really depend on thelibrary the way that someone who went to do research or borrow out of printbooks did He merely uses an inefficient subsidy for something that isincreasingly cheap and easy to do at homeand which could soon be subsidizeddirectly at far lower expense In other words if the public library of thefuture is mainly about free online access its in a mess of trouble            Another technological advance threatens libraries On Oct a company called NuvoMedia rolled out the first firstgeneration digitalreading device a  appliance called the Rocket eBook Its Versionexpensive a bit clunky and according to previews not really pleasantenough for pleasure reading But within a few years such devices are likely tobe a viable even preferable way to read books Dick Brass Microsofts vicepresident for technology development says that the technical hurdles of screenquality and battery life have been largely surmounted The question is how soona comfortable device can be built for  and how long it will take for alarge number of titles to become available The probable answer is not longAlready a nonprofit organization called Project Gutenberg has digitized over public domain works ranging from Paradise Lost to Tom Swift His Aerial Warship  Publishers are scrambling to put current bookson sale in electronic form Brass predicts that youll be able to get titles electronicallymore than you can find in an average Barnes  Noblefranchisein two years            Of coursethere are some big issues that need to be negotiated before ebooks putlibraries and bookstores out of business You may be able to digitize the million books in the Library of Congress for a mere billion dollars but muchof that material falls under copyright protection While publishers acceptsequential borrowings a single copy of a book from a library they cant verywell provide free universal access to everything in their catalogs And whileebooks have tremendous appeal in theoryimagine an entire library that weighsa pound is wordsearchable and can be read in the dark and at long last acopy of                   Slate                that you can take to the bathroomreaders simplymay not cotton to them The etopians who are certain that digital readingdevices are about to take over probably underestimate the doggedness ofingrained human habits So we should pose this as a whatif and not a whatwhenquestion If electronic reading supplants print as the primary means bywhich people absorb written texts what becomes of the venerable publiclibrary            Library workers who recognize the possibilityare doing what people in threatened professions do They begin from theassumption that they will always be crucially necessary and then try to figureout what they will be necessary for Unsurprisingly librarians have reached aconsensus that technological progress demands an expansion not a contractionof their role The disciples of Melvil Dewey would have you know that they areno longer underpaid scriveners on index cards In fact they no longer want tobe called librarians at all Theyre now information specialists whounderstand search engines and retrieval systems and sort out good informationfrom bad on the Internet They aspire to the rise in status and income thatcomputer geeks benefited from in the s            It isprobably true that we will need skillful librarians and maybe even morelibrarians in etopia While doing research on the Internet can be vastly moretime and costefficient than doing it in the stacks it requires a good dealof instruction In an unfamiliar world we need guides all the more What isless clear is that we will need librariesor at least the same kind oflibraries we have now in the quantity we now have them            There is little cause for anyone to fret about the highendinstitutionsacademic research and specialized libraries will be no lessnecessary Those who seek to understand the past are always going to want toexamine original documents manuscripts and hardcopy publications Thenovelist Nicholson Baker an eloquent critic of what libraries have done in thename of modernization is certainly right about how foolish many greatlibraries were to destroy their card catalogs after transferring them toelectronic form As Baker argued in a  article in The                NewYorker  the old cards are not just eerily beautiful artifacts but alsoimportant historical documents But Baker was on shakier ground in his article attacking the new postGutenberg era San Francisco public library foremphasizing electronic research at the expense of old books Why must anonacademic library maintain at great public expense a vast store of volumesthat no one uses            It is the more ordinarylibrariesthe  public and branch libraries in American towns andcitiesthat face a real threat of redundancy That is not to say that theseinstitutions dont have functions beyond lending out books A friend of minewho used to teach in an overcrowded New York City school makes the point thatfor a lot of poor kids the library is the only place to do homework afterschool Public schools should provide an afternoon haven but in the realworld they dont It would be terrible to get rid of an institution that workswithout figuring out how to reproduce its effectiveness Libraries are alsoplaces where immigrants go to take English classes and where illiterates learnto read They are meeting places that cut against the isolation of modern lifeIn cities the downtown public library is the rare place where social classesmix            But even with the reservoirof good will public libraries have such ancillary functions arent enough tokeep them alive if their basic purpose fades Our public libraries were builtso that citizens and especially young people could enhance their livesthrough access to the written word The day may be not so far off when we canaccomplish this function better with a subsidized Internet account and a freedigital reading device
