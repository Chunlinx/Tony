                    Background        During meiosis homologous chromosomes replicate pair to        form a bivalent experience a high rate of recombination        and undergo two rounds of chromosome segregation to produce        haploid meiotic products In meiosis I MI homologous        chromosomes segregate from their partners in a reductional        division and during meiosis II MII sister chromatids        segregate from oneanother in an equational division        similar to mitosis        Crossover recombination reciprocal exchange generates        chiasmata physical connections between homologs which        provide the primary mechanism to ensure proper segregation        of homologs during MI     In the absence of chiasmata        crossovers homologous chromosomes experience        nondisjunction and segregate randomly from their partners        However backup achiasmatic or distributive mechanisms        have been identified in some species                 These distributive segregation systems can partially or        almost fully restore faithful segregation of chromosomes        during MI in the absence of recombination        The respective contributions of chiasmatic and        achiasmatic distributive modes of chromosome segregation        can be studied in organisms with naturallyoccurring        achiasmatic chromosomes     in cells harboring        nonrecombined artificial chromosomes     and in        achiasmatic mutants     Among achiasmatic mutants        those lacking the Spo Rec protein are of particular        interest because Spo has a key role in the initiation of        recombination            Meiotically induced Spo Recdependent        doublestrand DNA dsDNA breaks have been demonstrated in        budding yeast and fission yeast        Spo        almost certainly catalyzes these breaks as it shares high        homology with the A subunit of Topoisomerase VI of         Sulfolobus shibatae     and it        becomes linked by a phosphotyrosine linkage to the  end        of the cleaved DNA        Spo homologs have        been identified in a wide range of eukaryotes and        available evidence suggests that initiation of meiotic        recombination via Spodependent dsDNA break formation is        conserved        Our results with the fission        yeast         S pombe fully support this view see        results and discussion        Spo protein has potential functions in addition to        catalyzing dsDNA breaks It is dispensable for chromosome        pairing and synapsis in some organisms but is required in        others          Budding yeast         spo null mutants lack chromosome        pairing but catalytic site tyrosine mutants          spoYF  support significant        levels of DSBindependent pairing     so the function        of Spo proteins in pairing may be separable from its        function in catalyzing recombination Localization of Spo        across synapsed pachytene chromosomes of mice also        suggests that Spo has an additional role after it        catalyzes recombination in meiosis            This study examined the relationship between meiotic        recombination and chromosome segregation in         rec          spo  mutants of fission yeast We        report that Rec protein and its active site tyrosine are        essential for crossover recombination in multiple intervals        of all three chromosomes Rec also has two roles in        reductional chromosome segregation during MI First        catalyticallyactive Rec is required for normal levels of        reductional chiasmatic segregation Second        catalyticallyinactive Rec protein facilitates        achiasmatic distributive segregation In addition we        report that Rec and its active site tyrosine are required        for proper equational chromosome segregation during        MII                    Results                  Structure of rec gene and complementation by          rec cDNA          While           rec was reported to encode a          protein of  amio acids     conceptual translation          of the surrounding region suggested that           rec encoded a larger protein          with homology to Spo of           S cerevisiae and TopA of           Sulfolobus shibatae               Alignments and splicing sequence profiles    were          used to identify four putative introns Figure A          Oligonucleotide primer pairs flanking each of the          putative introns were used for PCR and RTPCR to amplify          genomic DNA and meiotic mRNA respectively In each case          the product from mRNA was shorter than that from genomic          DNA confirming the presence of four introns Figure          A          Presence of four introns suggested that the           rec cDNA encodes a protein of           amino acids with high homology to eukaryotic Spo          proteins Figure B To test this hypothesis we          introduced a fulllength genomic clone and a          sequenceconfirmed cDNA into inducible expression vectors             in such a way that the first methionine in          predicted exon  would be used for translation Figure          C Each of these constructs restored wildtype levels          of recombination to           rec strains Figure A B          We conclude that the cDNA encodes a functional Rec          protein of  amino acids in length This conclusion was          confirmed by Western blotting of an epitopetagged Rec          protein expressed from the endogenous           rec locus a meioticallyinduced          protein band of the expected size was observed WD          Sharif and WP Wahls unpublished observations          Rec Spo protein shares homology with the          catalytic TopA subunit of Topoisomerase VI which          functions as a heterotetramer with TopB               However no TopB homolog is present in most eukaryotes          and the Rec Spo enzyme does not need to affect          strand passage in the manner of canonical type II          topoisomerases     We therefore tested whether          overexpression of           rec would lead to a          hyperrecombination phenotype thereby implicating          function as a homodimer Very low levels of ectopic           rec expression restored          wildtype recombination levels to the           rec mutant Figure B          confirming that functional Rec protein was produced          However upon overexpression of           rec the frequency of          recombinants did not increase significantly above          wildtype levels Figure C D Thus Rec protein in          excess of wildtype levels is biologically inactive some          other factor becomes ratelimiting under these          circumstances          The           rec mutant was isolated in a          genetic screen the           rec mutation reportedly          confers a fold or greater reduction of intragenic          recombination and a fold reduction of intergenic          recombination     To define more precisely the          requirement for Rec in meiotic chromosome dynamics we          used gene replacement to generate a null            recD  mutation and a mutation          in the putative active site tyrosine            recYF  We then determined          the effects of these mutations upon intergenic          crossover recombination within intervals of chromosomes                    I            II  and           III  We also employed a          combination of cytological and genetic approaches to          reveal the nature of meiotic chromosome segregation          defects for each chromosome in each of the three          mutants                          Rec and its active site tyrosine are required for          chiasmatic meioses          Models for recombination posit that gene conversion          and reciprocal exchange crossover recombination are          alternative outcomes of a common intermediate              Intragenic recombination at the           ade locus a measure of gene          conversion was reduced more than fold in           rec mutants     and we          have obtained similar results with the           rec            recD  and           recYF mutants Figure  WD          Sharif and WP Wahls unpublished data Because          reciprocal exchange accompanies more than half of all          gene conversions at the           ade locus      the           rec mutants must also have a          reduced number of reciprocal exchanges in the vicinity of                    ade           If Rec protein is required for all or most meiotic          recombination then           rec mutants might fail to produce          a sufficient number of reciprocal exchanges to ensure          that each chromosome pair receives at least one          crossover To address this issue we determined the          number of crossovers present in regions of chromosomes           I            II  and           III in the           recD deletion and           recYF active site mutants          Multiple genetic intervals encompassing approximately           of the genome  cM were analyzed          Intergenic recombination was reduced an average of          fold in the           recD null mutants and          fold in the           recYF active site mutants          relative to wildtype levels Table  Thus Rec          protein and its active site tyrosine are likely required          for most crossover recombination throughout the genome          Because there are between  and  crossovers per          chromosome in wildtype           S pombe meioses and those          crossovers are distributed without interference              we can estimate the residual number of crossovers present          on each chromosome in the           rec mutant meioses A fold          reduction in recombination would leave less than           crossovers per chromosome so all three chromosomes in          most of the           rec mutant meioses are          achiasmatic                          Rec is required for proper meiotic chromosome          segregation          The           rec mutant meioses are          achiasmatic and would thus be expected to suffer          chromosome segregation errors during meiosis I To gain          insight into this possibility asci from meiotic cultures          were stained with a DNA specific fluorescent dye DAPI          and visualized by differential interference contrast          DIC and fluorescence microscopy The majority of asci          from wildtype cells contained four wellrounded spores          each with a single DAPIstaining body of equal intensity          Figure A The           rec mutants were proficient at          meiosis and underwent two meiotic divisions as revealed          by ascus development and the distribution of chromosomes          However each of the           rec mutants exhibited a high          frequency of chromosome segregation errors that were          sometimes accompanied by defects in spore formation          andor ascus development Figure B The data from a          large number of asci from each mutant are presented          schematically in Figure C          The           rec            recD  and           recYF mutants exhibited          qualitatively and quantitatively similar cytological          phenotypes Figure C They each produced between           and  of asci with gross defects in DNA distribution          These mutant phenotypes were not uniform different asci          from the same cross were differentially affected Figure           This heterogeneous phenotype is characteristic of a          variety of mutations that directly affect meiotic          chromosome dynamics       Aberrant or random          assortment of the three chromosome pairs or twelve          chromatids leads to heterogeneous DNA distributions          within different asci          The           rec mutants also exhibited high          frequencies of additional developmental defects such as          abnormal spore placement reduced spore numbers and          abnormal spore formation Figure C It has been          suggested previously    that these phenotypes are          characteristic of a defect in meiosis II because spore          formation in           S pombe is controlled by the          spindle pole body of the MII spindle                          S pombe produces ordered tetrads          If chromosomes segregated aberrantly during the MI          reductional division and then segregated appropriately          during the equational division of MII one would expect          sister spores to receive identical complements of          chromosomes However among           rec mutant asci with four spores          and an aberrant DNA distribution Figure C classes b          c d e only  or less exhibited a pattern          characteristic of simple MI nondisjunction Figure C          classes c e The remaining  or more had DNA          distributions characteristic of precocious sister          chromatid separation andor MII segregation errors  DNA          was unequally distributed between two sister spores          Figure C classes b d In some cases a defect in          chromosome segregation during MII was visualized more          directly For example in many cases DNA masses failed to          separate properly into two sister spores during the          second meiotic division Figure B Figure C classes f          g j k m Thus Rec protein is required for some          function of MII as well as for recombination during          MI                          recmutants produce a high frequency aneuploid          meiotic products          Since           S pombe contains only three          chromosome pairs aberrant assortment during one or both          of the meiotic divisions can produce by chance a          significant fraction of meiotic products that receive at          least one copy of each chromosome and are hence viable               Aberrant segregation can also produce          nullisomic aneuploids missing one or more chromosomes          polysomic aneuploids having additional copies of          individual chromosomes and diploids       In           S pombe the haploids and diploids          are viable nullisomic aneuploids are inviable and          disomic aneuploids tend to lose the extra chromosome or          chromosomes and become haploid     We therefore          determined the frequencies of spore viability and meiotic          diploidy as genetic measures of chromosome segregation          errors          Approximately  of the meiotic products from the           rec and           recD null mutants were          inviable Figure A indicating that about  of the          products were nullisomic for one or more chromosomes          This value is close to the frequency  of nullisomics          that one would expect if chromosome segregation were          completely random in either one of the two meiotic          divisions Interestingly the           recYF mutant produced a          significantly higher frequency of inviable spores than          the           rec and           recD mutants Figure A          suggesting that           recYF is a separation of          function mutation          As a second measure of aberrant segregation we          determined the frequency of diploid spore colonies in the          mutants Each of the           rec mutants behaved similarly and          produced approximately  diploid meiotic products more          than fold higher than the frequency produced by          wildtype cells Figure B If chromosome segregation          were completely random in either one of the two meiotic          divisions one would expect approximately  of the          viable products to be disomic for all three chromosomes          The value obtained in the           rec mutants was fold higher          than the predicted random value indicating that the          segregation errors are not simply the consequence of          random chromosome assortment nondisjunction occurring          exclusively during one of the two meiotic divisions                          Rec is required for chiasmatic and achiasmatic          chromosome segregation during MI and its active site          tyrosine is required for chromosome segregation during          MII          Because each of the           rec mutants had aberrant meiotic          chromosome segregation Figure  produced a high          frequency of viable meiotic products Figure A and          produced a high frequency of meiotic diploids Figure          B we were able to monitor directly the segregation          patterns of all three chromosome pairs in each of the          mutants Meiotic diploids were genotyped for          heteroallelic centromerelinked markers on each of the          three chromosomes Those data were compared to the          inheritance patterns predicted for each type of          chromosome missegregation Figure           Approximately half of the diploid products from the           rec and           recD null meioses were          heterozygous for centromerelinked markers on chromosomes                    I            II  and           III Figure E Thus those          meioses did not exhibit simple MI nondisjunction because           of diploids arising from MI nondisjunction would be          heterozygous at the centromeres Figure B Precocious          separation of sister chromatids during MI     can          also produce diploid meiotic products  of which would          be heterozygous for centromere markers Figure D              However the average heterozygosities in the           rec and           recD mutants were          significantly below this value indicating that these          mutants must have suffered some proportion of MII          segregation errors By applying mapping functions for          aneuploid meiotic products     we can set a lower          limit of  and  MII nondisjunction for the           rec and           recD meioses analyzed          respectively          Surprisingly the           recYF active site mutants          produced meiotic diploids that were almost exclusively          homozygous for centromerelinked markers Figure E The          average heterozygosity for loci on all three chromosomes          was    This indicates that about  of those           recYF mutant cells that          produced diploid spores must have successfully completed          the reductional segregation of chromosomes MI and          failed to properly segregate sister chromatids during the          equational division MII          While there was clear cytological evidence of two          meiotic divisions and aberrant chromosome assortment in          each division in the majority of           rec mutant cells Figure  it          remained possible that some of the diploid meiotic          products were derived from cells that had skipped one of          the two meiotic divisions thereby biasing the chromosome          segregation data If this were the case all three          chromosomes within any given individual meiotic product          would exhibit identical segregation patterns However          about half of the diploids from           rec and           recD meioses and  of          diploids from           recYF meioses exhibited mixed          patterns of MI or MII missegregation for different          chromosomes within individual cells Table           Furthermore the observed frequencies of mixed          segregation matched the frequencies predicted from the          average values for single chromosomes            eg            vs  for           recYF  These data provide          additional evidence that two meiotic divisions had          occurred and that the diploids arose as a consequence of          meiotic chromosome segregation defects                            Discussion                  Conserved structure and function of Rec Spo          to initiate recombination          Identification of four introns Figure  and complete          complementation of the           rec hyporecombination defect          by the fulllength cDNA Figure  confirmed that Rec          protein is homologous to Spo of other eukaryotes              Both Rec and its active site tyrosine are required          for intragenic and intergenic recombination at multiple          locations on all three chromosomes Figure  Tables            data not shown We observed an average fold and          fold reduction in crossover recombination in the           recD and           recYF mutants for intervals          encompassing  of the genome Since wildtype           S pombe has  crossovers per          meiosis between  and  per chromosome     the          mutants statistically have less than  crossovers per          chromosome per meiosis and are thus achiasmatic          It was reported previously that           rec mutants exhibit only a          fold reduction in crossover recombination              which is at odds with our value of more than a fold          reduction in the           recD null and           recYF active site mutants          Table  This discrepancy is not due to the nature of          the           rec allele as we have also          observed a fold or greater reduction in crossovers in                    rec mutants WD Sharif and          WP Wahls unpublished data Our observation that           rec mutants produce a high          frequency of viable diploid meiotic products about half          of which are heterozygous for centromere linked markers          Figures   Table  provides a straightforward          reason for the discrepancy The previous study failed to          exclude diploid spore colonies and scored only for double          prototrophic recombinants the double auxotrophic          reciprocal recombinants were not analyzed Presumably          the bulk of the colonies reported previously as          recombinants were actually diploids or disomics          exhibiting intergenic complementation          We used dosage studies to see if Rec functions in a          manner predicted by homology to SpoTopA Upon          overexpression of Rec protein the frequency of          recombination did not increase beyond wildtype levels          Figure  The simplest interpretation is that Rec          functions in a multisubunit protein complex a complex in          which other components are required either for efficient          catalysis of dsDNA breaks or for correct subcellular          localization of Rec In budding yeast the active site          mutation exhibits allelespecific semidominance when          heterozygous with wildtype     and we have made          similar observations in fission yeast WD Sharif and          WP Wahls unpublished data This provides evidence          that a dimer of RecSpo protein harboring two          functional active sites is required for catalysis of          dsDNA breaks in each organism Thus with regard to          primary protein sequence Figure  inferred subunit          structure Figure and data not shown strict          requirement for meiotic recombination Figure  Table           and dependence upon its active site tyrosine Table           Rec protein is a structurally and functionally          conserved member of the Spo family of enzymes that          catalyze meiotic dsDNA cleavage to initiate recombination                                       Rec has dual roles in chiasmatic and achiasmatic          distributive chromosome segregation during Meiosis          I          In the absence of crossover recombination chiasmata          and a backup distributive achiasmatic system for          chromosome segregation MI nondisjunction should occur          and  of any resulting diploid spore colonies would be          heterozygous for centromere linked markers Figure B          However only about  of diploid meiotic products from           recD null mutant meioses          were heterozygous for centromere linked markers Figure          E indicating that some fraction of the products were          derived from precocious separation of sister chromatids          PSS andor MII nondisjunction Figure C D Since          PSS does not occur in           rec null mutants     those          centromerehomozygous chromosomes must have experienced a          proper reductional segregation and a failed equational          segregation discussed below          The           recD null mutants are          achiasmatic Table  and as anticipated exhibit a high          frequency of MI nondisjunction Figures   Table           However the frequency of MI nondisjunction observed is          only half of that expected suggesting the presence of a          distributive achiasmatic system of chromosome          segregation There is precedence for a distributive MI          segregation system in several organisms      In           rec hyporecombination mutants of           S pombe the fidelity of          segregation of homologs during MI exceeds the expected          random level     Similarly MI segregation of          GFPtagged centromeres in           rec deletion mutants occurs at          nonrandom levels L Davis and GR Smith personal          communication in good agreement with our genetic          results In each case identified this distributive          system of fission yeast can partially circumvent the MI          segregation errors of achiasmatic chromosomes          approximately onequarter to onehalf of those homologs          expected to nondisjoin            ie move to the same pole end up          segregating distributively            ie move to opposite poles          While the           recD null mutants frequently          suffer MI nondisjunction the           recYF active site mutants          produce meiotic diploids with nearly normal MI          segregation patterns Figures   Table  This          difference is unrelated to crossover frequency because          the active site and null mutants have identical          deficiencies in crossover recombination Table  Thus          Rec protein has one or more functions in MI that are          distinct from its functions to catalyze recombination and          mediate chiasmatic segregation We propose that the          RecYF protein facilitates distributive segregation          of achiasmatic chromosomes during MI          A meiotic checkpoint could provide additional time for          missegregating chromosomes to correct their erroneous          wanderings during MI     We propose two likely          mechanisms by which the Rec protein improves the MI          segregation of achiasmatic chromosomes First Rec may          be required for an MI nondisjunction checkpoint that          delays meiotic cells in which proper MI disjunction has          failed to occur If Rec were required for such a          checkpoint the null mutants would be achiasmatic would          fail to delay for the time period required to establish          distributive segregation and would consequently undergo          high rates of MI nondisjunction In the presence of          RecYF protein the checkpoint would be active          thereby allowing the achiasmatic chromosomes sufficient          time to reorient and undergo distributive segregation          Meiotic progression in           spo            rec  null mutants of budding          yeast is accelerated     supporting our hypothesis          that Rec may participate in an MI nondisjunction          checkpoint          As an alternative but not mutually exclusive          mechanism Rec protein may participate directly in the          machinery of distributive segregation In female meioses          of           D melanogaster  heterochromatic          pairing of homologs can substitute for chiasmata to          ensure bipolar spindle attachment of bivalents and          subsequent distributive segregation        Rec          may serve a similar role in maintaining a paired or          pseudopaired state between achiasmatic chromosomes          prior to the first meiotic division In support of this          possibility Spo of mice colocalizes extensively along          homologously synapsed chromosomes during pachytene and          dissociates when the homologs segregate from oneanother          during anaphase of MI                              Rec has a role in equational chromosome          segregation during Meiosis II that is dependent upon its          active site tyrosine          Cytological and genetic data each demonstrated that          the           recD null and           recYF active site mutants          frequently suffer chromosome segregation errors during          MII Figures   Table  This role for Rec in          equational chromosome segregation may be conserved as           spo mutants of           Sordaria macrospora also exhibit          frequent MII nondisjunction S Tesse A Storlazzi S          Gargano and D Zickler personal communication          Irregular partitioning of chromosomes during the second          meiotic division has also been reported in fission yeast           rec mutants     so MII          missegregation may be a relatively common fate for          chromosomes in hyporecombination mutants As described          previously in this paper and elsewhere     the          biology of fission yeast facilitates the identification          of MII segregation defects that are difficult to detect          in other organisms that terminate meiotic progression or          produce inviable meiotic products as a consequence of          defects in meiotic chromosome dynamics          Although they exhibit a striking difference in their          apparent MI nondisjunction frequencies the           recD null and           recYF active site mutants          manifest at most a twofold difference in the absolute          frequency of meiotic diploids exhibiting MII          missegregation patterns Figures   Table           Catalyticallyinactive RecYF protein apparently          cannot enhance the fidelity appropriate MII segregation          relative to MII missegregation levels in cells lacking          Rec entirely We therefore propose that Rec protein          mediates a signal strictly dependent upon its active          site tyrosine that is required for the equational          division of MII          There are two main hypotheses as to the nature of the          signal First Rec protein itself may participate in          the signal transduction In           pat           ts meioses Rec appears to persist          until about the time of the second meiotic division N          Herrera and S Forsburg personal communication so          Rec is available at the right time Alternatively some          aspect of the crossovers or chiasmata may transduce the          signal This could involve structural components that          persist on chromosomes at the positions where          recombination and chiasmata had previously occurred or          could involve a diffusible component generated by          recombination events          At present two hypothetical mechanisms by which a          Recdependent signal affects MII are proposed First          Recdependent recombinationdependent signals might          trigger a block after MI thereby allowing cells to skip          a frequently irregular MII division     However the          majority of the           rec mutant meioses show evidence          of two meiotic divisions Figure  and many of the          meiotic diploids exhibit mixed MI and MII missegregation          patterns for centromere linked markers on the three          different chromosomes Table  In the absence of PSS          which does not occur at significant levels in           rec mutants     such mixed          segregation patterns can only be generated by a          combination of errors in both reductional and equational          segregation A second hypothetical mechanism takes into          account the coordinate twostep release of sister          chromatid cohesion that is essential for the two meiotic          divisions     Recdependent or          recombinationdependent signals may be required for the          proper maintenance andor dissolution of          centromereproximal sister chromatid cohesion in MII          These and other hypotheses regarding the unambiguous          requirement for Rec in MII remain to be tested                            Conclusions        The role of Spo Rec in the initiation of meiotic        recombination via catalysis of dsDNA breaks is conserved        and likely universal among eukaryotes The         rec null and active site mutants        are achiasmatic and as anticipated Recdependent        crossovers chiasmata are required to ensure proper        reductional chromosome segregation in MI In the absence of        Rec protein and crossovers a backup distributive        achiasmatic segregation system operates successfully on        up to half of the chromosomes that would otherwise undergo        MI nondisjunction Presence of catalytically inactive Rec        protein enhances the fidelity of this distributive        segregation system In addition catalytically active Rec        protein or Recdependent recombination is required for        faithful chromosome segregation during MII                    Methods                  S pombeculture          Strain genotypes are listed in Table  Culture media          and
