                            Hepatitis B is a serious global public health problem but is preventable with safe and        effective vaccines that have been available since  Despite these vaccines about         billion people have been infected with hepatitis B virus HBV and more than  million        have lifelong infections These chronically infected people are at high risk of death from        cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer which both kill about  million people each        year        Suppression of viral replication in chronic carriers of HBV is an effective approach to        controlling disease progression Current antiviral therapies include lamivudine and        alphainterferon but longterm resolution of the disease is disappointing because of low        seroconversion rates and the development of drugresistant viral mutants        In this months         PLoS Medicine  Lisa F P Ng and colleagues describe the identification        of a host factor that has a significant effect on viral replication efficiency The team        began by examining the serum viral load of a group of carriers of hepatitis B in relation        to the HBV genome carried They found a significant association between high serum viral        load and a natural sequence variant within the HBV enhancer II regulatory region at        position  Upon testing all four possible  variants the A variant had the        highest transcriptional activity        Further investigation of this enhanced transcriptional activity revealed evidence of        possible interaction with host DNA binding proteins The team found that a protein present        in the human hosthnRNPKcould be isolated by direct binding to a viral fragment derived        from the HBV variant of these infected patients        hnRNPK has previously been shown to be involved in several cellular functionsfor        example as a regulator of signal transduction and of gene expression On further        examination of the role of hnRNPK in HBV replication they established that hnRNPK is        capable of acting on the full length of HBV rather than just a partial fragment They        compared four fulllength replicative HBV clones identical except for a single base change        at position  that were transfected with two different hnRNPK expression constructs and        showed that A was more efficient at promoting replication than the other three        variants        To further show the role of hnRNPK in HBV replication the team tested the effect of        overexpression and downregulation of the cellular protein Using siRNA designed to        reduce endogenous hnRNPK they showed suppression of both hnRNPK mRNA and HBV viral load        whereas a control siRNA had no effect on HBV viral load        Despite these findings the mechanism behind hnRNPK on HBV replication needs further        exploration the authors say concluding that viral replication efficiency was determined        by a combination of viral sequence and interaction with specific host proteins However        they suggest that these results indicate that although drug development of antivirals is an        established research avenue targeting the host is an untapped opportunity        They describe parallels with antiEGFR antibody treatment of breast cancer cells which        produced a decrease in cell replication rate and corresponding reduction in hnRNPK        expression levels this result suggested that hnRNPK levels could be modulated by antiEGFR        treatment thus highlighting new treatment options for altering the HBV viral load in        chronic carriers        The authors conclude that the future of longterm viral clearance will require        combination therapy of targeting the virus directly blocking host support proteins and        using immunomodulating agents
