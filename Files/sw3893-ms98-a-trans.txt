        okay  so have you had a project recently     well as about as a matter of fact about two years ago right now uh ive completely and totally remodeled and restored my kitchen   thats a project   yeah i uh i tore out the uh walls all the way down to the studs and started over we had had a uh the kitchen weve we had was um   uhhuh   had a paneling in it dark paneling and and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark in here and old cabinets and uh counter tops   umhum   at first i was we were just gonna paint the thing and you know how everything just sort of grows   yes   and uh so i ended up just just tearing tearing out the whole place and uh putting sheet rock in and building my own cabinets with ceramic tile on the counter tops and just everything  new floor   you must you must be pretty handy   well uh im fairly good at it not not not enough to be professional or anything but i can do my own   so you did the tile counter tops how do you like that   yeah umhum i love that its its really pretty we had just uh Formica and when i built the new cabinets uh i looked into this tile deal and i thought well you know i think we can probably do this   umhum   and um it was uh it was not even not hard at all um it just i just followed the instructions the basic instructions that you use with the tile and uh theyre not hard at all really its just about anybody can do that   umhum did you have or do you have any problem with staining of the grout   no not at all um uh what we what ive been doing is just using some like bleach and it uh gets it clean but it does it has browned over the the couple of years   uhhuh umhum   you know but it really dont look that bad even though it has gotten brown you know what i should have done now that i think about it was used brown colored grout   and just start out with that and uhhuh   and thats right thats right you know because it does stain some i mean you could whiten it but i never have   well how long did it take you to complete this   um about three months probably three or four months   thats not bad considering you did it yourself although im sure it was a real pain to have to live you know with everything   yeah yeah well it was for a while the worst part about it was we had to do it when i got to the sink part over here what i did was i left this cabinet just about this one wall where the sink is to the very last   umhum   and um i figured well you know ill remodel the rest of the kitchen and then when we get to that point ill do that last because we so we can keep the sink as long as possible   umhum   and then we had we were without a sink about a week or a week and a half or so and um what we had to do was just take the dishes and uh put them in a big dish pan   uhhuh   and you get water from the bath tub and then rinse them in you know for with the bath water not not in the tub  but youre just letting it run under there you know   no i know what you mean  sounds to me like the perfect excuse that your wife didnt cook for about three months   real really  yeah we did eat out a lot   did you have any major catastrophes or anything   not a thing not a thing i almost thought i had cut through a water pipe in the wall but i didnt i just nicked it a little bit it wasnt all the way through  and now that was about it   uhhuh   well thats quite an undertaking uh you know   yeah  well have you have you done anything like that or or anything smaller or   well nothing that big a deal my husband did um he made a cedar closet and shelving out in the garage uh for us which really was nice um   umhum   i dont know how it is in Biloxi we Dallas has no basements i suspect Biloxi   oh no no theres nothing like that here either   yeah well we come from the Midwest where theres basements and you know so you have to make storage where you can   uhhuh oh yeah   and uh he bought the sheeting uh the cedar sheeting and put that in and i didnt know for certain how that would you know how that would work out if it would be tight enough to keep the bugs and all out but   yeah sure   its been great we havent had any problems with moths or anything and the extra he finished the outside painted it to match the uh garage walls which is white and its just beautiful it really added a whole lot you know storagewise to the house   right right oh sure yeah it does   but uh i think the only glitches he ran into on that i put a few nails in it so i consider myself a partner in this  but   thats right you are and youre and youre half and half   yeah right the only thing we had to do is down at the bottom of the doors he had to put in oh like some extra closure because even though he thought that the um the plywood that he got was straight   yeah   somehow the humidity or something warped it a little bit while he was building it and we have to have a little closing you know to hold it down at the bottom   oh oh i understand yeah a little latch like yeah right   umhum but that that was about it but our house in only four years old so we havent done you know just a whole lot to it at this point   well yeah yeah everything is still so brand new yeah   umhum although were talking about adding uh the the ceilings here are high and the pitch of the uh roofs are very high and were talking about adding like some rooms up in the attic space   umhum oh i see   uh because there is so much space up there   well yeah sure   but uh i dont know that thats something we will undertake ourselves part of it well probably do you know like hanging the   no yeah now something like that i would probably have hire have to hire
