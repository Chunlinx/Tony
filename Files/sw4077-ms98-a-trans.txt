        how do you feel about gun control     well uh i mean i dont think that guns should be outlawed   um   but its going to a lot of the stuff that i mean all you do is to get guns   uhhuh   and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago   uhhuh   but i dont really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh i mean prevent that   well dont you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a drivers license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry   yeah that well do you even know what the procedures are now   i mean it varies from State to State   um   there is no national   but its kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it   uh in most States as long as you arent a convicted felon   yeah   you know or on probation or  you know other obvious things like that uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before you know be be obviously insane and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun   huh i didnt know that well thats pretty scary so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten   uh uh yes id probably id probably say about a five   thats where i would probably be     seems like its a good safe number to pick you know   well i mean i mean i dont really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better   uhhuh   because i mean i do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them wanting to have them but then again its just like all those nuts out there   uhhuh uhhuh  well you know uh uh other than that if you are looking at like you know country that you know uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much   it has because   well i mean yeah the uh the in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States   hum   uh you know i mean the problem though is you know they if the since the United States had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that i think you know if you were introduced you know any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already   yeah   you know so its so its really into a kind of a complex problem   well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta   uh im not really sure how bad it is ive ive not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up   yeah i know Dallas is   uh i mean i think you know in the  i mean i i think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years   i dont know if Dallas is in the top three but oh do you own a gun   uhhuh no ive ive thought about getting one if i get one i think i will probably you know get something i probably wouldnt get a hand gun i would probably get like a shotgun just for protecting myself you know from you know burglar type thing i do kind of live in the downtown area   uhhuh yeah   you know and shotguns are really good because you know theyre i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know   thats true   uh and you know you yeah i just dont i just dont understand these people you know that like when they they decide theyre going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know they are probably going to miss the person and theyre going shoot and theyre going to shoot through five wall and hit someone you know       i mean a shotgun just just struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever   yeah   you pretty much you pretty much stop them and you dont then the actual shot doesnt go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much   well well now when i first moved to Dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun   uhhuh   but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it   uhhuh   so i finally ended up giving it back to him i said i dont want it i dont want to be responsible for it because   uhhuh   you know if youre not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i dont need it   uhhuh yeah that that really does scare me people you know that have guns because you know if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you     and they get it from you uhhuh   and you know youre pretty much dead you know because you youve just told the person that you youre about to kill them then   set them off   you know and and well i mean you you you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that  you are a real danger to them and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know stop you   yeah well thats why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know   uhhuh   i dont want it if i dont know how to operate you know if i dont really know how to use it and i just didnt want the responsibility   uhhuh um   so well well uh did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever   yeah the did it happen at a cafeteria or something   yeah right that kind of   uhhuh   i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns i would be scared selling guns to people
