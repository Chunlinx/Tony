        how do you get your news coverage     well um most of what i do is um listen to the news in the morning when im heading to work um we get uh we have two different stations here that run uh National Public Radio and i really enjoy the format in the morning and the evening when im driving home from work so thats where i get most of my stuff uh   uhhuh oh thats pretty nice   yeah we we also subscribe to the newspaper of course so we get the Washington Post here and its a pretty interesting newspaper   yeah right   and uh so its you know its its uh between the two i generally do okay every great once in a while i manage to uh listen to the evening news but not very often how about   yeah thats just about all i get is the evening news and the and the newspaper sometimes i wish the evening news was like an hour long instead of thirty minutes   yeah i dont blame you its its uh its   but that would be nice to have uh um you know all is it an all news uh radio station   yeah and it actually well no i its i guess what is it its um its kind of a talk radio station its run by a university here called American University or at least that the the general program that i listen to National Public Radio itself is um   uhhuh   a uh uh a syndicated thing thats run by a group that operates here in Washington uh but if you have any public radio stations in your area chances are pretty good   umhum   especially in Austin come to think of it uh that youre going to be able to get it down there uh   i i guess i never i never really tried that it probably is on the AM i know its not on FM   yeah well i dont know whatever your you know it it the normally the public radio stations are gonna be down at the low end of the dial you know around eighty eight and uh and so forth and and uh   yeah   this uh the two radio stations that run here one is a classical station and the other i guess if you had to categorize its kind of a bluegrass station or something um but uh yeah that thats im im dead certain some station in your area carries it because every once in a while theyll do little special features on Austin its a real interesting radio program because they they dont just cover   yeah well its probably picking up um KLBJ thats a real famous   umhum   um uh Lady Bird used to own it radio station here but um theyre not so much news as they are um uh as far as musicians and and things going on around Austin   umhum umhum um well thats very interesting well this comes on right in the evening as im driving home   you know umhum   and um what they do is they they give you uh about a five to ten minute news uh broadcast and then for the rest of the half hour they usually divide it up into two or three segments where they they cover   umhum   um topics either of current interest or every once in a while theyll just do kind of an indepth reporting on on some uh particular thing like yeah like perhaps for instance how a particular city is doing or something along those lines yeah its uh   some subject yeah well not bad that sounds pretty interesting   yeah its real good and it  it it uh the other thing is is is my politics are kind of liberal and and um so they have a tendency being public radio to sort of take a look at things from the populist point of view as opposed to being terribly sympathetic to the government although the you youve got to give them credit they do a great job of showing both sides of the story   right   and uh they arent afraid to poke fun at themselves either       which is something i really admire so if you watch the evening news which of the news commentators do you tend to like the most   oh i guess Dan Rather ill switch around im not really partial you know one like Monday i might have one and Tuesday i might have another one you know just to get a different view you know or just someone different  but uh   yeah yeah im the same way but the the evening news on TV its its really its so short that you just uh i dont feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the uh McNeil Lehrer report on public TV   yeah umhum   i sort of feel like that news program drags on too long   yeah yeah its a little draggy   and uh with you know with their little round table discussions and all that sort of stuff and i must admit i i used to try to watch it used used to make me feel like oh well this is uh something i should be watching   yeah until it gets a little boring though i know there is something better on   you know yeah exactly and   so it its pretty nice in that the newspaper here its its its only you only have one newspaper and um its its kind of biased   umhum   but um it its all right   which way which which way does it lean is it conservative or   yeah its very conservative i would say its very conservative but you know being its only you you dont have one in the evening and you dont have a choice   umhum umhum   and you know i dont i dont like that but other i have uh uh small newspaper community um thats oh its its um uh just in this general area it serves maybe twenty thousand people and uh its free and its real nice   umhum oh wow   yeah i really like it you yeah it its like the small hometown newspaper you know you can put your kids picture in there if they had a birthday or or something like that you know or some   thats good yeah well thats interesting
