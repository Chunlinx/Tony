        here we go   okay   okay Janet could you tell me what your thoughts are   well i think the idea of public uh health services is a good one i think that we all um perhaps have a civic duty but i dont know as though it should be uh and i dont know if this uh was my interpretation was that perhaps it should be uh like a forced thing um i think it should all be voluntary as it is now but um i do agree that i think it is a good thing because i dont know how else a lot of these um things could happen if they didnt have the volunteers to do it   yeah they uh um the example they gave was like the Peace Corps   umhum   uh im not so sure if i i agree with that see uh back in Roosevelts administration they had the CCC camps   umhum   and i dont know about down in your area but like up here they built bridges and they built uh uh waterways leading from reservoirs to reservoirs to get to the city   umhum   in fact in my area its its kind of a rural area and its and the waterways are still in place you know theyre uh theyre beautiful theyre all stone walled and it it just leads from the reservoirs way up in the hills and it just leads down into other reservoirs some of the bridges are still standing too i mean some of them need repair now   umhum   but because of the recession back then or the depression whatever you want to call it uh there was a lot of people out of work so the government brought them in i mean they they performed a a public service   uhhuh   but yet they were paid for it too   well thats true and of course there was the need there and they didnt have any other resource and and uh i guess it it served its purpose   right   right is that what it was meant to do but as you say they were paid and im not all that familiar with the Peace Corps although i have friends who have family members that are in it and um um they generally go abroad and and uh serve but they dont get a salary and they give up uh X number of years of their lives to do this   right yeah but they must get some compensation somewhere   um i know some people that just came back from South America and uh they they are degreed and once they got their degrees theyre a married couple and they went off they got uh some they got some compensation but it wasnt a whole lot   uh was was it like a sabbatical   yeah more like a sabbatical i would imagine and uh i guess a lot of it was a learning experience for them i i imagine it takes just different kinds of people   yeah   and now theyre uh back in school so maybe theyre people in the beginning that just want to be in a constant learning environment i i dont know   uh yeah like yeah   but uh   yeah i think i think we need it in this country   yes i i agree i so much so many of our things are going outside the country to benefit other nations and okay thats fine but what about here   right were uh   you know   you know were supposedly on the leading edge of technology which uh that can be disputed i guess by a number of other countries um i do now that our rapid transit system uh is in terrible shape i mean most areas of the country we dont have anything   umhum   where overseas uh they do their rail lines their their uh their subways are in much better condition than ours if we put if we put a force to work in this country building a network of rapid transit systems you know just from say outlying districts of downtown especially California where the i saw a program on uh PBS last night theyre saying the average   umhum   the average speed on the California freeways now in southern California is thirty six miles an hour and its roughly uh a two hour wait to get from the outskirts of downtown   umhum   and they figure by five years the average speed is going to be eleven miles an hour   ill be   thats thats atrocious   you know maybe weve um got a turn around here maybe in the beginning we thought it wasnt such a good idea but perhaps if we instrumented it here in the US rather than taking all that manpower out of the US and providing a service for people to join here and do some good we could come up with some of those things   we have we have a lot of people that are in college and we have a lot of people that  for one reason or another that that cant get into college either they cant afford it or or perhaps they dont have the abilities   umhum   thats all more manpower and and one of the ways where were we were coping with that was they were going into the military and they were getting  a semblance of an education   right   now the militarys laying off   umhum   uh i think there should be mandatory that people that are not in school should at least get into some kind of a career program i mean they can help build the United States back up   thats uh thats a good thought now see i hadnt thought about it that way my first uh thought was when they mentioned that was to people who go abroad and do service abroad and perhaps there might be as you say more of an effort here needed   yeah   and weve done weve sent people abroad and the people that do go abroad are are usually um college educated   yes thats true   theyre taking the knowledge that we have and bringing it with them which is which is fine because in the long run if we educate those people and we build up their economy theyre going to want to buy products that we make   umhum   so but i dont know if that if that is really taken place like the Philippines with the the massive corruption in there i mean a few people got it and the rest of didnt   yes   the Middle East same thing a few people got it and and the rest of them dont so in theory if you build up their economies and help these people yes it can work but the corruption at the top i think limits that   i agree it doesnt always work that way the way it was intended and then the people change in this country too and not and are not able to see it through our administration changes also   yeah   so   yeah im kind of uh a dreamer i guess i still i still believe in we could put this country back to work we could bring the steel mills back in we could we could build our own rails we could we could create all kinds of jobs   umhum   if we just had the incentive like um im not sure who started the national highway system you know the the freeways   umhum   i dont know if it was if it was if it was Johnson or Kennedy or sometime before them the way they decided that yes were going to have uh  i guess weve got some of the best roads in the world we could do that too i mean we could we could get a national program Kennedy had a national program to land uh a man on the moon   umhum   and we did it so i i think if we if we put our minds to it we can do just about anything we want yeah sounds like im on a soapbox   i i think im inclined   but its been interesting its been an interesting soapbox so   yeah theres i just i just remember how it used to be and it seems like that   umhum   everythings just deteriorating you know you you cant go anywhere without waiting in line you cant um   now i thought that was just a sign of the times were all stressed out thats what theyre trying to tell us that that we now get upset because we have to wait in line or wait in traffic but in in reality theres so much more traffic and so many more lines and really like you say something needs to be done about that too   yeah it just seems to be a waste of time   umhum   i mean it takes it takes longer and longer to get back and forth to work   umhum   were adding to the pollution in the in the world whether thats creating the greenhouse effect or not whether it is or not uh its still being debated   apparently uh if we could get like we were discussing some people involved in this country like they want to be involved in other countries maybe we could do some some real good here you know and not take so long to do it   yeah   i think it could happen   it could the the main thing is um like you said earlier in the conversation if we make it a mandate and say you have to do it then were going to create all kinds of problems   thats very true   but i dont see why we cant say that i dont see why we cant you know you contribute well you dont go to school well spend two years doing something   or put these people that are in prison you know   we have a welfare system that   is defeating itself because they get more money from welfare than they can working at ordinary jobs   thats very true   so whats the incentive for them to go to work   yes exactly   the prison population right thats theres i dont know how many millions of people now are incarcerated   umhum   which is uh which is a huge drain on society   umhum   what do you do with those people   and supposedly were uh reeducating them and putting them back out in the public so give them some public service   yeah but are we really doing that educating i i suppose some   i dont know i i suppose to somebodys way of thinking we are but um i know that when they do get out the majority of them arent able to find jobs are they or get back into society because they have that stigmatism   no thats right and as much as you say yes you know ive paid my debt to society and all that its still there   umhum   and theyre going to be apprehensive and if you had to choose between one or the other you know you wouldnt you just wouldnt look at those people   thats very true if you had uh uh a public health organization in the US that took and say a lot of the
