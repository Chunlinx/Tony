                                 Just Say No            Every meeting of the HouseJudiciary Committee about the Lewinsky impeachment inquiry ends with the samebizarre ritual The Democrats go to the nearest microphone call thecommittees conduct of the inquiry unfair and accuse the Republicans ofpartisan warfare Then the Republicans step before the same microphone denythat the inquiry is partisan and insist that everyone is getting along Nowere not say the Democrats Yes we are snap the Republicans            Its nothard to figure out whos going to win this fight Politics like litigation andsports is stacked in favor of the defense In football its far easier todisrupt an  yard drive than it is to sustain it In soccer one good tackleruins a brilliant sequence of passes In a criminal trial one slickcrossexamination of a states witness can plant enough doubt to hang the juryAnd in Congress every eruption of partisanship or unfairness whether realor manufactured bleeds away the institutional credibility necessary to impeachthe president            The conservatives who dominate todays GOP dont like toview politics this way Cursed with a combination of irrational idealism andirrational narcissism they insist on interpreting public opinion and behaviorin ideological terms On ABCs This Week a few days ago WeeklyStandard Editor and Publisher Bill Kristol argued that the politics of theimpeachment inquiry reminds me of  It was four years ago on this datethat the Republicans announced the Contract With America and the consensus inWashington was  Republicans had overreached Critics of the GOP weremistaken then and are mistaken now Kristol suggested The underlying tide Ithink is antiClinton            Of coursehardly anyone who voted in  knew what was in the Contract With America Thecontract was designed not to win the election but to spin it by inflating anessentially negative referendum on Clinton and his health care reform plan intoan affirmative referendum on the conservative agenda The public wasntendorsing conservatism when it threw out the Democrats in  any more thanit was endorsing liberalism when it turned against the GOPs proposals forMedicare reform in  and  It was just saying no            In recent polls Americans have essentiallysaid no to the question Should Clintons behavior be tolerated But onceIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starr released his oversexed report and Republicansin Congress began parlaying it into impeachment proceedings the questionchanged to Should he be impeached Again Americans said nonot because theylove Clinton or his agenda but because they dont trust the impeachmentprocess any more than they trust national health insurance Democrats inCongress are deliberately and successfully exacerbating that mistrust            SomeRepublicans understand this strategic disadvantage but mistakenly think thatHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich is the problem They propose that House MajorityWhip Tom DeLay RTexas replace Gingrich as the GOPs high profile bad copBut no matter who becomes the bad cop Democrats will attack him and themedia always hungry for conflict will flock to the fight Other Republicansconsole themselves by noting that some Democrats will vote for a formalimpeachment inquiry Theyre missing the point The longer the inquiry dragson the more it will invite resentment acrimony and backlash Converselysome Democrats worry that by accusing Gingrich and the GOP of bias Clintonsallies are making a nonimpeachment deal more difficult But who says Clintonreally wants a deal From a purely political standpoint now that hesconfident he wont be convicted in the Senate his best move might be to letthe GOP antagonize more and more voters by marching all the way to animpeachment vote            Recognizing the futility of arguing with the DemocratsHouse Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde RIll has begun to yield to theirdemands He agreed to send a bipartisan staff delegation to inspect documentsStarr withheld from Congress which Democrats suspect may include exculpatoryevidence ordered a hearing to address the Democrats query on whatconstitutes an impeachable offense and endorsed the idea of giving theDemocrats subpoena power The Democrats would like to make process procedure the issue Hyde observed We are doing our level best to be credible Ifwe arent credible what we do amounts to nothing            Hydesaccommodations are noble but futile The Democrats can always find furtherunfairness and partisanship to complain about No sooner had Hyde announcedhis concessions than Democrats amended their objections The hearing onimpeachable offenses should have been at the committee level they argued andthe delegation to examine Starrs records should include committee membersthemselves not just staff These are concessions no question admitted RepBarney Frank DMass But its still not bipartisanship            The Democrats will be satisfied only if theinquiry is transformed so thoroughly that the GOP no longer stands to gain fromit Democrats would like to investigate Linda Tripps encouragement of thealleged quid pro quo in which Monica Lewinsky supposedly secured help in herjob search in exchange for submitting a false affidavit denying her affair withClinton Theyd like to investigate Tripps taping of Lewinsky as well asStarrs use of those tapes to launch his investigation A federal grand juryrecently questioned conservative mogul Richard Mellon Scaife in connection withalleged witness tampering by Clintons enemies in Starrs Whitewaterinvestigation Democrats wont shut up about partisanship unless Republicansagree to include those matters in the inquiry And at that point from aRepublican standpoint the inquiry isnt worth it            So how dothe Republicans break through the Democrats defense and carry the ball intothe end zone The cynical answer is They dont They punt or fumble and theDemocrats carry the ball the other way Indeed the Democratic counteroffensivehas already begun Bill and Hillary Clinton are on the campaign trail accusingRepublicans of substituting partisan impeachment proceedings for legislation toaddress the nations ills Clinton ally James Carville is conferring withliberal activists about a nationwide ad campaign to bolster Clinton anddenounce Republicans for bogging down Congress in scandal cynicism andpartisanship Eventually the Democrats will overreach again and the publicever wary will turn against them Its not about ideology Its aboutcautiousness
