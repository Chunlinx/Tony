                    Background        Since the initial report by Connolly et al    of        valvulopathy in women taking the combination of        fenfluramine and phentermine fenphen controversy has        surrounded the issue of associated risk Initial reports of        remarkably high prevalence of aortic and mitral        regurgitation AR and MR as assessed by echocardiography        in five separate populations    were subsequently        supported by most      but not all investigators            These uncontrolled reports were soon followed by a series        of studies in which prevalence of        echocardiographicallydefined AR and MR were assessed in        persons who had taken fenfluramine dexfenfluramine        phentermine or combinations of these medications and        compared to unexposed matched control populations                    The most recent of these studies        found  of persons currently taking fenfluramine or        dexfenfluramine had mild or greater AR or moderate or        greater MR similar to the very high prevalence reported in        older studies     The only prospective study found a        significant exposurerelated increase in the risk of        clinically diagnosed valve disease among users of        fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine but not phentermine                   Some recent reviews conclude that the risks associated        with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are similar real but        modest for aortic valve disease and barely detectable for        mitral valve disease phentermine appears not to be        associated with increased risk               Nevertheless interpretation of the results of these        studies has been so varied that some authors have even        questioned any causal relationship for fenfluramine        exposure     However analyses to date have not        formally considered major biases that would act to deflate        the actual risk associated with fenfluramine use Most        investigators have calculated only prevalence ratios or        prevalence odds ratios dividing the prevalence or odds of        valve disease in exposed persons by prevalence or odds in        an unexposed control group This approach contrasts with a        prospective design wherein relative risk is calculated        using only newly arising incident cases and with        conventional casecontrol studies in which an estimate of        relative risk the odds ratio can be made If persons with        prior valve disease are included in both the exposed and        the unexposed groups a gross underestimate of actual risk        may occur The dilution in estimated risk is likely to be        particularly important if the background prevalence among        unexposed persons is substantial but the incidence of new        cases during the observation period is small as        illustrated in figure  While other investigators have        noted this potentially large bias     no attempts at        appropriate correction have been made        A further source of underestimated risk in prior        studies is the lack of consideration given to the time        element In a typical prospective study both the exposed        and unexposed groups are generally followed for an equal        period of time However no prior echocardiographic study        examining anorexic drugassociated valve disease has        considered the fact that measurable differences in        prevalence have arisen among persons exposed to these drugs        over a remarkably short period of time usually a few        months whereas the prevalent valve disease in the        comparison groups likely arose over a number of years or        even a lifetime        In this metaanalysis we estimated incidence rates        based on duration of drug exposure and compared these to        expected incidence rates in order to obtain unbiased        estimates of relative risk for the development of AR and        MR                    Methods                  Study Search Selection and Data Extraction          We first sought to identify all published studies with          echocardiographic assessment of cardiac valve          regurgitation in persons exposed to fenfluramine or          dexfenfluramine and in suitable controls The search for          studies included examination of prior metaanalyses and          reviews MEDLINE search using the terms fenfluramine or          dexfenfluramine diet drugs echocardiogram or          echocardiographic and valvular heart disease and          review of references of identified articles For this          analysis we included only studies that reported duration          of medication use In some studies results were reported          separately by duration of exposure Each duration group          was considered as a separate observation if number of          persons exposed number of cases observed and duration          of exposure was reported                          Data Synthesis          We first evaluated studies reporting echocardiographic          prevalence of FDApositive valvulopathy mild or greater          AR and moderate or greater MR    among subjects who          had taken either fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine alone          or in combination with phentermine and in matched          controls            In most of these          studies echocardiograms were performed after the drugs          had been discontinued and were read without knowledge of          prior drug exposure by multiple readers table  In          some studies control subjects were derived from patients          assigned to placebo in a formal randomized trial of          fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine In others controls          matched for age gender and BMI were recruited and          examined          In a true prospective study persons with valvulopathy          at baseline would be excluded from followup or          calculation of incidence rates Since only one study had          performed echocardiography on a substantial number of          subjects prior to initiation of the diet drugs              some means of estimating and correcting for the baseline          prevalence in the other studies was necessary For this          analysis we have used the unexposed control groups for          each study to provide such an estimate Thus the          prevalence rate in the control unexposed group of each          study was used to estimate the number of background cases          expected in the exposed groups Any cases observed          beyond this background number were considered new or          incident cases This approach is mathematically          equivalent to modelling the rate of change in prevalence          in the exposed group with the control group providing the          initial estimate of prevalence The concept is          illustrated in figure using data from Jollis et al              Duration of drug use provided the time factor to          estimate incidence in the exposed groups Two studies          which did not report duration of drug exposure were          therefore excluded from this metaanalysis                        Of major importance in this analysis is the estimation          of the expected incidence rate of FDApositive AR and MR          for estimation of relative risk The most          straightforward estimate of incidence would require a          sample of persons from the general population having no          AR or MR at baseline and who had a repeat echocardiogram          some time in the future While two studies performed          echocardiograms one year apart in sizable populations          both showed either no net progression or a net           decrease in regurgitation in the          unexposed control groups      These findings          underscore the infrequency of new onset FDApositive AR          or MR in the unexposed population          As an alternative estimate of expected incidence we          modelled change in prevalence in two populations In the          first data from the Framingham study were utilized              In that study the prevalence of FDApositive AR or          MR in persons under age  was zero The prevalent cases          in the following decade ages  were therefore          assumed to have arisen since age  For each subsequent          decade the increase in prevalence was assumed to have          arisen since the prior decade Additional assumptions          were that incident cases did not drop out that is there          was no differential mortality and change in prevalence          was the result of cumulative incidence that incidence          rates were constant within decades and that there was no          cohort effects ie that incidence rates in older          individuals when they were young were similar to the          incidence rates in currently young individuals Given          theses assumptions the change in prevalence is given by          the expression              i t          were i is the incidence rate per year and t is the          number of years between prevalence data points  for          full decades The equation was solved for i given the          observed change in prevalence between decades and time          elapsed using the end of each time period Incidence          rates were calculated for FDApositive AR and MR          separately for each decade in men and women These          estimated incidence rates are shown in table  As a          conservative estimate for relative risk calculations all          the rates were pooled as the unweighted mean of the          calculated rates in table for men and women          recognizing that this will yield a higher unexposed          rate than was likely present for the younger and          predominantly female populations exposed to the anorexic          drugs The average estimated Framingham incidence rates          for age  and over calculated in this manner were           per year for mild or greater AR and  per year for          moderate or greater MR          The second data set used to estimate unexposed          incidence rates was the control groups of the studies          listed in table  Cases of FDApositive AR and MR          reported in the control groups were assumed to have          arisen between age  and the average age of the control          group in each study A mean of the estimated incidence          from each study was calculated and weighted by the number          of controls per study Since FDApositive AR and MR are          found in other populations under age      the          assumption that all the observed AR and MR occurred only          after age  will result in conservatively high estimates          of incidence resulting in lower estimates of relative          risk          The observed number of incident cases of AR or MR in          the exposed group was calculated as the total number of          cases minus the number expected at baseline estimated          from the prevalence in the unexposed control group in          each study Any negative numbers were set to  one          instance of AR with under  months exposure The          expected number of cases in the exposed population for          Poisson analyses was calculated as the incidence rate          per year determined from the pooled rate in controls          obtained as described above multiplied by the duration          of exposure in years The probability of observing the          number of incident cases in the exposed group of each          individual study given the number expected from the          pooled estimate was calculated using a Poisson          distribution Confidence intervals for the percent of          incident cases during each study figures and  were          calculated as suggested by Fleiss for observed versus          expected proportions     Effect of exposure duration          and other factors on percent of incident cases during          each study was tested in a weighted analysis of          covariance using the GLM procedure in SAS SAS Institute          Carey North Carolina          Relative risks were calculated as incident cases           personyears in exposed  cases in controls           personyears in controls Personyears in the exposed          group were calculated as total number exposed  cases          expected at baseline  mean duration of drug use          reported for each study Personyears in unexposed          controls were calculated as total number in the control          group  the number of years from age  to the average          age of the group Note that pooled incidence rates for          the unexposed were not used in this analysis so as not          to inflate power rather each study provided its own          estimates Significance and confidence intervals for the          relative risks were calculated as suggested by Kleinbaum          et al    for a density type followup study This          approach tests the difference in incidence between two          groups given that followup time may be different in the          exposed and unexposed populations                            Results        Raw data from each study is given for mild or greater AR        in table and for moderate or greater MR in table         Estimates of unexposed incidence of AR and MR utilizing        data from the control groups in these studies yielded        values approximately  higher than estimates from the        Framingham study  per year for mild or greater AR        and  per year for moderate or greater MR To provide        conservative estimates of relative risk these rates were        used to calculate the expected number affected given the        duration of exposure in each study for Poisson analyses in        tables and  Estimates of incident cases and relative        risks based on personyears are also given in tables and                The percent of incident cases of AR during each study        calculated without dividing by duration of exposure for        this analysis was found to be clearly related to duration        of exposure This is illustrated in figure  In a weighted        analysis of covariance including all the studies in table         R was  suggesting that  of the variance between        the studies of the percent of incident cases was explained        by duration of exposure The coefficient relating estimated        incidence to duration in months was  p          In contrast time since stopping drug and dose        were not related to estimated incidence in this analysis        All but three of the  confidence intervals from these         point estimates included the regression line suggesting a        fairly homogeneous estimate of risk Remarkably the        predicted cumulative incidence after  year exposure was         The weighted estimate of incidence from all studies        combined ignoring duration of exposure was   CI           z   p   during a mean        exposure time of  months This contrasts with an        expected incidence of  in  months at the rate        estimated from the pooled control groups of these studies        The summary relative risk for AR was   CI           p          The percent of incidence cases of moderate or greater MR        was lower than AR in these studies There was no        significant correlation with duration of exposure R          regression coefficient   p   or with        dose or time since stopping drug by weighted analysis of        covariance using continuous variables The percent of        incidence cases was marginally greater in those exposed for         months or more    mean  SE compared to        those with lower exposure times    p          Overall estimated incidence was markedly greater than        expected in most studies as shown in figure and table         The weighted estimate of incidence of MR including all        studies was   CI    z   p          during an average exposure time of  months        with an expected incidence of  in  months based on        the pooled control groups The summary relative risk for MR        was   CI    p                      Discussion        Prior summary estimates of risk for developing        FDApositive AR and MR have been based on simple        comparisons of prevalence in persons exposed and unexposed        to anorexic drugs For example without making any        adjustments to observed prevalence rates Loke et al           reported a summary relative risk of   CI           z   p   for FDApositive AR and          CI    z   p   for MR utilizing        most of the same studies included in the present report        Our findings suggest that these estimates are strongly        biased toward the null because of counting background        prevalent cases as incident cases in both exposed and        unexposed groups a form of nondifferential        misclassification and not considering the remarkably short        period of exposure during which most observed differences        in prevalence arose In contrast we found much higher        relative risks using methods to correct for these biases         for AR and  for MR both p          Furthermore our estimates of percent incident cases of AR        among exposed were highly correlated with duration of        exposure and appeared homogeneous suggesting a        biologically relevant strong causal relationship        Are these high estimates of risk unprecedented In the        only true prospective study comparing risk in exposed and        unexposed persons Jick et al    identified clinically        diagnosed valvular disease using the large UK General        Practice Research Database Using the data provided in the        paper a valvespecific analysis may be performed comparing        incidence of aortic and mitral disease in those exposed for         months or longer versus all others The results reveal a        relative risk of  for AR and  for MR both with p          by chisquare Since the few cases that arose        within  months of exposure are included in the unexposed        group in this analysis even these high risks represent an        underestimate Nevertheless the close similarity in the        estimate of AR relative risk to the present study is        remarkable The much higher risk for MR compared to our        estimate may represent fundamental biological differences        between clinically apparent valve disease and        echocardiographically assessed valve disease        A single study among those reviewed in our metaanalysis        excluded persons with valve disease using echocardiograms        taken prior to starting drug     That study yielded        estimates of AR and MR incidence that were similar to our        summary estimates further supporting our findings The        fact that so many studies have observed statistically        significant differences in prevalence after relatively        short exposure to drug suggest that underlying incidence        rates of new valvulopathy must be extraordinarily high        compared to the expected low unexposed rate        Data provided in this study can be used to estimate the        relative contribution of exposure to fenfluramines to        overall incidence of echocardiographically defined        FDApositive AR and MR Given that approximately  of        the population of the United States had used anorexic        prescription drugs mostly fenfluramine and        dexfenfluramine between  and             approximately  and  of all FDApositive AR and MR        respectively could be attributed to fenfluramine or        dexfenfluramine use Among those who had actually taken the        drugs the attributable fraction rises to  and  for        AR and MR respectively        Why was there no apparent effect of exposure duration on        MR incidence This may well be due to low power If only         of an incident case had been seen in the exposed group        of Hensrud et al    and  extra case had been seen in        the group exposed  months in Jollis et al    then a        significant logarithmic relationship between duration and        percent incident cases would have become apparent        illustrating the precarious nature of correlations when        events are few While we cannot claim such a relationship        does exist the relatively low incidence seen generally for        moderate or greater MR makes establishing strong        correlations difficult Importantly we cannot conclude        that a positive association between exposure duration and        incident MR does         not exist only that the current        studies are inconclusive regarding this relationship We        can conclude however that the current studies provide        sufficient power in aggregate to clearly demonstrate an        overall excess risk for developing MR        Another approach to expressing excess risk is the        calculation of number needed to harm NNH NNH may be        calculated as the inverse of the difference between risk in        exposed and risk in unexposed persons For example the        cumulative prevalence of AR was  per  in those        exposed to fenfluramines without regard to exposure time         cases among  exposed from table  compared to         per thousand among unexposed  cases among         unexposed for a NNH of  For MR the cumulative        prevalence was  per  in exposed  of         exposed from table  versus  per thousand  of         exposed for a NNH of  A risk difference as used to        calculate NNH is less subject to nondifferential        misclassification than is a risk ratio However        demonstrating association with graded exposures and        statistical methods to determine significance or confidence        intervals are well defined for relative risk but not for        NNH We have therefore emphasized estimates of relative        risk Importantly estimates of NNH as calculated by        differences between exposed and unexposed prevalence rates        shown above were very similar to NNH determined using        differences between our estimated month incidence rates        in exposed and unexposed NNH was  for AR and  for MR        by this approach further illustrating the internal        consistency of our analysis        Our study has several limitations There is no direct        measure of true incidence of AR or MR in the unexposed        population The only studies to perform repeated        echocardiograms separated by one year in both in large        numbers of unexposed persons found either no net        progression or net regression in their control groups             Because these studies did not report usable direct        measures of incidence we made several assumptions to        estimate unexposed incidence using raw data from the        Framingham study and from the studies reviewed here Our        observation that incidence rates estimated from both        populations were of a similar magnitude supports the        feasibility of this approach Further our estimate is        conservative For example using the Framingham estimates        would have yielded  higher relative risks Had we        subtracted the prevalence of FDApositive AR  and MR         seen in the CARDIA study    and considered the        time course of new valve disease development to commence at        age  the ending age of the CARDIA study the unexposed        incidence would have been approximately half the rate we        used and the relative risks doubled        Our estimate of apparent incidence of AR and MR among        the exposed groups is also based on several assumptions        However the strong consistent relationship between the        percent of incident cases of AR in each study and duration        of exposure suggests that our estimates were reasonable and        biologically relevant We acknowledge that there were a        number of differences between the study groups included in        our analysis There were differences in study design and        methods though most were quite similar fenfluramine or        dexfenfluramine doses though in most studies doses were        similar additional drugs used patient characteristics        interval between cessation of therapy and echocardiography        and completeness of followup However these differences        would likely add random error and therefore         decrease any observed correlation        Estimates of incidence among unexposed controls from each        study were more variable resulting in greater differences        between studies in estimates of relative risk This is not        surprising considering the relatively rare occurrence of        new onset AR or MR in unexposed middleaged men and        women        We have not formally considered other potential sources        of bias in our analyses These include measurement bias        related to acquisition and reading of echocardiograms            selection bias particularly in studies with        incomplete followup     and potential reversibility        of valvulopathy        If a reversible component        occurred rather quickly after stopping drugs then one        might expect a stable lower prevalence in studies        performed well after drugs were stopped with no        relationship between prevalence of valve dysfunction and        time off medication Indeed the most recently published        study which did not suffer from measurement bias showed a        high prevalence  of AR in persons taking fenfluramine        or dexfenfluramine at the time of the echocardiogram        similar to the older prevalence studies     Regarding        the potential reversibility of valve dysfunction great        caution must be exercised in assuming any substantial        reversal of valvular plaques as recent pathological        studies suggest a progressive nature to these lesions            Furthermore limited early apparent echocardiographic        improvement of acute rheumatic carditis has also been        recently demonstrated     The early improvement seen        in this setting certainly does not preclude later        progression of rheumatic valvular heart disease        In conclusion we have estimated risks associated with        use of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for developing        FDApositive AR and MR after correcting for two major        sources of bias Accordingly our estimates of relative        risk associated with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine use         for AR and  for MR are higher than in prior        reviews These findings lend strong support to the view        that fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are potent causal        factors in the development of both aortic and mitral        valvular heart
