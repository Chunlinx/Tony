                                 Jeffrey Toobin Hypocrite Part III            Its one ofthose gifts that keeps on giving New evidence of Jeffrey Toobins hypocrisyin his book A                VastConspiracy  arrives almost daily Todays installment focuses on theaspersions Toobin casts on Michael Isikoff whose reporting of the Flytrapscandal won a National Magazine Award for Newsweek             Toobinwrites that greed in the form of a desire to write books about thepresidents sex life motivated Isikoff and other Clinton enemies to act asthey did In a deceptivelycrafted passage on pages  Toobin quotes aSeptember  Linda Tripp tape in which Tripp says that Isikoff was workingon a book deal Hes doing an allthepresidents women kind of deal Toobinthen flatly asserts Isikoff was using Tripp as a source for the bookproject he had started with Glenn Simpson of The WallStreet Journal  who had by this point dropped out of the project Isikoffhad apparently even shared the working title of his volume with Tripp as hehad with othersthe title according to Toobin being All the Presidents Women                        Toobin thenblasts Isikoff for trying to talk Tripp into cooperating with him According toTripp Isikoff told her If I were to uh work with you and you know allowsome of this to get out into the mainstream media then that would set you upfor a book contract Toobin writes                           If eventsunfolded as Tripp said they did this was dubious ethical territory for thereporter If Isikoff and Tripp were both stoking the story so they could profitfrom it in the form of book dealsand not disclosing that fact to Isikoffsreaders as he had not in his August storythat would have been inappropriateto say the least Likewise it would have been wrong for him to advise Tripp onhow to position herself in the marketplace of Clinton sex books In the bookthat he did write on the case which was entitled Uncovering Clinton  Isikoff claimed that Tripp invented thisconversation with him If she did it is curious that Tripp knew the precisetitle of Isikoffs planned book moreover Tripp was obviously not lying abouther own interest in writing a book                        There aremany many things wrong with Toobins argument            First notethe clever use of the word if in the second sentence If Isikoff had beenwriting a book he might be accused of mercenary motives But Isikoff says hewasnt writing a book He confirms in UncoveringClinton  and to me that he had talked about cowriting a book withSimpson but says that they had dropped this idea over a month before the Tripptape after Matt Drudge ran a screaming headline suggesting that Isikoff washolding back juicy Kathleen Willey details which even Toobin concedes hewasnt for a book  Indeed Toobin himself pages before the above passage writes that after the midsummer Drudgeheadline Isikoff and Glenn Simpson decided to put Allthe Presidents Women aside for a while            Whatevidence does Toobin have that Isikoff isnt telling the truth and that thewhile had ended by Septemberwith Isikoff back to using Tripp as a sourcefor a book as opposed to reporting a possible article for Newsweek  Well Isikoff had told Tripp the precise titleof hisbook Except that Toobin got the title wrong The title of Isikoff andSimpsons proposed book according to both Isikoff and Simpson wasSecrets and Lies  not Allthe Presidents Women  The notion that Mike and I would be so lame as touse a clich like All The Presidents Women isperhaps the most insulting part of Toobins mistake says Simpson Simpsonalso told me that after Drudges report Isikoff was fairly petrified that hewould be pulled into a conflicted situation and that their book project wasmost emphatically dropped Isnt it likely that Tripp had simply read theDrudge Report and erroneously believed that Isikoffwas working on a book            Given thatwhat was so terrible about what Isikoff is alleged to have told Tripp He toldher she shouldnt publish her story herself but that she should let him haveit In other words hes trying to talk a source into giving a story to himand his employer Thats what reporters do and what theyre paid todo            Whats soterrible about writing a book anyway As Isikoff says Any big story canalways turn into a book A reporter would have to be a moron not to have thatthought somewhere in the back of his or her mind Maybe Toobin is right tothink that such incentives did not even exist a generation agoalthough Isuspect the incentives do more to bring out relevant truths than distort themand its not at all clear that prior to Clinton the incentives even appliedbooks about the presidents sex life Bob Woodward got rich off WatergateBut what journalist got rich writing about Nixons sex life or Fords orCarters or Bushsor Gary Harts for that matter Its easy to believe thatIsikoff would have done exactly what he did even if his only possiblepublication outlet was Newsweek and his onlyremuneration his salary since all of his reporting was supervised andsupported by his Newsweek editors            Toobin isof course being massively hypocritical here given that he too is nowprofiting from enclosing his reporting in hard covers How dare Isikoff write abook says Toobin in his book Was Toobins own judgment distorted by hispresumably large Random House advance Has he donated the money tocharity            Infact  kausfiles has learned after the Monica storybroke in early  Random House approached Isikoff who had no deal in theworks to write a book about it but then backed off because Toobin a big nameRandom author was already interested in doing one himself            It getsworse In May of  according to Isikoff when both he and Toobin hadpublishing deals Toobin actually proposed over lunch that he and Isikoff joinforces and coauthor their Clinton books At thatpoint of course most of what Toobin now criticizes in Isikoffs reportingincluding the role of Clintons enemies in advancing the scandal waswellknown If Isikoff was such a disreputable sleazemonger why would Toobinwant to write a book with him A Newsday story on this incident reports that Toobinsaid through a Random House spokesman  that Isikoff had approached himIsikoff insists it was the other way aroundhed invited Toobin to lunch butonly to pump him for info on Dennis Kirkland one of Paula Jones detractorsHe remembers being surprised when Toobin suggested they write the booktogether                        I believeIsikoff on this Neither Toobin nor Random House returned my repeated callsAnyway whoever suggested the arrangement Toobin doesnt deny considering itfor at least a day Why if Isikoffs so bad And shouldnt Toobin by his ownstandards have disclosed his book dealings with Isikoff to Vast Conspiracy readers            Theresmore Lets not forget that Toobin the man who now decries the balefulinfluence of book deals first made his mark betraying IranContra specialcounsel Lawrence Walsh for whom he worked as a lawyer by quitting to publisha book about the case before it was even over Theres not enough room onSlate s server to fully analyze Toobins possiblepsychological motives for indulging in the ridiculous innuendoes ofA Vast Conspiracy  But one is obvious hesprojecting                           PS Isikoff as Ive written earlier is a friend of mineIn my experience hes honest and conscientious Am I motivated to criticizeToobin in part by a desire to defend Isikoff from the slime in VastConspiracy  You bet But I wouldnt do it if I wasntconvinced Isikoff is right and Toobin wrong Im not that loyal afriend
