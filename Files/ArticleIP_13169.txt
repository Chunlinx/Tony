                                 War and Pieces            No movie in the last decadehas succeeded in psyching out critics and audiences as fully as the powerfulrambling war epic The Thin Red Line  Terrence Malicks return to cinemaafter  years Ive sat through it twice and am still trying to sort out myresponses which run from awe to mockery and back Like Saving PrivateRyan  the picture wallops you in the gut with brilliant splattery battlemontages and Goyaesque images of hell on earth But Malick a certifiedintellectual and the Pynchonesque figure who directed Badlands andDays                of                Heaven in the s and then disappeared is in adifferent philosophical universe from Steven Spielberg Postcarnage hissundry characters philosophize about their experiences in drowsy runicvoiceovers that come at you like slow bean balls Why does nature vie withitself  Is there an avenging power in nature not one power but two OrThis great evil Wheres it come from What seed what root did it grow fromWhos doin this Whos killin us robbin us of life and light First youget walloped with viscera then you get beaned by blather            Those existentialspeculations dont derive from the screenplays source an archetypal butotherwise downtoearth  novel by James Jones who also wrote From Hereto Eternity  about the American invasion of the South Pacific island ofGuadalcanal Theyre central to Malicks vision of the story however and notspecious In the combat genre the phrase war is hell usually means nothingmore than that its a bummer to lose a limb or two or to see your buddy gethis head blown off A true work of art owes us more than literal horrors andMalick obliges by making his theater of war the setting for nothing less than ameditation on the existence of God            He tells the story solemnly in three parts with abigdeal cast Sean Penn Nick Nolte John Cusack and a few other major starsJohn Travolta Woody Harrelson George Clooney dropping by for cameos Afteran Edenic prelude in which a boyishly idealistic absent without leave soldierPvt Witt Jim Caviezel swims with native youths to the accompaniment of aheavenly childrens choir the first part sees

O mysoul let me be in you now Look out through my eyes Look out at the thingsyou made all things shining            Malick puts a lot of shining things on the screensoldiers natives parrots bats rodents visions of Eden by way ofNational Geographic and of the Fall by way of Alpo Malicks conceptionof consciousness distributes it among the animate and inanimate alike almostevery object is held up for rapturous contemplation I could cite hundreds ofimages A soldier in a rocking boat hovers over a letter hes writing which iscrammed from top to bottom and side to side with script You dont know

overarching themeisnature twosided at war with itselfin the first few minutes but for allhis startling juxtapositions he never dramatizes it with anything approachingthe clarity of say Brian De Palmas Casualties of War  Besidesthe dialogue between Welsh and Witt The Thin Red Line s otherorganizing story involves a wrenching tug of war between Noltesambitioncrazed Tall and Capt Staros Elias Koteas

save lives and heroism can win a waror a battle he acknowledges But Staros is ultimately sent packing and Malicknever bothers to trace the effect of his action on the Guadalcanal operationIn fact the entire battle seems to take place in a crazed void Tall quotesHomers rosyfingered dawn and orders a meaningless bombardment to buck themen upitll look like the Japs are catching hell Soldiers shoot at

to ruminate onorder that he gets gummed up retreating to one of his gaseous multiplemouthpieces Where is it that we were together Who is it that I lived withWalked with The brother  The friend  One mind I think Id have aneasier time with Malicks metaphysical speculations if I had a sense of someconcomitant geopolitical onescentral to any larger musings on forces ofnature as viewed through the prism of war Couldnt it be that the German andJapanese fascist orders were profoundly antinatural and that the Alliescause was part of a violent but natural correction You dont have to buy intoSpielbergs Lincolnesque pieties in Saving Private Ryan to believe thattheres a difference between World War II and Vietnam or for that matterWorld War II and the invasion of Grenada or our spats with Iraq While he wasat Harvard Malick might have peeled himself off the lap of his pointyheadedmentor Stanley Cavell the philosopher and film theorist and checked out afew of Michael Waltzers lectures on just and unjust wars Maybe then hed viewGuadalcanal not in an absurdist vacuum the soldiers come they kill and arekilled they leave but in the larger context of a war that was among the mostrational in its aims if not its methods fought in the last severalcenturies For all his visionary filmmaking Malicks Zen neutrality sometimesseems like a cultivatedand pretentiousbrand of fatuousness            John Travoltas empty nightclub impersonation of BillClinton in Primary Colors  had one positive result It gave him ajumpstart on Jan Schlichtmann the reckless personal injury lawyer at thecenter of A Civil Action  Travoltas Schlichtmann is much more redolentof Clinton slick and selfish and corrupt in lots of ways but basically on theside of the angels too proud and arrogant to change tactics when all iscertainly lost Schlichtmann pursuedand more or less blewa civil liabilitycase against the corporate giants Beatrice and WR Grace over the allegedlycarcinogenic water supply of Woburn Mass Boston writer Jonathan Harr in thebook the movie is based on went beyond the poison in the Woburn wells to evokestopping just short of libel the poison of the civil courts where platoonsof overpaid corporate lawyers can drive opponents with pockets less deep andpsyches less stable into bankruptcy and hysteria            Director StevenZaillians version doesnt capture the mounting rage that one experiences whilereading Harrs book or even the juicy legal machinations that Francis FordCoppola giddily manipulated in his underrated adaptation of John GrishamsThe Rainmaker  But A Civil Action is a sturdy piece ofwork an oldfashioned conversion narrative with some hightech zipSchlichtmann doesnt take this orphan casebrought by the parents of severalchildren who died of leukemiabecause he wants to do good but because hefigures that Grace and Beatrice will fork over huge sums of money to keep theparents from testifying publicly about their childrens last days He mightsucceed too if it werent for Jerome Facher Robert Duvall the Beatricelawyer who knows how to keep Schlichtmann shadowboxing while his small firmsfinancial resources dwindle to nothing            Zaillian is at his most assured when he cuts back and forthbetween Fachers Harvard Law School lectures on what not to do in courtand Schlichtmanns fumbling prosecution The sequence has the extra dimensionof good journalism It dramatizes and comments simultaneously Plus it givesDuvall a splendid platform for impish understatement Duvall has become morefun to watch than just about anyone in movies Elsewhere Zaillian takes amore surface approach sticking to legal minutiae and rarely digging for thedeeper evil As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer  the outcomeof every scene is predictable but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat issurprisingly fresh He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollackas the spookily sanguine Grace CEO William H Macy as Schlichtmanns rabbityaccountant and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims Quinlanknows that when youre playing a woman who has lost a child you dont need toemoteyou reveal the emotion by trying not to emote            To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy thereal climax of this story isnt the downbeat ending of the book or the sleightof hand lets call the Environmental Protection Agency upbeat ending of themovie The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs sideand that remains on the bestseller list in hardcover and paperback for yearsThe climax is the movie starring John Travolta Beatrice and Grace made out OKlegally but some of us will never use their products again without thinkingabout Travolta losing his shirt in the name of those wastedaway
