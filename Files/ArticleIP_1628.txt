Harvards Museum of Comparative Zoology and published the firstattempted classification of an obscure group of blue butterflies known asPolyommatini  For years Nabokovs study attracted more attention fromliterary critics than from scientists But in  lepidopterists Kurt Johnsonand Zsolt Balint embarked on a new study of the butterflies and then comparedtheir results with Nabokovs The duos findings are published in Nabokov asLepidopterist An Informed Appraisal in the current issue of NabokovStudies  Of the seven generic names established by Nabokov five weredeemed still valid and the two

at the University of Rochester playedtwominute audiotapes consisting of short nonsense words such as bidakupadofor a group of monthold babies The infants they found listened longer tosubsequent tapes that didnt contain these words than to those thatdidsuggesting the babies had learned the words According to the Rochesterteam the findings suggest that our languagelearning abilities may have to
