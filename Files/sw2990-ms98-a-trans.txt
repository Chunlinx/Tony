                um i guess my music taste musical tastes uh run pretty much the gambit i listen to a little bit of everything   oh well thats good   uh yeah uh i i grew up in east Texas listening to mostly mostly mostly country type music country and western type stuff   uhhuh yeah   uh and of course uh grew up also with rock and roll so im thats pretty much ingrained   yeah   uh right now most of my musical uh experiences experiences are with radio   umhum   we listen to one of the local uh you whats usually the number one local rock type station uh adult contemporary soft rock Ron Chapman  right   hum yeah oh yeah yeah is that KVIL or yeah   and uh so we we listen to that uh pretty much all the time   huh well i grew up around here i grew up in Fort Worth   umhum hum   and uh its funny because KVIL back when i was a teenager was an AM station i think yeah and uh it used to have like the top twenty top forty all the time you know   right right   and i of course i was listening to rock music what what i called rock music when i was a teenager  now the music is so different than what i used to listen to that i dont know if i could could consider it the same but   yeah well its i i was just thinking uh you know we we say or KVIL says i think i think they call theirs uh adult contemporary   yeah yeah   uh which means soft rock or early early type rock music and and thats really what i what i consider rock and roll   right right yeah yeah well   its uh not rock   my husband and i are both that way we we both really like the Beatles a lot and um   right umhum well its thats funny because i even when i first heard the Beatles i couldnt stand them you know it took it took a a while before i really liked the Beatles   oh really thats funny well im probably older than you then  but but i uh i always thought the Beatles were great and   well i doubt that yeah i i might have been too old for the Beatles that might have been what it was  i was past that point when they came along uh but uh i i grew up uh listening to Elvis you know before even before the Beatles so   oh oh thats funny oh yeah yeah see i liked Elvis a lot and he was like my hero and now my little girl thinks its real funny because uh shell see him shell go ooh you mean you really thought he was neat   right yeah but uh but uh yeah but uh my uh like i said my my tastes run run the range we listen to uh you know even listen to a little bit of classical type stuff my my wife uh plays the piano   um   and she plays a little bit of that and so we you know we listen to that she plays you know whatever what she can what she wants to   yeah yeah well thats good   um yeah but uh i guess musicians or singers in particular uh uh Willie Nelsons one of my favorites you know so uh it uh   yeah i like Willie Nelson too   in the in the country and western rein uh vein i really im enjoying quite a bit of the country music now   yeah well see i the the reason i said my taste is probably different is i have always liked country music and my husband has always been just total rock   yeah umhum yeah   and so uh we never could agree on what we were going to listen to after we got married because id want to listen hear country and hed want to hear rock and we couldnt get along because his rock was too rock for me i like soft rock but i dont like some of the heavy metal stuff he was listening to     yeah   and um so both of us were real strong members of a church and uh we decided we start listening to contemporary Christian music so we started listening to one of the stations around here that we both really like it plays just Christian music all the time   uhhuh yeah   and weve gotten now where thats pretty much all we listen to and uh therere some really really talented artists thats you know song writers and singers that uh do just Christian music   umhum yes i uh right   so of course you know Amy Grant and people like that are pretty well known theres a guy named  Bruce Carroll and hes my favorite because he has a country sound but its Christian lyrics   umhum yeah umhum   and hes a wonderful song writer he won a an an is it Emmy or what does it Grammy its the Grammy awards they give for music yeah he won a Grammy for inspirational song of the year last year so   right lets see the the Grammy yeah uhhuh well our our daughter uh listens to uh to quite a bit to one of those uh i dont know which station it is she listens to   yeah   our son our son is into heavy metal and our daughters into the the the Christian type music   uhhuh yeah well thats neat   uh matter of face she went to a went to the concert down at uh Reunion last week uh   oh Sandy Patty and yeah well thats pretty neat well see im excited that kids these days are liking decent music and uh   Sandy Patty right yeah umhum   i mean all the songs of of course on on this station have real good good lyrics and good ideas and that kind of thing so i really encourage my daughter to listen to that and she right now she loves it i dont know   right yeah yeah yeah   if itll stick with her shes still young in elementary school so   oh yeah well thats our daughters an adult so but uh so shes   yeah well thats thats good that she still chooses that but you know i like the country sound there are several i like i like Willie Nelson i always like Don Williams my dad thought i was crazy but   yeah yeah oh yeah i love i love his uh   hes always been one of my favorites and um then my husband on the other hand he i guess when he was like in his early twenties really got into the heavy metal kind of stuff before we got married and   yeah umhum yeah   so then hed want to play that stuff and i was like oh thats giving me a headache   uh thats uh our son goes you know goes off into his room and and turns his on he hes not around much either either very very much but   yeah yeah yeah   hed go into his room and turn it up you know and wed do our best to to live with it or get him to turn it down so and uh   thats right     but uh you know its im not uh i dont uh dont find too much of the heavy metal stuff that i want to listen to   yeah yeah yeah well i still whenever they um have these advertisements on TV for um records that have like all the songs from the seventies i was i was in high school like from the early seventies and uh   umhum   so all that music brings back a lot of memories you know and im always thinking oh id like to have one of those albums but since we made this agreement that were going to listen to Christian music i think oh well ill probably set it on the shelf and  would never you know play it   lets see yeah thats yeah so instead so instead y ou buy Sandy Patty and Amy Grant and   yeah  thats right we buy things that we know the whole family can listen to   right that yeah that uh i was trying to think theres some  uh we go to the First Baptist Church over here in Richardson   uhhuh   and uh there some some of the musicians some of the young people from there that have become   oh thats neat   semi pro i guess musicians our daughters gone uh gone on a couple of choir tour things with the with the young peoples choir   uhhuh oh thats good yeah   and uh you know she she really gets into into that singing with that group you know and   yeah well see im an interesting person because i go to the Church of Christ and theres a lot of people at Church of Christ that think uh   uhhuh now thats you dont have music in the Church of Christ   thats right and and i think my personal opinion is theyre missing out on a lot and i love um this you know that KLTY thats what i listen to all the time and i   oh yeah   i love all the music that they play on there but i have a lot of people that go to church with me that kind of criticize that and think that uh its wrong and all this so uh it   yeah well i guess uh you know there there there are are ways to express your feelings and your beliefs and uh music is one of the ways of expression and you know its not uh   yeah yeah yeah well i told my husband the one thing i like about it is uh you know you kind of think about whatever you listen to i mean you just you may not realize youre doing it but you do and uh when i listen to Christian music then im listening im thinking about something good you know and   umhum right   ill be washing dishes or something and ill think about a song and itll bring back you know some ideas and so to me its just a good influence but theres still a whole lot of other music i you know really enjoy listening to my husband and i both kind of really got into REO Speedwagon   yeah right
