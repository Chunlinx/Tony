                       GaulicBread                        I thoroughly enjoyed readingUnmitigatedGauls Professor Krugmans interpretation of French elite thinking but Iwould quibble with one point            Krugmanmentions in passing that a unified European market and a common currencywill do almost nothing to create jobs In fact one way or the other EMUmatters a lot for jobs If policymakers stick to EMUs monetary and fiscalrules the policy stance will be on the tight side ie cyclical unemploymentwill go up or at least will not fall If in addition policymakers reducerigidities particularly in the labor market the initial consequence will bea rise in unemployment followed by an improvement with a delay of a couple ofyears see New Zealand the UK and the Netherlands for example Shouldpolicymakers ignore EMU rules and take it easy once EMU has started cyclicalunemployment may fall initially but at some stage higher inflation and adepreciating euro would force a course correction and unemployment would riseagain             GuntherThumann London                           PaulKrugman replies A common currency per se has got nothing much to do withemployment the rules of Maastricht which bear a dubious relationship to theactual requirements of such a currency are another matter                           OxfordBanalytica                        Although Why Do the GBother by the anonymous folks at Oxford Analytica was just chockfull ofsilly blather about globalization I was particularly struck by the vacuousnessof this sentence The liberalization of trade also effectively preventsgovernments from erecting protective barriers to boost the domesticeconomy            Theliberalization of trade by definition is precisely the lack of protectivebarriers like tariffs and import quotas Although Im sure its true that alack of protective barriers leads inexorably to a lack of protective barriersthis is hardly a profound insight At least I can be thankful that

                         Schlockto the System                        Thanks to David Plotz for hishumorous balanced and concise Assessment ofMarilyn Manson and the forces working against him I take issue with one pointin the articlethe issue of antecedents            Plotz rightly lists AliceCooper as a primary enabler of what Manson is doing now An even better casecan be made however for the importance of GG Allin and the Murder Junkiesas an influenceantecedent GG Allin created the same kind of talentlessdisgusting yet strangely compelling schlock that Manson puts out and combinedit with a stage show that would make Alice Cooper squeamish The differencehere is image management Allin had huge contempt for fame He avoided theconventional spotlight all he could He died of a heroin overdose in relativeobscurity            Untilrecently Marilyn Manson had worked in obscurity as well with just a slightlylarger cult following than GG Allin It was only when Manson acquiesced tothe hype machine created by his record label that he started getting rich andthe fundamentalists started getting angry                           RichArmstrong Denver                           RateCrimes                        In your June  Chatterbox youattack Newt Gingrich for telling a national radio audience that lower taxesmean less time at work and more free time when supplysiders have for yearsbeen saying that cutting taxes would spur more  not less work effortthereby speeding economic growth In criticizing Gingrich you stateEconomic theory tells us lower taxes do have contradictory effectstheyprompt us to work harder because we net more from each hour of labor and togoof off because higher total takehome pay means we can satisfy our needs moreeasily            In facteconomic theory says no such thing You have confused lower taxes with lowertax rates  Lower tax rates have conflicting effects on the workeffort of individuals for the reasons you stated Some tax cuts however donot raise the reward for work and therefore do not increase work effort Thebest example of this is the perchild tax creditthe centerpiece of theRepublican tax package Clearly this tax cut does not net more from each hourof labor Rather it is like winning the lotteryit makes individuals withchildren better off or wealthier and therefore reduces the need to work Inthis regard Gingrich is correct Economic theory predicts that the centerpieceof the Republican tax cut will mean less time at work which in turn means afurther reduction in tax revenues This may be good family politics but Ibelieve it is bad economic policy             RichHart Cincinnati                           Throw theBook at Him                        With regard to My Personal TradeDeficit I commend Steven Landsburgs use of personal experience with aBarnes  Noble bookstore in the next town to effectively explain themechanics of trade            In the second part of hisarticle however he passes judgmenta more ambitious undertaking Furtherbrowsing perhaps in a different section of the bookstore may be in order Hisconclusions            Foolishly excessive tradesurpluses are a greater danger than foolishly excessive tradedeficits  Thats because excessive trade deficits are selflimiting Ifyou run a trade deficit every year bankruptcy will eventually force you tostop But excessive trade surpluses can go on forever A perpetual tradesurplus is likely to mean youre either working too hard or consuming toolittle either way youre not getting enough enjoyment out of life            Really Bankruptcy is notharmless the debt is transferred to others customers suppliers taxpayersthe rest of society and the damage can and often does multiply beyond theoriginal foolishness The crash of  and the depression that followed isonly one dramatic example of such a domino effect            The realkicker is the last line Enjoyment of life is reduced when one produces morethan one consumes If Landsburg really has wandered over from the economicssection to the philosophy section of his bookstore and thought about this Idlike to hear his reasons             ChrisNoble Winchester Mass
