                                 Heaven and Earth            Giambattista Tiepolo the last of the great Venetian artiststhose masters of color andsuave worldlinesswas the supreme painter of ceilings and skies A properappreciation of his work can give you a pain in the neck In churches andpalaces around his native Venice and then as his fame spread as far afieldas Dresden and Madrid Tiepolo was without peer in executing the tricks thatmake for a believable scene in the heavens the figures foreshortened as ifseen from below the sturdy cloudbanks the shades of pink and blue that drawthe eye toward the infinite Perched so often on scaffolding as he paintedTiepolo rather naturally developed a fascination for things that hover and flyor flutter and fall            For thenext few months in celebration of the masters  th birthday NewYork City will host no fewer than four exhibitions devoted to Tiepolos workand to that of his associates Since ceilings and wall frescoes dont travelwell the curators have had to rely on portable paintings and works on paperFortunately such was the zeal of American collectors that many of Tiepolosfinest works are in American museums including a magnificent horde at theMetropolitan Museum of Art Some of Tiepolos larger works were destroyed inWorld War II so his vivid oil sketches or modelli  prized byconnoisseurs are the best record we have of them The Mets holdings have beenaugmented with masterpieces from American and European museums and the resultis a dazzling and dizzying show            Tiepolo was not one to work like Michelangelo in solitarysecrecy Having grown up in a workingclass quarter of Venice Tiepolo wasapprenticed at  to an academic painter He seems to have thought of paintingas a trade like any other surrounding himself with a workshop of assistantsincluding his gifted son Domenico The resulting issues of attribution are anightmare for scholars When he worked on commissions all over Europe he wassaid to prefer the company of his fellow workmen to that of the wealthy patronswho had hired him            Theinterlocked worlds of above and belowin the realms of religion myth orsocietywere Tiepolos great subject He lived in the stable prosperity of theVenetian Republic and died before the revolutionary upheavals of the lastquarter of the  th century that toppled so many hierarchiesConsequently he has often been dismissed as a wellpaid upholder of the statusquo But while Tiepolos work has none of the dark premonitions of Francisco deGoya there is an intriguing precariousness that sets in from time to time inhis compositions especially when high and low come unexpectedly into contactPaintings that seem at first sight to be sober treatments of an enduring orderturn out on closer inspection to have pockets of deep pathos or subtlehumor            Though  th century critics doubtedTiepolos spiritual conviction the curators at the Met make a strong case thatTiepolo was not just a brilliant decorator of sumptuous Catholic churches Hispictures of saints are particularly moving especially when their attention iswrenched suddenly upward In Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata the saint cranes his neck as we do to see the weird God hoveringabove him a round sun with a human face and four pairs of wings that shootsgolden laser beams down into Francis palms Since one source of the Francisnarrative mentioned a sixwinged seraph in the sky and another a crucifiedChrist Tiepoloa virtuoso in depicting wingsfudged and deployedeight wings in the shape of a cross            Tiepolo had a mischievouswitto which the contributors of the lively catalog are particularlyattentiveand it is given free play in his secular subjects such as the verydifferent joining of divine and human realms in The Rape of Europa c Europa sits innocently on the back of a tame bull while a handmaidentends to her mistresss unruly hair Europa little suspects that the bull isreally Jupiter about to run off and have his way with her Meanwhile fromhigh above Cupid pisses from a passing cloud onto Jupitersthunderboltssurely a novel if ineffectual way to cool a gods ardorTiepolo by giving Europa the features of his own wife whom he had furtivelywooed and married when she was  placed himself in the role of the divinebulla gesture worthy of Picasso            Cupidsgolden shower is nothing compared to the literal shower of gold in Dana andJupiter  one of the gems of the show According to myth KingAcrisius hearing the prediction that hed be killed by his own grandsonlocked up his only child Dana in a tower But gods move in mysterious waysand Jupiter at it again appeared on the scene and poured down a fructifyingflood of gold coins on Dana As Tiepolo imagines him Jupiter is a witheredold man hunched goatlike as the coins spew forth from his crotch An oldcrone who attends Dana tries to catch some of the loot on a salver Thehistrionic scene the stage effects of which might have arisen from Tiepolosinvolvement in Venetian theater suggests sex for pay with the crone in therole of procuress The hero Perseus somehow conceived in that metallictorrent accidentally felled his grandfather Acrisius with a discus            An errant discus as it happens also killed Apollos loverHyacinth But Tiepolo in his Death of Hyacinth c  took hiscue from a contemporary retelling of the myth and updated the murderous missileto a tennis ball In the foreground of the huge painting next to Hyacinthscorpse are two innocuouslooking balls and a racket while the net hangsslackly in the background The appalled Apollo makes an operatic gesture ofhorror over his muscular lover while a satyr and a parrot symbols offorbidden lust stare sardonically down at the proceedings Even if the picturehad a private meaning for its patron who had just lost his male lover itsobvious that Tiepolo enjoyed toying with the tragicomic possibilities of afatal tennis match            Tiepoloswit evidently found an echo in the popular commedia dellarte characters ofVenetian street theater a taste for the topsyturvy he shared with his sonDomenico They took particular pleasure in the antics of Punchinello alongnosed clown with white clothes and a cone hat In a show largely devotedto the Mets collection of Domenicos work one can see a host of Punchinellosfelling a tree perhaps one of the Napoleonic trees that marked the emperorsprogress through Europe or pompously burying one of their number They alsopopulate a related show at the Pierpont Morgan Library Tiepolo and HisCircle Drawings in American Collections which showcases some of Domenicosgreat studies of animals Punchinello with an elephant Punchinello riding adonkey And at the Morgan are yes even more Punchinellos these beingGiambattistas such as the lively Punchinellos Cooking and TestingGnocchi  These figures possess a magical carnivalesque aura despite theirunfortunate resemblance when seen today to whiterobed Klansmen In thecommedia dellarte where lowlife performers mingled with aristocraticaudiences ones social position was no more secure than those tumblingtrees            The sheer range of Giambattista Tiepolos workcomes across in these multifaceted exhibitions at the Met and the Morgan andno one could complain of the variety of the objects on view I would like tohave seen a few more of Tiepolos portraits the greatest of which depicting aVenetian naval hero with a mutilated hand could not leave Venice and notquite so many sketches for ceilings But Tiepolos vision like Rilkecontemplating autumn leaves was of a world where everything is falling Andyet there is One who holds this falling with infinite softness in his handsThe viewer leaves these gravitydefying masterpieces with a lighter stepexpecting the sky to fill up momentarily with things that flutter and fly
