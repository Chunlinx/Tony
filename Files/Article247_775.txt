                                 Hyde Still Seeks            Impeachment politics dominate with the House Judiciary Committees decisionto expand its inquiry into President Clintons fundraising activities leadingat USAToday  the Los Angeles Times and New York Times The Washington Post goes instead with todaysannouncement that Exxon and Mobil will indeed merge            Judiciary will probably the papers report vote on party lines to issuesubpoenas today bearing on prior Dept of Justice investigations into Clintons fundraising FBI Director Louis Freeh and Charles LaBella former head ofDOJs fundraising investigation will probably be ordered to testify andtheir superior Janet Reno will be ordered to turn over memos they wrote toher Another subpoena will probably go to Clinton himself requiring that heensure that Reno comply with the committees request The LAT plays theClinton subpoena high putting it in the headline and in the first sentenceThe NYT also plays it high USAT is a bit more offhandmentioning the subpoena of the memos and of Freeh in the subhead but holdingoff until halfway through the story before placing the presidents subpoenathird in a list of bullets The LAT notes that previously separateHouse and Senate committees investigated Clinton fundraising withoutuncovering illegality by highlevel Clinton administration officials but goeson to quote a Judiciary Republican source saying that only  percent ofLaBellas memo has been reviewed by Congress and that the GOP members believethe other  percent contains strong evidence of illegal Clintonfundraising            The papers all report that despite Clintons being invited by Henry Hyde toappear before the committee his spokesman yesterday said he wont be comingThe NYT quotes presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart saying of anyappearance by his boss that It wont add any new information and can be put inthe category of a stunt But the LAT says Lockhart made thiscomment not about Clinton but about Judiciarys plan to take testimony todayfrom two convicted perjurers            The NYT lead lays out the political dilemma voting for impeachmentinstead of censure presents to House Republicans Voting for impeachment willprobably produce a party line House vote which will impair the GOPs abilityto work with Democrats on other issues And will make censure which is morelikely than impeachment look like a Democratic victory            The WP explains that Exxons purchase of Mobil will rejoin two of thebiggest pieces of the Standard Oil empire broken up by the government ninedecades ago and will leave just three corporations with control of vast oilreserves and tens of thousands of gas stations The Post agrees with theview expressed in a NYT piece yesterday and in the USAT offleadtoday the merger will cost more than  jobs  USAT says it could be            The LAT s Column One tells of what it calls the abortion debatescause celebre the first murder prosecution of an abortion doctor in Californiain nearly twenty years Dr Bruce Steir is charged with knowing that he botchedan abortion but failing to have his patient admitted to a hospital Later thatday during the long drive back to her home the woman died Given that theCalifornia Medical Association found no basis for criminal charges theassociation and many prochoice advocates fear the case is an example of whatmay well become the newest weapon against doctors who provide abortionsselective criminal prosecution One quibble The piece describes Steir as aveteran of  procedures Why not write that he had performed abortions            The LAT front reports that new studies show that although AIDS wasslow in coming to South Africa that country is now the place on the planethardest hit by the disease The infection rate there is now one new person perminute But AIDS denial and ignorance in the country is widespread In a surveyof  people in the black township of Soweto the paper says  percentbelieved they were at little or no risk even though nearly twothirds saidthey never used a condom            The Dow had a point drop yesterday but the papers keep the story offthe front page Are the papers getting the point that spilling a lot of inkover a market going one way so soon after spilling an equal amount on a marketgoing the other way is more than a little ridiculous Todays Papers can onlyhopeand adds that papers should also quit announcing the raw point totals ofmarket moves in headlines The percentage of the move is much moremeaningful            The Wall Street Journal cites the doubling of Sharper Imagestock on Monday as a symbol of how investor excitement can be triggered byInternet anglesthe company says its web sales have tripled in the past yearBut the
