                    Background                  Nomenclature          In recent publications involving bioinformatic          analysis of aromatic aminoacid biosynthesis                 we have implemented a nomenclature that          attempts logical and consistent naming of genes and their          gene products for different organisms The problem is          exemplified by the contemporary naming in two model          organisms of deoxyD           arabino heptulosonate phosphate          DAHP synthase the initial enzyme step of aromatic          aminoacid biosynthesis In           Bacillus subtilis the gene          appropriately enough has been named           aroA but in           Escherichia coli the equivalent          function is represented by genes encoding three          differentially regulated paralogs These           E coli genes have been named           aroF aroG and           aroH In           B subtilis these latter three gene          designations refer to enolpyruvylshikimatephosphate          synthase step  of chorismate synthesis chorismate          synthase step  and chorismate mutase initial step of          phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis Even in           B subtilis where the naming was          intended to follow an orderly progression in terms of          order of reaction steps there is the complication that          DAHP synthase is expressed as a fusion of two catalytic          domains one being a class of chorismate mutase called          AroQ This requires naming at the level of domain and the          designation           aroQ aroA was implemented to          denote such a fusion      Thus a single          enzymatic function in one organism is accommodated          through the cumulative expression of three paralog genes          but in another organism is only encoded by a portion of a          single gene A universal nomenclature is needed that          labels at the level of domain that labels in synchrony          with order of reaction steps as much as possible and          that labels isofunctional paralogs at the same          hierarchical level but with discriminating          identifiers          The status of nomenclature for the tryptophan pathway          is not so chaotic as the genes in almost all prokaryotes          have been named in line with           E coli but even here distinct          problems have arisen because gene fusions that exist in           E coli are often absent elsewhere          Much of the literature up to at least  used five gene          designations for the seven protein domains   In           B subtilis these seven protein          domains are encoded by separate genes   Thus           E coli trpD encodes the equivalent          of           B subtilis TrpG and TrpD The           E coli gene fusion has been          redesignated with the convention of a bullet to          represent a fusion           trpG trpD   Likewise the           E coli trpC encodes the equivalent          of           B subtilis TrpC and TrpF and the           E coli gene fusion has been          redesignated           trpC trpF The nomenclature we          advocate is more easily remembered because genes are          named in the order of pathway reaction Subunits for a          given reaction are named at the same hierarchical level          anthranilate synthase first reaction consists of TrpAa          and TrpAb and tryptophan synthase fifth reaction          consists of TrpEa and TrpEb The implementation of a          logical and consistent nomenclature as illustrated in          Figure  should be most helpful in the long term                            Results and discussion                  Phylogenetic tree construction          Initial aminoacid alignments were generated using          ClustalW software version    Manual adjustments          were made through visual inspection to bring conserved          motifs and residues into register This was implemented          by use of the BioEdit multiple alignment tool            Inferences about the evolutionary relationships within          the TrpEa and TrpEb protein families were made using the          PHYLIP package of programs   The Protpars program          was used to generate a maximum parsimony tree and the          neighborjoining and Fitch programs were used to generate          a distancebased tree The distance matrix used in the          latter programs was produced using the program Protdist          with a Dayoff PAM matrix The Seqboot and Consense          programs were then used to assess the statistical          strength of the tree using bootstrap resampling          Neighborjoining PHYLIP Fitch and Margolash Fitch in          PHYLIP and maximum parsimony methods   all produced          trees consistent with one another Despite low bootstrap          values at many individual internal nodes the clusters          formed and arrangement of taxa within them were largely          identical Ninety TrpEb and  TrpEa sequences were          analyzed                          Distinctly different types of TrpEb          TrpEb proteins divide into two distinctly different          groups as illustrated by the unrooted tree shown in          Figure  The major group denoted TrpEb includes the          wellstudied enzymes from such organisms as           E coli Salmonella          typhimurium and           B subtilis The minor group          denoted TrpEb is represented heavily but not          exclusively by archaeal proteins Among the current          inventory of completed archaeal genomes only           Methanococcus jannaschii lacks          TrpEb Seven archaeal genomes possess both TrpEb and          TrpEb            Methanosarcina barkeri possesses          two paralogs of TrpEb in addition to one species of          TrpEb Six archaeal genomes possess TrpEb but not          TrpEb          Bacterial TrpEb proteins are thus far limited to           Aquifex Thermotoga Mycobacterium          Geobacter Chlorobium and           Rhodopseudomonas genera In          addition one of the multiple TrpEb proteins present in          the higher plant           Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to          the TrpEb subfamily In view of the distinct divergence          of TrpEb from TrpEb one might expect that either          TrpEb has lost the ability to interact allosterically          with TrpEa or perhaps that a divergent subgroup of TrpEa          has coevolved with TrpEb Multiple copies of TrpEb are          often present in genomes Examples include cases where          two TrpEb species coexist where two TrpEb species          coexist or where TrpEb and TrpEb coexist in the same          organism A number of organisms            M barkeri Rhodobacter capsulatus          Chlamydia psittaci and           Corynebacterium diphtheriae           possess two copies of TrpEb In each case the           trpEb copy that is linked to           trpEa is highly conserved whereas          the remaining copy has diverged to the extent that it may          be a pseudogene Table  The TrpEb products of these          probable pseudogenes have elongated branches highlighted          yellow on the protein tree shown in Figure           It is noteworthy that cyanobacterial and higher plant          aminoacid sequences form a cohesive cluster for TrpEb          as shown in phylogram form in Figure left panel An          analysis of TrpEa proteins from the same organisms yields          a very similar phylogram output Figure  right panel          This higher plantcyanobacteria relationship is          pleasingly consistent with the endosymbiotic hypothesis          of organelle evolution In each case           Prochlorococcus marinus and           Synechococcus species are the          outlying sequence group with the other cyanobacterial          sequences            Nostoc punctiforme and           Anabaena species being closer to          the higher plant sequences from           A thaliana and corn            Zea mays  The order of branching          shown is supported by very high bootstrap values Zma          is the TrpEa protein that has been proposed   to          function independently of a TrpEb partner producing          indole for entry into a pathway other than tryptophan In          this case indole serves as a precursor for a defense          metabolite that is active against insects bacteria and          fungi                          TrpEa in organisms lacking TrpEb          Six organisms all Archaea possess intact tryptophan          pathways but they lack TrpEb TrpEb in           Thermoplasma volcanii T          acidophilum and           Ferroplasma acidarmanus is          represented only by a single species of TrpEb Although                    Sulfolobus solfataricus Aeropyrum          pernix and           Pyrobaculum aerophilum all possess          two species of TrpEb both are the TrpEb variety Thus          in all six of these lineages TrpEa either might be unable          to form a tight complex with TrpEb or might have          evolved different proteinprotein contacts In the latter          case distinct TrpEa subgroupings might be expected in          parallel with the two TrpEb subgroupings On the          contrary all TrpEa sequences fall into a single group          Figure  However in contrast to sequences present in          those Archaea that do possess TrpEb for example           Archaeoglobus species of           Pyrococcus Methanococcus          Methanobacterium Methanosarcina and           Halobacterium  the six archaeal          lineages that possess only TrpEb have very distinctive          elongated branches on the TrpEa tree Figure  This          suggests an elevated rate of evolutionary divergence due          either to selection for new productive contacts of TrpEa          with TrpEb or to lack of constraint to maintain TrpEa          residues previously important for contacts with          TrpEb          The long branch of the TrpEa sequence of           Chlamydia trachomatis reflects its          likely status as a pseudogene This is consistent with          the observation that           C trachomatis TrpEb Figure           also seems to be a pseudogene One does not expect          positive selection for maintenance of function in           C trachomatis as it lacks an          intact tryptophan pathway Indeed the alteration in           C trachomatis of many otherwise          invariant aminoacid residues is evident from the          information given in Table                           Overview comparison of TrpEb and TrpEb          Figure shows an alignment of the aminoacid sequence          of TrpEb from           S typhimurium with TrpEb from           P furiosus Each sequence is shown          as a template for its own subfamily as extracted from a          refined multiple alignment Conserved residues deduced          from a full multiple alignment available from the author          on request are indicated as are the gap positions          present in the full alignment Functional roles in          catalysis and allosteric regulation are indicated for the                    S typhimurium TrpEb sequence in          order to compare similarities and differences between          TrpEb and TrpEb proteins Residues that are ligands          of pyridoxal phosphate or that interact with pyridoxal          phosphate are scattered throughout the sequences          including the catalytic K and are highly conserved          Residue E has been shown to render indole more          nucleophilic via proton abstraction from N   The          serine substratebinding region is highly conserved as          is a monovalent cation MVC binding region            coordinating with G FY and GAS A number of          indels insertionsdeletions distinguish TrpEb and          TrpEb and TrpEb is about  residues longer overall          than TrpEb In addition to other residues conserved          between both TrpEb and TrpEb each subgroup has its          own repertoire of uniquely conserved residues The COMM          domain   a rigid but mobile domain as originally          defined with           S typhimurium TrpEb            differs from the corresponding region of the TrpEb          subfamily by the presence of an indel Key TrpEb          regulatory residues R K within this region as          well as one residue near the MVC site D are not          conserved in the TrpEb subgroup                          Loss of intersubunit contacts in TrpEaTrpEb          systems          The tryptophan synthase of           S typhimurium is a rigorously          documented example of substrate channeling in which          indole generated as an intermediate is passed through an          internalized tunnel   and references therein Ligand          binding at the site and covalent transformations at the          site accomplish mutually reinforcing overall allostery          The movable COMM domain is comprised of residues G to          G in           S typhimurium TrpEb COMM          interacts with both the active site and with subunit          loops  and  in response to allosteric signals Within          the COMM domain of TrpEb S participates in          intersubunit signaling with G of TrpEa Competing          allosteric conformations are mediated by alternative salt          bridges between K of TrpEb and D of TrpEb on          the one hand or between K of TrpEb and D of          TrpEa on the other When D of TrpEb is not occupied          with K it forms an alternative salt bridge with R          as shown in Figure           As intersubunit signaling between TrpEb and TrpEa is          either lacking or involves different contacts one might          expect the important catalytic residues but not the          allosteric residues to be conserved in comparison of          TrpEb with TrpEb This comparison is shown in Figure           Likewise in those TrpEa proteins that lack a TrpEb          partner instead being forced to function in concert with          TrpEb one might expect retention of catalytic residues          but loss of allosteric residues This comparison is shown          in Figure  Of the intersubunit signaling pair TrpEb          STrpEa G S is not conserved within its own          subfamily and equivalent residues seem to exist   It          is however striking that G is invariant in all TrpEa          proteins except for those belonging to the six archaeal          lineages lacking TrpEb It is even more striking that          K which participates in the alternative  or           salt bridges is invariant in TrpEb but absent in          TrpEb Likewise the saltbridge partner D is          invariant in TrpEb but absent in TrpEb The          saltbridge partner D in TrpEa is invariant except for          the six archaeal lineages that lack TrpEb Figure          shows that TrpEb sequences carry an insertion of           residues in the general region corresponding to the COMM          domain of TrpEb proteins                          Tryptophan gene organization in TrpEbcontaining          genomes          The organization of tryptophanpathway genes in the          ten archaeal genomes and six bacterial genomes that are          thus far known to possess TrpEb are displayed on a S          rRNA tree in Figure            Pyrococcus horikoshii has lost the          entire pathway and only           trpEb is present In           Aquifex and           Chlorobium all           trp genes are dispersed and           trpEa is not linked to either           trpEb or           trpEb In Bacteria and Archaea          the gene order           trpEb  trpEa is one of the most          highly conserved of genomic gene arrangements Often          translational coupling exists as seen in Figure for           P furiosus P abyssi M          thermoautotrophicum T volcanium Archaeoglobus          fulgidus and           T maritima In each of the latter          genomes           trpEb is outside the           trp operon Both species of           Thermoplasma possess an otherwise          intact           trp operon that lacks           trpEb also not present elsewhere          in the genome Hence by default it appears that the          unlinked           trpEb must function for          tryptophan biosynthesis in these organisms In           A pernix and           S solfataricus all of the           trp genes are adjacent but           trpEb flanks           trpEa and           trpEb is absent from these          genomes In each case a second unlinked copy of           trpEb is present In           Geobacter sulfurreducens both           trpEa and           trpEb presumably partnered based          on the results shown in Figure  are unlinked to one          another and both are outside an otherwise intact           trp operon In this case it seems          curious indeed that the operon contains           trpEb           A snapshot of the incredibly dynamic alteration of          tryptophan gene organization in prokaryotes is apparent          from Figure  Of the organisms shown in Figure  the          most consistent linkage is that of           trpAa and           trpAb In           A fulgidus trpD and           trpB are fused whereas in           Rhodopseudomonas palustris          trpAa and           trpAb are fused Operons are          sometimes incomplete as with           P aerophilum and           G sulfurreducens or fragmented          as with           R palustris In           A pernix an inverted arrangement          yields a divergent transcription of           trpEa  trpEb  trpC  trpD and           trpB  trpAa  trpAb This is also          one of the very few cases where the order is           trpEa  trpEb instead of the usual           trpEb  trpEa           The           Ferroplasma genome illustrates a          case where a nontryptophan pathway gene           aroA encoding DAHP synthase is a          member of the operon translationally coupled The          implied transcriptional control of DAHP synthase by          Ltryptophan potentially could produce growth inhibition          by Ltryptophan because of limitation of precursors          needed for Lphenylalanine and Ltyrosine biosynthesis          This is because no other genes encoding DAHP synthase          appear to be present in the genome It would be          interesting to know whether the           Ferroplasma DAHP synthase is          sensitive to allosteric control or not The phenomenon of          growth inhibition triggered by exogenous amino acids is          exemplified by the effect of exogenous Lphenylalanine          upon DAHP synthase in           Neisseria gonorrhoeae   and in          other organisms   and references therein          What is the function of TrpEb As previously          discussed it seems clear that TrpEb has sometimes been          pressed into service with TrpEa to function as tryptophan          synthase What might be its function in those situations          where           trpEb is isolated away from a          typical tryptophan operon which possesses closely linked          or translationally coupled genes specifying           trpEa and           trpEb           TrpEb from           S typhimurium is the prototype          member of a superfamily of pyridoxal phosphate          PLPdependent enzymes that are of remote relationship          and that catalyze replacement and elimination          reactions     These include           O acetylserine sulfhydrylase          threonine deaminase threonine synthase cystathionine          synthase aminocyclopropanecarboxylate deaminase          Lserine dehydratase and Dserine dehydratase Isolated          TrpEb does catalyze the reaction of Lserine          dehydratase deaminase           in vitro but does not support          significant levels of the other activities It does not          seem likely that TrpEb catalyzes the latter reactions          either as PsiBlast of TrpEb sequences did not return          hits for them any more avidly than was the case for          TrpEb queries          Perhaps the most likely alternative function of          TrpEb proteins is a catalytic activity already          established as an           in vitro activity of isolated          TrpEb of which there are two The Lserine  indole           H            O  Ltryptophan reaction might          function alone for tryptophan biosynthesis in cells that          acquire indole from the environment Little information          about the availability and utilization of indole in          nature seems to exist Model organisms such as           E coli and           B subtilis transport indole poorly          and it tends to be toxic but these organisms lack          TrpEb          As stated above the second established           in vitro activity of isolated          TrpEb dimers is Lserine dehydratase deaminase          Lserine  pyruvate  ammonia It is indeed suggestive          that the presence of TrpEb correlates almost perfectly          with the absence of the primary Lserine deaminase          COG used in nature Table  This SdaA class of          serine deaminase is an ironsulfur protein not a          pyridoxal phosphate protein   It is absent from          the Archaea Although widely distributed in the Bacteria          it is not present in           Thermotoga Aquifex Chlorobium          Geobacter and           Rhodopseudomonas Mycobacterium          smegmatis is the only TrpEbcontaining organism to          possess an SdaA homolog          There are other candidates for carrying out the serine          deaminase reaction A serine deaminase that is          PLPdependent exists in eukaryotes but seems to be          absent or rare in prokaryotes Threonine dehydratase has          a lesser capability to carry out the serine dehydratase          reaction           in vitro Biosynthetic IlvA and          catabolic TdcA threonine deaminase are homologs          except that IlvA has a unique carboxyterminal extension          that provides an allosteric module Most archaea lack           ilvA and only a limited number          possess catabolic threonine dehydratase          If archaea lack           ilvA what is the source of          ketobutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis It appears          likely that ketobutyrate is generated instead by the          pyruvate pathway in which citramalate is generated as          the initial intermediate A few tracer studies in the          older literature have indicated derivation of          ketobutyrate from pyruvate rather than from threonine             and Rcitramalate synthase activity has been          shown recently in           M jannaschii MJ   This          pathway was initially shown to exist in           Leptospira   and it seems          likely that more examples will surface Indeed it is          interesting that an enteric bacterium has a latent          potential to replace the threonine deaminase step with a          pyruvatederived pathway under appropriate selective          conditions   The citramalate pathway for conversion          of pyruvate to ketobutyrate involves a carbonchain          elongation mechanism that uses an initial step of          condensation with acetylCoA followed by rearrangement          oxidation and elimination of a carbon to produce a keto          acid differing from the original substrate by the          presence of an additional carbon This mechanism is          familiar in nature analogous steps being used in the TCA          cycle the ketoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis          and in leucine biosynthesis These analogous steps in          different pathways were originally used in formulating          the recruitment hypothesis for evolutionary acquisition          of new function   and it is interesting that the          citramalate synthase gene shown in           M jannaschii had previously been          annotated as isopropylmalate synthase which catalyzes          the initial step of leucine biosynthesis          Overall the cumulative evidence indicates that          established sources of Lserine dehydratase are low or          absent in organisms that possess TrpEb and therefore          points to a plausible role for TrpEb as Lserine          dehydratase
