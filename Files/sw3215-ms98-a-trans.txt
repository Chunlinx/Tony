        well this is a subject that you never think youll be assigned to speak about  one that kind of comes up when youve lost it     no   the other  other subjects  um as i was sitting there i thought the weathers been perfect i dont know much to say about it its uh its you know for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous and are you it couldnt have been better i mean it didnt foul one launch and thats kind of unusual   im from Plano also thats right   and its kind of cold in the mornings so you dress up warm but by  and thats the only thing wrong i can find with it  but   right i just got back from Dayton i spent the weekend in Ohio with my family and the trees are changing color there so that as soon as we got out of the cloud cover of course it wasnt sunny like it is here it was real gray   oh how fun i miss that yeah yeah   but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and i saw all those trees it just really made me realize how much i miss the fall  i dont complain weatherwise though because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning and the high was only fifty and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon   yeah   ooh   so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies   i guess you have to take some things and leave some things   thats right   so yeah im from Utah area and the you know we have tons of canyons where the leaves change and theyre gorgeous you could spend every weekend of the  fall going to a different area   yes we did that when we lived up in Michigan we went up to the upper peninsula and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure   hm wow   and then on leaf weekends it was which is this time of the year its bumper to bumper traffic people its whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road   no its kind of hazardous for driving thats for sure but i cant complain it  i dont know if ive been spoiled ive been thinking its getting cold sooner than normal weve only lived here a couple years but   yes i think it is and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on at the TV news  that they are three weeks ahead of schedule   huh   as far as the coldness of the temperatures and uh the first frost everything just happened three weeks early this year   well have to see how it goes  a couple weeks ago we were cooler than normal but then we were back to being warmer than normal this week or last week so   just so we dont have one of those famous ice storms in the spring i   i dont have to live through many any of those really a bad i mean nothing comparable i guess to what youve had before   well ive only been here just a short time too so i havent been through any of those either so i have in Michigan but in in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on     youre right   so as i understand it here if theres anything theyll call off schools and and close businesses   well they get ice and no one can drive on ice i mean we used to think they were pansies but then when you decided what ice was   right right the real definition of ice   so  well i think weve discussed it good enough today  so it was it was good talking to you maybe well get to next time thanks Karen bye bye   i think so it was nice talking with you okay okay bye
