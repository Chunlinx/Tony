                                 Keyes Loses It            HANOVER NHThe second Republican debate was enlivened by the presence oftwo hecklers who got inside the Dartmouth auditorium where the town hallstyleforum was taking place One a young woman shouted that military spendingshould be cut to provide better health care until she was ejected from thehall The other Alan Keyes ranted and raved about a variety of topics but wasallowed to remain            Keyes is an intelligent man but tonight he seemedtruly deranged In response to a question put to all the candidates aboutwhether they supported a flat tax Keyes declared that the income tax was bothsocialism and slavery The income tax is a form oftax that was advocated by Marx and Lenin because it cedes in principle to thegovernment control of EVERY LAST DOLLAR that is made or earned in income hebellowed walking to the edge of the stage THINK ABOUT IT he shouted at theaudience If I have to give you a percentage of my income and you get todetermine the percentage how much are you in control of HOW MUCH ANSWERIT ALL OF IT EVERY LAST BIT OF IT            This assault left everyone a bit stunned but it wasjust a warmup for his answer to a polite and intelligent question aboutwhether the United States ought to pay its back UN dues If you want toblame somebody for that billiondollar deficit blame me he shrieked I wasone of the people in the Reagan administration who helped to put together andfoster the policy that withheld our contributions from the United Nations TheUnited Nations that takes our moneytosses it down the RATHOLE During thesescreeds someone in the CNN editing room kept cutting to audience members whowere rolling their eyes giggling or trying to suppress gales of laugher            Id say Keyes was one step away from being hauled awayin a straitjacket He on the other hand thought he was the handsdown winnerAs soon as the debate ended he came upstairs to the hall where the press waswatching on a bigscreen TV and offered to take questions Reporters peckingout their stories on deadline didnt immediately respond with any At thatpoint Keyes truly lost it accusing the press of racism for ignoring him Ithink his tirade is worth recording in full            You know whats fascinatingCan I make a statement here The New Hampshire debate that was held in the race they did the polling afterward I actually won the debate in the eyes ofthe people polled I OFTEN win these debates and every time I stand before youpress folks you have no questions I find it kind of amazing At some pointyou know one has to start to wonder The people of this country have gottenover their racial sickness I dont know that you folks have I think thatmerit means nothing to you because you cant look past race And I think Imdeadly SICK of it Every time I get in front of audiences in this country theyrespond just as it was tonight to the answers THAT I GIVE But your responseis nothing because you dont represent those people You apparently representthe same money powers that are seeking to destroy the representative nature ofour government I frankly think you all ought to be ashamed of yourselves Atsome point you ought to wake up to your responsibility not to let vice takeplace in darkness and not to let virtue languish unnoticed Thats your jobbut you dont do it DO YOU Instead you PANDER to the money But if you weredoing your job we wouldnt have to worry about campaignfinance reformbecause there would be sufficient attention paid to every candidate in the racethat the American people would know who they are and what they stand forwithout the expenditure of billions of dollars But they dont know becauseyou wont do your job Thats SAD And its DESTROYING our democracy            With that Keyes stormed off the stage and departed theroom leaving reporters somewhat stunned In fact I think the racial factorworks mildly in Keyes favor If he were a white Republican and thus less of anovelty the press would portray him more directly as a fanatic Ignoring Keyesis the kindest thing the press can do for him            The rest of the evening was less exciting If there wasa theme it was turning up the heat on George W Bush for not showing A NewHampshire television reporter who interviewed Bush before the debate asked ifhe wasnt trying to get the job of president without the job interview Bushtook umbrage saying he had to attend a dinner held in honor of his wifeLaura and that his family came first The excuse is of course bogus as wasBushs last one about having to attend a fundraiser in Vermont Severalcandidates took shots at Bush for his absence Steve Forbes had the best lineabout how to get Bush to participate in the next debate If you call it afundraiser he might show up Forbes quipped            Gary Bauer launched the only direct attack on a fellowcandidate when he once again hit Forbes this time on Forbess flattaxproposal which exempts inheritance and capital gains Bauer said that hisfather was a janitor and that this wasnt fair Forbes responded that peopleshould be allowed to leave the world unmolested by the IRS He even got off agood line about  no taxation without respiration before dissolving into histrademark crookedgrin guffaw Forbes also took credit for the fact that all ofthe candidates present with the exception of Keyes now support a flat taxThis is indeed amazing            Perhaps the best answer of the evening was JohnMcCains response to a question about whether the armed forces could be rebuiltwithout restoring the draft After explaining that he thought the Army didntneed volunteers he turned to the issue of his temper recently displayed inresponse to a negative New York Times story that heclaimed was leaked by the Bush campaign People say that perhaps John McCainis angry My friends I get angry when we spend  million on carriers theNavy doesnt want or need  And meanwhile my dear friends we have enlisted families brave young men and women on food stamps Thats adisgrace Thats an outrage Im going to fix it as president of the UnitedStates To my ear the applause meter topped out on that one            Unlike last nights performance which ended abruptlytonights format allowed for secondlong conclusions speedspeeches thatrecalled the great Monty Python summarize Proust contest This was the mostinteresting part of the event Forbes declared that he supported a New Birthof Freedom beginning with the freedom to be born Bauer decried what hecalled the virtue deficit Keyes said the nation was in  the worst moralcrisis its ever faced McCain said he wanted to clean up government andinspire young people Orrin Hatch concluding the show said that severalSupreme Court justices were getting old and that he wanted to pick theirreplacements
