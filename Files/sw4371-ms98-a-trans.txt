        so Rick you thinking about buying a new car     umhum yeah i am uh a truck   a truck uh Japanese or American   yeah i think im going to buy American this time   you you this time you had a you Japanese   yeah i got a yeah we got a Toyota two of them actually   uhhuh   they uh theyve always been real good cars but its just uh   they rust   well i actually havent had any problem with them at all but um i i think its probably pretty important to uh to buy American ive im coming to that conclusion   you know i its like im ive been driving like foreign cars now for for years and i im actually thinking about buying a new car i i   uhhuh   im sitting im sitting here right now its like my with a thousand dollars worth of repairs on my car  and uh im thinking about buying an American car also   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   um i i think theyre to the point now where theyre just theyre just as good as those foreign cars   i yeah i do too i i think uh       ive ive had pickup trucks before and ive had uh Chevrolets and they were pretty good but i i think uh Ford um is is pretty much focusing on quality   that thats the best uh actually uh a guy that likes in next office he uh hes thinking about buying a truck and hes looking at an F one fifty and uh   uhhuh   he he he one thing that you find about the about the the F one fifties is that uh they are every every the word is out that they are like the best truck uh especially like if you want to get like you know heavier than a mini pick up and uh they werent cutting too many deals   is that right yeah umhum   with uh with the prices on the F one fifties especially especially like in the in the four wheel drive models   umhum   but uh i i i guess like all these people cant be that wrong you know in terms uh of uh of how they how they are   yeah yeah i was looking in uh it was uh i i forget the name of the magazine used to be Changing Times sort of like a Consumer Reports magazine   umhum   and uh they were saying that Ford Ranger was the number one selling truck counting all   now the Ranger is that the Ranger is below the one fifty its like a its like a three quarter ton truck   yeah umhum yeah something like i believe something like that   and was is and the and the F one fifty is a ton and a half or or im not sure where they sit   yeah im not sure i i i kind of think id like to go with uh something around a a one fifty i dont want a full size but i dont want uh one of those little uh mini trucks either     uhhuh   besides i probably would look at something uh maybe a a V six   yep you geing to get a King Cab   you know  yeah   yeah that       that that  know do you have any any kids or anything   yeah ive got one little girl and and and a set of golf clubs so   oh there you go yeah you you you  you got to have you got to have just that extra space     yeah yeah yeah thats it   it yeah the uh the its a a buddy of mine he just he just bought a truck and uh and and it was a thing was like it would there was no thought whatsoever about not getting the extra size cab even though you cant really use use that back area for a seat   yeah   you know unless youre some like some kind of contortionist   yeah uh   but you just need it because you do carry you do carry stuff that you you dont want to like just throw in the bed   yeah yeah i i kind of like the looks of a short bed but or the short cab but but uh you know like i say just you you just really need the extra space     uhhuh   either unless you have some sort of a cab you know  cover or something but   yeah youd get airconditioning because  youre down there its pretty hot right   yeah umhum   uhhuh that uh   although uh i i notice you you you said rust right before that that we dont have that much problem down here but i know yall have it up there i guess they salt the roads and   uh oh boy ill tell you thats like thats the number one car killer up here is that is the is the rust you know its like youre youre constantly car taking   uhhuh yeah   about every other every about every month during the winter you know the smart thing to do is to go to like one of those uh drive in car washes do it yourself and just fire a bunch of water underneath underneath you know up into your rocker panels and stuff   uhhuh yeah yeah   because uh it just like i said it it just eats the cars like right alive   yeah i guess i i as as was working with some people from Buffalo here recently or actually it was a couple years ago but they were they were saying you know a lot of people up there they got a winter car and then a summer car you know   that my neighbors in the exact same situation situation its like he uh       he has he has two cars one of them is a is a a Mitsubishi you know uh uh i dont know what is a Starion or its one of those hot cars and uh   yeah umhum   its like come come November when the roads like start to get you know to get nasty the Starion goes like into the into the garage then he closes it and locks it and then he   yeah   he throws he he pull he throws a tarp off of this beater that hes got in the backyard   yeah out comes the sixty eight Nova   and i think its a its actually like a       its like an eighty two no no yeah its like an eighty two Toyota Corolla you know   yeah uhhuh   and this guy goes through this like role you know this revert Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde revert
