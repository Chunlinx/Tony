                    Background        Opioid receptors belong to the large superfamily of G        protein coupled receptors     Three major types of        opioid receptors   and  have been cloned and each one        is associated with several physiological and behavioural        roles The focus of the present work is the  opioid        receptor Delta opioid receptors play a modulatory role in        analgesia hibernation autonomic nervous system function        neuroendocrine system function mood driven behaviours and        olfaction     Thus understanding the requirements for        activation of  opioid receptors can lead to identification        and design of novel drugs acting through this receptor for        treatment of various physiological problems        While designing drugs with selectivity to a single        receptor can be a desirable approach in drug design        another approach may be to design drugs that act on more        than one receptor but with differential activity on each        receptor These would be drugs that act as an agonist at        one receptor and as an antagonist or partial agonist at        another receptor type The latter approach would be useful        in situations where the same receptor type that mediates        the beneficial effect of the drug also mediates the        untoward effect     In this case interaction with        another receptor type could reverse the unwanted effects        associated with the activation of the first receptor        In the absence of comprehensive activation data for        opioid ligands at  opioid receptors we set out to        characterize a set of fifteen opioid ligands for their        activity in cells expressing only  opioid receptors These        ligands were selected based on our previous data showing        that they bound all three opioid receptors     However        model tissue studies    and         in vivo studies    had suggested        that these ligands exhibited differential activation        profiles at the three opioid receptors Thus the present        study was designed  to describe the activation profiles        of a set of opioid ligands not previously defined at an        isolated cell system expressing only  opioid receptors        and  to compare the relative efficacies and potencies of        these ligands to the strongest ligand in the set        metazocine to the common opioid analgesic morphine and to        the endogenous  opioid ligand metenkephalin        In this study the activity of  opioid receptor was        measured by assessing the levels of inhibition of        forskolinstimulated cAMP production in the presence of        various opioid ligands It has been reported that  opioid        receptors couple more efficiently to adenylyl cyclase        system than to Ca channels     This evidence supports        the use of cAMP system for assessing the activity of these        receptors Moreover cAMP has been implicated in playing a        role in the analgesic effects mediated through  opioid        receptors      Human embryonic kidney cells stably        expressing mouse  opioid receptors were used to        characterize the activation profiles of opioid ligands in        this study The results describe the activity of a set of        ligands not previously characterized at  opioid receptors        The results obtained from this study will serve to define        the relative efficacies and potencies of a set of opioid        ligands compared to one another and differentiate between        the full and partial agonists at  opioid receptors                    Results                  Receptor activation          All ligands used Table  were nonpeptide ligands          selected for lack of selectivity for different opioid          receptors In the majority of cases the data were          reproducible and interexperimental variability was small          Figure  Thus the data from several experiments were          normalized to the top of the fitted curve no ligand          forskolin alone the results of several experiments          pooled and a new fitted curve constructed Figure  The          IC            values in Table are the results of          the pooled normalized data from  or more experiments          carried out in duplicate          Two ligands nalbuphine and naltrexone were          categorized as antagonists All other ligands studied          showed a robust inhibitory effect on the forskolin          stimulated cAMP production Table  The rank order of

morphine           dezocine Statistical analysis showed that most of the          agonists tested had efficacies that were not          significantly different from that of the endogenous          ligand metenkephalin The only exceptions were the          highly efficacious ligands fentanyl P            metazocine P   and xorphanol p                     The potencies for the different ligands ranged from             nM The most potent ligands studied as          measured by the lowest IC            values Table  were etorphine          cyclazocine lofentanil and xorphanol with IC            s of less than  nM The other          ligands metenkephalin WIN  hydromorphone and          Butorphanol exhibited potencies of  nM metazocine          and SKF   nM and nalbuphine dezocine and          morphine  nM The least potent ligand was          fentanyl with an IC            of about  M The rank order of          potency of these ligands was

curves of a          representative set of ligands Etorphine and lofentanil          are shown as examples of two very efficacious and highly          potent ligands SKF  is representative of a very          efficacious ligand with intermediate potency Finally          fentanyl is shown as an example of a ligand with very low          potency which is nevertheless very efficacious if high          enough concentrations are used                          Receptor binding          Human embryonic kidney HEK cells were transfected to          express mouse  opioid receptors These cells do not          express any endogenous  opioid receptors as they lack          binding of the radioactive tracer  HDPDPE data not          shown thus they serve as a good system for the          expression of opioid receptors A single clone of HEK          cells stably expressing    fmolemg protein           opioid receptors was selected for this study The K           d for  HDPDPE in these cells was             nM These cells were used to characterize the          activity of fifteen opioid ligands in inhibiting          forskolinstimulated cAMP production          Ligands that showed very low potencies or low enough          efficacies to be tested for antagonistic effect were          further characterized for their binding affinities at           opioid receptors All ligands studied exhibited K           i values in nanomolar range The rank          order of affinity of the ligands was xorphanol  Win           nalorphine  morphine  nalbuphine           fentanyl Table  The rank order of affinity agrees          with the rank order of potency of these ligands in          inhibiting forskolinstimulated cAMP production                            Discussion        Ligands acting at  receptors can induce antinociception        both spinally and supraspinally       thus        identifying ligands that activate  opioid receptors and        determining their physiochemical characteristics is        essential to understanding opioid receptor pharmacology and        physiology There is evidence suggesting that  selective        opioid ligands do not cause changes in respiratory        parameters     Thus suggesting that designing        specific ligands that act at  opioid receptors may be        useful in formulating analgesics without the side effect of        ventilatory depression Yet some selective  ligands have        been shown to be ineffective antinociceptive agents when        given systemically       The reason for this        ineffectiveness is not clear Still other reports have        suggested that opioid ligands with agonistic effect at         opioid receptors and antagonistic effect at  opioid        receptors are potentially useful analgesics              These latter results advocate that the key to designing        opioid ligands with optimal analgesia and minimal side        effects may be in the design of ligands that act on more        than one receptor type but activate each receptor        differently Thus it is useful to identify opioid ligands        with differential activation profiles and characterize        their physiological effects analgesic and unwanted        effects Prior to the design of any novel drugs based on        this approach it is necessary to clearly understand how        the known nonselective opioid ligands act at  opioid        receptors Such information can not only help explain some        of the paradoxical behavioural data of these ligands but        it can also explain the interaction of each ligand with a        single receptor involved in modulation of the pain        pathways The present data serve to define the mode of        action of a set of opioid ligands at  opioid receptors and        will help explain the physiological effect of these        ligands Moreover since  opioid receptors have been        reported to exert a physiology indicative of regulatory        effects on hemodynamic balance and cardiac function as well        as hibernation a better understanding of  receptor        pharmacology can lead to possible novel uses of  ligands        independent of analgesia        The present study was designed as one of the steps in        defining the detailed pharmacology of a set of        nonselective opioid ligands and aimed at defining the        activation profiles of these ligands at a welldefined        system expressing only  opioid receptors The use of such        a system is essential for understanding the mode of action        of ligands at a specific receptor Such data can then be        used to interpret the findings from more complex settings        such as         in vivo studies where multiple        opioid receptor types are expressed        The data presented in this report agree with available        published data thus establishing that the methods used        were valid and could be successfully used to provide useful        data for previously uncharacterised ligands For example        as reported etorphine    and lofentanil    were        shown to be highly potent and efficacious at  opioid        receptors        Comparison of the efficacies of the set of agonists in        this study to that of the endogenous ligand        metenkephalin showed that all were full agonists        Moreover fentanyl metazocine and xorphanol could be        considered super agonists at delta receptors based on        having efficacies significantly greater than        metenkephalin This observation suggests that in        situations where the endogenous ligand is present such as        in a stressed animal it is possible to achieve further        activation of  opioid receptors by the application of one        of these ligands Moreover the efficacies of the above        super agonists were comparable to that of  selective        ligands such as SNC and BWU Based on previous        reports maximum inhibitory effect of SNC in transfected         opioid receptors is       and              with IC          values of  and  nM respectively        The maximum effect of BWU has been reported to be           with IC          of  nM     Some ligands that        exhibited very low potencies in this study such as        fentanyl or metazocine were amongst the most efficacious        ligands tested suggesting that these ligands are capable of        maximally activating  opioid receptors Thus different        concentrations of these ligands can be used to achieve        various physiological effects based on the pharmacological        properties of these ligands on other opioid receptors        Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid ligand belonging to the        phenylpiperidine family of ligands Based on receptor        binding assays fentanyl has an affinity for  opioid        receptors that is  fold higher than that for         opioid receptors      However no published        activation data for fentanyl at  opioid receptors was        available         In vivo  fentanyl is a strong        analgesic agent in pharmacological doses due to its        interaction with  opioid receptors     However at        higher toxic doses it shows general opioid toxicity        symptoms in addition to muscular rigidity which are        reversible by naloxone Muscular rigidity of fentanyl has        been suggested to occur via several mechanism involving        glutamatergic pathways     serotonergic system           as well as noradrenergic system      One other        potential pathway may be via regulation of dopaminergic        system as suggested before    possibly via  opioid        receptor system as explained here It has been reported        that stimulation of  opioid receptors can cause inhibition        of dopamine release in striatal pathways resulting in        muscular rigidity     The present report shows that        although fentanyl has low affinity and low potency at         opioid receptor it is highly efficacious at these        receptors Thus at high fentanyl concentrations  opioid        receptors can also be fully activated possibly leading to        the inhibition of dopamine release and the resultant muscle        rigidity So the data presented can serve to describe the        mechanism of action and physiological observations after        application of drugs         in vivo  Based on the present data        a distinct effect of morphine compared to fentanyl can be        observed at  opioid receptors While fentanyl is a full        agonist at  opioid receptors morphine is only a partial        agonist Thus although both these drugs can activate         opioid receptors with low potency at high concentrations        morphine cannot stimulate  receptor as effectively as        fentanyl Thus fentanyl but not morphine can elicit        physiological changes that are mediated by activation of         opioid receptors        A different scenario holds true for the two ligands        xorphanol and WIN  Both these ligands have high        affinities and potencies at  opioid receptors with        xorphanol being very efficacious at  opioid receptors At         opioid receptors however the activation profiles of        these ligands are different While both these ligands bind        with high affinities less than  nM to  opioid        receptors WIN  acts as an antagonist at  opioid        receptors and xorphanol is a very weak agonist at  opioid        receptor Gharagozlou et al unpublished results Thus        these ligands can be useful in clinical applications where        activation of  opioid receptors needs to be combined with        a weak action or an antagonistic action at  opioid        receptors Such an application can be very important due to        the unique physiology of  opioid receptors Studies such        as presented here can serve to provide the data necessary        for application of opioid ligands in such unique settings        Moreover until now the activity of xorphanol at  opioid        receptors had not been described This ligand had been        described as a mixed agonistantagonist opioid ligand            with agonistic activity at  opioid receptors            Overall very little work has been done on xorphanol and        little is known about it except that it is an orally active        analgesic with limited physical dependence liability            Thus the present report describing its activity at         opioid receptors provides useful data on this ligand        Nalorphine has been previously categorized as a mixed        agonistantagonist ligand     These are ligands that        are believed to act as an agonist at  and as an antagonist        at  opioid receptors No published         in vitro data was available for the        activation profile of this ligand at  opioid receptors In        this study nalorphine was shown to be an antagonist at         opioid receptor with a moderate binding affinity Such a        moderate affinity makes it possible for nalorphine to        antagonize the effect of other ligands or the endogenous        ligand like metenkephalin at  opioid receptors while        possibly acting as an agonist at other opioid receptors        Based on the regulatory role of  opioid receptors such        applications may be numerous Data similar to the one        presented in this report will open the door for novel        applications of these ligands in the treatment of various        ailments                    Conclusions        The present study was designed to characterize the        activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands in cells        expressing only  opioid receptors These ligands had not        been previously characterized at  opioid receptors The        data produced from this study can be used to achieve        several goals  These data can lead to elucidation of        the complete activation profiles of these ligands leading        to clarification of the mechanisms involved in        physiological effects of these ligands at  opioid        receptor  These data can be used as a basis for novel        use of existing opioid ligands based on their pharmacology        at  opioid receptors  These         in vitro data can be utilized to        define the physiochemical features of the ligands defining        agonism and antagonism at  opioid receptors leading to        design and discovery of novel opioid analgesics  In        combination with         in vivo data characterizing analgesic        and unwanted effects of these ligands the         in vitro data can be used to identify        the activation profile of the ideal opioid analgesic that        has minimal side effects Such information combined with        the knowledge on the physiochemical characteristics of the        agonists and antagonists at each receptor will lead to the        design of novel opioid analgesics with minimal side        effects                    Methods                  Cell culture          Human Embryonic Kidney HEK  cells were
