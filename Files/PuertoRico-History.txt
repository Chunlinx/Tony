A Brief historyThe First Puerto RicansThe islands earliest known inhabitants Indians now called Arcacos the ancients were primitive fishermen More than  years ago they were conquered by another tribe called the Igneri who had mastered farming and potterymaking The final stage of Indian advancement began while Europe was in the Middle Ages the Tano Indians a peaceful people native to Venezuela traveled up through the chain of the Lesser Antilles and settled the island they called Borinqun They lived in thatched houses hunted and farmed and worked ceramics and textiles with great skill Several of their ceremonial ball courts which were used for certain social or religious gatherings have been discovered throughout Puerto Rico The Tanos feared an evil spirit Juracn who was responsible for violent storms and gave his name to the tropical hurricanes of the West Indies They also feared an earthly evil the Carib Indians who periodically raided their land for loot and captives The Tanos fears were well founded The word cannibal derives from Carib a reminder of the way these marauders disposed of some prisonersThe Arrival of the EuropeansOn  November  Columbus was lucky enough to be met by the kindly Tanos in fact the name Tano meant friend and was used by the Indians to enable the Europeans to distinguish between them and the notsofriendly Caribs The Tanos were the ones who introduced the Spanish to tobacco corn on the cob and that archetypal Caribbean mode of relaxation the hammockColumbus christened the island San Juan Bautista honoring St John the Baptist It was the first colonist Juan Ponce de Len who admiring a bay on the north coast declared it Puerto Rico rich port Sixteenthcentury mapmakers back in Spain mistakenly confused the names so that in the end the port became San Juan and the whole island was called a rich port once on the maps the names stuckA less innocent error was an American attempt to erase four centuries of Spanish history After the conquest of  the first US military governor ordered that the name be spelled Porto Rico This semiItalian corruption didnt last long Today some nationalists still yearn for good old Borinqun a name youll see on many restaurants and barsPonce de Len had received permission to found a Spanish colony on the island in  For reasons of security he settled a few miles inland from what is now San Juan The site was swampy and mosquitoridden and after a number of outbreaks of disease his fellow colonists abandoned him and moved to the future capital city They immediately began work on the formidable fortifications for which the city is still famous Ponce de Len also suffered another setback He became involved in a power struggle with Columbuss son Diego who through his fathers will had claims on the island The small colony could not cope with the egos of two such powerful men The Spanish crown solved the tense standoff by entrusting Ponce de Len with another voyage of exploration His search resulted in the discovery of Florida While on a second expedition to colonize Florida in  Ponce de Len was critically wounded during an attack by Indians the explorer hoped to return Puerto Rico but lost his fight for life on the way back in Havana CubaPonce de Lens successors imagined that the island was one big gold mine and set the Indians to work mining and panning They were wrong however the gold soon ran out The Spaniards then looked to agriculture to turn a profit and began growing sugar cane which had been introduced to the Caribbean on Columbuss second journey As the number of Tano and Carib laborers declined due to disease and suicide plantation owners eventually began importing slaves from West AfricaPuerto Rico quickly developed into a major port and trading postit was one of the last major ports Spanish galleons stopped in before sailing back to the motherland San Juan also became the center for the Catholic Churchs evangelization of the New World numerous churches convents and monasteries were established throughout the island to aid in this effortA Beleaguered IslandTo the pirates and privateers who sailed the Caribbean in the early th century the fortress of El Morro at San Juan represented the might and the wealth of the Spanish Crown Lured by the promise of treasure galleons and stores of ammunition some pirates worked independently others however were employed by the various European crowns particularly the British to help carry on their power struggles in the colonial world Puerto Rico suffered from constant attacks The most poignant though not typical case involved raids against the coastal hamlet of San Germn Two French pirate ships first ravaged the village in  It happened again in  and three times in the following five years After every attack the settlers put out the fires buried the dead and rebuilt San Germn In  after the sixth sacking the settlers decided to move inland to the towns present hilltop location With remarkable persistence the pirates climbed all the way twice just to pillage San GermnMore ominous than the French were the forces of Sir Francis Drake The great British navigator and adventurer operated in the Caribbean for years before he turned his attention to Puerto Rico In  Drake learned that a millionpeso gold shipment had just arrived in San Juan aboard a Spanish galleon This kind of booty was worth a battle even though Drake knew the city was well protected by a set of forts The British fleet dueled with the guns of El Morro fort and the defending warships in a long costly battle Then under cover of darkness Drake sent out attack boats to destroy the Spanish frigates But light from the burning ships gave El Morros shore batteries a fine view of their target The English slunk away without the loot It was the only defeat of Drakes career within months he was deadEl Morro was not however invulnerable A few years later a British fleet commanded by George Clifford the Earl of Cumberland shrewdly outflanked the fortress Far outnumbered by the man invasion force the defenders of El Morro surrendered after a twoweek siege But the English flag did not fly over San Juan for long Four hundred of Cumberlands troops died in an epidemic of yellow fever and dysentery and the British had to withdraw less than three months after their victory The Dutch were the next to try in  they succeeded in pinning the Spanish into the confines of El Morro but after looting everything of value they set fire to San Juan and departed Because surrender was never considered the Spanishand todays Puerto Ricansregard this episode as a victorySoon after this the Spanish began building a thick defensive wall all around San Juan With an average height of  feet  m it was a formidable site and is still one of the most impressive parts of the old city It seems to have impressed generations of marauders once it was complete they stayed away for more than  yearsA final British rally against Puerto Rico came in  Seven thousand troops under Sir Ralph Abercromby landed east of San Juan and blockaded the city For two weeks the battle seesawed Finally as suddenly and unexpectedly as they had arrived the British retired According to one version it was all because of St Ursula and the  Virgins On the last night of the siege devout local women led by their bishop marched through the streets of old San Juan in a torchlight parade praying for deliverance The legend says General Abercromby heard the church bells tolling saw the lights mistakenly deduced that Spanish reinforcements had arrived and fledThe End of Spanish RuleFor Spain the th century was a bitter slide from imperial might to the status of a hasbeen By the early s independence movements had overthrown Spanish rule in most of the Western Hemisphere Madrids most important remaining possessions were the island colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico both of which were chafing under the yoke of colonial rule and the bitter system of slavery To squash subversive ideas about independence in Puerto Rico Madrid imposed ruthless military control The most memorable incident occurred in  in the mountain town of Lares when government forces crushed an uprising of secessionists killing or jailing the insurgents and many innocent victims The event is remembered as El Grito de Lares the cry of LaresThe colonial government could not however hold back the tide of change sweeping the Caribbean In  one momentous decree abolished the yearold institution of slavery in Puerto Rico and in  Spain cut the colonial ties and finally granted the island autonomy The long dream of independence seemed to have come true But eight months after Madrid had authorized home rule for Puerto Rico American troops arrived to take it awayThe SpanishAmerican War was no great challenge for the US force that landed at Gunica on Puerto Ricos calm south coast rather than at fortified San Juan Military resistance was spotty at best By starting at the soft underbelly the  troops of General Nelson A Miles gained control of the island in less than three weeks The central issue that had drawn Spain and the United States into warCubas struggle for independencewas resolved in that islands favor Cubas freedom was guaranteed by the Paris Treaty of  But Spains two other major colonies the Philippines and Puerto Rico simply changed hands becoming colonies of the United StatesPuerto Rico and the United StatesThe population was initially little better off under its new landlord Most Puerto Ricans were tied to the large agricultural companiesthey lived in company houses and were paid in tokens that could only be spent at company stores They didnt starve but they didnt thrive either A few strong voices were eventually raised some proposed radical action while others advocated working within the system for a more democratic society One especially prominent activist was Muoz Marn Rivera who is credited with helping to move Puerto Rico toward the th centuryWashington gradually began to grant Puerto Ricans a greater degree of selfgovernment and representation In  the first civil governor was appointed all the appointed governors were Americans until  In  Puerto Ricans won a mixed bag of benefits they were given more say in their internal affairs made citizens of the United Statesand declared eligible for conscription in World WarI In the years between the World Wars there were continued efforts to change the islands status and improve its quality of life Some such as those who followed radical Pedro Albizu Campos took to violence which resulted in several assassinations though many more insurgents worked within the systemMore Puerto Rican draftees went to war in  Even while poverty lingered from the Great Depression World War II caused continued hardship on the island because of its isolation in a dangerous sea But the s saw the emergence of two great political figures Luis Muoz Marn son of Muoz Marn Rivera and founder of the new Popular Democratic Party and Rexford Guy Tugwell Governor of Puerto Rico from  to  These two men were instrumental in orchestrating an amazing economic expansion that almost singlehandedly converted the island from an underdeveloped backwater into a pacesetting industrial society Under Operation Bootstrap which attracted hundreds of new factories to Puerto Rico through tax and other incentives the percapita income soared to the highest in Latin America Life expectancy rose from about  years in  to an enviable  years today Pouring onethird of its entire budget into education Puerto Rico cut illiteracy to about  percentThe Commonwealth of Puerto RicoPolitically recent history is less conclusive In  the islands voters approved a new constitution still in effect forming a commonwealth between the United States and the free associated state of Puerto Rico though even the commencement ceremony was marred by violent demonstrations by radicals As a result Puerto Ricans now elect their own governorlegislature and local officials and send a nonvoting representative to the US Congress In turn Washington runs the postal customs and immigration services handles defense and foreign relations and sends dollarsparticularly useful in times of crisis such as after hurricanesIn recent elections power has alternated between parties backing the statusquo and those preferring even closer ties with the United States though a referendum in  defeated a move towards statehood A third force is often in the news but the parties pushing for independenceestablishing Puerto Rico as a separate nationhave thus far gained only minority support at the polls The withdrawal of tax incentives for US companies operating in Puerto Rico by the Clinton administration in  which has caused job losses and economic hardship is another thorn in the side of those who hope for a stronger and more selfsufficient society On the other hand tourism which began in earnest in the s brings increasing numbers of visitorsand amounts of moneyto the islands economy
