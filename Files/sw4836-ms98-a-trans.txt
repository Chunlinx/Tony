        you wanna start or you want me to start   well go ahead if youre   okay  personal interests in computers basically nowadays it seems like you cant get by without one everywhere i go its got some kind of computer interface like pressing on keyboards uh pressing in personal identification numbers all the ATM machines things like that i personally dont own one because i cant afford one uh every time you look in a friends houses and they show you their computers and all the knickknacks they have it seems like they go from their basic computer to all these peripheral devices like uh modems and fancy printers or lazy printers and fax machines and games that they like to play course i i was impressed by some of the games they have like flight simular game simulator for the different aircraft   yeah well thats uh  actually you might guess you could say even more than just a game its uh similar to the one they use at uh for training   very close to it i understand except for the bouncing around it   well i have a i just got a i used to use a TI PC at work now i just got a  uh computer PC   you using it mostly for spreadsheets or do you use it for like word processing   uh  well i use it uh in my business i have to uh tie into the mainframe and also into a uh minicomputer a  so i use a terminal emulation in uh talking to other computers plus word processing i do quite a bit of that and its uh thats supposed one of the features of the the new one the  its got Windows on it and so you can toggle back and forth between uh applications and you know get a get a lot quicker in and out used to be you had to log off  then log back on the other application   yeah i use a Z  at work but its basically to tie into the communications network then through our communications network we go to our mainframe on the base there   umhum   and use the Unix operating systems   yeah   use their VI editor and we use um read on line news through it and we also have terminal emulations through IBM thirty two seventy eight   umhum   and  i dont know i just dont i dont even use the hard disk drive to to copy any floppy disks or anything like that i just basically use it for a a window into there to the Unix world   umhum yeah uh were supposed to be getting a fifteen hundred minicomputer pretty soon   uh is that IBM or is that an IBM type   replace our  huh uh no its a TI made  its a a minicomputer uh its a newer version of the nine ninety which is one they had it uses uh Unix as one of the operating systems but uh   im familiar with Unix commands like um copying files and compressing them things like that i just have a fun time using their mainframe at the base but   well Unix to me i mean uh that System Five i mean thats pretty  looks pretty uh user unfriendly   its like a different language all right   uh it seems like they sure uh i got a lot of stuff to learn i havent used it that much so   yeah we can use System Five or we can use um C shell you know i like um i favor C shell over the other   umhum   i think i think most of our users like Bourne shell because they were trained in it and they just dont wanna learn something different     that uh thats a powerful force  once you thats a powerful force once you learn something you you tend to wanna stick with it   pardon oh yeah plus everybody in your office knows it and as the new people come in they kind of help each other out but you have different people with different backgrounds and they have a hard time sharing information   thats like i learned uh DFM and PFM you know Professional File Manager which is can be used as a word processor it doesnt it does everything i need moves splits you know all that but uh doesnt have some of the little fancy stuff like underline caps bold i mean bold and all that so uh thats other than that its you know perfectly suitable for most things i do   yeah the disadvantage disadvantage of VI editor you cant see all those fancy things  i have another thing called QOffice from Quadratron back in California that people like to use but its a very slow system   umhum   and i understand its only on like we use a Gold  and thats basically their format they use for word processing and theyre trying to push people into using either WordPerfect
