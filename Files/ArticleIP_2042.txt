                                 The Marriage Contract            Premarital agreements arerare This observation used to dismay the late Nobel laureate George StiglerHe maintained that the grand institution of matrimony is demeaned by those whocant be bothered to negotiate its details            Amarriage is a contract You can write that contract yourself in which caseits called a premarital agreement or you can accept the default contractwritten by your state legislators Now comes the state of Louisiana determinedto expand its citizens options Henceforth Louisianians will be able tochoose between two prefabricated contracts each with very differentprovisions for divorce The first option is similar to the nofault contractthat is standard in other states The secondthe socalled covenantmarriagemakes divorce far more difficult            Even if you never divorce your choice among contracts canaffect the entire course of your marriage Thats because thepossibility of divorce alters your incentives to keep your spouse happyand vice versa Of course you might want to keep your spouse happy for otherreasons the most notable of which is love Sometimes love is all you needBut because were talking about divorce law I want to focus on cases wherelove is not enoughand in those cases to ask which contract provides the bestincentive for good marital behavior The answer may not be what you think            Whilewere at it lets compare three kinds of marriage a nofault contractwhere either party can obtain a divorce on demand a mutualconsent contractwhere both parties must agree to a divorce and a covenant marriage whereeven mutual consent is not enough You might think that nofault marriages arealways the most likely to end in divorce That isnt true and heres onereason why A lot of marital issues are negotiablelike who should do thedishes who gets to operate the remote control which one wears the antisnoredevice and which one wears the earplugs and so on Here the negotiatingprocess itself provides all the right incentives to respect your spousesneeds What you wont do for love youll still do for a bribe And thosethings you wont do even for a bribe are presumably sufficiently distastefulthat you shouldnt do them            Bribery works equally well under nofault andmutual consent though the choice of contract alters the balance of power andtherefore might alter the size of the bribes Under either system themarriage survives as long as its possible to keep both partners happiertogether than they would be apart Therefore the two systems produce the samenumber of divorces If youre not convinced by that argumentwhich is aspecial case of a general principle that economists call the Coase theoremclick for an illustrative numerical example            On theother hand if youre in a covenant marriagewhere you cant get a divorceeven by mutual consentdivorce might be impossible even when the marriageturns bad for both of you If we assume that all marital conflicts arenegotiable the covenant marriage has no offsetting advantages It keepscouples together only in those cases where theyd both be happier apart            The analysis changes if there are important decisions thatcant be negotiated like the decision whether to bring home a surprisebouquet of flowers Chronic thoughtlessness on such matters can cause amarriage to deteriorate The knowledge that divorce is impossible might makeyou strive harder to avoid such deteriorationand it might do the same foryour spouse In that sense a covenant marriage is like the old nuclearwarDoomsday Machine You are each on notice that youd better work hard topreserve a good marriage or youll both be forced to live your lives in a badone Doomsday Machines can be very effective But sometimes they blow up Sothe covenant marriage is a mixed blessing            Its theissues you cant negotiate that make the covenant marriage worth consideringBut that same inability can make nofault marriages the strongest of all In anofault marriage a happy spouse will treat you well to prevent your leavingThat gives you an incentive to keep your spouse happy And this process feedson itself Your spouse works to make you happy which makes you want topreserve the marriage which makes you work to make your spouse happy whichmakes your spouse want to preserve the marriage and so on in a great virtuouscircle            By contrast if divorce required mutualconsent your spouse could accept your efforts to make him or her happy withoutfeeling a strong need to reciprocate This prospect discourages you frombearing gifts in the first place But when either partner has the power to endthe marriage kindness tends to be repaid with kindness and therefore kindnessthrives Notice once again that this analysis applies only to surpriseefforts Efforts that are negotiated in advance can be negotiated equally wellunder any contract            So here is the bottom lineWhen marital issues are negotiable we are in the domain of the Coase theoremwhere nofault and mutual consent do equally well and where covenant marriageis always a mistake But when important issues cant be negotiated both thecovenant marriage and the nofault contract become more attractive fordifferent reasons            This analysis is far fromexhaustive and I know from much recent experience that Slate readers willforcefully call my attention to scenarios Ive failed to consider Let mepreempt them and go a step further by pointing out a basic question Iveignored How does a change in the marriage contract affect a couples decisionabout whether to get married in the first place Theres a lot of interestingeconomics in that question and if I manage to sort it out Ill let youknow
