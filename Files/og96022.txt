the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment HUD submitted the proposed Amendments to Regulation Xto the Office of Management and Budget OMB for review as asignificant regulatory action under Executive Order  Sincethe rule was determined to be potentially economicallysignificant HUD prepared an Economic Analysis which was alsoreviewed by OMB According to HUD staff after the EconomicAnalysis was submitted to OMB HUD made changes in the Analysis tomaintain its consistency with the rule to which minor changes hadbeen made as described below These changes were also submitted toOMB for approvalThe Economic Analysis indicates that it is difficult to quantifythe costs and benefits of the exemptions for certainemployeremployee payments The Analysis also states that HUD lacksessential information to estimate the economic consequences ofits action with respect to computer loan origination systemsCLOs However in both areas the Analysis includes a discussionof cost and benefitrelated issues and the possible effects of thechanges to Regulation XWith respect to HUDs Statement of Policy on CLOs the Analysisstates that the guidance provided should enable CLOs to developwith much greater certainty about RESPA consequences and with fewrestrictions on reasonable pricing and compensation It also statesthat these actions should lead to faster development ofIn response to our inquiry OMB staff advised that the rulecould be economically significant and major because it couldadversely affect competition OMB also informed us that generallyRegulation X matters had been designated major rules underExecutive Order GAOOGCCLOs which should ultimately lead to greater consumer andproducer surplus The Analysis summarizes the two other Statementsof Policy issued with the final ruleIn its submission HUD states that its Analysis reflects itsassessment thatchanges in the rules treatment of employeremployeepayments are desirable to prevent any abuse of the relationship oftrust between consumers and providers of settlement services and the elimination of the exemption for payments by borrowers toCLOs enhances the ability of firms to develop CLOsiiActions

only that large firms are likely to find thepractice of dedicating an individual to marketing affiliatesproducts more attractive than small firms In connection with CLOsthe Analysis identifies potential concerns of small real estatefirms and lenders but also sets forth potential advantages of CLOsto those entitiesSection b states that the certification and explanatorystatement shall be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy ofthe Small Business Administration SBA In response to ourinquiry HUD staff explained that its procedures do not includeproviding a separate copy of the certification to SBA and that itdid not do so in this instance An SBA official has confirmed thatsome agencies follow this practice and that SBA has not objectedto itSection b provides that if the head of an agency makes acertification under that section the agency shall publish suchcertification in the Federal Register along with a succinctstatement explaining the reasons for such certificationHUD staff explained that the exemptions at issue here would nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities to the extent that such an impact could
