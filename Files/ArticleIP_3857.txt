with NathanMyhrvolds argument in Human Clones Why Not It is hypocritical of our leadersto issue blanket statements that this type of research should be banned due tosome imagined threat to society in the future            Themedical procedures and wonder drugs of this century have been encouraged andfunded with full support of political and religious leaders Modern medicinehas as Myhrvold stated ended or possibly even reversed the evolution of thehuman species producing genetic weaknesses in the population as a whole Butwe would never propose limiting or discontinuing medical research due to theimportance of human life I think that the process of cloning should be lookedupon as a possible method of strengthening mankinds weakening genetic makeupor of preventing some future genetic disaster And I dont think thatcivilization as a whole will allow the predicted abuses of geneticresearch                           StevenRichardson                                       DoubleVision                        Two genetically identicalthumbs up to Nathan Myhrvold for Human ClonesWhy Not Not since the heady days of Utahs cold fusion has there beensuch a complete nonissue issuing from the halls of science            To suggestthat genetic identity between two individuals of differing ages is of anymaterial consequence to their selfidentity is the height of hubris Identicaltwins all over the world would face discriminationand whats worse thepainful process of identifying which one of them was the real one Thediscussion of cloning has forgotten the complexity of human nature and centeredon the kind of loony scifi hysteria that embarrasses the relatively few of usleft who have any scientific literacy                           Evan C Allen                                       MarryMarry Quite Contrary                        The pointof David Frums argument in the GayMarriage dialogue seems to boil down to Look at how severely and for theworse marriage has changed in the last  years While I see him claiming thatpermitting gay marriage is one more step along this path I dont see himproviding any argument that such unions are themselves bad or any worse thanthe other breakdowns of traditional marriage such as interracial marriagemultiple divorces prenuptial agreements and so forth Neither does heprovide any answers to the problem merely a wistful remembrance of how goodit was And if his idea of good is forcing roles upon members of a couplealimony for life and community shunning of individuals whose marriages did notsucceed then Frum is really criticizing modern society not just marriage                           Jim Drew                                       Cant BuyMe Biodiversity                        Steven ELandsburg exhibited a rather alarming disregard for common sense in his recentarticle Taxthe Knickers Off Your Grandchildren The greatest foolishness contained inthe article is the assumption that the natural riches that organizations likethe Sierra Club try to preserve can be equated with money Professor Landsburgshould take note that money cant buy everything and the ready cash that canso easily purchase consumer electronics is powerless to restore vanishedbiodiversity The breathtaking thoughtlessness exhibited in this piece hasappeared in lesser forms time and again in the Everyday Economics columnThis simpleminded writing

                         Its theInflation Stupid                        In the Dialogue on theCapitalGains Tax Michael Kinsley is quite correct in notingthat strictly speaking the capitalgains tax is merely one particularmanifestation of the overall income tax Nevertheless he glosses over theessential unfairness of the current system of taxing capital gains namely theinflation problem            Supposesomeone purchases a building in  and sells it in  in a somewhatappreciated but not especially buoyant market His capital gain on which hemust pay tax will seem like a fat profit But even relatively low inflationduring the intervening time period will have caused the value of money todwindle thereby diminishing his gain in real terms Capitalgains taxes tobe fair must be indexed for inflation otherwise many longterm investors mustpay tax on gains that are more than offset by inflation                           NicholasCorwin                                       RacyHeadline                        The DavidMastio article about US government attempts to influence political events inother countries was interesting enough but I dont know whom to blame for theheadline Uncle Sam Plays John Huang Huang is an AsianAmerican withwellknown fundraising problems but it has not been proven that he is tryingto influence American politics on behalf of other nations The title in thecontext of the article implies that Huang is a paid agent of a foreigngovernment Unless there is a connection between foreigngovernment funding andpolitical influence by John Huang Slate made the
