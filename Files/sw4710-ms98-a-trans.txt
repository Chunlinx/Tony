            well Kirk uh i believe in capital punishment im from Texas and we have that in in effect down here and uh i guess im kind of the old school you know an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth   uhhuh uhhuh do you have um has Texas always had capital punishment or they ever had a period where they outlawed it   uh no sir not to my knowledge uh theyve always had it   i see right from day one   uhhuh   id have to confess to you that uh i dont know what the i honestly dont know what the law in Maryland is i think we have i think we have a capital murder law uh   uhhuh   i think thats probably the only crime for which you know capital punishment is meted out   umhum   my own i guess my own personal feelings are  i tend to take a look at the social cost benefit ratio which sounds kind of callous but uh its basically you know it what what is the net the net benefit to society if you execute someone for a particular crime versus say if you lock them up for the rest of their lives or something of that sort and in many cases i decide in favor of capital punishment in fact i think in most cases uh and there probably be a few instances in which i would think that maybe it wasnt warranted   well well uh Kirk is capital punishment is that like death death yeah right uhhuh uhhuh     thats thats death right and uh lets see Texas uses death by lethal injection now right   well uh the death by the electric chair uh and uh lets see the last time that i was uh privy to it death by electric chair   oh i see okay i see   umhum you see one of our problems is down here since we were one of the later states to join     umhum   is that uh murder was rampant i mean uh horse horse thieving and was rampant down here in the old days and i bet you can go to any town within the state and find a hanging tree   um umhum umhum umhum   and you know you stole somebodys uh horses or uh stole their cattle that was a capital offense and you got hanged from the nearest limb if uh you know you were caught   umhum umhum   so its got goes back to the old days now i dont know about Maryland uh golly or what they did in the old days   well Marylands a pretty complicated state   uhhuh   because its uh well because of its colonial you know background and then of course during the Civil War or during prior and during the Civil War it was a border state you know with half the state northern northern and half the state southern you know in sentiment and so forth   umhum   i suspect that like most most states uh you know in the nineteenth century and so forth that they certainly had capital punishment   yeah right   uh its not a Quaker state or something of that sort you know like Pennsylvania   right umhum   but uh and i as i said i think we we have a a capital murder law on the books right now i guess my feeling you know i can set up some hypothetical cases where uh well suppose there was something uh you know a famous uh medical researcher who murdered his wife   yeah   you know now this you know the question is well what are the prospects of this medical researcher making medical break throughs that might benefit human beings in the future never mind that he murdered his wife   is that what you meant while ago uh when you said you know about about uh putting them in prison actually what you meant what kind of contribution can they make if you dont murder them   right you know and i i i think id have to sit down and say well what kind of contribution would they make and also what what   right uhhuh umhum right   do you i think another element in it in it is what kind of society do you what what message are you trying to send to society i mean like the uh   yeah   im im actually in favor of things like uh if youre going to execute somebody you uh i dont see any reason why they shouldnt televise it you know or what have you its uh   umhum yeah   it uh uh you know people ought to be aware of what it is that you know what it is that theyre doing and uh you know what what the sentence really means when you uh you know if you sentence somebody to death this is what it really means just like they show you what prisons are supposedly like um they pardon   what well you you know you have the Christian view   uhhuh   and the Christian view is to forgive you know and uh   umhum     and maybe try to rehabilitation rehabilitate   umhum   and of course when you do that you know then your costs go up on that measure and those who have lost someone uh you know feel like that that uh the guys escaped justice   umhum   and uh so you know i can see that point too im just kind of the old line that uh i believe if you go out and kill your neighbor you know you can look to lose your own life     umhum sure uh   and and its true that uh some people uh you know uh go out and and commit a murder and they could really uh
