                                 More Time With My Family            Nobody in the press wantedto call Rep Bill Paxon a liar last month when he announced that he wasquitting his day job plotting and scheming against the House Republicanleadership to spend more time with his familytoddler Suby and wife SusanMolinari Less than a year ago Molinari left her seat in the House tobecome a TV anchor and according to news reports to spend more time with herfamily            Soreluctant were reporters to call Paxon a prevaricator that most of them waiteda decent intervala few paragraphsbefore reporting the apparent reason forPaxons resignation His challenge to Majority Leader Dick Armey was doomed andhe faced a career as a Republican backbencher a fate the ambitious polapparently couldnt face            ANexis dump indicates that at least twice a day somebodytells the press he or she has swapped the horrors of work for the bliss offamily In one recent week            A Baptist minister in NorthCarolina who was in hot water for performing a gay marriage ceremony doffedhis collar to spend more time with the missus            The CFOs of both the New YorkTimes Co and Kaiser Permanente copped the family plea when they left theirjobsthough a Kaiser Permanente spokesman felt it necessary to add that theresignation was unrelated to a  million loss in             Threecoaches hung up their clipboards one software CEO stored his last file and avillage board member cast her last vote because they allegedly wanted more timewith their loved ones            Obviously I dont think all these fineindividuals are lying about their motives Its safe to say that in the courseof a year perhaps two or three people on the planet really do quit so they canwatch their kids grow up Another halfdozen or so may be deceiving themselvesrather than us individuals such as the mayor of Delray Beach Fla Tom LynchLynch quit in  because he wanted more time with his family and hisbusiness Lynch has since learned that the sure cure for wanting to spend moretime with your family is spending more time with your family Hes just thrownhis hat in the ring for the Delray Beach School Board            Manytender the family alibi because theyre ashamed of having been fired orembarrassed to admit that theyve conceded defeat to the god of successPaxons case Im sure or because theyre going nuts on the job By citingfamily the worker neutralizes the stigma and efficiently blocks furtherquestions No responsible reporter will allege a firing if she cant prove itbecause that would risk a libel suit Besides only a pit bull would continueto tear into the flesh of a foe that has rolled over on its back to signalsurrender            In Washington the timehonored lie is to pair a newinterest in ones family with a profound disgust for the system Or to say thatyou want to get back to the real people Vin Weber left the House ofRepresentatives in  rather than face the vicious negative and highlypersonal campaign he saw looming Today Weber labors in the genial positiveand highly impersonal business of lobbying with clients like Microsoft ITTand Boeing Then theres the Rev Al Sharptons variation Last week heannounced that he would not seek office this year because he wants to spendmore time on civil rights issues            I fed thefamily alibi to the Washington Post when I quit my Washington job in I did however add that I had failed to acquire a family and I hoped tosecure a wife and two children as soon as possible so we could spend more timetogether            Another indemnifying exit strategy is to claimthat youre seeking new opportunities without naming them This excuseusually appears in the form of a corporate press release because nobody cankeep a straight face when its spoken out loud In a more honest world itwouldnt be tacky for titans of industry to say theyre leaving to pursue afully deployed golden parachute as they bail out            Theperson who actually does quit to spend more time with the family may discoverthat paid work is almost always more rewarding than the tedious work of childrearing Or so says Arlie Hochschild in The Time Bind When Work BecomesHome and Home Becomes Work  The modern home is like an assemblylinefactory with an endless stream of clothes to clean and kids to shuttle andbroken windows to fix and meals to cook Why not escape the noise and thepressure of being a Superadult for the rewards of the workplace wheresupervisors are trained to understand you            Lets call Paxons bluff and see if he stays close to hometo nurture Suby or takes another demanding job Of course Im betting on thedemanding job During the farewell tour of his legislative district Paxonindicated the depth of his enthusiasm in raising Suby when he let Molinarichange the diaper as their plane touched down in Buffalo NY His technique istoo methodical and slow she said            My hero though is RichardHeseltine the chairman of the Overseas Investment Trust who resigned earlierthis month in opposition to the business plan forced on him by his superiorsHeseltine declined to enumerate his disagreements with his bosses but saidPut it this way its nothing to do with ill health its not to pursue otherinterests its not to spend more time with my family
