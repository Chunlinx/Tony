                                 A Tourist at Home            When the weather is good Ioften take the bus to my office I suppose that is partly because the bus tripcosts  less than the taxi trip and I am of the Depression generation thatstill thinks that  is a lot of money I tell myself that it is only  centsin real  dollars but that doesnt stick in my mind Also I really likethe bus I like to observe the other passengers And I get a better view of thecity and the people on the sidewalk from my seat on the bus than I do from theback seat of a taxi especially during one of those wild rides where I amclosing my eyes to blot out the dangers            The busstop is across the street from the Watergate apartment in which I live Twentyyears ago possibly even  years ago when I came out of the building therewould be knots of tourists often Japanese standing around looking to takepictures of the building where it happened They are all gone now Watergatehas become an abstraction a symbol for something bad a president did Butthere are fewer and fewer people who remember just what the president didHardly anyone now remembers why Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr fought aduel or why Andrew Johnson was almost voted out of office So it is becomingwith Watergate            How accommodating it is of history to have located thebreakin of the Democratic National Committee in a building with a distinctivearchitectural style and name Suppose the breakin had been at one of thoseidentical cubical office buildings with names like   th Stthat fill downtown Washington Would tourists have come to take its pictureAnd what would we have instead of IranContragate and Whitewatergate andFilegate Journalists would have been clichless            But backto my bus The driver is always an AfricanAmerican and often a woman I cantget used to saying AfricanAmerican Her ancestors probably came here longbefore mineperhaps well over a century before mine If she is anAfricanAmerican what am Ia RussianAmerican But whatever we call her I amglad to see her She has overcome centuries of race and gender prejudice to getwhere she is I am pleased to see the competence with which she wrestles thatbig bus around corners hands out transfers and answers passengers questionsabout stops and connections Not long ago such competence would not have beenexpected of her            After snaking around eight blocks we arrive ata corner on Virginia Avenue where one can see separated by a narrow streetthe buildings of the Federal Reserve and the State Department What aconcentration of worldwide power But more impressive than the power is theconcentration of homeless men lounging on the grates and the grass            Twoblocks down on Virginia Avenue we come to the site of my epiphany Looking outof the bus window one day I saw a tall graceful fountain in the garden behinda building that fronted on Constitution Avenue I had passed it dozens of timeswithout noticing it perhaps because the water had not been playing before Isuddenly had the thought that if I had been on a tour bus in Rome or Viennathe guide would have called our attention to that fountain and explained itshistory and we would all have marveled at it From that moment at least for awhile I looked at my surroundings with fresh eyesthe eyes of a tourist            We turn up  th Street and pass the rearentrance of Constitution Hall the property of the Daughters of the AmericanRevolution I wondered how many other buildings are famous for something thatdidnt happen in them Marian Anderson didnt sing here in I have recently seen assertions that the DAR excluded Marian Anderson fromConstitution Hall because she wanted to sing on Easter Sunday and not becauseshe was colored as we used to say I dont know the truth of that but itreally doesnt matter The truth is that conditions in America in  weresuch that a Marian Anderson could be excluded because of her race andthat conditions today are such that she could not            A littlefarther up  th Street we see the huge building of the Department ofthe Interior which houses among other things the Bureau of Indian AffairsThat is the locus of one of Ronald Reagans favorite stories about thebureaucrat who was found with his head down on his desk sobbing because hisIndian had died That is a funny story but it should not have been told by apresident of the United States who should have realized that the historicrelation between the federal government and the American Indians is no laughingmatter            As we proceed up  th Street wetake on more passengers almost all of them AfricanAmericans or HispanicsOften I am the only white person on the bus In my new stance as a tourist Ithink to myself How exotic I could be on a bus in Tokyo and all the otherpassengers could be Japanese I know so little about them about their livesand thoughts and feelings            But thenI realize how superficial that attitude is Fundamentally the AfricanAmericansand Hispanics and I are pretty much alike riding on the same bus to the samedestination over the same potholes And we have reached a degree of liberationthat permits me to think of these potholes as Mayor Barrys potholes withoutfeeling guilty of racism            The word fundamentally in the previous paragraph carriesa lot of weight but it is important to think of what is fundamental I meanhaving the experience of love and loneliness illness and health the joy ofchildren the satisfaction of work and the inevitability of death Those arethe respects in which we are all alike That is the sense in which we are allon the same bus Perhaps it is being  years of age that makes me think thatthese are the overwhelmingly important and overwhelmingly common aspects oflife But many people much wiser than I am have thought that at a much earlierage than mine            Nearing the end of my trip Irealize that my observations have been largely about race That is notsurprising Race is the great American problem From the standpoint of humanhistory race is not the distinctive American conditionfreedom and prosperityare But even this pretendtourist takes that for granted It is the raceproblemthat tangled web of history hostility demands frustrationsinjustice and lawlessnessthat gets and deserves attention And yet as Ithink about Marian Anderson and about my fellow passengers and about the femalebus driver I feel hopeful            At my destination she pullsthe handle to open the door for me I say Thank you She says Have a niceday
