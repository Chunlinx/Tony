                                 Not for Children Only                        Dear Tony            I have to admit I began the first Harry Potter book in a mood of irritableskepticism Having worn out flashlight batteries under the blankets sinceearliest childhood Ive never understood why other grownups wont readchildrens books Of course theres plenty of dreck being written for allages but the best kids booksparticularly ones by British writerspulltheir readers through adventures of the sort that seem to have vanished fromserious adult fiction with compelling inventiveness thats rarely been seensince Lawrence Sterne OK maybe Donald Barthelme and Thomas Pynchon Plustheyre a lot easier to read Peter Dickinson who writes superb fantasy novelsfor children once explained it by saying Youre not allowed to borechildren And since no one bundles them off into the ghetto of genre when theybring in magic unless you consider juvenile lit a genre childrens authorscan draw on myths and fairy tales to give their books resonance and deeplysatisfying structure            But until this year it was almost impossible to get any selfrespectingadult to read them Friends would thank me with polite puzzlement when I gavethem great childrens books I knew theyd lovethen would tuck them away inthe bookshelves for when their kids were a bit older If my bookloving peerswould rather spend their beach reading on plodding thrillers than on theheartstopping adventure stories of Philip Pullman author of the DarkMaterials trilogy say or the scintillating allegory of Norton Juster The Phantom Tollbooth  then nothing could be done about it short ofreading aloud to them when they were laid up with the flu which does work butyou lose your voice So what were these Harry Potter books Why were healthyadults fighting for them Could they really be better than the books by DianaWynne Jones or E Nesbit or TH White Im sure you can add your ownfavorites here Tony which everybody turned up their noses at            Well no the Harry Potter books arent better But thats good news for hisfansits like saying that Dickens is no better than George Eliot Im hopingadults will find a savory spread of great kids books right beneath theirnoses now that theyve plucked those noses down from the stratosphere And Ibet kids are turning to other great books while they wait for the nextinstallment            Harry Potter the orphan son of a witch and a wizard gets sent to HogwartsSchool for Wizards after discovering his own magical powers in the first bookin the series Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone  This puts himsquarely in two timehonored juvenile genresmagic books and school storiesTheres even a fine body of literature in the intersection When I startedRowlings series I found myself comparing them to Jill Murphys outofprintWorst Witch books a series for slightly younger kids toyearoldsabout a hapless student at Miss Cackles Academy for Witches The two seriesshare lots of obvious details broomriding lessons animal familiars withminds of their own scary teachers potions gone wrong school uniforms thatlook like Halloween costumes to us Muggles as Rowling calls nonmagical folksI hope Murphys books will fly back into print on Rowlings robetails Ialso thought of Diana Wynne Jones Witch Week one of my alltime favoritebooks Its a dark witty suspense story about an outbreak of illegal magic ina school full of witch orphanschildren whose parents have been burned aswitches I was miffed on Jones and Murphys accounts among others thatRowling was getting all the press            But soon I was hooked just like everyone else The woman has an amazingimagination She structures the series like one of those Renaissance paintingswith the perspective lines heading off to infinity in all directions and weirdsupernatural beings and rock formations in the background while in theforeground someone in a peculiar hat has an intense interaction with ahippogriff And shes so funny Didnt you love the Whomping Willow the treeon the school grounds that bashes any creature fool enough to touch it andPeeves the school poltergeist whom everyone treats with irritated tolerationNot to mention poor Nearly Headless Nick the ghost whos not allowed to ridein the wild headless chase because the ax that did him in was too blunt andleft a flap of skin on his neck I also admire Rowlings talent for balancinghumor with serious savetheworld drama which she does with a far defter handthan Tolkien            I was impressed with her technique for interweaving her magical world withMuggle life Her wizard world exists in the interstices of everyday Britainwith its denizens wandering around in a bit of a muddle Think of thathilarious scene when one of Harrys school friends tries to call him on thetelephone and keeps shoutinghe cant believe his message is getting throughWizards of course send messages via owl post            And the books are getting better and better What did you think of theDementors those elegantly symbolic bonechilling villains in the latestHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  They guard Azkaban the wizardprison by sucking hope from the prisoners leaving them in a state of icydespair as good a description of depression as Ive ever read            Like Harrys nerdy courageous alwaysright friend Hermione Im tastingthe delicous pleasure of telling everyone I told them so Its so badbut itsso good            YoursPolly
