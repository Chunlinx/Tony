        well       its uh ill start off here uh i dont know i get probably most of my information either from the newspaper or from CNN um i like CNN because it uh you know repeats it well Headline News repeats every half hour and so it it makes it really convenient because i keep a rather hectic schedule   right yeah   and uh but the newspaper provides provides a little bit of depth that you cant really get from   yeah i i think id agree of of of a similar method of getting the news with me too its uh uh CNN has been a welcome addition to  the T V scene here in the last uh number of years uh       prior prior to cable you know you didnt get much news off of normal uh television broadcasts   right   uh just usually pretty local in in nature and and i like uh CNN because you get some world world events too   umhum   uh which is not too common on on the other format newspapers and so forth   right yeah i know the my only major objection is that uh i dont think American media spends enough uh attention on on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada uh   that thats true you know you hardly ever see uh headline articles about the uh either the economics or or other world news events going on in either of those countries   umhum yeah   uh whereas if you pick up a a European paper you know uh it all the surrounding countries Soviet Union and everything has uh major news uh articles in them   right yeah i mean you know Canadas going through a lot of problems now with with Quebec and and everything and uh its amazing that you know i i listen to DC area and the Washington Post you know i mean the most theyll give it is maybe the back of the A section   yeah   um you know   well im im currently living in Dallas and it it wont it wont even give it the back section you just never see you just never see anything about it uh       which is a shame because you go to other countries uh and and they carry quite a bit about the US on the other hand and if you go up to uh Canada those people are usually pretty uh familiar with the politics going on and and the news events in the US and   umhum   and were pretty uh limited in our understanding of of leaders up in Canada or Mexico   yeah definitely   you just you just dont know whats going on   yeah   id i every once in a while i have to travel overseas and then lately ive taken the taken a little shortwave radio uh around and picking up the BBC and its sort of like uh a CNN too you you can tune into some stations and you get some like thirty minute summaries of of news events uh   umhum   i occasionally get into some of the middle eastern uh area and thats the only way you can tell whats going on at all       theres not much in the way of television in some of those places   right   um but thats a good point about about the neighboring countries i hadnt really thought about it but i guess you dont think about it because you dont hear it   right exactly yeah i uh spent this past summer up in Canada uh well part of it touring and uh you know i i was amazed because id pick up a local paper and id read about all of these you know really interesting things going on theres some serious talk about whether theres actually going to be a a Canada you know in the next five years   yeah   you know because of the problems with Quebec and never i had never heard any of that before   yeah yeah you know there was a a what is it called is it Meech Lake Accord or or yeah thats just something uh   umhum   id say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and you know picked up a a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it and and came came and it was a big thing going on there and i came back here and nothing in the papers   right right   and just didnt see a thing about it so its uh weve got a long ways to go i guess its improved and like i say with CNN and and uh the cable news even even theres a uh its sort its semireligious in some respects but what is it its uh i mean its news is not not that way uh oh im trying to think of the channel the Christian the Christian Science Monitor   oh yeah   uh it it surprised me ive caught it a few times and they they do some pretty good news uh seemingly unbiased news broadcasts uh   umhum   uh the the title of the network is sort of surprising youd think it would carry mostly religious but it it doesnt seem to so ill flip through and listen to it once in awhile too uh and catch something maybe a little different than than CNN might be covering uh some more interest interest type topics in in other countries but its kind of world world uh network too   yeah um ive i guess ive never seen the TV show i used to get the uh
