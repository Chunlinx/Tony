                    Background        Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor        VEGFvascular permeability factor VPFresponsive genes        could potentially help elucidate the detail molecular        mechanisms of endothelial cells EC activation EC        activation is a program of geneexpression that could        affect angiogenesis permeability and inflammation that        are closely associated with a large number of vascular        diseases Recent studies show that priming of quiescent ECs        with appropriate cytokines could switchon the EC        transcription machinery the genes and protein products of        which could activate ECs Mediators known to activate ECs        include inflammatory cytokines growth factors such as        VEGFVPF and basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF        extracellular matrix ECM proteins such as collagen and        fibronectin and proteases such as MMPs              In vitro and         in vivo assays indicate that VEGF        signaling promotes increased permeability cell migration        proliferation and differentiation functioning through two        ECspecific tyrosine kinase receptor such as Kinase domain        receptor KDR       In the majority of solid tumors        VEGF is upregulated in response to hypoxia inducing the        expression of proangiogenic genes that promote tumor        angiogenesis growth and eventual metastasis              The expression of both positive and negative factors must        be tightly and specifically regulated in a coordinated        manner Uncontrolled expressions of these factors could        activate the EC transcription machinery which could        promote pathological consequences including tumor growth        and metastasis               Thus the identification and dissection of the cellular        and molecular pathways associated with EC activation may        reveal novel clues which could provide further        understanding of biological processes such as wound        healing vascular permeability and angiogenesis among        others A number of         in vitro model systems have thus been        developed to study EC activation that employs either one or        more combinations of ECM molecules including fibrin        fibronectin collagens laminins and Matrigel matrices        together with PMA and FGF       When placed in a D        type I collagen matrix and stimulated with PMA VEGF or        bFGF ECs undergo rapid morphological changes and        differentiate into capillarylike tubular networks        Transcriptional inhibitors block this         in vitro tube formation suggesting        that the angiogenesis requires EC activation and gene        expression      Indeed a recent review describes        approaches used to identify such angiogenesisrelated genes            Although many angiogenesisrelated soluble        factors ECM components and intracellular signaling        pathways have been identified and elucidated their        subsequent targets and their mode of action still remain to        be determined        Despite extensive studies for example the molecular        mechanisms underlying endothelial cell activation and EC        differentiations are not entirely understood To better        understand molecular mechanisms and pathways of EC        activation we embedded ECs in D type I collagen in        presence or absence of human recombinant VEGF  RNAs        isolated from these cultures were then subjected to        suppression subtractive hybridization and differential        display SSHDD Through this method we identified a set        of  new induced genes previously not reported to be        associated with the processes of EC activation We        confirmed expressions of candidate genes in ECs by northern        and western blot analyses There is a large number of        literature showing microarray and geneexpression profiling        analysis of EC transcriptome However this preliminary        study forms the basis for the future experiments involving        analyses of signaling pathways associated with EC        activation that are crucial for many pathophysiological        conditions including angiogenesis cardiovascular diseases        and growth of solid tumors                    Results                  Identification of VEGFresponsive endothelial cell          genes using SSHDD          Angioblasts and ECs are the precursor cells that can          form functional blood vessels in response to specific          angiogenic stimuli To study the molecular mechanisms          underlying capillary morphogenesis in ECs we used a          wellestablished           in vitro model of angiogenesis          Model system employed in our study closely resembles with          those that have been described previously                Either human microvascular endothelial cells HMECs or          human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs were          seeded between two thin layers of type I collagen gels          and overlayed with complete media supplemented with VEGF           as described in methods This typically induced          cytoplasmic projections spikes and extensions          elongations of ECs within  to  hr These processes were          considered to represent a precursor to cell elongation          interconnections of cells and eventual tubule formation          A small population of ECs that failed to elongate did          not form such interconnections This model system closely          approximates ECM proteolysis cell migration          proliferation and capillary formation Representative          photomicrographs of VEGFinduced capillary morphogenesis          in ECs after  hr and  hr are shown in Figs Aand B          respectively Figure Cshows ECs forming at X          magnification elaborate interconnections and vacuole          formation at  hr Although control unstimulated ECs          formed interconnections at the end of  hr but fail to          form any capillaries data not shown Eosin staining of          these structures demonstrated that the capillaries were          surrounded by at least three to five ECs Fig D To          identify genes associated with activation of ECs we used          the method of SSHDD By employing forward and          reversesubtraction we identified both common indicated          by arrows and differentially expressed genes Fig          E F The addition of VEGF into ECs embedded in          the D type I collagen matrix forwardsubtraction          generated more than  cDNA fragments To eliminate the          identification of artifactual clones we analyzed only          those cDNA fragments that were detected at least  times          Based on this criterion only  cDNA fragments clones          out of  sequences clones were retained for further          evaluation From this  a total number of  induced          fragments were identified and sequenced Table I          Database search with these nucleotide sequences using the          BLAST algorithm revealed many known positive or negative          regulators of angiogenesis including proteases and cell          surface receptors Importantly we identified           VEGFresponsive candidate genes associated with the          activation of endothelial cells                          Confirmation of Differentially Expressed Genes by          Northern Blot          To confirm the differential expression of genes          identified by SSHDD we performed Northern blot analysis          of total RNA isolated from ECs grown in D collagen          matrices The expression of  known regulators of          angiogenesis KDR and             integrin VEcadherin MMP and          MMP as well as  candidate genes Figs   Table I          identified were analyzed Consistent with previous          reports the expression of KDRVEGFR increased by           fold at  hours  fold at  hrs and  fold at           hours in response to VEGF treatment Fig A          whereas the expression of             integrin subunit was increased by           fold at  hours by  fold at  hrs and was barely          detectable at  hrs Fig B      Expression of          VEcadherin was minimal at the earlier time points but          significantly increased at the end of  hours Fig C          MMP expression remained robustly active from  to           hours Fig D While expression of MMP appeared to be          biphasic highest expressions were detected at  and           hrs Fig E Equal loading of RNAs was confirmed by          probing membrane with a actin cDNA probe data not          shown Northern analyses of clones D B E G          A F A C D H F and C were          performed at  hrs following VEGF treatment Fig          ABCDEFGHIJKL Northern blot          analysis did not support the differential expression of          clone C Fig H Clone D B and C probes each          detected  transcripts which could be either          alternatively spliced products or related genes Clone          E G A F A C D H F probes          detected single transcripts Fig          CDEFGHIJK Of particular note probe B          corresponding to Stanniocalcin detected primarily the          lower isoform  kb in ECs While probe C          corresponding to Stabilin is known to produce three          isoforms Most likely ECs primarily express Stabilin          and  that are  and  kbs isoforms respectively          The GAPDH probe was included as a control for the          quantity and integrity of the loaded RNA detecting a          single transcript of  kb All data shown are          representative of those obtained in at least three          separate experiments with similar results                          Confirmation of Differentially Expressed Genes by          Western Blot          To confirm that the genes identified by SSHDD encode          proteins we performed Western blot analysis of total          cellular protein isolated from ECs grown in monolayers          The addition of bFGF VEGF or PMA to the monolayers ECs          induced cellular elongation over a period of  to  hr          In contrast unstimulated ECs remained proliferative and          retained a cobblestone appearance data not shown          Western blot analysis revealed that VEGF and PMA but not          bFGF induced the expression of KDR Flt and the             integrin subunit at  hr Fig          ABC Likewise only VEGF and PMA upregulated the          expression of VECadherin Fig D As expected all           cytokines induced the expression of MMP and MMP Fig          Eand F These cytokines also induced expression of          Kinesin Fig G albeit less appreciably Furthermore          we found dramatic increase in expression of VCIPPAPb in          ECs that were stimulated with VEGF and PMA Fig H lane           and  in contrast in bFGF stimulated cells Fig           lane  or in control Fig  lane  its expression          remained undetectable AntiGrb mAb was included as          control for protein loading Fig I These data suggest          that the cDNA fragments detected by SSHDD were indeed          active genes that produce proteins that could activate          endothelial cells Similar studies will be required to          test whether remaining novel genes produce functional          proteins or not and to establish their exact role in EC          activation For Western immunoblotting experiment          monolayer ECs as opposed to cells grown in D gel were          used Because it was difficult to solubilize ECs          embedded in D gel Cold cell extraction buffer          containing  Triton X and  SDS did not          effectively solubilize solidified D collagen  warm          C cell extraction buffer was incompatible because it          activated endogenous proteases It remains possible that          different genes may be expressed in ECs cultured as          monolayer as opposed to D                            Discussion                  Known Regulators of Angiogenesis          Of the known regulators of EC activation identified in          our study the role of MMPs has been well established          Matrix digestion by MMPs including MMP MMP and          MMP is a prerequisite for EC activation          differentiation and tumor induced angiogenesis               The growth of mesenchymal cells in a D type I collagen          matrix induces the processing and activation of proMMP          by MMP Consistent with this incubation of ECs with          angiogenic cytokines induced the expression of MMP and          MMP Figs            We also identified  indirect regulators of EC          activation and angiogenesis ie myeloblastin          cathepsin B calpastatin and urokinase plasminogen          activator surface receptor uPAR The myeloblastin          protein displays antiproliferative properties and is          also a key protease involved in factorindependent growth          of hematopoietic cells     Overexpression of          myeloblastin has been linked to multifunctional cytokine          transforming growth factor TGF a known regulator of          angiogenesis We postulate that myeloblastin in our model          system may negatively regulate EC activation thereby          signaling to end EC morphogenic differentiation          Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease the          expression of which is increased in different tumors          including human brain lung colon and breast tumors              Calpastatin is a physiological protease inhibitor          that acts specifically on calpain a calciumdependent          cysteine protease The cleavage of calpastatin by          caspases initiates the apoptotic cascade in certain          neurological disorders     It is possible that          increased expression of calpastatin may control calpain          activity thereby limiting extent of proteolysis during          capillary sprouting In contrast uPAR has been shown to          regulate plasminogenmediated extracellular proteolysis          during angiogenesis              The identification of VEGFR and VEGFR KDR was          consistent with the observation that the stimulation of          ECs with VEGF increases the expression of VEGFR          promoting myocardial revascularization     We also          detected the cell adhesion molecules VCAM VECadherin          and the             integrin subunit all known          regulators of angiogenesis In the present study we          confirmed the expression of KDR             integrin VEcadherin MMP and          MMP in activated ECs by northern and western blot          analysis Figs and           Finally we identified a known modulator of          angiogenesis the prostaglandin endoperoxidaseH          synthase also known as cyclooxygenase COX The COX          isoform is constitutively expressed in blood vessels          while expression of the COX isoform is induced in new          blood vessels In many angiogenic tumors COX          colocalizes with VEGF and TGF and increased expression          of COX and VEGF has been correlated with increased          tumor microvascular density                              Metabolic genes and Miscellaneous genes          Although metabolic genes such as ketohexokinase          adenosine deaminase and spermidine synthase detected by          SSHDD assay           per se do not directly activate of          EC it is likely that they could represent a component of          the angiogenic switch Among the miscellaneous genes          identified in our study were adenylyl cyclase and          platelet factor  PF Intracellular signaling          machinery of adenylyl cyclase is required for          cytoskeletal organization vessel maturation and vessel          integrity     PF is a chemokine that binds to FGF          and is a known inhibitor of EC proliferation and          migration     Thus the upregulation of PF might          limit the degree of activation of ECs and morphogenic          differentiation It is noteworthy that Stanniocalcin          Stc accession  U Figs A was also identified          by GeneCalling a mRNA profiling technique and           in situ hybridization demonstrated          that Stc is expressed in the vasculature of a subset of          squamous cell carcinomas     Stc is a secreted          protein known to regulate calcium and phosphate          homeostasis potential role of this protein in EC          activation and permeability is not clear     Since          most ECMdegrading enzymes are metal ion dependent Stc          may act as a sensor to maintain a steadystate level of          metal ions during EC activation                          Candidate genes associated with the activation of          ECs          In addition to the genes discussed above that have          previously been implicated in EC activation and          differentiation we also identified  candidate genes          Table I          Kinesin heavy chain KHC accession X Figs          Band G mediates organelle movement towards the plus          ends of microtubules in the presence of ATP and functions          in cell differentiation and axonal guidance     To          our knowledge increased expression of KHC during EC          differentiation has not been previously reported          Although the specific role of KHC in the differentiation          process is unclear this protein might be important for          the maintenance of the plasticity andor polarity of ECs          which may be a prerequisite for the formation of          capillary ends          Epiregulin Fig C is a member of epidermal growth          factor EGF family of mitogens     Expression of          epiregulin has been reported to be highest in placenta          and in a subset of carcinoma cells Epiregulin activates          COX therefore epiregulin may serve as an upstream          inflammatory component of COX signaling pathway The          function of epiregulin in the activation of ECs has not          been investigated          A general transcription factor BTF Fig D clone          G accession AA protein is thought to be          involved in precise transcription by RNA polymerase II          but fails to interact with DNA Disruption of gene          encoding BTF protein in the mouse caused          postimplantation lethality around embryonic day               Detailed studies have not been reported in the          literature We believe this is the first report of          identification of BTF as one of the induced genes in the          activation of ECs          As a first step towards elucidating the molecular          mechanisms and pathways associated with activation of          ECs we cloned the fulllength cDNA corresponding to the          Clone A called VCIP also known as phosphatidic acid          phosphatase type b PAPb PAPb shares similarity with                    Drosophila polarity gene           Wunen      PAPbVCIP          encodes  amino acid residues contains a single          Nglycosylation site a consensus lipid phosphatase motif          KPSXXXRPH an RGD cell attachment motif          sixtransmembrane channellike structure and displays Mg          independent lipid phosphatase activity in transfected          T cells     Both N and Cterminus segments of          PAPbVCIP are located inside the cytoplasm Consistent          with previously published report our data suggest that          PAPbVCIP is cell surface protein and the expression of          VCIP is highly enriched in vascularized tissues In          addition to its known lipid phosphatase activity          PAPbVCIP also mediate cellcell interactions                       Synaptojanin Figure F is also known as a          polyphosphoinositide phosphatase This family of          proteins is distant homolog of yeast protein SacI              The SacI homology domain is most notably found at the          amino terminal of the inositol phosphatase          synaptojanin Synaptojanin lipid phosphatase          activities may be regulated by cellcell and cell matrix          interactions through RAFTs morphogenetic platforms                       G proteincoupled receptor GPCR kinaseinteractor          Fig G interacts with G proteincoupled receptor          kinases and exhibits ADPribosylation

  kb size EC specific isoform Because GIT localizes          with a subset of paxillin therefore makes it a          potential candidate signaling protein that may          collaborate with focal adhesion signaling machinery              Thus GIT may play a role in cell adhesion          spreading and motility          SMAP an Smg GDSassociating protein Fig H Clone          C accession AI contains  Armadillo repeats          and interacts with the smg GDS protein through these          repeats This protein is a vSrc substrate          phosporylation affects the affinity of the protein

exhibits dual activity One is to stimulate their GDPGTP          exchange reactions and the other is to inhibit their          interactions with membranes              Angiopoietin related protein AngRP Fig I is          chiefly expressed by the hepatic cells AngRP contain the          characteristic coiledcoil and fibrinogenlike domains          that are conserved in angiopoietins however do not          interact with Tie and Tie receptor     AngRP act          as a survival factor for ECs but its role in          angiogenesis is not clear It will be interesting to          examine if there is a specific receptor for this molecule          in ECs or other vascular cells          Probe H Fig J detected  kb transcript amino          acid sequence analysis suggest that this protein is          likely to be member of ribosomal protein L     In          eukaryotes ribosome consists of a S large subunit and          a S small subunit     In mammalian cells          ribosomal proteins accounts for up to  of the total          cellular protein          The alpha subunit of Translational elongation factor          Fig K mediates binding of aminoacyltRNAs to S          ribosomes This process is driven by hydrolysis of GTP          into GDP Translational elongation factor interacts          with guanine nucleotides S ribosomes and          aminoacyltRNAs In addition Translational elongation          factor binds with the  subunit of Translational          elongation factor to exchange bound GDP for GTP                       Finally clone C Fig L DNA sequence was

proteins showing  fasciclinlike adhesion          domains  EGF domains  Xlink domain and           BXB hyaluronanbinding motifs     Stabilin          and stabilin are likely to play a role in cellcell and          cellmatrix interactions in vascular cells              Several articles describe the identification of genes          associated with the activation of ECs and angiogenesis          as well as the repertoire of genes expressed in normal          versus tumorassociated endothelium                 Because EC activation is a complex process accompanied          by alterations in many aspects of EC physiology it was          not surprising that the genes identified in these studies          were in several functional classes However the genes          identified in the present study are significantly          different from those reported by others which may          reflect differences in the approaches used and types of          tissues analyzed        This preliminary study          serves as groundwork for our laboratory and we believe          it will be worthwhile to examine their role in ECs          Detail study of these candidate genes will entail          generation of recombinant cDNA constructs generation of          cell lines antibodies fusion proteins and perform          insitu hybridization among others Detailed analysis of          each of the differentially expressed genes identified in          this report is ongoing and is beyond the scope of this          article                            Methods                  Materials
