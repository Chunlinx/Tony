                all right um how do you feel about the health insurance problems   well uh i agree that they have problems but i im afraid im very much against universal health  um my daughter is uh uh stationed in England right now and of course you know theyve had uh group health uh over there for some time um   uhhuh yeah   i was over there last uh a year ago when my granddaughter was born and uh she had some problems and uh i was horrified from beginning to end  first of all they are about fifty years behind   uhhuh   they dont have and their medical technology he doctors since they arent responsible really to each patient dont feel they have to sit down and talk to you about the problems   umhum   when they want to do something to a patient whether the patient is a few days old or eighty or ninety they do it they dont ask permission   wow   my daughter went um upstairs into intensive care to see the baby and they were doing surgery on the baby and she didnt even know they were going to surgery on the baby uh   oh my God what a terrible thing for her to go through   yes it was it was really terrible thats why i went over there i mean she was she cried she called and was you know really you know upset um the day we were leaving the hospital finally um we were getting all ready to go home and finally you know the baby was okay and everything was fine and the doctor that had been working with her poked his head in the door and he said by the way he said in six weeks he want you to come back uh for a test uh uh a test that we want to do on on her um for uh uh multiple sclerosis   ah   and he turned around and left and we just kind of looked at each other and said what uh for what and i i tried for fifteen minutes to find the doctor and he was unavailable so uh ive had some bad experiences with it i i uh perhaps not you know uh i dont know a good solution do you have any ideas   yeah well no i i i had never had experiences like you did which sound terrible to go through     well the the thing is these are the HMOs that they have now which are cheaper and you can in my daughter my other daughter belongs to an HMO or they used to thankfully theyve just changed um you dont   umhum uhhuh   you only get a choice of doctors that are in your area not necessarily of doctors that are good or not uh see i ive worked for i worked for John Hopkins for two years   right right uhhuh   uh at the hospital there and ive worked for a private doctor for two years and um i got to slap in the face as far as the medical profession was concerned in the United States uh now the doctor that i worked for was good but there was another one in our complex that uh she didnt feel should even be practicing medicine and i said well why dont they get him out of there she said well he hasnt done anything wrong its just that he has poor judgment and i thought oh gosh i mean youre the doctor telling you this you know   oh   some horror stories like that but then with the HMO um the they sent here to a pediatrician that had one gentleman that was uh uh in his late seventies and an Indian doctor that she couldnt understand and that had no patience with children     ah   and you know it was kind of that was kind of a bad experience too so when they changed she finally got you know a good pediatrician but uh uh it it its its just a little scary when you dont have as much when you cant just go say heres a good doctor im going to go to this doctor you know um   right   and i i fear that the doctors are going to not be as you know right now theyre in a lot of fierce competition  so they they keep up to date you know at least most of them the good ones um i i i dont know i just fear that uh that it may go downhill if we do indeed you know change to something like that uh   that doesnt give any incentive   no it doesnt uh also uh we uh my husband was a civilian but we were uh stationed overseas for a while and so i had to go to myself and the children had to go do military doctors huh wow  now thats another story you know so but its the same       same thing i mean these doctors didnt want to be here okay they were forfilling fulfilling their military obligations and you know they uh of course i guess if you a doctor gets into the field you know they uh well enjoy the field but um the i have found uh through people that i know that have HMOs that most of the doctors that they see there may be one or two good ones and the rest of them are either foreign speaking i mean not speaking but like Indian doctors you cant understand them because of their their um uh accent   uhhuh   uh or uh Chinese or and i have nothing against them in fact i went to a doctor for years that was a Chinese doctor but i could understand what he was saying   umhum   you know so i just it just this is a bad subject for me to be on  only because ive had some real bad experiences and ive known some people that have uh   yeah i guess so i just joined an HMO i just got a new job and i havent heard i havent been i havent even actually paid for it or actually started my coverage yet but thats what they have is HMO and   been right well ill tell you now what you do is you go uh to the doctors and just meet them   umhum   and get feel on you know you can usually tell if you go to a doctor and if you you give him i dont know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply um if theyre going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk  to you and that will you know do things like that uh       is uh uh is usually pretty good but uh uh you know you ill try him out   well what they told me at at work they told me that uh they said that the most once you get to know the doctors well you get you get your choice of doctors but theres huge waiting lines for the good ones and theres no waiting lines for the bad ones so you dont really get the good ones even if you choose them you dont get them for years and years if at all   yeah ow it should okay see thats it   so   yeah so thats see thats what scares me about going into universal health   yeah   okay  i mean  you could  you could really be in serious trouble if you wait to see one of the ones that you feel are better if uh uh you know if we went to that and that was all there was uh um uh   how would they decide who gets which doctor   oh well they dont  it would it would still be like it is now um the ones in your area     oh i see local   you know and that would be closest to where you live uh and you know those are the ones that you would see i mean i would presume um       but uh but also now in England how they work it is you go to see a regular MD if he determines that its necessary then hell send you to a gynecologist or a surgeon or you know you cant just go there   right that the same for the HMO and and because the doctors work for the HMO the people i work with are telling me you know HMOs are great if youre generally healthy   uh   and you just go for the checkup every year or whatever its just three dollars but if you have a problem then its real hard to get the doctor to refer you to a specialist because theyre told you know not to  because it cost the HMO money   yes umhum yep um hum thats right and uh i mean you know that could potentially be um rather
