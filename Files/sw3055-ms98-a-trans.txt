          and i guess the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party if we wanted to do something like that or share recipes or something um  are you one who gives dinner parties very often   yes uhhuh sure right no   no nor am i  uh   i avoid them with all   theyre a lot of work thats for sure yes yes   yeah they are i mean i do them but theyre a lot of work i usually have them when i theres a special event in their lives and i i make a big deal out of it for them   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   and uh i think im uh most happiest with my most familiar foods that i know are successful   yeah right yes   you know and i have uh i make my own pies and pie crust and you know i can make my pies from scratch i dont need a recipe to follow and   uhhuh oh thats great you sound like my mother whos been well i bake pies too but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family and she has the same the same technique i mean i guess after so many years of doing it you just kind of do it second nature   uh yeah you just know from heart i had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie and she said make me one and i made her one and when i when she gave me back the plate she said i didnt share this with anybody   ah she enjoyed it huh  well theres a a woman in our choir who is almost nearly famous for her apple pies and uh we had a   and i thought whoa  that was a big pie yes um umhum   a an auction one time at the church  excuse me and uh one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars   my word she must have a great pie recipe then   well i i think i i ive had it once and its been a few years ago but i do recall that it was quite good so um   wonderful   yeah so that is her specialty um i like to bake um also i dont bake so much now that my children are grown but i do enjoy baking and i guess i always liked making making um cookies and bars and things like that that was more my specialty i suppose and they seem to last longer than pies around here pies just would would go practically in a days time  yes   umhum umhum yeah you thats right yeah theyre meant for the that evening dessert and you know its got to be gone or daddy gets into the you know the leftovers and puts about two more inches on his waistline and then he is  chastising himself afterwards   right  and not very happy huh well its interesting that uh yesterday i had lunch with a friend and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend for friends of hers for um a   umhum   one of her acquaintances one of her old friends i guess had been in town and uh they invited two other couples over and so there were seven of them but uh i said well what did you have and she said what she had uh just Mexican food but you know she had uh uh you know guacamole and uh i cant remember all she had but she also had made uh flan which is actually Spanish i think have you ever made that or had it   no i have not huhuh   its it it its um i had used to work with a a gentleman who was from Cuba who would make it uh and its just a wonderful dessert its like uh a egg custard in a uh caramelized sugar uh was on top of it and its its quite   umhum oh okay   actually not very difficult to make but its very very high in cholesterol im sure with all the eggs that are in it but uh   sure yeah   she said that she and her husband had uh traveled in Spain a couple of years ago and and flan is almost uh a basic with every meal that you get there   like apple pie in America right uhhuh   yeah uhhuh its just very customary to get flan so if you ever run into that youll youll sort of be aware of what thats all about but uh i would never have thought of making that as part of a a Mexican dinner but   wow umhum yeah   you know so papillas i guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that but  flan is something you can make ahead and have just uh you know have ready but uh oh i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon but   umhum umhum   i tell you it that i my its one of those things where it does require some real uh planning and its you know you dont just make the dinner you have your house to clean and you know the the whole business that goes with that   yes  umhum well when i have a dinner party thats my motivation for getting the house clean   yeah probably a good way to do it  oh the house needs cleaning i guess i better have a dinner party yeah   yeah yeah were catering a wedding um in August and uh this lady that is it at its is at her house shes not a a good housekeeper so shes got to hire this crew   oh uhhuh oh   of four women to come in of two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready yes and there you know she she must have found some jewels because they start in the corner and work out   good heavens uh oh wow thats such a nice thing its i you know until well we my husband and ive been married twenty six years and until last year i had never had another person clean my house and then i got so involved and so busy i said   yeah so umhum umhum   this is one luxury im going to let myself have every now and then and so i had a woman come in uh once a month you know and which isnt very often but for me it was wonderful   sure yeah thats nice you know to have that thats a luxury today   well it is and it is it buys you time to do other things like have a dinner party  so its just a real gift of time as far as i am concerned but well um i better   thats right yeah yeah umhum i i have a pie crust that recipe that i that is unique that has vinegar and egg in it   uhhuh i have heard about that but ive never tried it no um um well i should say i have heard of one that has vinegar in it i dont know that it has egg in it uhhuh uhhuh do you have it right on the top of your head   have you okay egg and sugar umhum umhum um i no i think it would be too hazy because um the uh no i   you dont have it yeah i would i   well its like the liquid is like a half of cup of water and then your egg and then your uh tablespoon of vinegar and you mix that together and then you you know your see it makes   uhhuh right   it makes uh five pie crusts at once so thats its quite a volume of um   uh quite large yeah right   i think its four cups of flour and like uh a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar and and you combine your dry ingredients and then you uh put in your liquid   uhhuh umhum yeah um what is it about the uh the vinegar that uh makes the crust better   it just it just makes it very pliable and and very flaky and you can really treat it rough and youre still going to have a flaky pie crust   ah interesting yeah yeah boy that the thats the real secret umhum   like uh its not mine it was from uh one of the magazines probably twenty years ago and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it and it will still be flaky and i thought wow thats quite a statement for them to make   oh that it makes me think of years ago um when i was visiting my motherinlaw in uh Michigan and she lived very near an apple orchard and we just had we could take as many apples as we wanted from it according you know according to the owners and so i decided to bake about four pies ahead you know and freeze them   umhum umhum   well talk about working with big amounts of pie crust and having it be tough  those were the toughest apple crust or apple uh pie crust that i have ever ever made it was just terrible i i could have used that recipe it sounds like   oh wow wow well im from Michigan   where about   uh Detroit umhum   uhhuh well we lived in um Plymouth for four years um   oh yeah thats real close   yeah in fact i we were there from uh seventy three to seventy seven and i was i worked for the little the weekly newspaper there the the the Plymouth Plymouth um oh what was it called Crier and uh   umhum oh how neat   my husband is from the upper peninsula so he was born and raised up there and thats where my motherinlaw still lives so uh are you originally from Michigan or uhhuh   oh okay umhum oh yes umhum born in Detroit umhum um   ill be darn and
