                                 Diamonds in the Rough            Fourscore and seven yearsago the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for businessPhiladelphias Shibe Park home to the Athletics and later the Phillies wasone of  urban ballparks built in the sevenyear period now regarded as thegolden age of ballpark architecture All but three Wrigley Field Fenway Parkand Tiger Stadium have since been razed            Replacing parks built of wood these ballyards set new standards for size firesafety intimacy and convenience As places to watch ballgames they werevastly superior to the postWorld War II parks especially the facilitiesdesigned in the late s and s that doubled as football stadiums But theseconcrete monsters plopped into vast parking lots in Houston PittsburghCincinnati Philadelphia and elsewhere lack the character of the classicparks            Chicagos New Comiskey Park which opened in attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodernfacade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the goldenera park itreplaced New Comiskey was marketed as an oldfashioned park with all themodern conveniences But inside it was still a symmetrical concrete monsterand it sat in the middle of a car parking lot rather than in an urbanneighborhood            A yearlater a newyet more genuinely oldballpark arrived to dispel the gloomBaltimores Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkilyasymmetrical relatively intimate steelstructured cityfriendly ballparkOnce this opens predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti everyonewill want one like it And so it came to be Camden Yards successors inCleveland Arlington Texas and Denver and those designed for MilwaukeeSeattle and San Francisco take their cues from Baltimores conceptualbreakthrough Even totally nontraditional parks like those in Phoenix Miamiand Tampa Bay emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield Its almostas though a disembodied voice intoned If you build it they will copy            While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universallypraised some of them dont deserve the hype The most annoying hype is thatall the new parks are intimate and that every seat is better at the new placethan the old Intimacy has two aspectsactual size and the subjectiveperception of size and scale A good architect can ace the second part of thetest through convincing forms good proportions and attractive materials Theexposed steelwork brick stone tile and wellplaced wall openings of the newparks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago            For the new parks charmswe should be thankful But in actual size the new ballyards are not intimateAll their amenitieselevators wider concourses abundant toilets especiallyfor women bathrooms escalators plentiful food stands and luxurysuitesmake them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate These parksare larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate Compare forinstance the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington  seats which rests on acres to Seattles Kingdome a seat multipurpose stadium thatopened in  and covers  acres Ebbets Field home to the BrooklynDodgers occupied a mere  acres and seated             Orcompare heights New Comiskey Parks roof is  feet above field level oldComiskey Park was about  feet high This is not ballpark trivia but anindicator of fan experience Upperdeck seats in the new taller stadiums arefarther away from the action At Arlington the fan sitting in the middlerowupperdeck seat closest to home plate is  feet from the batter compared to feet at Tiger Stadium a park with  more seats            Why are upperdeck seats in the new parks so far from thegame Two reasons column placement and luxury seating            In the old parks thestructural columns stood within the seating areas placing the upperdeck seatscloser to the game The tradeoff was that these columns obstructed the view ofsome fans Todays architects remedy the problem by placing the columnsbehind the seating areas thus moving the upper decks back from the field Itshould be noted that the new parks claim that they have noimpairedview seats is an overstatement            Addedtiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck awayfrom the field The retreat of that deck is a centurylong process but it canbe stemmed The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered CamdenYards top deck and produced a middlerow viewing distance of  feet abouteight rows closer than Arlingtons            Design references to goldenage ballparks are only oneparallel between that period and ours We are also matching that eras frenziedpace of construction Twentysix of Major League Baseballs  franchisesoccupy a park that is less than  years old has been or will be extensivelyremodeled or hope to move into a new one soon            One of the classic parksmerits was that they were unsubsidized Team owners bought land and paid forstadium constructionsome even built trolley lines to transport fans to thegames In all but two cases during the last  years taxpayers have coveredmost or all of the costs of stadium building            The SanFrancisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadiumassembling about  million in private funds and persuading the city to payfor some of the infrastructure The Giants say that other team owners arerooting against their scheme because it calls into question the profligatepublic subsidies Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costsIf the White Sox fail to draw  million annual fans at New Comiskey Park inthe th through th years of their lease the state of Illinois iscontractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto tickets            Youd expect that the public would get something perhapsaffordable seats in return for subsidizing stadiums Instead the cheap seatsin the new parks are scarcer The Seattle Mariners proposed park forinstance will contain about onefourth as many generaladmission seats as thepresent location This erosion of lowcost seats is a longrunning trend            So too is the dramaticincrease in luxury seating which is the primary real reason for theballparkbuilding boom The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites thatlease for between  and  a year payable in advance Acomparable moneymaker is the club deck just above the firsttier seatingThese pricey sections are occupied usually on a seasonticket basis and offerthe best sightlines roomier seats and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare            The gilding doesnt endthere New parks also include membersonly stadium clubs and onpremises barsand restaurants            Naturally owners dont advertise their new parks as a means of making lifebetter for elite ticketholders They say that only a new stadium will allowthem to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and toallow fans to savor that oldtime baseball flavor in greater comfort andconvenience Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitchthey have voted thesemeasures down in Illinois Washington state California Wisconsin andMichigan Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap stategovernments directly for the money            Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater landand construction costs Operable roofs such as those in Torontos SkyDomePhoenixs BankOne Ballpark and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee arebudgetbusters Since most teams put up little if any of their own moneythey have scant incentive to economize on the parks In Seattle Marinermanagement has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driestweather in MLB outside California The real problem with the Seattle climate iscold weather in spring and fall but the unsealed roof wont make the parkwarmer or totally free of wind            Lately the cost ofstadiums has ranged from about  million to  million The multipurposestadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattans lower west side tentativelycarries a  billion price tag Add the financing and maintenance costsand even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof At one pointthe cost of the Brewers proposed stadium grew from  million to million and thats not counting the value of the land            Thegood news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team AllPittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a toseat parkwith natural grass and no roof bells or whistles Though his attitude iscommendable the proposed park will still cost about  million and perhapsan equal amount in interest            Why should the public chip in Taxpayer subsidies dontproduce cheaper ticketsthey produce more expensive tickets The averageadmission price not counting club seats and suites rises about  percentwhen a team moves into new digs And independent economists ie those nothired by stadium proponents discount the claim that new stadiums spur regionaleconomic growth            But one compellingargument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together whenproperly designed and sited This requires a downtown or neighborhood locationwhere lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game where they canwalk to the stadium from work hotels restaurants or bars and where gettingto the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experienceThis is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park andthe new ones in Toronto Baltimore Cleveland and Denver            If youput them in the wrong place its a colossal waste of money says the planningdirector of the city of Cleveland But if you put them in the right place thebenefits are phenomenal            Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generatemuch better patronage than suburban ones or those in neithernor locationsThere are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have legsretaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off But some teamsdeliberately seek isolated locations where they can better monopolize parkingrevenues and gamerelated food drink and souvenir business This is why theWhite Sox moated their park with  acres of parking why the MilwaukeeBrewers refuse to build downtown and why the Mariners insisted on the mostremote of Seattles three ballparksiting options            Modern conveniences asidethe new baseball shrines are a mixed bag Most are visually impressive boastinterestingly shaped playing fields and start off as boxoffice hits But toomany of them are large and expensive tend to live on the dole and arehampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans At their bestthey strengthen their cities at their worst they exploit them            The decisionmakingprocess behind the financing and building of new ballparks has becomepredictable as have the designs But the good news is that our stadium boom isfar from over If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longerview of stadium economics and community concerns we may yet see parks thatbetter unite traditional character with modern convenience
