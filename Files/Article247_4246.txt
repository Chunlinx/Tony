                                 Brush Up Your Shakespeare iPleasei            It was inevitable thatas the New York Times reportsShakespeare would come to rivalMachiavelli as the most popular adviser in world literaturefor businessmen who want to lie cheat and scheme their way to the top TheBrothers Grimm and A A Milne author of Winnie the Pooh  dabble inthat line of work too but their output is noncompetitiveonly one book toMachiavellis and Shakespeares several each It is also fitting that thecharacter chosen by the authors of Shakespeare in Charge The Bards Guide to Leading andSucceeding on the Business Stage as a role model for CEOs is Henry VHal as he is called is widely acknowledged to be the playwrights mostMachiavellian hero            Most people like to think of Henry V as a jolly patriot who conquered Francefor Englandhurrahwhich is how Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh playhim in the two movie versions of Henry V  But read the play more closelyand you realize that the cheerfully successful king bears little resemblance tothe man Shakespeare created At best Shakespeares Henry V was as criticWilliam Hazlitt wrote an amiable monsterthat is he was ready tosacrifice his own life for the pleasure of destroying thousands of otherlives At worst he was a cold and cunning strategist without a glimmer ofmoral doubt a man as happy to humiliate his friends even execute them as heis to commit mass murderall in the name of consolidating power                           Just the sort of man a CEO should emulate you may be thinkingCulturebox agrees The Shakespearean as opposed to the Oliverian orBranaghian Henry V embodies several telling bits of wisdom for he who woulddevelop the character of a trueblue businessman             Learn everything you can from your friends but drop them the minutethey get in your way In Henry IV  young Hal is a roustabout whokeeps the company of a band of merry thieves led by the obese drunkardFalstaff who has been described by critic Harold Bloom as the life forceincarnate Falstaff teaches Hal how to be a quickwitter punster and a masterof play he also teaches him a commoners skepticism of power and itspretensions In short Hal learns from Falstaff a street savvy that will makehim enormously popular later in life As soon as Hal ascends to the thronehowever he pretends not to know his old and embarrassing mentor                           I know thee not old man fall to thy prayersHow ill white hairs become a fool and jesterI have long dreamd of such a kind of manSo surfeitswelld so old and so profaneBut being awaked I do despise my dream                         Dont worry about whether you have a good reason to initiate ahostile takeover simply having the means to do so will suffice Why doesHenry V gather up an army and sail to France For no better reason than that hesuddenly came upon a way to pay for it At the beginning of the play Englandschurch officials offer to underwrite an invasion as a bribe to keep Henry fromappropriating church lands Upon receiving the proposal he asks Englandsbishops several times to give him a clear justification for the invasion whichwill necessarily entail the deaths of thousands of men The bishops give himlongwinded answers that make no sense at all at the end of which he asksagain confused May I with right and conscience make this claim Moreincomprehensible replies ensue The scene ends without good reasons having everbeen offered after which he goes ahead and invades anyway             Threaten to loot pillage and rape the daughters of your competitorsif they dont give up the fight as soon as you enter the fieldand explainthat they have forced you to do so Consider Henrys speech before thetown of Harfleur whose crime has been to hold out against a siege                           What ist to me when you yourselves are causeIf your pure maidens fall into the handOf hot and forcing violationWhat rein can hold licentious wickednessWhen down the hill he holds his fierce career                         If a former friend has committed a crime however minor make sure hereceives the maximum punishment in order to make an example of him Justbefore the great battle with the French at Agincourt Henry V is told thatBardolph a member of his old gang has been caught stealing a small statue ofChrist from a local church For this act Bardolph is to be hanged Rather thanpardon the poor fool Henry has him killed in order to show the French that hisis an orderly army that means them no real harm             Take no prisoners But if you do kill them When Henry hears atAgincourt that the French have sent in reinforcements he orders his men tokill their French prisonersa terrifying act for men facing the prospect ofimprisonment themselves As one soldier remarks Tis expressly against thelaw of arms tis as arrant a piece of knavery mark you now as can beoffert Neither Shakespeare who alludes to the incident only in passing norhistory offers any justification for this gross violation of the laws of warWas there as it was later claimed some sudden movement on the part of Frenchcavalry which lead Henry to fear an attack from the rear It is possiblethough no such attack took place writes historian John Julius Norwich in hisforthcoming book Shakespeares Kings The Great Plays and the History ofEngland in the Middle Ages   Norwich who calls the commandthe darkest stain on the historical Henrys reputation says that so manyof Henrys men refused to obey his order that he was at last obligated todesignate  of his own archers specifically for the task             Marry a woman appropriate to your station and say anything you haveto to win her In wooing Katherine the French princess whose country andrelatives he has just laid waste to Henry having never met the girl callsher an angel and claims to be in love with her When reasonably enough sheobjects he subtly menaces her                           No it is not possible you should love the enemy ofFrance Kate but in loving me you should lovethe friend of France for I love France so well thatI will not part with a village of it I will have itall mine and Kate when France is mine and I amyours then yours is France and you are mine                        To sum up then What does Shakespeare really have to say to businessmen whothink that his kings make good role modelsrather than say troublinginteresting morally questionable dramatizations of the effects of powerLord what fools these mortals be
