The Baltimore SunWeak economy court challenge threaten legal servicesfundingAdvocates turning to state for financial assistanceAndrea F SiegelSaturday January  The main funding source for Marylands legal services to thepoor has fallen on hard times and advocates are preparing to seekunprecedented state financial help  even as they keep an eye on alegal challenge that threatens to cut off a main source of fundingfor such services nationwideThe Maryland Legal Services Corp  which supports organizations providing legal help to those with cases involvingdomestic abuse landlordtenant disputes and other issues  faces a million budget shortfall because of slack interest on theaccounts that help fund itThe states chief judge is seeking a  million subsidy toclose the gap in the organizations  million annual budget andadvocates are planning a strong push in the General AssemblyYou can bet we will be doing every kind of lobbying we can dofor our funding said Wilhelm H Joseph Jr executive director ofthe Maryland Legal Aid Bureau the largest provider of legal helpto the poor The bureau receives  million of its  millionbudget from the Maryland Legal Services Corp which wasestablished by the General Assembly in Chief Judge Robert M Bell said his budget request is intendedto maintain the same level of services that we have had in thelast several years in terms of access to justice for theneedyThe timing is awful advocates concede as the state legislatureweighs what to do about an expected  billion state budgetshortfallComplicating the picture is a case pending before the USSupreme Court from Washington state that challenges the mechanismevery state uses as a mainstay of legalservices fundingAt issue is an arrangement that skims interest from shorttermtrust accounts that lawyers hold on behalf of their clients andfunnels it to legalservices groupsBy law the interest must be too small to be worthwhile forbanks to process for individual account holdersIOLTA challengedUntil interest rates plummeted this mechanism known as IOLTAor Interest On Lawyer Trust Accounts pumped up to  million ayear into Maryland legal services and about  million into suchservices nationwideBut last month the high court heard a constitutional challengeclaiming that the government takes the interest without justcompensation to clients A ruling is expected by JuneEven if the funding mechanism is upheld legalservices groupswill be hardpressed to meet their needs because of low interestrates according to the American Bar AssociationIn the fiscal year that ended in June IOLTA revenue in Marylandwas  million  down from  million two years ago and million in the heyday of high interest rates That led to cuts thisyear of up to  percent to  legalservices groups despiteemergency infusions of cashUnder the bestcase scenario  if IOLTA is upheld  we areprojecting a  million shortfall said Robert J Rhudyexecutive director of the MLSC The critical need for legal aidhas gone up because of the recessionHe said that without more state help the MLSC will cut grantsby up to  percent next year That would force groups to drop someadvocacy work and thus serve fewer peopleAs it is advocates say the  Marylanders they reachprobably are no more than  percent of those in needThe  going to the Womens Law Center for example fundstwo days a week of a statewide hot line counseling  needywomen last year so many that callers say it can be hard to getthroughCallers include those who have been abandoned without access tofamily money those not receiving courtordered child support andthose who want to leave their husbands but are unsure about theirlegal rightsIn the event of a funding cut there is no way we would be ableto pick it up said L Tracy Brown executive director of thecenterJ Peter Sabonis Jr executive director of the Homeless PersonsRepresentation Project in Baltimore which took a  percent cutlast year will reduce outreach if more funds disappearThat means for us we wont have a presence out in front of awelfare office we wont be out there on the day laborers line at in the morning we wont have a lawyer at a soup kitchenSabonis saidShelly Norman  got her legal aid from Sabonis groupAfter a drug conviction kept her out of subsidized housing thegroup intervened and got her housing  along with a court hearingthat changed her conviction to a misdemeanor with probation

improvement groups and crimevictimsLobbying campaignTo help ensure that such services continue the Maryland StateBar Association and other advocates are lobbying legislators toexplain how legal services help constituents in every district Forthe first time and at the judiciarys request Rhudy has sentevery new legislator an orientation package about legal help forthe poorThough optimistic advocates know that getting  million fromthe state is an uphill fightEveryone else  is looking for more funding in a year whenthere is a  billion shortfall said House Speaker Michael EBusch an Anne Arundel County DemocratEverybody has taken a big hit said Senate President Thomas VMike Miller a Prince Georges County Democrat I do believe thelegislators will look askance at new issuesA spokesman for Govelect Robert L Ehrlich Jr said theincoming administration could make no funding promisesAdvocates are looking at other ways to generate moneyA letterwriting campaign asks every lawyer in Maryland todonate at least the dollar value of one billable hour  typicallya couple of hundred dollars  to the Legal Aid BureauCheck in lieu of workStarting next month lawyers must report to the courts how muchfree or lowfee legal work they do for the poor and charities witha goal of  hours a yearThough many lawyers provide such services they are also beingurged to write a check to a legalservices organization in lieu ofthe hoursAdvocates also might borrow ideas from other states Tennesseehas a surcharge on speeding tickets Ohio assesses an annual lawyerregistration fee and Texas uses dollars from its Crime VictimsCompensation Fund for such programsMaryland has a surcharge on court filing fees that goes to legalservices for the needy
