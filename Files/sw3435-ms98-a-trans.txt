                 push my number okay   okay so are you a a a golfer or are you a spectator   oh im a i play golf but i dont actually play golf   well im the same way i i go out there and hit the ball   yeah hack it all over the place its sickening isnt it   yeah um uh well in the Carolinas its its just you know weve got a bunch of golf courses around here   yeah weve got tons up here but i dont know how do you feel about your game i guess thats a good question   uh well i mean im not a serious golfer at all uh uh a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and i uh i dont have a i dont really even have a game i usually when i go out and play golf its usually like at a at one of these par threes that you know you   yeah   but um i like watching it on TV   yeah i like that too i dont know i try to play but God i a couple years ago i played two three times a week and got lousy i guess thats the best i ever got was lousy   uh   and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come and then i got worse again so   well i i i if i can i can hit a great deal like um uh they they my friends to get me they they say i hit worm burners because i i cant hit it up in the air so im pretty bad but i i i get great distance hitting it you know uh for it going across the ground   yeah   and if its going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because im but im getting better ive got where now i can hit it in in the air some of the time   umhum thats pretty good   yeah uh so im kind of a novice at it   um im that at worse i i play next year i actually i take it kind of seriously but ive been doing so bad next year i always say this every year but next year im starting over from scratch im going to go take lessons and everything im going to do it right and see if i can actually play this game or not   well that i i guess thats what i need to do is is get some kind of lessons or something because i my my tee off is not bad i mean im im good up to everything else putting and stuff like that its just that that initial tee   yeah what do you do when youre putting thats a good thing thats something i could learn actually thats when i do my worst i finally get to the green and i think im doing all all fine and then     just walking around the hollow and making sure theres not really you know checking the ground and and so forth you know see how its going to break or whatever   yeah can you really see it though what about the speed   yeah if you get if you get down on the ground you really can   can you tell how nah but can you tell how how fast youre going to hit it   um well if you know if its up on a slope that youve got to hit it not kill it but youve got to hit enough speed and the right angle that its its you know because when its going up a hill its going to break in a direction   yeah but you can feel that   yeah   i dont know i have i can get get it within like you know four or five feet or something but i dont have enough field now im TV watching they make you die at the hole every time oh it just dies and rolls in   yeah yeah   i dont know its hard for me   but i the the its its like i said once i get up on the green im fine but that that tee shot uh it you know when teeing off uh it ill go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it it takes me awhile to get to the hole but   once youre there youre all set though   im all set   we should play team golf then ill get us there and you put it in   that sounds good to me that its uh   i see oh the TV golfers they do that it takes them two to get there and two to get it in so its fifty percent and me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in   well it it it usually takes me about probably two to to or three to get it there and and then thats according to the hole and it just uh uh maybe one or two putts its according to where im at on the green   yeah thats good   but the friends i play with uh they play all the time and and theyre really good   Joe Pros   uh theyre not Joe Pros but they they golf in the high sixties low seventies so i guess theyre pretty good   thats pretty good for eighteen   yeah for eighteen   wow thats pretty good   yeah   im talking to the wrong guy your shitty golf is probably the best golf ive ever seen   no no no thats not my golf thats my friends mine mine im im usually in the eighties or nineties so im im not good     if when im in the nineties im feeling good im usually around a hundred thats my thing around a hundred you know i can hit a great drives and think im going to do all awesome on this hole but it aint going to happen   well i either teeing off i either slice it or i hook it ever single time and and i alternate   well its a good thing with me i slice it every single time thats good i aim
