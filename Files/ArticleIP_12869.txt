                                 Values Shmalues            The major premise of the Pieter de Hoochretrospective in Hartford Conn incredibly the first show ever to be devotedto this Dutch master is that de Hooch is the supreme painter of Dutchdomesticity Most of his art expresses a clear moral point of view writesPeter Sutton director of the Wadsworth Atheneum and the worlds leadingauthority on de Hooch above all of the values of patriarchal Dutch societyand their celebration of domestic virtue Sutton quotes liberally from theflood of domestic conduct books of the period including some rhymed coupletsfrom the wildly popular manual of Jacob Cats such as in my translation Aman obeys the law of the land a woman obeys the will of her man Picturessuch as A Woman Nursing an Infant With a Child circa  are inSuttons view compendiums of family values The little girl feeding the dog ispracticing for the nurturing rituals of motherhood The birdcage above thecontented mothers head may well symbolize Sutton suggests the sweet slaveryof marital love another proverb from Cats            Little is known of hislife early or late and his pictures  in the Wadsworth show carefullyculled from a total of perhaps  are the sole evidence of hispreoccupations Born in  in Rotterdam de Hooch apprenticed himself to aHaarlem landscapist called Nicolaes Berchem before making his way to Delftaround  There he married and had several children before changing his baseof operations to the burgeoning city of Amsterdam where he died in             De Hoochs paintings can be easily divided in subject andstyle among his three geographical locales as his own life ascended fromworking class to middle class to high bourgeois In Haarlem he painted shadowylowlife scenes of soldiers and barmaids carousing in vaguely rendered brothelsand dives In Delft his art snapped suddenly into focus with a few figuresdeployed in sunlit interiors or courtyards their architectural surroundingsmeticulously evoked with dazzling tricks of perspective In Amsterdam hispalette darkened marble floors replaced earthenware tiles satin supplantedhomespun and a dreamit cannot have been more than that for de Hoochofluxury reigned            The short stay in Delftresulted in de Hoochs greatest paintings and these dominate the Hartfordshow It was in Delft that de Hooch mastered the expressive balance ofarchitectural setting and human character as in his ambitious A Family ina Courtyard circa  Visible through the arched entrance of theHartford installation the picture displays many of de Hoochs signaturedetails the ubiquitous dogs the bewilderingly complex perspective and aboveall the recession down a corridor often with a door ajar in the distance InSwanns Way  Marcel Proust compared the little phrase of the composerVinteuil the national anthem of Swanns love for Odette to one of thoseinteriors by Pieter de Hooch which are deepened by the narrow frame of ahalfopened door in the far distance of a different color velvety with theradiance of some intervening light            Velvety radiance actually sounds more like Jan VermeerSwanns obsession than de Hooch and the precise relationship between the twopainters still elude scholars No document links them but shared motifs awoman weighing gold a trompe loeil curtain drawn just so in theirpaintingsespecially from a magic moment around suggest an intimacy akinto such famous partnerships as Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin or PabloPicasso and Georges Braque Current critical consensus is that de Hooch was theinnovator Vermeer the perfecter while current taste as evidenced by theoverwhelming attendance at the Vermeer show in Washington three years agoprefers Vermeer De Hooch cannot match the sheer glamour of Vermeer themeditative inwardness of Vermeers women the pearly mystery of their moods asthey mull over love letters or listen to music            If we compare the twopainters on Vermeers termsmystery glamour serenity simplicity ofdesignde Hooch is the inevitable loser If we accept the view of de Hoochadvanced by the Hartford show and catalog as a propagandist for Dutch familyvalues its hard to explain the peculiar hold that his paintings have orought to have on us I think the Hartford show overemphasizes de Hoochspraise of domesticityclean tiles and contented motherswhile underplayinghis alienation            Heres another way to look at de Hoochs pictures WhereVermeer is serene and transcendent de Hooch is edgy and ill at ease De Hoochin marked contrast to Vermeer is a painter of this world with all its socialprecariousness and unavoidable melancholy Vermeers single shaft of luminosityfrom window or door evokes an otherworldly reality De Hooch deploys severalsources of light casting shadows every which way His windows and doors relievethe claustrophobia of his interiors but they imply no other realm Theenigmatic figure with his back turned to us that we see down so many of deHoochs recessions may suggest an escape route but theres no promise thatwhere hes headed is any different from here            Once were tuned to thisunsettling frequency in de Hoochs work we notice how many hints ofconfinement and escape there are in his work All those birdcages may implysomething less comforting than loves sweet slavery The dogs prowlingaround standins perhaps for the observant artist give an unruliness tofamily gatherings Affectionately painted servants in de Hoochs paintingssuch as the housemaid in Woman and Child in an Interior circa handing a mug of beer to an elegantly clad little boy suggest an affinity withthe lower orders of society During his Amsterdam period de Hooch includesblack servants and entertainers in his festive gatheringsanother indicationof his sympathy for people on the margins of society            De Hooch is at his most appealing when he is poking fun atthe Dutch mania for cleanliness In the wonderful A Woman Drinking with TwoMen and a Serving Woman circa  carousers from his drab Rotterdampictures have entered the finely nuanced space of his Delft interiors Aslimwaisted woman closely resembling the figure down the corridor in ACourtyard in Delft  raises her cup to two men one of whom pretends to playa fiddle with two pipes Another lovingly rendered serving woman stands by themantle above which hangs a painting of the traditional theme of the educationof the Virgin Not only does de Hooch play with two wayssecular andsacredof educating virgins but he deliberately desecrates with bits of asmashed pipe and rolling paper that immaculate expanse of floor            After his move to Amsterdam de Hooch painted evermore luxurious interiors probably as bait for wealthy patrons He set severalpictures in the palatial Amsterdam Town Hall completed in  and regarded asthe eighth wonder of the world These picturesincluding one depicting a partyheld incongruously in one of the Town Hall chambershave a dreamlike auraDe Hoochs Amsterdam addresses were in the poor outskirts of the city outsidethe town gates and the Town Hall may have been the only swanky interior he hadaccess to At a time when Holland was experiencing a surfeit ofprosperitywhat Simon Schama calls its embarrassment of richesde Hooch wasapparently left out in the cold The last  years of his life are a blank Allwe know is that Pieter de Hooch one of the masters of Dutch painting wasburied in the cemetery in Amsterdam his body having been carried directly fromthe dolhuys  the house for the insane
