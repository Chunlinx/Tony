                    Introduction        A number of studies have evaluated possible associations        between a polymorphism in the cytochrome Pc          CYP  gene and breast cancer risk                           Cytochrome        Pc functions at key branch points in human        steroidogenesis catalyzing the ovarian and adrenal        biosynthesis pathways for androstenedione the immediate        precursor of testosterone     Three polymorphisms have        been described in this gene a C  T transition at        nucleotide  in intron      a G  A transition at        nucleotide  in the untranslated region promoter            and a thymidine substitution for cytosine at nucleotide         in the untranslated region promoter that creates a         Msp AI recognition site            The         Msp AI polymorphism gives rise to        three genotypes AA AA and AA Although it was        hypothesized that the polymorphism A allele could result        in an additional Sp binding site with enhanced promoter        activity and an increased rate of transcription            this was not found in experimental studies             Nonetheless two studies found that both premenopausal and        postmenopausal women with the variant A allele had higher        levels of circulating estrogens than those with common        alleles indicating that the polymorphism may be in linkage        disequilibrium with another functional polymorphism or that        it may affect hormone levels through some other mechanism                    Effects of the variant         CYP genotype on risk have been        investigated in a number of studies with some        corroborative results and some conflicting results In a        multiethnic cohort while breast cancer risk was not        significantly increased for women with the A allele            the A allele did confer more than a twofold increase in        risk among those with advanced disease Furthermore late        age at menarche was protective only among women who were        homozygous for the A allele The findings regarding age at        menarche were confirmed in three other studies             and in a recent metaanalysis involving  cases and         controls     These studies did not find that the         CYP genotype was associated with        risk of breast cancer even when stratifying by stage of        disease              Feigelson         et al     recently reported that        women with A alleles were less likely than those with A        alleles to use hormone replacement therapy presumably        because of fewer menopausal symptoms due to higher        circulating estrogens It is clear that hormonal milieu        differs for premenopausal women and postmenopausal women        and there is evidence that risk factors for disease        diagnosed among the two groups of women may also differ        particularly those related to hormonal factors            The majority of previous studies did not evaluate        associations separately by menopausal status particularly        for effect modification by         CYP on relationships between breast        cancer and other risk factors In the present study we        evaluated separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal        women whether the         CYP polymorphism was independently        related to breast cancer risk or could possibly act through        modification of other breast cancer risk factors                    Materials and methods                  Population          These research data were collected in an earlier          casecontrol study  of  premenopausal and           postmenopausal Caucasian women in western New York          The detailed methods have been reported elsewhere                         The protocol for the present study was reviewed by the          Institutional Review Board of the State University of New          York at Buffalo and by all of the participating          hospitals Informed consent was received from all          participants for the interview and for the medical record          review Women diagnosed with incident primary          histologically confirmed breast cancer were identified at          all major hospitals in Erie and Niagara counties They          were frequency matched by age and county of residence          with controls randomly selected from the New York State          Motor Vehicle lists   years and the Health Care          Finance Administration rolls   years Interview          data included medical reproductive dietary and          lifestyle histories The majority of women were born in          the United States and all women reported country of          birth of their parents to be in Western Europe or to a          lesser degree in Eastern Europe          Women were considered postmenopausal if they were          younger than age  years and had natural menopause had          bilateral oophorectomy or had irradiation to the ovaries          Women aged  years and older were considered          postmenopausal if they had ceased menstruation At the          end of the interview women were asked to provide a blood          specimen  of premenopausal women and  of          postmenopausal women agreed Among premenopausal women          there were no significant differences in socioeconomic          hormonal reproductive or dietary factors between those          who gave blood and those who refused Among          postmenopausal women controls who gave a blood specimen          had a greater mean number of pregnancies  versus                     P   than those who          declined There were no other significant differences          between the groups                          Laboratory analysis          DNA was purified by standard phenolchloroform          extraction followed by ethanol precipitation from frozen          blood clots PCR conditions were based on those of Carey           et al               Briefly genomic DNA  ng was amplified using           pmol primers CAT TCG CAC TCT GGA GTC and AGG          CTC TTG GGG TAC TTG in GeneAmp PCR buffer  mM KCl           mM

Piscataway NJ USA in a  l reaction volume The PCR          reaction had an initial melting temperature of C           min followed by  cycles of melting C  min          annealing C  min and extension C  min An          extension period of  min at C followed the final          cycle The resulting product  bp was subjected to           Msp AI digest New England Biolabs          Beverly MA USA according to the manufacturers          directions Gel electrophoresis  agarose Gibco BRL          Gaithersburg MD USA of the resulting fragments          revealed either the A homozygote  bp the A          homozygote  and  bp or the AA heterozygote            and  bp          Results of genotyping for the study were read from the          gel by two independent investigators and at least  of          the samples were repeated for quality control The assay          was validated by confirming polymorphic Mendelian          inheritance patterns in seven human family cell lines            n   each encompassing three          generations data not shown NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant          Cell Repository Coriell Institute Camden NJ USA                          Statistical analysis          Tests for HardyWeinberg equilibrium among controls          were conducted using observed genotype frequencies and a           test with one degree of freedom To evaluate the role          of           CYP on breast cancer risk through          mediating mechanisms we first assessed differences in          age at menarche age at first fullterm pregnancy          difficulty in becoming pregnant and use of hormone          replacement therapy and oral contraceptives among          controls according to the           CYP genotype          Data on hormone replacement use were only available          for women who were postmenopausal and few women beyond          menopause had a history of oral contraceptive use so          only premenopausal women were included for those          analyses Odds ratios and  confidence intervals were          calculated using unconditional logistic regression to          evaluate associations between           CYP genotypes and breast cancer          risk separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal          women The odds ratios were adjusted for age education          age at menarche age at first pregnancy reported family          history of breast cancer body mass index history of          benign breast disease and age at menopause for          postmenopausal women          Associations between hormonalreproductive factors and          breast cancer were further calculated within genotype          strata We performed tests for interaction by computing          the crossproduct of the independent variables            CYP and reproductive factors          whose effects on risk varied by genotype and including          it in a regression model with its components entered          separately                            Results        Data in the present study were available for         premenopausal and  postmenopausal women The mean age        among premenopausal women was  years and the average age        of postmenopausal women was  years We evaluated        information on the participants country of origin and        their parents country of origin In this fairly        homogeneous population all of the women were of European        or Eastern European decent A  test of observed versus        expected genotype frequencies for         CYP among premenopausal women        suggested a slight deviation from HardyWeinberg        equilibrium However this difference was not statistically        significant          P   The genotype frequencies        for postmenopausal women followed HardyWeinberg        equilibrium          P          Hormonally related factors appeared to vary by         CYP genotype Table  Among both        premenopausal and postmenopausal women those with at least        one A allele were more likely than women with the AA        genotype to experience early menarche although differences        were not statistically significant There were also slight        differences in age at menopause with a somewhat later        average age at menopause for women with either the AA or        AA genotypes Interestingly postmenopausal women with        at least one A allele were also less likely to experience        difficulty in becoming pregnant and correspondingly        tended to have children at an earlier age Contrary to        findings by Feigelson         et al      the         CYP genotype did not influence the        use of hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives        in the present data        Neither homozygosity nor heterozygosity for the A        variant was associated with increased breast cancer risk        Table  In fact there appeared to be inverse        associations between the A allele and risk particularly        among postmenopausal women in both unadjusted models and        those models adjusted for breast cancer risk factors        Because there were few differences in relationships for        those with AA and AA genotypes these categories were        collapsed and the associations evaluated between genotype        and other breast cancer risk factors        Associations between breast cancer and hormonal risk        factors by         CYP genotype are presented in Table         For premenopausal women late age at menarche was        significantly protective only among women with AA        alleles odds ratio    confidence interval          This effect was not seen among postmenopausal        women Differences in risk were also noted for other        factors Late age at first fullterm pregnancy        significantly increased risk among premenopausal women only        for those with the AA genotype Risk was also elevated        among these allele carriers if they reported use of oral        contraceptives and difficulty becoming pregnant For        postmenopausal women it was women with A alleles who were        most at risk of breast cancer with late age at first        fullterm pregnancy and with difficulty becoming pregnant        While effects of age at menarche age at first fullterm        pregnancy and oral contraceptive use were only        significantly notable among premenopausal women with A        alleles interactions were not statistically significant        data not shown                    Discussion        We found in the present study that while the         CYP Msp AI genetic polymorphism did        not increase breast cancer risk it appears to modify the        associations between hormonal and reproductive factors and        breast cancer Interestingly women with A alleles those        associated with higher estrogen levels in both        premenopausal and postmenopausal women were more likely to        share characteristics associated with greater fertility        They were more likely to have an earlier age at menarche        less difficulty becoming pregnant an earlier age at first        fullterm pregnancy and later age at menopause        In accordance with previous studies               later age at menarche was protective against breast cancer        only among women homozygous for the A allele although we        noted this association only in premenopausal women        Furthermore late age at first fullterm pregnancy and oral        contraceptive use increased risk only among premenopausal        women homozygous for A alleles Relationships were not as        notable among postmenopausal women although late age at        first birth increased risk only among women with A        alleles These apparent discrepancies by menopausal status        although they may be due to chance could reflect        differences in the nature of premenopausal and        postmenopausal breast cancer etiology particularly in        relation to steroid hormones        The initial report of increased risk of breast cancer        and modification of other risk factors by variability in         CYP was promising for breast cancer        research     Steroid hormones clearly play a large role        in breast cancer etiology and identification of risk        associated with genetic differences in their biosynthesis        and metabolism could greatly elucidate mechanistic pathways        and make inroads towards prevention for public health        However this report was followed by a number of studies        that did not corroborate those early results As more        studies have been conducted relationships between the         CYP genotype and breast cancer risk        have become clearer particularly through the repeated        findings of modification of risk through other reproductive        factors Because two studies have noted higher estrogen        levels among women with A alleles      it is        possible that women with these genotypes have more lifetime        exposure to circulating steroid hormones that is not        abrogated by later age at menarche or by earlier age at        first fullterm pregnancy Oral contraceptive use may        similarly only impact risk in an environment of lower        estrogens        Experimental studies     have shown that the         CYP polymorphism in the flanking        region of the gene does not influence binding to Sp as        previously conjectured      Nonetheless studies in        both premenopausal women and postmenopausal women have        found that those with A alleles have higher circulating        levels of steroid hormones Thus while the mechanism        whereby the         CYP polymorphism increases serum        hormones levels has not been identified it is probable        that there are either effects that have not yet been        elucidated or that the site is in linkage disequilibrium        with another polymorphism that alters the function of the         CYP enzyme        Results from this study may be impacted by a number of        factors foremost of which may be small sample size While        we had data on  women stratification by menopausal        status and additional stratification by         CYP genotype to evaluate        differential effects of breast cancer risk factors resulted        in small data points in some cells and therefore results        are interpreted cautiously Nonetheless results support        findings from a number of studies and are consistent with        findings from the two largest studies to date those from        the Nurses Health Study    and the study of breast        cancer in Finland     In addition our findings are in        accordance with those of a metaanalysis of  casecontrol        studies            Furthermore genotype frequencies among premenopausal        women deviated slightly from HardyWeinberg equilibrium        although these differences were not statistically        significant Previous studies have shown a range of        genotype distributions In a recent metaanalysis by Ye and        Parry     the AA genotype prevalence ranged from         to  among Caucasian women in  different studies        This variability in estimates could be due in part to        small sample sizes In the present study we found that         of premenopausal controls and  of postmenopausal        controls had the AA genotype which falls well within        this range However the prevalence of heterozygotes was        higher in our population than in other studies It is        unlikely that this could be attributed to population        stratification since western New York is a fairly        homogeneous area and women were all of European descent        and for the most part at least secondgeneration or        thirdgeneration Americans Another possible explanation        for the higher proportion of heterozygotes could be        genotyping errors although two independent investigators        read the gels and at least  of the samples were repeated        for quality control Furthermore assays were validated by        confirmation of polymorphic Mendelian inheritance patterns        in seven human family cell lines          n   each encompassing three        generations        In summary our findings support those of several other        studies that variant         CYP alleles modify breast cancer        risk associated with several hormonal and reproductive        factors These collective findings may point the way toward        further investigations into the role of metabolic        variability in steroidogenesis and metabolism in relation        to breast cancer risk and target women who may be most at        risk for the disease                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        bp  base pairs PCR
