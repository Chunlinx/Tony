                                 Mirror Mirror on the Web            Atlong last theres a cure for the intractable problem of the undecided voterThanks to a new site called the American Presidential Candidate Selector  the Web canactually tell you who you should vote for Simply type in your opinions on arange of issues and the site tells you which candidate agrees with youmost            TheCandidate Selector is one of several Web tools offered by SelectSmartcom  a companythat produces Web sites to help with all sorts of complicated decisions itsslogan is Before You Decide In addition to the Presidential CandidateSelector the company offers a Lawn Grass Selector a Pet Selector a HairProducts Selector and a Contraception Selector Gary Bauer will be matchedwith your prolife creationist views the same way LeaveIn Conditioning Spraywill be recommended for your dry frizzy hair            Hereshow the Candidate Selector works The site asks your positions on  issuesfrom abortion to defense spending to free trade and also asks you to choosewhether you feel strongly or somewhat strongly about each of those standsYou can also answer no preference to any of the questions When youre donethe program spits out a list of all the presidential candidates ranked andscored in order of how closely their platforms match your views            Thetool claims moderate accuracy According to a poll on the site  percent ofusers found that the candidate for whom they intend to vote appeared at the topof their list Another  percent found their top candidate in second placeThe poll doesnt ask the far more interesting question of how many users mightchange their votes because of the SelectSmartcom results            Iasked a few colleagues with disparate political views to testdrive theSelector They ended up with funhousemirror versions of their actualpreferencesaccurate in some places comically distorted in others Theselector placed Bill Bradley and Al Gore first and second respectively on Timothy Noahs listwrong order he says but not bad Timothys list got lessaccurate as it continued It placed Socialist David McReynolds the Natural LawPartys John Hagelin and Warren Beatty who is not even a candidate beforeTimothys reallife third choice John McCain He observes that the onlyaccurate score is for Alan Keyes who I would indeed rank dead lastMeanwhile the site told Tucker Carlson who writes for the conservativeWeekly Standard  to vote for Orrin Hatchthe candidate for whom I havethe most contempt Tucker sayswhile awarding John McCain ninth place behindHatch George W Bush Harry Browne Alan Keyes Steve Forbes Gary BauerHoward Phillips and Pat Buchanan Do they have a drunk guy doing therankings Tucker asks            CurtAnderson the sites designer sounded sober on the phone but he has certainlycrafted some sloppy questions One asks users about whether they advocateteaching evolution or creationism in schools This is not exactly an issue forthe next president but in any case giving it the same weight as such topicsas health care or taxes seems preposterous Even when Anderson does hit onmajor issuescrime prevention environmental protection foreign policyhisphrasing is without nuance and sometimes without sense For example theSelector asks Would you prefer your candidate promise to protect or reformor even abolish Social Security This question is impossible to answer fromthe choices provided The distinction between protecting and reforming SocialSecurity is anything but clear Some candidates such as Steve Forbes suggestthat the best way to protect Social Security is to reform it  while eventhose candidates who advocate preserving the current systemsuch as Bush andGoreadvocate some significant changes  Reform could mean any number ofthings from minor tweaks the addition of individual savings accounts to moreradical fixes replacing Social Security taxes with privately managedindividual accounts Even if the site asked the question more preciselysayby asking users if they prefer governmentmanaged savings or privatesavingsit would reduce an issue of agonizing actuarial detail to a flippantoneliner            Theoptions for answers are just as clumsy as the questions The somewhat buttonis ambiguousif I tell the Selector that I am somewhat prochoice I mightbe saying that I want a candidate who is generally prochoice but who opposespartialbirth abortions Or I might simply be expressing that abortion is aless urgent issue for me than others Indeed the site doesnt allow you todesignate which issues are most important to you You may care about guncontrol far more than you do about anything else but unless you leave theother  questions blank your candidate list wont reflect yourpriorities            Thebiggest problem with the Presidential Selector though is that it reflects anutterly unrealistic sense of how people choose candidates It undermines itselfwith its own idealism Anderson boasts that his Candidate Selector screens outsuperficial factors such as advertising hype and image and allows voters tobase their choices solely on the issues But few people make up their minds onthe basis of positions alone The site does not try to measure intangibles likeintegrity experience passion and electability that doand shouldmatter tovoters            Rightnow the site is most helpful to the minor candidates whom it gives the sameweight as the major players It helps them find votersOrrin Hatchs Web sitenow links to the Candidate Selector and Libertarian Harry Browne says that anumber of people who found themselves matched to him have become followers            If the questions andanswers were formulated more precisely the site could make for a fascinatingexercise It would allow you to see how closely you line up with the candidatefor whom you intend to vote and thereby tell you whether your attraction isbased on a congruence of views or a more ephemeral sense of goodwill Thetechnology might usefully be applied in local races in which its hard to sortout the platform of every potential state senator judge school boardofficial and city council member But for now the Candidate Selector is nomore than a terrific party gamethe electionyear equivalent of having yourpalm read
