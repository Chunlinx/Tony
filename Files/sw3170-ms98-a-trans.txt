        basically um my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases we really dont get into small little purchases if were going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card but       other than that its not something that we use a lot of um we may have only two or three versus um i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or uh up to a dozen credit cards but um ours are just major credit cards that we have and uh use uh use only when when we feel its necessary to make a big purchase   yeah is that like Visa and and MasterCard   yeah yeah   do you have department store credit cards too or   uh yeah one Sears   uhhuh   Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do um   appliances   appliances and things like that and theyre real good with their appliance and stuff like that so   yeah   but uh we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate if youve got the cash to pay for something its better to do it that way than versus credit cards unless its a small enough sum that you can do it within a two three month period but   yeah   if its uh any large purchases um youve got to kind of think about um how much youre going to put down as far as uh payments on it so that youre not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off so   right my my husband and i do basically the same thing but we we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise   uhhuh   we still pay it off every month if it kills us  but we do it mainly for you know the cash flow what is that   yeah yeah yeah   oh float thats the word float and i often will keep track track of what ive charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already   uhhuh sure sure uhhuh sure so you know   and sometimes just and keep a list and make sure i   sure   i dont go over a certain limit especially around birthdays you know   yeah exactly exactly yeah   oh if we go out to a restaurant oh just to float it or i dont know   or if its a business transaction a lot of times thats important too to keep a better receipt of it so yeah   yeah yes my husband has a uh or anytime like a plane ticket or you know   umhum   even if we have the im sure wed have the cash before we got it but   umhum   the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that   sure oh sure for the month or whatever   that thirty days  or whatever   yeah exactly   we have a new one from ATT and we have you know havent used that one too much  be interesting thats nice  because you can use it for a calling card also   so uhhuh yeah exactly sure   its a MasterCard too so its kind of fun uh  but you get a lot of junk mail about them   sure yeah oh yeah and you always get these preapproved uh credit card things coming through uh your credit is great so lets send you another credit card or its preapproved for   yeah youre such a a wonderful person   such such to entice you to get more credit cards   well give you five thousand dollars up front   yeah and so you know we always laugh about that because its quite a bit i mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff so   right do you have uh uh an annual fee on yours or  do you get yours through a bank or   uh ours is through a bank yeah we had it a long time ago through a banking system so yeah just a but   yeah yeah i i cant see paying an annual fee for it i mean i almost   oh youre already paying them uh if youre if you dont pay it off within that month interest anyway so yeah thats exactly it   yeah   so  okay   well it sounds like im being paged otherwise so that   okay all right thanks a lot by now   good talking to you thanks byebye
