          so how do you keep up with the news   most of it is TV   um do you read the newspaper   yes i do we get a daily and then i get uh the Wall Street Journal also   um what daily   its the uh Charlotte Observer   Charlotte Observer um is that there in your city   yes right   uhhuh  so uh   the Wall Street Journal gives financial news and other information im interested in   so uh do you think you get anything from your local newspaper   yes but its usually after the fact uh as far as the major topics because most of the other has been on TV dont you agree   um yeah i dont im not exactly sure how good the national news is though how accurate exactly   yeah oh i think uh during the Middle East Crisis there was a problem in terms of too quick to try to get a scoop and not checking facts out and i think thats probably a a good relevant uh uh fear of all of it yeah i didnt see a movie a long time ago but it was about the news team that um   fear   tried to influence the world and i i have a feeling that theyre much more into themselves sometimes than they are into what the world um is ready to hear they create news   yeah it seems like theyre not really trying to report the news they are trying to report how the news affects them   yeah yeah i think so too   or where theyre at with the news or something along those lines uh   radio is sort of a catch up in fact i was um listening to the radio the other day and that they were reporting on the condition of an of an accident victim and i had already seen on the news about an hour before that that accident victim had died but the radio news report was that he was still in intensive care so its one of those um it the most immediate is TV The others are catch up and fill in   yeah a little bit of color or something for the lack of total information that was given on the TV lack they give immediate for the lack of total   uhhuh how do you feel the newspapers there in Colorado Springs treats local interest news   well rather biasedly i think i believe huh very pro city   uhhuh   uh for the city fathers but uh it seems almost as though they dont        care about how the national news affects the local area   uhhuh uh i think about other topics too i id like to go to a city and sort of look at the front page and find out what is going on in that city but its always the national information that you have to flip through to find out anything special about the city and i think thats uh   yeah and then they give give you just the local O bits and thats it   uhhuh uhhuh   and and well hell you dont know know those people that died or or what from   no the older you get the more you know though   well what i mean is do you if your in a strange city you certainly dont know them   oh right right yeah thats true what type of work are you in   i work for Texas Instruments   okay uh that uh is a news worthy company in itself so youre you would be interested in any news related to it yeah   uh yes and yourself   oh im im consulting right now im in between jobs so it makes uh it makes a difference im im interested in many more industries than i used to be just in terms of looking around so it   yeah i understand   ive been in the oil and gas business and then higher education and um done a few other things including international uh accounting so   huh thats interesting ive always considered myself uh how is this best put the the Charles Bollfield trash   oh okay  uh uh   grew up in West Texas thank you   yeah yeah i understand that i was in Oklahoma so i i know the area very well   yeah yeah   yeah   uh um so do you think our local do you think our national news tells us anything important   oh yes theyll theyll tell you a lot thats important but the trouble is the value do you watch Sixty Minutes and some of those other   um yeah i i i watch Sixty Minutes   i i wonder sometimes where they get those topics you know some of the topics are very very good and others are like uh who who who dreamed this subject up you know   almost religiously well and   and far as affecting a national audience i wonder sometimes   and more importantly than that i wonder how the other side of the story is   uhhuh yeah   and of course theyre not going to tell the other side of the story and theyre not going to tell it accurately   no but i do enjoy we are here temporarily i enjoyed having CNN so that i could tune in the news any time i wanted to and not wait for network broadcasting   uh we dont we dont have cable   okay its its a good addition because i think theyre they have a lot of news obviously all the time and theres not the pressure then   yeah weve watched little bits here and there during the Gulf Crisis and we   uhhuh yeah the   i didnt exactly i wasnt exactly sure how accurate it was either   oh i think it it too is under pressure   and it seemed as though during the Gulf Crisis it might have been under pressure from the incorrect side   uhhuh oh yes it was there are games played   i im not sure how to phrase that uh delicately   psychological warfare is a big factor all the way around um its been its been a big factor for many many years but this is the first uh first time we have seen it so quickly and so close up   yeah it is   it   i i didnt feel comfy you know i you know you always hear about the warm fuzzy feeling   uhhuh   i kept watching that be it CNN in a bar or or or or local news at home or federal news at home or or see uh   uhhuh   we dont subscribe to our Colorado Springs paper we subscribe to the Denver paper   Denver paper okay   and uh but on occasion more than occasionally well buy the local paper   uhhuh uhhuh   and that warm fuzzy that were talking about i never could get that warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomach about are these people really telling me the truth or more importantly all the truth   yeah i think all the truth is is the big issue they obviously had to be telling a lot of truth because they were there reporting firsthand but in terms of   well id suspect that to be true but you couldnt prove it to me   yeah yeah   and and most importantly i couldnt believe any of those people they didnt seem believable   did you just switch back and forth between programs   oh all four um well we have the independent here and weve got the three majors and PBS and we watched all four of those and on more than occasionally i went to a bar that had CNN running around the clock   uhhuh   and still i got this feeling as though from these six or eight news sources i had that something was missing   uh i think they they withhold when its advantageous both sides both sides and i think when Norman announced afterwards on the Barbara Walters Show   and oh Storming Norman   yes that um he knew you know what to expect out of Saddam Saddam Hussein that he was playing games you know and and they both were i think thats all part of warfare is to play games   oh of course and youve got to expect that   yeah   but i had the feeling that no matter who i listened to it wasnt that they werent telling me the truth i felt that someone was lying to me and theres nothing there still at this state that i can put my finger on and say oh heres where they lied to me   yeah   just a feeling   yeah well lets hope we dont have to go through that again     yes wouldnt it be wonderful if there were no more wars   oh that would be nice i hope we never never get to but im afraid um human nature is such that somewhere therell be a fanatic that will start something   and more importantly wouldnt it be nice in this land of the free and home of the brave if there were never again be any misinformation   oh yes oh yes
