                                 Does the Net Get Politics Ask Jeeves            Journalists who write for the Internet frequently ask Does politician X getthe Net            Theyfind their answers by looking at candidate Web sites testing their familiaritywith email and taking their temperature on Net issues such as ecommercetaxation or censorship            At NetElection though we have an additional question Does the Net getpolitics            As NetElection has documented there are a large and growing number of Web sitesdedicated to American politics some of which are lively and informative Butlets say you come to the Internet without knowing precisely where you want togothe position we assume of the average person How hard is it to findsolid political sites            If youwant general news about the  presidential race the answer is The Internetexcels Go to the Yahoo homepage  for example and one of the main  categories is GovernmentClick on the word Elections under that and youre two clicks away from apage that contains a slew of info including breaking news links to all themajor candidates sites CSPANs site and coverage from Newsweek andthe Washington Post             Curiously not all the portals we examined make it this easy At theDisneyowned Gocom for example no words such as government politics or elections appear on thefront page And even if you click on the ABCNewscom link it still doesnt compare to Yahoosonestopshopping page Thats also true for Excite and Lycos            But asyou delve more deeply into the issues the major portals quickly get muddy Sayyou want information on Bill Bradleys proposed overhaul of the healthcaresystem Will it harm minorities disproportionately because it eliminatesMedicaid as Al Gore has charged If you enter the words Bill Bradley andhealth care into Yahoo the engine will actually serve up some relevant sitesincluding Bradleys official campaign site and a homemade Bradley on the issuessite  On Lycos you get nothing so informative            Andheaven forbid you make an error If like us you initially forget to enterBradleys first name the first site that comes up on Yahoo is for a companythat provides training consultation and treatment services for compulsivegambling and related addictions in Bradley Beach NJ            Itsthe sort of non sequitur experience thats all too familiar to Web users Weresupposed to think Well these are just dumb machines after all They cantreally judge linguistic niceties like context Thats sort of true but notentirely Most search engines dont actually search the Net every time a userenters words Rather they sift through a collection of Web pages that havebeen examined and approved for use by the individual companys databaseGetting a site approved by a big search engine can take up to six weeks Notsurprisingly the premium real estate on the page that shows you the searchresults often goes to those who are willing to pay for it            Another way of saying this is that much of the Web is not really wired to thinkthe way most political people thinkwhich may be a good thing There areuseful aggregations of political sites available at places like Aboutcom  where you can getguidance on every issue from animal rights to womens liberation And therehave been some attempts to build political portals such as PoliticsOnlinecom But while such sites do a good job of making recent articles and broadbasedresources available theyve yet to combine the Nets strongestattributessearchability and multiple information sourceswith politicalsophistication Moreover typical viewers arent apt to stumble upon thesesites Rather they would need to know the specific Web addresses already            Sowhile we await the arrival of a truly intelligent political Web agent we arestuck with Ask Jeeves which Net insiders consider something of a joke Ask Jeeves isnt perfect infact it often exhibits a grasp of reality that falls somewhere between adatabase and the Magic Ball            Andyet to our surprise for certain kinds of political searches Ask Jeeves faredrather well For example we asked Jeeves Where can I find information aboutBill Bradley and Medicaid The site immediately returned Bradleys officialsite a site for news about the  presidential race information aboutMedicaid and books about Bradley Not bad at all            Ofcourse there are limits We asked Jeeves Why did Al Gore pay Naomi Wolf somuch money for advice which presumably he couldve gotten for free Two ofthe suggested counterquestions were How much does it cost to use AmericaOnline as an Internet Service Provider and What should I know aboutrestaurant wine pricing            To be fair to Jeevesthough were not sure anyone has a good answer to that question
