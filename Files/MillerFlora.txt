The first one I ever saw had a bird braid with a part of the A model                     Model T                     No there was the A model         A And my uncle had one         They made a funny sound click click click click         Um                  There was a lets see         Five of us then my brother lived with us         We lived in this little tworoom house         Five people                     Five people in two rooms                     Umhuh                     Did you have wire electricity                     Yes                     Oh well                              They had a fireplace in that little house         It looked more like a little dollhouse then a you know like a little playhouse or something                  It had two porches on it                  And um we had rabbits         Pet rabbits and I had a pet chicken         And I taught a pet and asked her where her eggs were         And she would take me to them         My dad sold them to the grocer and I wouldnt ever eat another chicken that came from the grocery store         I was afraid Id be eating my pet                     I dont                     Thats right                  I was afraid I would be eating my pet         And so I never ate any more chicken from that grocery store         I remember down in the woods         I had this like a         Partner         Stepping on them flowers         And climb them trees         The taller the better         Guess I was a tomboy         Tammy was too                           Its a small thing but Daddy was an alcoholic         And sometime good times and sometimes not so good times                  Its pretty good up and until he was a truck driver         And went along on them long hauls sometimes         Went up to New York and everything         And get snow bound         Got gas in the truck         Driving a truck to him was like a habit or something you know         Hed hear the sound of a truck and tell you what it was         Thats a white         Thats a diesel and then he couldnt drive it anymore                  He became a plumbers helper you know and it killed him         He had about a fifth grade education         Long pause                     Hows that                     I remember we were coming up to Charlotte to visit         They still had um the way they delivered milk was in a         with a horse         The thing they pulled         I can remember waking up to the sound of the horse Clip clop clip clop         And I dont know it sort of made you feel secure         And thats the way they brought around ice too         They didnt have any refrigerators then         Maybe some people did but most people didnt                  And believe it or not that was in the s s                     Thats during World War II         You probably dont remember that do you                     Umhuh         No         I know I was living then but dont know         I remember some little things         They were playing war games near our house in Wadesboro and they got them guys got Mama to bake them a cake         Is that twenty minutes of recording                           Well I just told you that Daddy was an alcoholic         So when I was a teenager         I was so embarrassed you know my friends would come by         Its a small town         So everybody knows that hes one of the town drunks I mean there were quite a few of them         And I told Mama that it was darn right embarrassing hed get drunk you know like in the summer time and then hed get as far the yard and pass out         I told Mama it was embarrassing for my friends to come by there ride by there there he was laying in the yard passed out         So the next time he started to lay down in the yard Mama told him she said Clayton if I were you would not lay down in the yard and go to sleep         He mumbled something or other and laid down in the yard and went to sleep         She took him by his feet and we had steps to go up on the porch         And pulled him up his head going Bump bump bump all the way up them steps                     Its bad when you dont even feel it                              Oh he was saying oh oh oh         He felt it                              He was just to drunk to do anything about it         Wasnt he                              Drinking I dont understand         They say they drink to forget their troubles and then thats all they talk about                  Me when Im drinking I get sick on the stomach         My mother said that God has blessed me and made me that way because I could have been like Daddy and could have been an alcoholic                  I cant understand how anyone likes the taste of it                  Wheres the boys                     At home                     When did you uh get married                     Huh                     When did you get married                     Well I came to Charlotte to live with my grandmother         I was engaged to a boy in Wadesboro         But I came up here and                     So you were running from him                     No         I came up here to work                     Did you mean to leave him                     He left me first         He was in prison         He went to prison                     Oh                     And Im still writing to him up here but I met George Watkins and I really dont know how to pick men         He um believe it or not I met him in the church but he turned out to be a paranoid schizophrenic         And his doctor said he was dangerous and it was best that I got away from him                     But you didnt listen to his doctor did you                     Yes                     No you waited until he ran you out the door                     I was out the door that time         I just had on black shorts and red shirt and I was a witch         Living with him you had to be careful of what you wore         What colors         How you picked up anything on the dresser and put it down or you were arranging some witchcraft stuff         The reason the doctor say I shouldnt live there is that         Um he thought the bible said well it does say dont suffer a witch to live so he might kill me         I was teaching yall my kids witchcraft too he said                  Well like I told you Tammy I could tell bits and parts of my life story and make I dont know how many books         If I could just get into it sit down and think about it and do it                     Sitting down and writing it should remind you of some of the battles                     I would read the True Story magazine sometimes and think Good gosh she didnt have it any rougher then I did         And why did she go out and become a heron addict or                     Was your whole life bad or did you have anything good happen                     I had fun         I danced         Um I sang         And my best friend was Eleanor Ruth Hare         And         we went everywhere together         Well we didnt go to many places because we couldnt sneak out that much                     You were quite an artist too         You love to draw womens clothes                     A designer is what my teacher said I ought to be         I did         Id draw them Sarah my older sister would make them                  Um when I had fun was after I went to work for Schmick in wiring electric duck heaters         I had fun doing that                     You loved that job                     I love wiring electric duck heaters         And                     You love the people too it was like a family                     Umhuh                     Made you feel at home                     And then they closed out the electric duck         You know the heaters         The wiring they say just um air conditioning units and all those things were big and everything but I still enjoyed working there because I knew the people         I worked there for about ten years         And then                     You made very good money for people during that time too         For a woman                     Yeah         I was the only woman in that place making the kind of money an inspector made         Electric duck heaters         But the men werent jealous of me like they said you know that they were         Most places                      The men                       The men helped me get the job                                       I noticed that about mine too         They helped                     They taught me what I ought to know         To get the job right before I was to go for the interview they told me everything I suppose to know when I went in there I knew it                     Thats good                     They said You got it on your own         You remembered things real well                  I had been going over there and helping the temporary inspector anyway                  We had to learn about the air gauges how much air would go in them things that make those I cant even remember the name of them now         Fly open and shut when you put air to it                  And then I married Earl and along came Nicole call her Buttons on there so         And um         that made me stay young I think Nicole                     You got with her what you couldnt have with us                     Because I had to work all the time with them         I worked quite a few with Nicole too                     But you got to do more                     Went to the beach a lot                  At that time I had kids of all ages one grown up one thought she was grown up and         Amy was just real quiet         Nicole was never quiet                     You had all girls                     Umhuh                  I had a miscarriage         Swore it was a boy                              All the people during that period the

the sheep                               Uhhuh                                       Tell me about Elma Ruth before she run away from training school                     She came to me then I hurt her feelings because I told her she couldnt stay there but I was staying with Sarah                     How old was she                                          Why was she in training school                     Um she was with this girl named Barbara and they told         they looked older then what they were         Although the guy at the car lot should have asked for their driver license         And they use to let you take the cars and drive them around with nobody in them but now you know they stay with you                     Yes                     And they went on a joy ride in it                  They took the car and went on a joy ride         But it was called stealing because they didnt take it back                     They didnt give them any warning or probation like they do nowadays                     Well shed Elma had a lot of warnings about school                     She didnt go to school                     Playing hooky                  They put her there                     You said she was beautiful                     I thought she was         She had jetblack hair         I mean it was black as ace of spades         And a pretty complexion but I got along better with her then I did with my sisters                     How long have you been friends                     Since when we were little tiny things and sliding down the bank         Red mud in little white panties                              When did you stop seeing her         When you moved to Charlotte                     Well we saw each other after I moved to Charlotte when I go back down there to visit but when she moved to um some         I cant think of the name of the place         Just lost touch with her         She got married and moved                     So yall were friends on up until you were teenagers                     Umhuh         I talked to her one time when I lived in SC         My daughter Debbie gave called her found out where she was what her phone number was and called her and had this three way calling and we talked to each other                     Its quite common now but it was new when Debbie done it                     It it wasnt the same         I guess you just cant go back but I still would like to see her         But when we uh drive through Wadesboro going to the beach and everything nothings the same down there either
