                    Introduction        Neutropenic complications defined as febrile        neutropenia severe neutropenia or dose delay or reduction        due to neutropenia are the most common side effects of        myelosuppressive chemotherapy      The frequent        occurrence of neutropenic complications suggests that it is        impossible to predict accurately which patients will        present with a neutropenic complication Febrile        neutropenia defined as an absolute neutrophil count ANC        of more than    liter with a temperature of more        than F is the most severe neutropenic complication        and can cause prolonged hospitalization Neutropenic        complications can negatively affect the course of        chemotherapy leading to dose delays or decreases to reduce        a patients risk of developing febrile neutropenia The        ability to improve predictions of which patients are at        risk for neutropenic complications might help to reduce the        morbidity due to febrile neutropenia and increase the        likelihood of delivering full chemotherapy dose on time In        addition hematopoietic growth factors could be        administered to patients who need them most permitting the        more efficient use of medical resources        Several publications have argued that the first        chemotherapy cycle nadir ANC is a good predictor of        neutropenic complications in patients with breast cancer             These papers were based on retrospective chart        analyses and therefore require further validation in        additional chemotherapy regimens and patient populations        before the model can be prospectively implemented        Filgrastim recombinant methionyl human granulocyte        colonystimulating factor has been shown to reduce the        depth of the nadir ANC shorten the duration of        neutropenia and reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia            thereby maintaining chemotherapy dose      Many        patients with earlystage breast cancer do not receive the        full chemotherapy dose intensity recommended in        conventional adjuvant chemotherapy regimens              Neutropenia is the primary reason for chemotherapy dose        delays and reductions              Dose delay and dose reduction can result in care that is        less than optimal Significant reductions in total dose and        dose intensity have an adverse effect on diseasefree        survival and overall survival      Because most dose        delays and reductions occur after a neutropenic        complication or febrile neutropenia patients might        experience an infectious episode and might need to contend        with the burden and anxiety associated with a        hospitalization and the risk of prolonged complications in        treatment These events impose potentially preventable        burdens on the patients The use of hematopoietic growth        factors as primary prophylaxis is one way of decreasing the        burden of neutropenic complications However when growth        factors are not used as primary prophylaxis neutropenic        complications serve as the indicator of the patients risk        for further neutropenic complications resulting either in        growthfactor treatment as secondary prophylaxis or in        chemotherapy dose delays or reductions        An alternative treatment strategy can be developed in        which patients have a reduced risk of neutropenic        complications and a higher likelihood of receiving a full        dose of chemotherapy on time Firstcycle nadir ANC can be        used to identify patients at risk for neutropenic        complications These patients could receive prophylactic        hematopoietic growthfactor support to decrease        treatmentrelated morbidity and to increase the likelihood        of the administration of fulldose chemotherapy on        time        Silber and colleagues    proposed a predictive model        of neutropenia dose reduction or dose delay based on        blood counts observed during the first cycle of        chemotherapy The model estimates the patients risk of        requiring dose attenuation due to myelosuppression or        alternatively decreasing below acceptable ANC levels in        subsequent chemotherapy cycles The model demonstrates that        patients can be ranked by probability of presenting with        neutropenia in subsequent cycles with a high degree of        certainty and good degree of discrimination between        patients at high and low risk This ranking permits the        judicious use of hematopoietic growth factors such as        filgrastim to support patients who can benefit the most        from this treatment Consequently patients at high risk        for developing neutropenia will have a greater chance of        receiving fulldose chemotherapy on time and avoiding        febrile neutropenia        The purpose of our study was the further validation of a        model     that used firstcycle nadir ANC count to        predict the risk of febrile neutropenia dose delay and        dose reduction in patients with breast cancer receiving        myelosuppressive chemotherapy The validation had two        parts a crossvalidation of the original model with our        data and a test of the model specification to improve its        predictive power for our specific patient population and        regimen                    Methods                  Patients          The validation sample included  chemotherapynaive          patients with stage I II IIIa or IIIb breast cancer          who had been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy during           as part of the MD Anderson Cancer Center MDACC           trial Patients aged more than  years those with          inflammatory breast cancer those with a previous history          of contralateral breast cancer with higher stage of          disease and those with second primary other than basal          cell carcinoma of skin or           in situ carcinoma of cervix were          excluded from the original MDACC  study          Of the  patients participating in the trial           were excluded from analysis Four patients had no          complete blood cell count data recorded three had          incomplete chemotherapy delivery information and three          had received filgrastim Results are reported for the          remaining  patients Therefore as in the study by          Silber and colleagues     this validation sample          describes the natural history of neutropenia                          Treatment          Primary surgical treatment consisted of a modified          radical mastectomy or segmental mastectomy If indicated          the patient was treated with preoperative or          postoperative local radiotherapy All patients were          treated with the FAC fluorouracil doxorubicin          cyclophosphamide regimen that consisted of  mgm          doxorubicin given as a continuous infusion over  hours          starting on day   mgm cyclophosphamide          intravenously on day  and  mgm fluorouracil          intravenously on days  and  Treatment was given every           or  weeks for a total of six cycles Complete blood          counts with differential counts were usually obtained on          days   and  of each cycle Chemotherapy was usually          delayed if the ANC was less than    liter on the          planned first day of the cycle Dose delays were usually          for  week The chemotherapy dose was reduced if on the          previous cycle the nadir ANC was less than             liter or if the patient experienced an episode of          febrile neutropenia defined as an ANC of less than             liter with a temperature of more than F Dose          reductions usually consisted of a  reduction in dosage          of all chemotherapy drugs                          Outcome definition          A neutropeniarelated event was defined similarly to          that in the study by Silber and colleagues     a          nadir ANC of    liter or less a          neutropeniarelated dose reduction of  or more of the          planned dose of any agent a neutropeniarelated dose          delay of  days or more or a febrileneutropenic          episode Delays and reductions were related to          neutropenia and the reasons for the dose modifications          were documented A response group for the risk model          consists of all patients who experienced at least one          neutropeniarelated event after the first cycle of          chemotherapy The ANC cutoff point to define an event was             liter rather than    liter used in          the Silber model to accommodate the physician practice          style associated with patients in the validation          sample                          Statistical methods          The originally estimated Silber risk model was          crossvalidated with the MDACC sample We used the same          definitions as in the original model for the predictor          variables The distribution of these predictor variables          was compared across the original Silber and validation          MDACC study samples The outcome variable in the          validation sample differs in that an ANC cutoff point of             liter is used in the compound outcome          definition Given this difference in ANC cutoff point and          the difference in chemotherapy regimens used in the two          samples the absolute predicted probabilities of events          resulting from the crossvalidation might not be          interpretable but their relative magnitude or ranking          of patients by predicted probability of an event is          valid To assess the crossvalidation results we divided          the patients into predicted positive and predicted          negative groups by using varying probability cut points          This process is equivalent to ranking the patients by          their predicted event probability and dividing the ranked          list in all possible ways declaring the higherranked          patients predicted positive and the lowerranked patients          predicted negative          The sensitivity and specificity of each possible          resulting classification are summarized in a          receiveroperatingcharacteristic curve plot The           C statistic area under the          receiveroperatingcharacteristic curve     which          summarized the sensitivity and specificity across the          entire  to  range of probability cut points is          reported together with the sensitivity and specificity          rates for the optimal classification table This          validation process does not address the effect of          concurrent radiotherapy because none of the patients in          the validation sample were treated with this modality As          a result the indicator variable for concurrent          radiotherapy present in the original model is set to           effectively applying the model to patients with no          concurrent radiotherapy          For the modelspecification test the same variables          used to predict neutropenic complications in the Silber          model were fitted with a logistic regression to our data          and the significance was reported Furthermore we          explored other potential predictors to examine whether          new significant risk factors would emerge The          discrimination and calibration of the model fitted to our          data and original models were compared by using the           C statistic and the          HosmerLemeshow statistic     The          receiveroperatingcharacteristic curves for the two          models were plotted and compared The magnitudes of the          risk factors effects were compared across the validation          and original models Regression coefficient differences          were tested with an asymptotic normal test and the          estimated probability of event curves derived from the          original and validation models were plotted for          comparison Finally we assessed the importance of          firstcycle nadir ANC as a predictor of subsequent          episodes of febrile neutropenia and of reduced dose          intensity not more than  of planned dose intensity          by comparing the proportion of observed events

estimated probability curve for the          MDACC sample might be due to the higher myelotoxicity of          the CAF regimen used in the validation sample The          observed proportions of patients who experienced febrile          neutropenia and received  or less of the planned dose          intensity in the MDACC study are presented in Figs and          by firstcycle nadir ANC The association of the ANC at          firstcycle nadir with each of the outcomes is evident A          significantly higher percentage of patients with a          firstcycle nadir ANC of    liter or less

retrospective analyses     using a variety        of chemotherapies have consistently resulted in firstcycle        nadir ANC as a primary predictor of neutropeniarelated        events in patients with breast cancer Here we confirm the        results obtained in the previous analyses by Silber and        colleagues     which is important because the data used        in this study come from a prospective clinical trial        whereas the other data sets were collected from patient        charts in an uncontrolled environment The data in this        study represent a homogenous population receiving        standardized chemotherapy and the collection procedures        ensure highquality data The crossvalidation analysis        showed that the original predictive model successfully        classified patients by their risk of neutropenic event The        model fitted to the validation data results in the same        specification and similar variable coefficient magnitudes        to those in the original model        Our model differs somewhat from the Silber model First        the impact of the change in hemoglobin concentration is        significant in the Silber model and not significant in this        data set although the magnitude of the effect is similar        in both models We do not believe that hemoglobin        concentrations have a direct impact on neutropenic        complications however low hemoglobin concentrations        probably provide further indication of bone marrow        depletion It is possible that the impact of change in        hemoglobin concentration in the models will vary by        chemotherapy regimen        On the basis of the cumulated published evidence the        model seems to be robust The model was tested in several        chemotherapy regimens and in various clinical environments        It seems that the models specification and the magnitude        of the coefficients effect is consistent across        chemotherapy regimens The inclination is to consider the        implementation of this model prospectively Before such a        step is undertaken some issues need to be discussed to        improve our understanding of the models limitation and its        usefulness        The major challenge to the models prospective        implementation is the uncertainty that a greater dose        intensity would result in clinical benefit such as        survival Although it is not within the scope of this study        to answer this important question it should be emphasized        that the model provides some other distinctive and        practical benefits Successful application of the model        will clearly define the patient group that should not        receive growthfactor support and who can receive the full        dose on time without a risk of complications The ability        to define the population that does not require growth        factors on the basis of a quantitative clinical indicator        has an immediate benefit to the patients and the health        care system it diverts resources from patients who will        not benefit to those who will The second benefit is the        potential to reduce the morbidity due to febrile        neutropenia from the highrisk group by providing these        patients with growthfactor support before any clinical        complications occur The third benefit is learning the        relationship between high dose intensity and survival on        the basis of planned dose and not actual delivered dose        Implementation of a risk model can provide better data by        making the planned dose closer to the delivered dose and        the impact of dose can be measured more accurately        Additional objections to the model relate to the        definition of a neutropenic complication in particular        dose delays and dose reductions Dose delays and dose        reductions are events that occur as a result of a clinical        decision and not a measured biological variable such as        neutropenia based on ANC It could be argued that these        decisions are not necessarily objective reflecting the        practice pattern of individual physicians and cannot be        part of the definition of a neutropenic complication In        this context it is important to remember that the purpose        of the model is to identify patients at risk A physician        who delays or reduces the dose of chemotherapy has decided        that the patient is at risk Moreover once it is decided        to reduce or delay the dose there is no way of knowing the        rate of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia if the full dose        of chemotherapy had been delivered Therefore including        these events in the definition of a neutropenic        complication seems justified especially if the goal is to        minimize harm to the patients Admittedly this methodology        might result in an overestimation of the number of patients        at risk        Although the model seems to be robust and potentially        useful it does not answer the following two major        questions If patients were stratified by their risk for        neutropenic complications and provided with growthfactor        support would the dose intensity delivered increase and by        how much Would the rate of neutropenic complications        increase because of the higher chemotherapy dose delivered        To answer these questions decisively the model needs to be        implemented prospectively                    Conclusions        The first step toward the prospective implementation of        the model has been performed and is reported by Rivera and        colleagues     Additional prospective studies on        different regimens and different cancer types would be        required to establish the utility and feasibility of this        model Such an effort carries with it the promise that        clinical criteria would be used to deliver appropriate care        to patients with cancer and would maximize the potential        benefit from chemotherapy while possibly minimizing the        burden on patients and their caregivers and families                    Competing interests        MHE is an employee of Amgen Inc the manufacturer of        filgrastim and owns
