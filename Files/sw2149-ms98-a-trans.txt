           so huh what do you think should they uh should young Americans be forced to do a year of service   i dont i dont think they should be forced but i think they should be encouraged i guess encouraged to to do some kind of public work i guess just to get them i guess involved with community maybe you know just community activity if nothing else see how the city works stuff like that   yeah i think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh   yeah i  i think so too i think thats a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it its a good idea to get them involved in the city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and     you know kids   uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can   move on yeah i think its a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two and and and force them i think that uh i think itd be i think most i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it   yeah youre right i do too i think they start out young like in uh Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts doing stuff   right exactly i was a i was a Boy Scout and as part of being a Boy Scout you had to do you know projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a do a year long project for   exactly right thats see thats what we did in Girl Scouts and and that got you involved real good and it i think it starts kids out on the right track and it lets them decide if thats what they enjoy doing something   yeah i think i i now i think people generally volunteer that that theres no problem with getting them to to do stuff   yeah i do too i think i think a lot of people a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays i mean at least theyre getting out and doing it and  you know perhaps helping and helping out i think thats good and   well we have a funny commercial around here it says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary we could they could solve all the worlds problems or something         so  i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh or just or just gave or or just or just forced our kids just to force kids to serve for uh parents i guess   yeah yeah ill be yeah  there you go thats   substitute my my yeah my kidll do uh four or five hours this week for me no problem   hey yeah it sounds pretty good  that sounds good ive noticed a lot of uh  different organizations in our community uh pick up like on the highway and stuff and i think thats pretty neat they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over and they clean it up   oh i ive seen that yeah   and keep it clean i think thats a pretty good idea and i think you know again ive seen a lot of young kids doing that and i think it gets them prepared to to learn how to volunteer as they get older i know i did you know in like Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that  so   they they just started trying to get them together like like like like that around here from for from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh very very recently you dont sound like youre in the north you sound like youre in the south somewhere   oh yeah im in Texas where are you at   yeah uh im in uh New York upstate upstate upstate New York yeah and uh  long way uh   New York oh gosh yeah yeah   and we just had a really big ice storm and basically half the trees in in in our city im in Rochester which is uh right upstate half of the trees in the city   umhum   um are no good anymore and thats how bad it was everything is just down everywhere you know we had three hundred thousand people without power   oh no oh golly   you know it was and you know and and they and we didnt have power for a week and there are still people who dont have power its its oh yeah its been over its been ten days already and there are still something like   are you serious oh   ten thousand people without power and were officially yeah and were officially in a state of emergency funny thing is the news the national news how they covered it um   oh my God how do they live yeah i havent heard a thing   yeah i think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and and weve been in a state of emergency for over you know for ten or eleven days you know we just got our phone back today uh   oh Lord God   and and theyre you know putting out ads and now for people to come volunteer or to have their organizations come volunteer to help clean up the streets   well thats good thats great   because we have you know everywhere everywhere that a tree is down people need help and were all all a lot of older folks need help getting their yards cleaned out because they cant afford to pay anyone and they and and they certainly cant carry it themselves and so   right yeah yeah right right  thats one thing we do at our church is um  we have a group called Hearts and Hammers and we go along and im really not sure how we find the individuals but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that need desperately need it and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can   oh thats great   yeah and spend a day doing thats really neat i mean its not a lot because youre just doing a house at a time but you know every little bit helps   and is that supported by all donation to the church and so forth or   uh yeah they uh  luckily we have a a man who owns a building company   oh so he   so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material then what he doesnt donate we just go out and buy   thats real nice   yeah and its not you know we dont promote it a lot outside the community because we dont want recognition for it you know so much as we just want to help people out so its real neat its     right that that thats real good and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that   yeah its like i say its not a lot but it helps people like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and i just you know it just tears your heart out to   yeah   to see this kind of thing and you know if you can do any any little bit it helps so   thats thats uh thats real good we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that some did elderly visits some did um   yeah yeah   some did you know Big Brother Big Sister stuff like that and im convinced that that that at least twenty five percent of our school participated in some sort of uh some sort of group you know activity activity like that you know twenty five i dont know  twenty five percent  yeah my wife was big in that  and she thinks yeah twenty five percent its it was a small school  but um   gosh thats great thats a lot thats thats a lot of kids though oh well still thats a lot you know thats a good chunk of kids   yeah but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because there were all different organizations to do there was Big Brother Big Sister they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to to support that group   yeah yeah thats neat   such that you know lots of people got involved that way   thats great thats great but uh like ill agree with you though i dont think they should have to do a year   yeah yeah no neither do i i think it should be completely optional and you know   yeah i dont think that some people i dont think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean theyre not worth it   yeah theyre not worth a year or some people unfortunately just just cant even afford it you know or whatever i mean the Peace Corps doesnt pay very well   right oh yeah thats true thats true   you know people get shipped off and then you know and then and then their parents i have a um a a friend whose whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now   oh oh oh   and you know he and his wife just went off to visit her and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala   i i couldnt either i couldnt either   you know so so i think you know and and and the kids certainly not making much money   right right   so i can see where that that may be a problem   yeah i just know one person thats in the Peace Corps and  i mean shes a teacher and and just wanted to do it shed been a teacher for a while just decided she wanted to do it so i mean im grateful for people like that but i dont see how they can just     just take off a year   yeah just pick up and head on out i wish i could do something like that but   right yeah i dont yeah well neither can i so i i i i i i did my service before and ill do my little community service throughout but never never for a year again   i cant so right thats the way i am  i know the feeling   but so right so i guess our vote is no   thats right  were against it   well its been nice talking to you i guess   thats right you too and i hope everything works out up there   well yeah were were slowly getting everything back together again you know it its taking time but everything you know we got lucky we had no damage to our house or anything so the restll just have to come with time   yeah good good thats great yeah well good luck   well good luck to you too  byebye   thanks bye
