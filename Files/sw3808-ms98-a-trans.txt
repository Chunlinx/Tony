            what do you think about drug testing   well unnecessary a necessary evil i guess   yeah i think that its appropriate in some job categories uh jobs that involve safety and you know that that performance of which really would have an effect on the the the lives and safety of other people you know health professionals and people who uh operate machinery and fly and or drive whatever i think that those are really important im not sure how i feel about about other jobs just uh for the purpose of determining whether or not an employee is drug free you know on on general principles   well   but i can really see the justification for the others   yeah uh i guess im uh partly biased since we just recently our companys gone to the uh process of initiating drug testing on a random basis   uhhuh for all job categories   everybody uh in the corporation   uhhuh so whether youre an executive behind a desk or youre operating a vehicle or whatever   thats correct   and and how do they how do they do that how often generally does random mean   well its uh other than they uh they insisted on the uh you know management and and supervision taking the uh being done within the first year which weve all been done you know uh seems to be   so in the past month   the past year   oh since nineteen ninety one it started is that right   uh right actually late in ninety it was   uhhuh   but you know they its fairly infrequent its just that its there you know   uhhuh uhhuh when you say infrequent is it maybe once a quarter or   oh Lord no i dont think uh first of all in my group hardly a fourth of them have been tested you know   how large is that group   uh its about uh twenty people   uhhuh uhhuh so what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do that that the company chose to do that   well   was it insurance issue or   that uh they want to you know social uh issues   safety issue uhhuh so uh on a performance level there was actually a problem with abuse of substances and they wanted to make sure that they were reducing that or   yeah i think that that was probably the prime motivation and insurance like you say to get uh   uhhuh yeah what kind of a company is it   Texas Instruments   oh i guess i should have figured  anybody i talk to in Texas is is probably  from TI     yeah   interesting well they really i guess i shouldnt stray from the subject but they have some very interesting topics for for questions i often wonder who has created them   yeah i guess there uh may have been just a committee throwing out suggestions   was the response from the employees regarding drug testing favorable or   it was uh it was received at our site here in Houston fairly easily however in Austin where they have a lot of engineers and uh i guess a younger set uh people they uh they were pretty uh a lot of people quit over it and uh quite a   oh really   quite a bit of furor yeah   interesting quit on general principle   i guess yeah there was some people that just actually quit because of the their uh objection to the policy being forced on them you know   uhhuh uhhuh is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription medication and and   uh i dont know how much of that there is i dont think its that big of an issue because theyve hired a national company and its you know handled   be interpreted correctly   third party and theres supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that   uhhuh uhhuh do you know if anyones been uh um disciplined or   oh yes theyve theyve theyve been people that have been uh the company has a you get a two step process the first time if youre caught you have to uh take a uh you know go into a program to even if youre not you know still have to go into a program even   so even if its you know one time   yeah if youre if youre youre high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if youre not a habitual user or whatever   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   then uh after that first time chance then the second time its automatic termination so   seems fair certainly if people are prepared for the fact that theres a chance theyre going to be tested you think theyd be smart enough if they did have a problem to eliminate their use   yeah well its its almost become a uh non topic anymore
