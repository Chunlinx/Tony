                                 The Paper Chase                        Dear David            It has been  years since you left home and we have been talkingintermittently since then by telephone You have gone far geographically andI was going to say careerwise but as your mother is a strict grammarian Iknew she would wince at that wise ending We used to say that when you werean undergraduate at Harvard you were one of the few students who knew that oneshould not begin a sentence with Hopefully and more why one should not doso In any event meander as I am wont to do you have gone far in your chosenfield I used to say that your sister and yourself both PhDs in earlymodern European history would go to any lengths to find a subject for whichyour father could not give you a bibliography            Now we are talking by email an unfamiliar venue for me Your mother has acomputer I dont though I use hers fitfully This is in spite of the factthat I taught courses on technology for more than  years before I retired andhave even written books on the new technology But as you know I alwaysconsider myself in the position of the young man drafted into the Israeli navywho when asked if he knew how to swim replied I know the theory of it Myinterest is in theory because I am interested in the logic of technology andhow that unfolds And as a sociologist I have long argued for the priority oftheory since theory allows one to take a finding or a proposition out of onecontext and apply these to different and even unfamiliar ones I stand by theold saw If something works in practice does it also work in theory            As you can see I am seeking to avoid getting started over this unfamiliarroute and talking as we are supposed to do about the days events as theyunfold in the morning newspaper But the morning newspaper for me issomething I read at a distance so to speak Though we have now lived inCambridge for almost  years I do not see the Boston Globe  our localpaper Each morning before we get up the New York Times and theWall Street Journal are delivered to our door I have always found theGlobe to be somewhat dull and parochial and I would know what wasplaying at the New York nabes rather than in Boston But now the Timeshas a Boston edition with the Boston weather and television schedule and theTab a community paper with special town editions such as Cambridge tellsme what is playing at the local movie houses            We get the Times because it is the Times and has all the newsthat it sees fit to print And having recently been in Paris and London weappreciate the Times all the more for its detailed news coverage asagainst all the nattering about Tony and Gordon and Alistair Campbell thatfills to overflowing the quality London papers And the Wall StreetJournal  for its intriguing frontpage news stories and the succinctpresentation of business and political news in two columns even though theeditorial page makes me gnash my teeth I would prefer the London FinancialTimes  which is the only decent newspaper in England and I mean decent inmany senses since they do not show tits and bums or print gossip about themarital adventures of cabinet members but it is too expensive to get heredaily Besides we read the Economist regularly such a prize for itsfine and lucid prose and its comprehensive worldwide coverage that fills thegaps left by the Times and the Wall Street Journal             All right to the news  But I have gone on nattering for the askedforpage and a half so why dont you begin            LoveDad
