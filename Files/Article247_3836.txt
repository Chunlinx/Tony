                                 Rule No  Dont Follow All Rules                        In late September of  the New York Giants and the Chicago Cubs weretied for first place in the National League pennant race with about a week togo in the season This was in the days when there were no divisional playoffslet alone wild cards If you won the regular season title you went to theWorld Series The two teams met for a game at the Polo Grounds and went to thebottom of the ninth tied             With two outs and Moose McCormick on first Giants first baseman Fred Merklesingled to right field sending McCormick to third The next batter then lineda single up the middle scoring McCormick with what should have been thewinning run and putting New York into first But there was a catch Merkle whowas digging hard for second base swerved away he never touched second andstarted running for the Giants locker room in center field as soon as he sawMcCormick touch the plate As was their wont in those less orderly days Giantsfans immediately came swarming onto the field when their team won and Merklewanted to get a head start on the happy mob            This then was whats known in baseball as Merkles Boner Refrain fromall vulgar snickers please According to the rules of baseball the gamewasnt actually over until Merkle touched second base Cubs second basemanJohnny Evers of TinkerstoEverstoChance fame realized this tracked downthe ball actually people who were there say he got another ball from thedugout since the original ball had disappeared into the crowd grabbed anumpire and stepped on second base which in theory completed a force play onMerkle After much discussion the umpires called Merkle out and declared thegame a tie that would have to be replayed A week or so later it was and thistime the Cubs won sending themselves to the Series and consigning Merkle topermanent notoriety            Theres no question that according to the rules as written Merkle did haveto touch second base But according to custom in  runners who were on basewhen a gamewinning run scored in the ninth tended not to touch the nextbase and instead headed for their clubhouses A month or so before in a gameagainst Pittsburgh Johnny Evers had tried the very same trick against a Piraterunner who had left the field at games end but that time the umpire hadrejected his appeal            In suddenly invoking the letter of the law then the umpires were requiringMerkle to act in a way that he had no reason to believe he was supposed to actThe communitys understanding of the rule that a runner must always touch thebase to which he is forced was that this rule didnt apply when a game was wonin the ninth inning What Merkle did then was what the community expected himto do This may not mean he was right to do what he did But theres anargument to be made that when custom systematically changes the meaning of alawin this case changes it by adding an important exceptionits a mistaketo invoke the original meaning arbitrarily and without warning            All of which brings us back to New York Citys crackdown last week againstpeople who doublepark while their streets are being cleaned This form ofdoubleparking which is clearly distinguishable from doubleparking inshopping or business districts is customary throughout the city On my streettheres a guy who will doublepark your car for you and then return it tocurbside when the threehour streetsweeping period is over Its beenunderstood that doubleparking is technically illegal but that this is anorderly and systematic community response to the reality that people need aplace to put their cars while the streets are being cleaned            By descending on selected residential neighborhoods and ticketing all thosedoubleparked cars the cops have pulled a Johnny Evers Theyre just enforcingthe law as written But by doing so without notice theyre catching peoplebreaking rules that the community had in a sense decided didnt need to beenforced I exaggerate here since the community is the community of carowners And insofar as much of our everyday lives depends on knowing thatcertain rules count and others dontlike laws banning cursing out loud orspitting in public or oral sexRudy Giuliani is making everyone feel veryunsettled            Actually though the unannounced war on doubleparking is not reallycharacteristic of Giuliani Most of his previous Jesuiticalinitiativesagainst jaywalking speeding gridlock and the failure to wearseatbelts among othershave been announced well in advance so that noticewas served that as of a certain date things were going to be different And ifyoure going to hold people to the letter of the law that seems like the wayto do it because itd be hard to have any sympathy for Fred Merkle if beforethat September game the umpires had told both teams to make sure they touchedall the bases in the ninth inning
