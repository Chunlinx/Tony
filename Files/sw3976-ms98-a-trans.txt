              okay yeah the topic is uh car repairs and the last one ive had done it was a fluke the last one i had done   right uhhuh what happened   well i was driving down six thirty five at the um coming from North Dallas   uhhuh   and i was uh going um almost hitting the um       entry where all the the merges go from six thirty five seventy five and Coit and uh all of a sudden i get this liquid all over my hood and my windshield     yeah   and i had smelled it before i thought and i thought that it was coming from another vehicle and then when i saw it go all over my car i thought oh oh something came through my radiator and just somethings wrong inside my car so i i was waiting for my car to collapse you know i go i was going about sixty five miles an hour         and it kept going and i thought well what is going on and so i made it home and i looked at my car and it was a mess       so i immediately the next morning i took it to my dealer and i i left it just how i drove it in the the night before and he says well it looks like your uh antifreeze uh something happened to your antifreeze   huh   and they checked everything in that car and it wasnt from my car       it was from some other car some other car did that to me well im glad but it was a very panicky situation   some other car had too well isnt that something well oh sure right   but no i do not do any of my own repairs the only thing i do to my car is put gas in it and wash it   well i do i do some of my own repairs yes i do i i have learned to do this   oh you do well good for you thats great   that uh my husband drives uh sports cars races he races them as a hobby   oh i see oh well he probably showed you all the tricks of the trade thats great   yes and he said you need to know how to do all this stuff so i do change my own oil um   sure   most in fact i have changed out a whole engine in uh one of sons trucks   you did well bless your heart   yes i took the whole thing out and i fixed it but i think its really important to know these things if you can   well i think thats wonderful i mean  i think thats great   but uh but now if i could talk him into doing this ill let him do it ive told him ive learned how but     well gee you should uh you know you should get some money for your talents and start branching out     no i dont think i wanna work on too many peoples cars thats hard work i think they earn their money i do   it is oh well you know uh loosening those nuts and bolts would be a problem for me   right   and i know they have some really sophisticated equipment today where they do it electronically and all that but that takes money to buy those kind of tools too   yes it does now i i dont think i will be able to work on you know too many cars much longer because they are sophisticated and i just cant fool with these computers and things that they have in it that   umhum umhum right yeah no i wouldnt want my i wouldnt want anybody to touch my car without having all the the yeah the uh computer and all and everything     the proper tools right thats but it uh i had just gotten a new car this year and i i take it back to the dealer i take this one to the dealer   because you have that uh as a as a gift to you dont you that they do it for you for gratis   yes  right uhhuh at least this first year  and uh   uhhuh right well i have a womans agreement on mine and they they did it for three years   oh well thats nice   yeah yeah that really was nice so i uh appreciated that uh a present that they gave me   uhhuh well that that is really good but i cant think of any offhand um problems we have really had lately you know that weve had to fix uh the one thing we have problem with is our electricals anything that goes electrical wrong with the cars we dont even try to fool with those ourselves   oh umhum right   and uh those to me theyre very difficult to locate the problem if you   well dont they have if you that they hook it up to the computer and the computer does the analysis and tells you whats wrong with with different areas yeah yeah   well right they can do that with the new ones uhhuh with these newer cars you can do that and uh   umhum   but other than that the the oil changes and the gases water and antifreeze i do keep that in there     well i i have put windshield washer solvent in the container but and   yeah have you ever changed a windshield wiper   no i have not  this one hasnt needed any thus thus far     yeah yeah   um its been a super car its uh lets see its uh three years old   oh well good what kind is it   its its a Plymouth Acclaim   uhhuh well good   i really like it its a been a very dependable um no maintenance i have not had
