                                 How Congress Resists the Web            Thesimplest way the Internet can enhance democracy is by making buried informationeasily available to citizens By putting documents of all kinds onlineagencies let in disinfecting sunlight and make themselves accountable to thepublic By and large the federal government has made impressive strides towardmaking itself Webaccessible But theres one big exception the USCongress            Congress is ostensibly fascinated with cyberspace Fifty Webrelated bills andresolutions are pending on Capitol Hill Over  members of Congressparticipate in an Internet caucus Yet when it comes to posting basicinformation about its inner workings Congress has been shamefully slow Theresult is that it protects the privileged status of corporate lobbyists andinsulates backroom deals from public scrutiny while fencing out concerned andengaged citizens            Letssay you want to find out something about the latest draft of a bill You mighttry the home pages of the House and Senate  which link to Capitol Hill tourism tips and memberhome pages But these sites provide scattershot coverage of legislationrevisions Nor are the pages of the legislations sponsors likely to help Mostof these are filled with promotional dross Biographical information pressreleases and lengthy legislative accomplishment lists are complemented byintern solicitations and flag request forms Sen Mitch McConnell RKyincludes his recipe for ChocolateNut Pie             Youmay get closer to what youre looking for at GPO Access  aGovernment Printing Office site where citizens can download legislation andsearch Congressional Record archives The clumsy and confusingTHOMAS a Libraryof Congress siteduplicates some of this information It contains billsrollcall votes and links to congressional committee sites But neither ofthese sites gives you the uptodate information that might enable you tounderstand how a bill is working its way through the legislative process            Thereis much more information online about Congress than at any time in historyaccording to Jason Poblete a spokesman for the House Administration CommitteeThat is undoubtedly true but its hardly a meaningful statement There is farless information about Congress online than there should and easily could beHere is whats missing and why                           Working Drafts of Bills and Amendments Citizens can accessbills but working drafts are rarely posted Thats because under currentpolicy THOMAS cannot post an update until the text is processed by theGovernment Printing Office The delay guarantees that lobbyists have time toget drafts and influence the process before the general public knows whatshappening Adam Thierer Internet policy analyst for the Heritage Foundationsays that the messy nature of the legislative process makes it difficult tokeep a site up to date But Gary Ruskin of the Congressional AccountabilityProject a Ralph Naderrelated organization that watches Congress asserts thatcommittee chairmen squelch the posting of drafts because If citizens figuredout what was in some of these bills there would be public outcry againstthem                           Hearing Transcripts and Statements To find out aboutcongressional hearings the curious must locate the appropriate committee siteSome committees post opening remarks and transcripts but the coverage isscattershot THOMAS publishes hearing testimony but it often takes monthsbefore the transcripts are processed While the public waits lobbyistspurchase uncorrected transcripts from pricey transcription agencies Pobletecounsels patience and claims that all committees will offer video archives ofhearings someday In the meantime Congress could make all its committeeshearings available with the help of a few  scanners                           Congressional Research Service Reports Congress spends over million a year on a research service that analyzes thousands of issuesfrom abortion to Zambia The reports which are often excellent are publicdocuments that the public cant easily get its hands on Sen Tom DaschleDSD posts several hundred CRS reports on his site and members givethem away in response to specific constituent requests Still citizens oftenhave to wait weeks for research that a congressional staffer can download inseconds As a result commercial services are able to make money sellingbootleg copies PennyHill Press  for instance peddles CRS reports for  per order Whynot put these guys out of business Ruskin contends that Congress hoards thereports because members see CRS as their own fiefdom and they like the abilityto give reports as a favor to constituents A congressional task force isconsidering making all CRS reports public It is supposed to report itsconclusions by the end of the year                           Voting Records To find out how a member voted on a particularbill citizens must comb through archives of rollcall votes which arecategorized by bill number and searchable by topic Constituents cant searchby representative name at least at any official government site Ruskin arguesthat easily searchable voting records are essential to democraticaccountability Poblete says Congress is considering how to make votingrecords easier to access                           Lobbyist Disclosure Reports These reports detail how muchlobbyists are paid to work on a particular issue and in theory what who andhow they lobby They can make for very interesting reading but to get them youhave to go in person to a little office in the Capitol Ruskin argues thatposting the reports would allow citizens to trace patterns of influenceCitizens are not able to access these reports online even though they areelectronically stored Poblete claims that the reports will be posted as soonas Congress resolves technical hurdles                           House Senate and Personal Financial Disclosure ReportsMembers must report how they spend their representational allowances and haveto file personal financial disclosure reports The disclosures can be used toferret out wrongdoing and conflicts of interest The data are computerized butfor policy reasons the reports are not available online Congress isreconsidering whether to post them according to Poblete            Five years agoSpeakerelect Newt Gingrich promised to make important information availableonline at the same moment that it is available to the highestpaid Washingtonlobbyist That did happen but only oncewhen Congress instantaneouslypublished the Starr Report  When it comes to its own dirty laundrythere seems to be no such hurry
