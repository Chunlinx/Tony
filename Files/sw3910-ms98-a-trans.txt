        how do you uh feel about the metric system     well uh i i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think itd be great that we went to it and uh the the one thing though that i think we should do if we go to the metric system then we should do away with the other system and and have only the metric system   well yeah ill tell you i was i was thinking about it while i was waiting for a connection   uhhuh   and i in my business i have to do conversions back and forth between  metric tons and uh then i converted into barrels and gallons and then i deal with long tons and so forth and so on and i will admit that it does make it uh   right yeah yeah yeah   uh perhaps a little bit cumbersome at the same time i dont know its one of the oddities one of the few things that are left you know is is as the world shrinks we become more and more homogenized everybody   yeah well thats true   yeah it seems to uh uh  you know it its like its like accents even you know theres not used to be theres a great variation across the US and now with television everybody is beginning to sound like uh a news uh announcer you know   yeah yeah yeah thats true youre right youre right theres no losing were losing our culture of our area uhhuh   and and the whole um i dont know it yeah but i i dont know i kind of got a soft spot in my uh my heart for feet and inches even though i i like i say in in my business i do have to uh to work around it   sure yeah yeah well i uh i work in a hospital and of course thats all we use and every and every thing we do is metric you know and uh you know weights is in kilograms and uh you know whatever whatever is whatever happens to be the thing that were measuring its in metric   yeah you know i think one of one of the reasons that ive got some hesitancy about doing it is that i still have a difficult time   and uh   i mean there are few  of pieces of the metric system that i can visualize okay i i ive gotten pretty good at at at you know i realize about that how long a a meter is   yeah yeah right right   okay but as far as you know and its uh ive kind of got the conversion of different parts of the metric system where im comfortable with it but im not with weights   yeah yeah   and and until i i i guess it would be something that if i had been uh uh a little more educated in it or forced into using it more i might be more comfortable with it   yeah yeah sure right well uh uh one one of the things that really i i really think it would be sort of weird is is the uh cars the miles per hour instead of having uh having kilometers um kilometers per hour   uhhuh   cause it its hard to imagine you know i well i think the problem with us our generation is that nobody even if we did go all the way to the metric system that were still going to think in terms of how it relates to the other system you know   well well sure itd take a new generation it would take a new generation to be just you know completely metric   no matter what you thats right thats right because its hard to its just like uh another language i guess   yeah i think youre right   and when you learn another language um i guess what you have to do is try to think in that language and not think in in terms of translating it to English you know but   yeah well  you know they try to in one of the in one of the parts of the question they ask you know just ask to ask us to discuss was uh uh why why the first attempt failed you know and i was thinking i dont i dont know i i dont really have a good answer for that other than i guess it was just that much uh uh resistance to change   yeah yeah i think so too and i think that uh that it was it was pretty much optional wasnt it at the time and and uh   thats true and and the other thing too theyre they were going to use both systems you know simultaneously   yeah thats right see thats why i think it is i think they used both systems and everybody as long as they had inches  they could just transpose back and forth and it made it difficult so everybody thought well this is too much trouble   right   but uh of course if you didnt have anything available but metrics i think itd be a little easier on you you know   yeah they didnt until uh  you know uh strawberries by anything but uh kilograms then you know rather than pounds   thats right thats right you youd you would just quit thinking you wouldnt worry about how many ounces is this you would just say well how many how many uh grams is it you know and   sure yeah and then and then you could you know people would start looking seeing a you know a quantity and they would say well hey that you know thats about that looks to be about two pounds and hey thats this much you know in metric so you know   yeah sure yeah yeah and its uh like weight you know i i weigh about a hundred and sixty five and thats i know somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy something kilograms you know and its its hard to imagine well only seventy something you feel like you dont weigh much you know     umhum umhum   but um i guess if thats the only thing you knew well you would just know well i weigh seventy something kilograms and thats it you know   yeah of course ive i do think theres always that theres still kind of a uh  i dont know a a romance if you will with the idea of a yard being the uh the link from the kings nose to the tip of his uh finger or you know   well thats true yeah i understand that its thats true thats very true thats very true     so i you know  and and that that and i i think i dont know then all these other old English stories that go back you know that with our uh with our system of measurement   yeah thats right   its funny that uh i guess all that started in England i guess all the measurement system of measurement and now uh were still using it and they are gone theyve left it you know and they use metrics there   yeah yeah although although although although there are
