                okay  uh where do you stand on gun control   was a loud one im against it   again your a one then   uhhuh   uhhuh i i uh your against gun control why why   yes you you cant enforce the laws you got why do you want to pass some more   thats a good thats a very good point very good point i personally i guess i would be a five they said pick a one to ten   uhhuh   uh because i im i think im dead smack in the middle i think that if there is going to be a ban on gun control that it should be enforced like you said and i feel like if there if if there is a band put upon us it wouldnt be a forced enforced just like um theres suppose to be working on a drug problem suppose be working on our education problems   uhhuh   things like that and those arent being enforced but at the same time i want to see people protect themselves because things like the drug the drug war is not is not helping and i feel like i have to protect myself when i go out somewhere because theres so many people theyre crazy people out there   thats correct i dont know how maybe thats i agree one hundred percent i just uh what irritates me i guess is that they keep wanting to pass gun control laws that do nothing but take away your your constitutional amendments   you know and so uhhuh   and that is that is really not gun control is not the problem   uhhuh   its the people using the guns   exactly   and all theyre doing is look at this new Brady Bill   uhhuh   the seven day waiting period that does not deter anybody who really that wants to buy a gun   uhhuh right   theres spots here in Austin   uhhuh   on Sixth Street to Eleventh east east of the interstate   uhhuh   and you stand in an alley down there and buy anything you want   wow   i mean you know and   uhhuh   whether you want guns drugs women anything uh   uhhuh yeah its just its just like the drugs i mean theyre legal   yeah   but you can get them anywhere if you want you can get it   true you can make two phone calls if you know if you know anybody here in town uh you can make two phone calls and have automatic weapons   uh that is a shame   the laws just you know its they cant enforce what they have you know and im not a big fan of Peter Jennings peculiarly   uhhuh uhhuh   but he was on one of the on the talk shows one time they had Kennedy on there and Brady Mrs Gonzalez and some of the other liberals but you know   uhhuh   and he he pulled this big stack of papers out that was about oh four feet tall and he said these are all the current gun laws you have the books if you cant enforce these why do you think you can pass another one and enforce it   exactly exactly   but uh the Brady Bill wont do anything but just make it harder for the people that are honest to buy one those those that are criminals which are the ones that are refusing guns in the first place uh theyre not going to walk in and buy one anyway   the reason i think im so cloudy on the issue is because i mean it it i want to protect myself but at the same time i dont want anyone to have a gun that could harm me you know what im saying   well uh the uh proper solution is education of the masses   and so uhhuh uhhuh   youve got to educate the people in in using the weapons   uhhuh exactly   and you know our forefathers you know everybody carried a gun here in Texas   uhhuh   you know for you know a couple of hundred years   right but everyone werent they werent going around killing each other   thats true unless of course there was you know   trouble yeah   sufficient sufficient provocation which we have basically the same something now its just that all the honest people you know the citizens as it were no longer carry guns to defend themselves because only only the criminals are   but do you think more and more people now are carrying guns and weapons   oh yeah   i mean just to im talking about the regular like   oh yeah uh i have a class license   Joe Blow on the street uhhuh   for firearms and a friend of mine owns a gun shop in   uhhuh uhhuh   and i go up and help him you know work in the store and stuff like that and it its amazing the number of people that are buying guns and the reason theyre buying them is they want to give their wife one to carry in the car with them   right   and that some of the woman will come in and theyll look around and theyll try and find a small one to fit inside their purse   right uhhuh i mean you you have to because i i mean i dont have a gun it just scares me to have one but i feel like that very soon im going to have to get one just because i would probably feel safer   and well if you get one you know   right now i have a knife under the seat in my car uh if im going anywhere at night anywhere i mean if im just stepping outside my door i carry something on me if im you know going up to my door and i dont have anything i put my keys in some kind of weapon like position in my hand you know   youre single i take it   im sorry   are you single i take it   yes yes i am i have a boyfriend but you know hes not always around   yeah okay yeah well my wife uh before we got married uh she didnt carry any sort of thing and uh   uhhuh   i ive got uh ive acquired you know her you know bought several that i give her to carry one of them she carries in her purse   uhhuh   and theres some in the car i i always have one in my truck when im driving any place   yes my boyfriend that that got me you know put the knives here and there and you know just different things and   you know knives or mace or something but uh you know   yeah and i have mace on my key chain i mean i have a lot of you know little things that but i dont i dont like to have to carry them you know uh but you have to   well its a sad state of affairs when have to but uh you know theyre are more and more homes getting broken into and everybody says well   yeah uhhuh   uh its because of guns no its not because of the guns its because of the people and and actually theyre breaking in   no no thats right   to the homes and and using weapons to buy drugs although you do have those that you know like the idiot who ran out and grabbed that AK and shot everybody up at the McDonalds in Calif ornia   thats right uhhuh uhhuh now thats just   you know that were talking about somebody whose crazy having a gun law is not going to stop him because hes going to find one   lunacy thats yeah hell find some other way whether its a gun or bomb or what   and uh yeah well you know California California Hawaii and New York state have these and uh now New Jersey had the stiffest gun laws   oh do they   oh yeah but you know where where are the most crimes committed New York state   yeah   as you know uh John Lennon was you know you know was shot and killed   uhhuh   in uh New York by a guy that bought a gun in Hawaii which has a tough gun law   uh uh uh   and you know i mean this clown out in uh California he uh had a criminal record you know a mile long   and still got a gun   but he still had not one but several   uhhuh   and there was one not too long ago but in the last six months uh he shot up that Allstate or or or that GMC credit place in Florida   right uhhuh   well he went out and bought six different guns   uh   you know and he had a criminal record   and i mean if you find if you offer a uh enough money to somebody theyll go get you a gun you know if your not eligible you know come to me offer me enough money ill go get you a gun you know theres probably a lot of people like that   oh yeah and there are people yeah theyre people doing that so i mean the the solution is not to pass more laws than you cant enforce because theyre theyre going to pass one now theyre trying too either the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill   yeah uhhuh umhum   either way they do it its going to cost you and me more money   right and not probably going to help too much   because and and and were going to increase the bureaucracy thats supposed to handle it and what are they going to do theyre going to punch your name in the computer and youre going to come up as no youre not a criminal and no and no you have no criminal record you know and yeah you can by gun   uhhuh   but that doesnt say that youre not going to walk outside and three days later shoot somebody   exactly   you know theres no substitute for people   a lot a lot of people that are in jail you know its their first shooting or why do people you know not everybody has shot someone before   oh yeah actually guns are not the prime uh weapon used in killing people in crimes of passion or whatever   uhhuh   its knives and baseball bats   uhhuh baseball bats   yeah   i didnt know that   oh yeah   i could see knives yeah stabbings and things   see you can walk down the street carrying a baseball bat and nobody thinks anything about it   uhhuh   you know and how many times have you seen people walking down the street carrying a baseball bat   uhhuh   you figure what little leaguers on their way to practice   yeah   they could be gang members just as easy if you   i didnt know baseball bats was like that   oh yeah its uh its quite a deal   uh   nobody pays attention to a baseball bat   uhhuh   you know and you you can see a baseball bat in the back of the car and nobody no cops going to give you a ticket for a baseball bat in the back of your car   thats a very deadly weapon   yeah so why you know   i mean one blow at that and   yeah or knives you can have knives everybodys got knives of course youre limited you know you cant have switchblades and stuff   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh uh you know guns are used but so is everything else   uhhuh   if youre going to ban that if youre going to band guns ive got an article in the Wall Street Journal where they had where they had uh used a satire where someone in New York had suggested all the guns because they were used for commission of drug regulated crimes   uhhuh   and they immediately decided well lets start banning the public telephones       bless you   im sorry   and they said well lets band the public telephones too because the public telephones are used in the commission of drug related crimes   very true   makes about as much sense   a lot of sense   but you know the to my way of thinking you know uh im a im you know i spilled blood on the ground you know for in the United States   uh umhum   and uh if if the United States does not trust me enough to have a gun after that then i dont trust them enough to govern me   right right   but im kind of radical on that i just you know   you sound like youre pretty strongly   well i i see too much of it and i see people come into the shop up there and you know and i buy guns and and they havent got the faintest idea what you are doing   yeah   you know and they want to buy a gun now i think there should be some sort of ID card that you carry   right what do you think about making some kind of application or something   theres an application you fill out now   do you okay   its a yellow form   uhhuh   but uh see thats its just another piece of paperwork it asks for your name your address and phone number and the county where you birth and all and you know and then theres a list of ten questions you answer and if you answer no to all of them that means youre a good American       you such um seriously and   yeah uh uh uh   its a little yellow form you fill out and it puts the name and the serial number the gun who bought it and the date like that and that stays in the gun shop and it never goes anywhere it stays right there weve got boxes full in the back room   uh well thats a lot of help   and and the only thing that its used for is if uh if Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms come down and does an inspection   uhhuh   they look through and if they look through and if they look through your legal logbook you have to log it down in and out well you got   and they probably really do that   and they and they dont come out very often   uhhuh   ive seen them once in about five years   oh my goodness   but they come down once
