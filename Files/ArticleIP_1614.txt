Democraticgubernatorial primary sent a trickle of voters in that state to the polls June This offyear contestbetween fourterm Rep Rob Andrews and twoterm stateSen Jim McGreeveygenerated little

But it is worth noting that  the clips take on Ciba notMcGreevey and  they are more tentative than the context would suggest Oneheadline merely places Ciba at the storms center another notes that

The day after the first primary debate where Andrews had raisedthe CibaMcGreevey issue McGreevey issued a statement saying that he had infact drafted compromise amendments that broke the logjam and allowed the banon ocean discharges to be written into law Detractors have pointed out thatthe only significant amendment to the bill ended up delaying the pipelinesclosure by a year Determined to establish his distance from the Ciba issueMcGreevey has cited newspaper reports in which major players on the bill saythey have no memory of his involvement But his protests seem to have hadlittle

the toxins released bythe chemical industry His initiative notwithstanding he has come under firefor letting the Whitman administration undermine what the Pollution PreventionAct sought to achieve Clearly there was time yet for a hundred indecisionsand for a hundred visions and revisionsand alas it isnt Andrews who gets totake the toast and tea Shore Revised ends with the ubiquitous shot ofthe politician with his family and the ubiquitous spiel about him fighting forhis family and yours The fight was in vain as it turned out Andrews lostDoes that mean the spot failed It was a classic play on a hotbutton issueand it fell just short Making the case against McGreevey in the broadest andbarest terms its message never quite landed                           RobertShrum
