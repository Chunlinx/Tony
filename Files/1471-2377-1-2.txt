                    Introduction        Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United        States after heart disease and cancer and the leading        cause of adult disability  In  Matchar and Duncan          claimed that each year there are   strokes in        the US causing  deaths and leaving         survivors disabled The         Heart and Stroke Statistical Update           of the American Heart Association   states        that   Americans suffer a firstever or recurrent        stroke each year All three reports were based on the        predominately white cohort study of Framingham        Massachusetts In  Broderick et al   hypothesized        that the figure of approximately half a million strokes        substantially underestimates the actual annual stroke        burden for the United States They claimed that there were        at least  firstever or recurrent strokes during          This estimate was derived by extrapolating from        firstever strokes among whites in the Rochester Minnesota        Stroke Study The          Heart and Stroke Statistical Update          of the American Heart Association adjusted their        estimate to   firstever or recurrent strokes each        year in the US        Populationbased stroke incidence studies such as those        from Framingham Massachusetts and Rochester Minnesota        have substantially increased the knowledge about stroke        trends subtypes risk factors and incidence rates in both        men and women However these studies were conducted among        predominately white populations Recently epidemiological        studies have been focusing on differences in stroke        incidence between racialethnic groups Of particular        interest are rates for blacks however there is little        data regarding stroke risk in Hispanics or Asians Recent        data from Northern Manhattan suggest that blacks are not        alone in the higher risk category and that Hispanics also        appear to be at greater risk than whites         In order to get a more accurate estimate of occurrences        of stroke in the US Williams et al   estimated the         incidence occurrence and characteristics of total stroke        based on a large administrative claims database        representative of all  US inpatient discharges They        conservatively claimed that there were   firstever        or recurrent strokes during         The primary goal of this paper was to replicate the        recent estimates of Broderick et al   and Williams et        al   and to examine the trend from  to  This        was accomplished by use of a large administrative claims        database representing a  representative sample of all         US inpatient discharges The administrative database        was supplemented by appropriate adjustments for the         International Classification of Diseases        th Revision Clinical Modification ICDCM codes         derived by Williams et al   to correct for some        of the inaccuracies of the diagnostic codes                    Subjects and Methods                  Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database          This study employed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample          NIS of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project          HCUP release  which is a large administrative claims          database that is a  representative sample of all           US inpatient discharges The fifth release of the NIS          contains  million discharges from a sample of           hospitals covering  geographically dispersed states          Compared to the fourth release  the fifth release          uses  fewer hospitals and contains  million fewer          discharges Similar to those of the fourth release these          data also represent a  stratified sample of all US          inpatient discharges Stratification variables included          region control location teaching status and bedsize          The software program SUDAAN   was used to convert raw          counts generated from the NIS database into weighted          counts that represent national estimates          Inpatient records included clinical and resource use          information typically available from discharge abstracts          The NIS database includes most commonly used data          elements patient demographics admission source          principal and secondary diagnoses and procedures          expected primary source of payment discharge status          hospital and discharge weights length of stay and total          charges                          Data Analysis          We only used the first code reported to avoid double          counting those patients with more than one reported          ICDCM code  to  at discharge To obtain the          estimated number of stroke cases by ICDCM code we          multiplied the number of patients with each ICDCM code          by its estimated positive predictive value PPV for          stroke  The total number of hospital strokes was          calculated by summing across codes A  confidence          interval was computed by utilizing Monte Carlo simulation          techniques   ie the PPV distribution for each          code was simulated by using  iterations of a          binomial distribution whose parameters were obtained by          pooling data from four published ICD stroke validation          studies               Technically an incidence rate should include only the          first episode of the disease being studied However          because this database does not distinguish between          firstever and recurrent strokes total stroke          firstever and recurrent rates and occurrences were          reported Stroke firstever incidence rates were          estimated by reducing the total stroke rates by the          expected number of recurrent strokes The limited data          from populationbased cohorts suggest that  to  of          strokes are recurrent    Age and          sexstandardized and stratified incidence rates of total          stroke were also estimated These were estimated by using          the  US census population figures                           Nonhospital stroke          Even though ICDCM principal and secondary diagnosis          codes  to  provide virtually complete ascertainment          of hospital strokes not all stroke patients are          hospitalized Two populationbased stroke incidence          studies    reported that the proportion of          patients with stroke without hospitalization nonhospital          strokes was  and  respectively          Therefore to estimate the total number of strokes          hospital and nonhospital an appropriate adjustment was          made in the analysis This adjustment conservatively          assumed that  of strokes were nonhospital strokes          This was a simple mean of the proportions published in          two stroke studies  and  Several international          studies of westernized countries have reported          proportions ranging from  to   The two          published US proportions  and  were also used in a          sensitivity analysis                            Results        The  results were compared to those of    in        parentheses The NIS database contained          patient discharges with a principal or secondary first        code reported diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease This        was extrapolated to   patient        discharges in the United States Table uses the ICD        codespecific pooled PPVs   to adjust for false        positives and reports that there were          hospital strokes in the United States with a         confidence interval of   to          We believe that at least          additional strokes were nonhospital strokes  of the        total occurrences of stroke We thus estimate that there        were over   incident and recurrent strokes        in the United States in   The sensitivity        analysis on the nonhospital stroke rate produced a range        from   to          Of the estimated   hospital strokes          or   were subarachnoid        hemorrhages   or   were        intracerebral hemorrhages and the remaining          or   were ischemic strokes        The overall incidence rate for total stroke firstever        and recurrent was   per  population age        and sexadjusted to the   US population The        average annual age and sexadjusted incidence rate for        firstever stroke was estimated to be   per         Total stroke incidence rates increased        exponentially with age for both men and women In addition        men had higher agespecific total stroke incidence rates        than did women as illustrated in Figure         Table reports demographic and clinical characteristics        of the stroke patients by ICDCM code The mean age of        all patients with stroke was   years          were male   were white and   of the        patients died during the hospitalization A        disproportionately low percentage of patients with        subarachnoid hemorrhage were male   versus          and as expected the patients with subarachnoid        hemorrhage were much younger than the average stroke        patient   versus   years The        inpatient mortality rates for subarachnoid and        intracerebral hemorrhages were significantly higher than        for the overall stroke population at   and          respectively A surprisingly high percentage of        ICDCM code  patients were male   versus          and most code  patients were white                 Table also presents data on resource utilization For        the index hospitalization the stroke patient population        had a mean length of stay of   days median           days and a mean total charge of   median          Patients with subarachnoid and        intracerebral hemorrhages had much longer length of stays        averaging   and   days respectively        Their mean total charges were also higher at          and   respectively The majority        of stroke patients had a routine discharge or were        discharged to a skilled nursing facility with rates of          and   respectively                    Discussion        Williams et al   estimated that there were         firstever or recurrent strokes in  We conservatively        estimate that there were  firstever or recurrent        strokes in  The   increase in firstever        or recurrent strokes may be due to chance but it is        probably due to the population gain  in         versus  in  a  increase and the        increase in aging   years old population from  to          in  versus  in  a         increase  The aging population effect is more        pronounced in the group aged  years who are at greater        risk of stroke  in  versus  in         a  increase  We also estimate that American        hospitals charged  billion for stroke treatment and        management during  which translates to a society cost        of approximately  billion        It is worthwhile to notice the remarkable consistency in        stroke patient characteristics between  and  as        shown in Table  The length of stay however was shorter        in  than in  for stroke patients although the        total charge was higher in  than in  It may be due        to a combination of inflation and inpatient healthcare        practice changes or healthcare reimbursement regulation        changes        The present study may be associated with several        limitations First the validity of conclusions drawn from        analyses of large administrative databases depends on the        accuracy of casedefining diagnostic codes Therefore the        validity of the present study is highly dependent on the        accuracy of the positive predictive values of the ICDCM        codes which has been addressed         The impact of the uncertainty in the PPV pooled        estimates was examined by constructing a  confidence        interval around the number of hospital strokes The bounds        of this confidence interval were tight          indicating that the point estimate had reasonable        precision        Another limitation of the present study is the lack of        documented information on the rate of nonhospital stroke        Additional data are needed to produce a more reliable        estimate of the proportion of strokes without        hospitalization By intentionally choosing a low        percentage we were confident that our estimate of the        total annual stroke burden was not inflated We used        sensitivity analyses to illustrate the potential impact of        a different true percentage In addition racespecific        information was not available which limited our ability to        adjust for race        The methodology used in the present study was the same        as the one used in Williams et al   but different from        other studies published on the incidence occurrence and        characteristics of stroke All those studies used        stateoftheart stroke registries based in relatively        small geographical areas Framingham Massachusetts        Rochester Minnesota Rochester New York Northern        Manhattan New York Greater CincinnatiNorthern Kentucky        Our approach might have slightly reduced internal validity        but it should have far greater external validity although        this might be somewhat compromised by the reduced internal        validity        In summary this study supports the findings of        Broderick et al   and Williams et al   by        conservatively estimating that there are approximately        threequarters of a million strokes each year In addition        we observed that there is a slight increase although not        statistically significant in occurrences of stroke from         to  This is likely due to a combination of the        population gain and the aging of the population from         to         In conclusion stroke is a significant problem in the        United States The importance of preventive measures for a        disease that has identifiable and modifiable risk factors        must be emphasized The reduction of morbidity and        mortality among stroke patients must remain a public health        priority                    Competing interests        None declared
