                well um so um have do you have a son or daughter thats looking for a college   uh been through it   ah im still in it   okay  no weve uh weve had two children graduate so and i have worked at universities   uhhuh   so it was a topic that uh seemed appropriate as far as discussion like this   right   you had youre in the process of planning for or your children are there   no im im im im still in college im still a student   oh okay okay all right   im graduating this May yeah   this May well good where are you   uh North Carolina State University   very good uh uh the uh planning for college tuition and all the associated costs is a tough tough decision  at   yeah yeah i think its its when youre looking for a college that you want to go i think you really should know exactly what you want to be so you can pick the best quality   how did you choose North Carolina State   i chose it basically that way uh North Carolina State has a reputation for being uh good agricultural school   umhum its a land grant university right   in the area exactly and um they have a good extension service for agriculture and uh i wanted to go into agriculture so i came here   yeah   and since since i was in you know instate i pay resident i pay resident tuition so it was also a it was also good for me because you know being a good school plus instate tuition saved me a lot of money   the oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area theres sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but uh theres as many   right well for example yeah yeah i i think thats very true because for example uh im going to graduate school after i finish here and uh im going to go to California   to stay in the same area yeah uh two reasons for that i think if they even recommend in advanced degrees to uh try a different set of teachers get a different perspective as far as the the advanced degrees theyd like for you to change rather than stay in the same institution   thats true   yeah   yeah i mean they would like for you to stay so that you know they they could keep getting your money but one you know an employer likes to see different schools i think   right umhum and i and i think a very good advisor would uh tell you that its best for you anyway to get a different uh different set of instructors on it and a little different outlook and plus there are regional differences i think too California may have a different type of emphasis now agriculture changes by region as far as its emphasis is concerned middle of the country would be wheat land here its tobacco and uh California it may be   right   uh more of the grapes and and uh other types of   right they have in California they have a lot of heavy metal problems also and a lot of salts because of the valleys very very salty   oh yes right   thats what i i was interested when i went over there i i uh talked to some people in the university i think also you know um dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions because i think thats what really turned me towards that you know the the school that im going to is i went and talked to the people in the school and they gave me information which i could not have gotten otherwise and that that really finalized my decision   umhum yeah what is your specialty   well im graduating with just a soil science degree here in North Carolina but i hopefully will go to California to receive a PhD in uh soil science with a specialization in environmental  environmental quality   uhhuh   which will deal with uh ecotoxicology heavy metals and soils and things like that so away from the production agriculture end of it and more into the soils and you know contaminants   umhum umhum   so im kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is going to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled   no question   and how to how to remediate them and all   no question you im sure you you and your classmates have been following the uh waste situation in North Carolina and the the absence or facility to handle   right especially in the sounds   right and its its a universal problem you know if you look at uh some countries you expect them to have problems Latin America now with cholera and and a bunch of other problems associated with   umhum   waste management the United States you can expect more out of but we still have the same very deep problem of how to take care of our waste we create a bunch now now what do we do with it   yeah now that now that its getting harder to get permits for landfills uh the the problems pressing down harder than ever   yeah and then i think theres a a big mistrust public mistrust as there is with nuclear energy uh they were talking about Chernobyl again this this week because its an anniversary but i think theres a big mistrust of uh some of the waste management companies in terms of how well they do take care of their product and thats got to be solved i think there has to be public trust in it before you can   yes uh i agree with you   find a good sight well i wish you luck in California   yeah uh thanks a lot it was nice talking to you all right bye   okay same here bye
