                     This is the story of how I met my husband         Its kind of like a Brady Bunch story         I was the lady with the two daughters and he was the man with the two sons         We had each been divorced for a while and we each were too busy to do any dating or meeting of perspective mates         So my daughter Michaela had a group of friends affectionately called The Quail Girls and his son Ryan had a group of friends I wont tell you what wed name them but anyway they were normal high school seniors and both of the children were seniors at South Mecklenburg High School at the same time         And the boys and girls interacted a lot they were uh they were all friends         One of the girls in Michaelas group Shelle just got an inspiration one day when she was staring out a window riding down the road and she said Chaela         We need to get your mom to meet Ryan Speckmans dad         And Michaela said Really         Cause she was of course very protective of her mom         So finally Michaela said Well maybe that will work         And all of the other girls are saying Yeah yeah yeah         So that was when the idea was born         And for the next few months Michaela kept saying You know Mom you need to meet Mr Speckman         And I said Now why do I need to meet Mr Speckman         Well you need to meet Mr Speckman because hes single and all he has time for is his job and the boys         Hes really cute and hes a really nice guy and hes real involved with the kids         I said Well if he is really cute and hes a really nice guy then Im sure that hes got a girlfriend         And she said No no no         I know he doesnt         I just know he doesnt because the girls say he doesnt and he never goes to the games with anybody and you need to meet Mr Speckman         So I said All right whatever         Ill meet Mr Speckman         So then I would forget about it and the girls would come over and they would say Ms Quinn you need to meet Mr Speckman         And Im like Yeah yeah yeah         Ill meet Mr Speckman         So um a soccer game would come up because the boys played soccer the Speckman boys played soccer         Michaela would say How about it         Can you go to the soccer game on Thursday night         And I had an evening job and I would say Well no I cant go Thursday         So then a few more games would go by um I could go to the game but she couldnt go to the game and next time she could go to the game then I couldnt go to the game and she would say Well Mr Speckman wasnt there anyway         So this fixture in our house became this Mr Speckman person         So um there was at the end of the sports season the fall sport season and the spring sport season at South Mecklenburg there was always a what they called a banquet and they didnt serve any food but for some reason they called it a banquet         They had all the children the students from the fall sports up on the stage to be introduced get whatever recognition were appropriate and um there was going to be one in early December of          And uh that was when it was decided since I was going to be there because Michaela played tennis in the fall and Mr Speckman was going to be there since Ryan and Eric played soccer in the fall that was when this meeting would take place         So in order to make sure that I would be there one of the Quail Girls who lived right around the corner from the Speckmans said she would come and she would pick me up         Michaela couldnt drive me because she had to be there early to be in this program         So Michaela helped me pick out what I was supposed to wear and uh Wendy came to pick me up         And you have to understand Wendy is this shes a wonderful girl but shes kind of a silly girl         Shes always like Ha uh ha uh         So Wendy came to pick me up and I was all nervous and everything which was ridiculous         I was I felt like a high school girl myself         And um when we got there uh we s sat with Wendys parents who again live around the corner from Mr Speckman         They said this is uh Wendys mother said to me Oh         Youre going to meet John Speckman         Whew         I hope this works out         Youve got good taste         Im like Oh boy         What am I getting myself into         So Wendy and I sat down and were just kind you know of chatting         Shes squirming and looking all around and everything and the program started and its quiet and all of a sudden she says There he is         Right over there right over there         I said Sssh         So anyway I got I got a chance to take a look at Mr Speckman and um he looked just like Michaela had described so through the whole thing I kind of did an analysis of you know do I or do I not want to meet Mr Speckman         And if I do you know         Basically do I or dont I want to meet Mr Speckman but I felt like I would let Michaela and all of the girls down if I did not         So after the program was over Michaela came down off the stage         And she came and uh came with me to the little lobby of the auditorium where they were serving food         So all the Quail Girls and I were together and we were having punch and cake or whatever and the guys and Mr Speckman were over kind of in another area         So uh you know Wendy was saying How are we going to do this         How are we going to do this         And I said Well you know if it happens it happens         If it doesnt happen Ill Ill you know it can happen at another time Im sure         Well be in the same place another time because minutes went by and nothing happened         So I said to Michaela after about five or  more minutes You know maybe this isnt the right time         Lets just leave and and you know Ill Ill just meet him another time         And all of a sudden I got this tap on the shoulder and I turned around and I looked up into the eyes of this high school boy and it was Ryan Speckman         And he said Dont you want to meet him         And I fell in love with Ryan Speckman first and I said Well sure         So he went and he got him and I walked in that direction and Mr Speckman came over and said Hi         You must be Ms Quinn         And I said You must be Mr Speckman         So we introduced each other and had a few awkward moments and then we left         So the next th OK that was the Monday of Thanksgiving week so I had to work the day after Thanksgiving in the medical clinic where I worked and it was a crazy crazy crazy day and Michaela called me in the middle of the day this was on a Friday and she said Guess who called and left a message         And I said Who         And she said Mr Speckman         And I said Youre kidding         And she said Are you going to call him         Are you going to call him         Are you going to call him         So I said Yeah Ill call him         So I went home that night called him left him a message he wasnt there         So a couple of days later I get home from work again in the evening and there was a message that said Call me back whatever time         So I called him back and we arranged to have dinner on that following Friday         So I called and talked to Michaela and I said Well were going out to eat         And she said I knew it         I knew it         I knew it         Ryan came up to me at school and he said He called her         I think theyre going to go out           And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryans group crossed the serving line and said He called her and hes going to ask her out         So everybody knew before I knew that he called me and was going to ask me out         So Friday came and we were supposed to go out         I came home from work so there was a message and on the voice mail was Shelle the girl who had this brainstorm to begin with and she said Hi         This is Shelle         Just wanted to tell you good luck tonight         Dont be nervous         Youll be fine         And Im like Im old enough to be your mother Im sure Ill be fine         So everybodys eager to find out whats happening on this date         So um Michaela was going out and I had instructions to call her as soon as I got home to beep her as soon as I got home so we could discuss the date         So we went out to dinner at a place where Mr Speckman had asked one of his sons friends where we should go and he said thats where we should go and so we went there to eat         And the whole evening was talk the discussion the whole evening was how all the preparation and all the discussion that was going on with me and the Quail Girls was also going on with John and with all Ryans friends         And they had cleaned out the car they called him at work and made sure that he was there in time for the date so I mean we had a lovely evening lovely evening         And um just talked about how funny it was that these kids were trying to to make us meet         So the next day um Michaela yeah I called Michaela and she said What did you think         What did you think         I said You know hes a very nice man but he is so busy with his business and with his two boys that I dont even think hes even got time for another date but he he is very nice         But if he asked me out again Id probably go out again         So this was Friday night early so the next day I went out and I bought a Christmas tree and I had a lot of errands to do         In the afternoon Mr Speckman calls and said Really had a good time last night         I said I did too         It really was fun         He said Id like to do it again sometime         And I said Yeah I would too         So were talking some more and I said I went and got a Christmas tree         He said What are you going to do this evening         I said Ill probably put the Christmas tree up         He said You know I would really like to go to McAdenville         So anyway I said Cool         You want to go to McAdenville well go to McAdenville         So Michaela came home and I said Guess what         Im going to McAdenville         And she said Oh my God         She called Shelle  Shelle was at the house in five minutes         I cant believe it shes going out with him again         Youre going out with him again         So we went out again and we went out the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday and meanwhile all the kids at school are in absolute shock that we liked each other and we were going out I dont know what they expected         And one friend of Ryans Brandon said to Michaela one day Wouldnt it be weird if your mom and Mr Speckman got married         And like you moved into that house and you were taking a shower and Ryan Ryans your stepbrother and hes going to knock on the ba how weird would that be         Michaela told me that and I said That is so weird         She said That is so weird         Well it wasnt long before um probably a month or two later she said to me Mom hes wonderful         Would you ask him to marry us         Anyway to make a long story short about we met in December of          February of  he asked me to marry No         February of  he asked me to marry him         June of  we got married and our wedding party was the Quinn girls and the Speckman boys and the guest list was the Quail Girls and all of Ryans friends and they all lived happily ever after
