how sterile and subwayesque Not for him thecherryblossom viewings and golden pavilions of Yukio Mishima the monarchistwho disemboweled himself in  No nostalgic ramblings only details thatoverrun the canvas and add up to nothing A bestselling author in his countryMurakamis most recent work before WindUp was Underground  amammoth exploration of the Aum Shinrikyo cults sarin gas attacks on the Tokyosubway Away at Princeton when they occurred he returned to examine Japansfascination with the cult and its tubby halfblind leader Undergrounddescribes a nation bored and isolated by its successes and its failures alikeWindUp fictionalizes that worldbut barely and to less effect            Rootless and lonely Toru Okada plods across hisstrenuously postmodern space Until that is his spaghetticookingRossinihumming contentment is dissolved by the sudden departure of first hiscat and then his wife of six years Noburu Wataya the cat returns abouthalfway through the novel of Kumiko the wife one is less sure She works ata health magazine whose strange hours screen her infidelities from animprobably credulous spouse Leaving as if for work one morning she does notreturn She picks up her dry cleaning the following day however andeventually writes him a letter in which she recounts earthshattering orgasmswith other men Im sorry to have to tell you this but the fact is that I wasnever able to have true sexual pleasure with you            Toruslife disintegrates following Kumikos departure Obsessed with finding her hetakes off on a cinematic odyssey that collapses time and space Murakami laysseveral plot lines and both consummate miniaturist and committed pessimistappears to develop each carefully while keeping the mix unstable And so thepressure builds Toru reaches out to a pair of allegedly clairvoyant sistersas it turns out to little result beyond a few crepuscular couplings that mayor may not be real He meets a veteran whose wartime experiences allowMurakami to play antiimperialist Torus conversations with the lieutenantyield an enduring image a dry well whose dark silences facilitate thought andforce people to confront their demons Torus suburban alley offers convenientaccess to such a well and into its clichd dankness he descends my bodybegan to lose its density and weight  my mind was dragging my body into itsown territory It is the perfect birth canal a magical antienvironment thatboth suspends and exaggerates all sensation For Murakamis reader it conjuresup the excitement and terror the white hots and the blue colds of childhoodtreks through a storm sewer system For Toru who is drawn back to itrepeatedly it is simultaneously prison and release It makes him face hisdeepest fears which puddle up in a stigmatic stain on his right cheek thenallows him osmotic and healing passage to other worlds and narrativesMysteriously transported from the well to a mysterious Room  in a Tokyohotel he taps into a labyrinth of stories that eventually reconnects him withhumanity            Murakamis fiction before WindUp wasless ambitious in scale and makes a compelling case for his return to a smallercanvas He is a good reporter well read well traveled and keeneyed Allthis makes for good documentary and great short stories His book about thecult sticks with the conventions of storytelling and delivers emotionanalysis and narrative the manysplendored tales that interpolate Torusstory find Murakami at his most engaging Each plot is painstakingly tooledgenerates momentum and invites you to share            But look at the whole andWindUp confirms the Norman Mailer principle The birth of a greatjournalist is often paralleled by the death of a novelist Murakami lets thenarrative lines so carefully laid snap youre suspended midair your tenderattentions scattered to the winds You gulp tell yourself you can transcendthe Aristotelian unities and would move on if Murakami allowed you to But hedoes not In what is either a belated acknowledgment of your investmentandhis ownor less likely a more directly subversive move he starts reeling inthe lines about  pages from the end The obvious is manfully recapped thebows tied in tweet tidy trills Cinnamons grandfather the namelessveterinarian and I had a number of unusual things in commona mark on theface a baseball bat the cry of the windup bird And then there was thelieutenant who appeared in Cinnamons story he reminded me of LieutenantMamiya the war veteran And shortly thereafter Everything was intertwinedwith the complexity of a threedimensional puzzlea puzzle in which truth wasnot necessarily fact and fact not necessarily truth            Back in Room  a few pagesbefore the novels conclusion Toru encounters a woman on the bed Ping goes the call button in his head I think you are Kumiko Because then allkinds of story lines work out Im tempted to give Murakami the benefit of thedoubtto say even that his pat machinations force his readers into his crowdof woundup dolls of whom most died remember plunging over the edge of thetable But Ill settle for this Murakamis story ran away with him Toolittle too late his impulse to tidy resolution testifies more to hisdiscomfort with an expanded canvas than to his plugandsocket skills
