                                 The Sorry State of International Disaster Relief            The Turkish earthquake of August  and its disastrously bungled reliefeffortthe official death toll now stands at  is adepressingly familiar story Why is the world unable to create an internationalforce to provide manpower and equipment to assist in the aftermath of hugenatural and manmade disasters which seem to occur pretty reliably at leastfive or six times a year This extremely sensible idea was floated by theNew Republic  which attached to the hypothetical force the memorablename Griefbusters in a series of editorials from the mids to the earlys But for some mysterious reason nobody seemed terribly interested            According to an editorial in todays Christian Science Monitor  the United Nations is doing abetter job of coordinating the grabbag of relief efforts public and privatefrom all over the world than it used to thanks to its new Office for theCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA which apparently took overmany duties of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief CoordinatorUNDRO UNDROs record wasnt especially good According to theMonitor  the UN has learned from past attempts that its best role indisaster scenes is to pool the efforts of national governments not to do thework itself OCHA says the Monitor  has a realistic mandate ButChatterbox isnt aware that the creation of a Griefbusterstype force has everbeen tried Clearly whatever small improvements the United Nations has made ininternational coordination didnt prevent the Turkish government from tellingmany foreign rescue workers to leave even before yearold Ismail Cimen waspulled out alive from under a collapsed balcony yesterday German JapaneseBritish and Austrian rescuers had gone home Meanwhile according toyesterdays Toronto Globe and Mail  a Canadian team of  soldiers wasbeing told by some Turkish officials that the field hospital andwaterpurification systems it had brought were needed and by other Turkishofficials that they were not Exaggerated deference to an incompetent Turkishgovernment doesnt strike Chatterbox as the way to go            The original New Republic Griefbusters editorial published afterMexico Citys disastrous  earthquake said                                             A flexible rapid deployment force would report to a single director Moreimportant it would know what each kind of disaster called for and wouldeither possess or have immediate access to the basic required equipment Theforce could employ a semimilitary structure with reservists from membernations who could be called up at a moments notice  If we made a prioragreement with other nations promising to help each other in case of disasterthe burden would be to refuse aid rather than to ask for it                                       The editorial expressed a preference for limiting the disasterrelief forceto US allies working under US control In a later editorial the NewRepublic proposed UN control rightly pointing out that howeverproblematic the UN remains politically it ought to be able to function on ahumanitarian level Either way is fine with Chatterbox            The pathetic state of international disaster reliefarguably the UnitedNations is better at peacekeeping  which isnt saying muchcalls tomind Lytton Stracheys description in Eminent Victorians  of the anarchy with whichFlorence Nightingale was confronted when she set out to help wounded Britishsoldiers in Crimea As Strachey makes clear Nightingales fake lady with thelamp image as the mother of modern nursing completely obscures her realsignificance which was as a ruthlessly effective administrative reformerfirst of a single military hospital and later of the entire Britishmilitaryhospital system But in Nightingales time the British military atleast had the excuse that the age of modern medicine with its emphasis onsterility and proper ventilation of hospital rooms was only just dawningWhats our excuse
