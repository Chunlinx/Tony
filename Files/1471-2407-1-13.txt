                    Introduction        Conventional cancer incidence rates contain new cases of        the disease for a given year in the numerator and the        midyear population in the denominator     However        this rate is potentially problematic for those cancers in        which the denominator includes cases not atrisk of        developing the disease     For example a large portion        of the female population will undergo a hysterectomy in        their lifetime       removing them from being at risk        of developing corpus uterine cancer In addition a woman        with cancer of the corpus uterine is very unlikely to be        diagnosed with the disease a second time     Hence        these women should be removed from the atrisk population        in the rate calculation        In the mid s Lyon and Gardner presented a method        for obtaining hysterectomy prevalence and applied it to        uterine cancers in order to produce corrected incidence and        mortality rates     The approach used the prevalence of        hysterectomy as determined by the United States Health        Examination Survey of      and a cohort model        population applied to the  United States female        population This population was corrected over time by        hysterectomy rates obtained from the National Hospital        Discharge Survey a survey providing annual probability        samples of hospital discharges from nonfederal shortstay        hospitals     A more recent study provided corrected        uterine cancer rates for the United States by applying the        method proposed by Lyon and Gardner and using hysterectomy        rates from the National Hospital Discharge Survey through                    Two other methods may be used to obtain hysterectomy        prevalence estimates that have an advantage in that they do        not require several years of followup data to obtain        hysterectomy prevalence estimates The first involves        calculating hysterectomy prevalence estimates by applying        crosssectional hysterectomy incidence and allcause        mortality data to single and doubledecrement life tables            However this approach may be limited by trends in        the data A second approach obtains prevalence estimates        directly from responses to crosssectional survey data An        advantage of this method is that it does not require        complicated modeling but it may be limited by potential        biases that affect selfreported survey data        The purpose of this paper is to describe these two        methods for correcting corpus uterine cancer incidence        rates and probabilities The methods yield estimates of the        proportion of the population at risk for developing the        disease and correct the incidence rates and probabilities        accordingly Although the focus is on corpus uterine        cancer the same methods may be applied to other cancers of        the female genital system such as of the cervix uteri or        ovaries                    Materials and Methods                  Method  Lifetable method of estimating          hysterectomy prevalence          A singledecrement life table was used to calculate          the proportion            p                       x             of a hypothetical cohort of  million newborns          alive at the beginning of age interval           x when exposed to the          crosssectional hazard of death from all causes From a          multipledecrement life table the proportion            p                       x             of a hypothetical cohort of newborns alive and at          risk of the disease at the beginning of age interval           x is calculated based on their          chance of having undergone a hysterectomy having been          diagnosed with the disease or dying of any cause Women          having undergone a hysterectomy or previously diagnosed          with corpus cancer without having had a hysterectomy are          assumed to reflect those not at risk of developing the          disease The prevalence of having undergone a          hysterectomy or having been previously diagnosed with          corpus uterine cancer minus those having had a          hysterectomy is calculated as           P                       x                        p                       x                       p                       x                      Estimates derived from the life tables represent the          prevalence that would be observed if a cohort of          individuals were exposed to the current hysterectomy          corpus uterine minus those having had a hysterectomy          and allcause mortality rates over their entire          lifetime                          Method  Crosssectional survey method for          estimating hysterectomy prevalence          The status of an individual with respect to the          presence or absence of a disease or healthrelated event          may be obtained through assessment at a given point in          time There are national and international surveys that          track the disease and health status of people in the          population For example the Behavior Risk Factor          Surveillance System BRFSS collects information about          womens health issues such as pregnancy and          hysterectomy A question that asks whether a woman has          ever had a hysterectomy along with solicitation of the          womans current age indicates the prevalent proportion          of women who have had a hysterectomy by a certain          age                          Corrected denominators in the cancer rate          calculation          In order to correct the denominator in the rate          calculation of corpus uterine cancer we need to alter          the population so that it reflects women at risk of          developing the disease We assume that a woman is at risk          of developing corpus uterine cancer if she has not          already been diagnosed with the disease or has had her          uterus removed because of a hysterectomy The majority of          women who are diagnosed with corpus uterine cancer are          treated with a hysterectomy The percentage of corpus          uterine cancer cases that underwent a hysterectomy          between  was  overall  for ages            for ages  and  for ages  and older              Thus the prevalence            P                       x             derived using the lifetable method involves the          agespecific number of hysterectomies plus women          diagnosed with corpus uterine cancer who did not undergo          a hysterectomy ie not at risk In the survey method          the agespecific rate of women not at risk of corpus          uterine cancer divided by the agespecific rate of women          having undergone a hysterectomy provided an index which          was multiplied by the agespecific hysterectomy          prevalence obtained from the BRFSS to get an estimate of          prevalent proportion of women not at risk of corpus          uterine cancers                          Corrected incidence rates of cancers of the corpus          uterine          Conventional cancer incidence rates are derived as           R                       x                       C                       x                       L                       x             where           C                       x            is the agespecific number of cancer cases and           L                       x            is the midyear population from crosssectional          census dat Corrected rates are derived as                    for x                                  Lifetime and ageconditional probability          estimates          Lifetime and ageconditional probability risk          estimates of being diagnosed with cancer are derived          using lifetable methods Conventional lifetime and          ageconditional probability estimates of being diagnosed          with cancer are corrected for the prevalence of the          cancer This involves multiplying the cancer incidence          rate used in the computation of the probability estimates          by           p                       x                       p                       x                        P                       x             The two methods for obtaining           P                       x            are described above A complete description of the          method for deriving lifetime and ageconditional          probability estimates of being diagnosed with cancer is          given elsewhere     Probability estimates of          developing cancer are reported across the age span and          interpreted as the probability that the average child          born today will be diagnosed with the disease by age           x  This statistic assumes that the          current rates upon which the probability estimates are          based will remain constant over the childs lifetime          Given that current rates are unlikely to remain constant          over an extended period of time and that persons are          more likely interested in their chance of developing the          cancer from their current ages onward shortterm          ageconditional probability estimates are perhaps more          relevant     Both types of probability estimates are          reported in this paper                          Diagnostic and procedure codes          The Utah Cancer Registry identifies cancer using the          International Classification of Disease Second Edition          ICD     Invasive cancers of the corpus uteri          and other uterus not

incidence rates prevalence proportions and          invasive cancer incidence rates and probabilities Three          years of data were considered in order to provide more          stable estimates

   survey method                    Discussion        This paper presents two methods for obtaining corrected        corpus uterine cancer incidence rates and probabilities In        the lifetable method hysterectomy or corpus uterine        cancer prevalence estimates were derived from        crosssectional hysterectomy corpus uterine and allcause        mortality data applied to life tables In the survey        method hysterectomy prevalence estimates were obtained        directly from BRFSS data The purpose of the correction was        to adjust the population values used in the calculations in        order to reflect the atrisk population for developing        corpus uterine cancer        Both methods have the advantage that several years of        followup data are not required to determine the atrisk        population Hence for areas of the world that do not have        sufficient years of hysterectomy or cancer data to directly        compute prevalence corrected rates and probabilities can        still be obtained However the lifetable method is        limited by trends in the data Because the hysterectomy        rates were lower in  than in previous years the        prevalence estimates based on these years underestimated        the prevalence of this procedure Use of the higher        incidence rates in  produced higher hysterectomy        prevalence estimates across the age span However        prevalence based on these rates may also have been        underestimated at least through ages  as suggested by        the hysterectomy prevalence estimates from the survey        method        According to a selfreported national survey        hysterectomies have remained stable between             However based on the National Hospital Discharge Survey        there is evidence that hysterectomy rates decreased        slightly from the mid s through the s and then may        have leveled off through        Our results        show that hysterectomy in Utah significantly decreased        between  and  in the age groups  and         where hysterectomy is most common This suggests        that hysterectomy prevalence based on the crosssectional        method at least for ages less than  based on         data underestimates hysterectomy prevalence Use of the        survey method to obtain prevalence has the advantage that        it does not require complicated modeling and is not        influenced by trends but it may or may not represent the        Utah population given potential biases that may influence        selfreported responses Yet a high level of correspondence        has been previously shown to exist between selfreports and        hospital records of hysterectomy            In an earlier report by Merrill and Feuer     based        on  national data the hysterectomy prevalence        correction based on an historical rather than a        crosssectional approach increased the ageadjusted rates        of corpus uterine rates from  to  Although we        cannot compare our results directly because of difference        in time periods studied the unique racial makeup in Utah        and because we also incorporated the prevalence of corpus        uterine cancer cases not treated with a hysterectomy the        magnitude of the correction is similar to those reported in        this prior study        As anticipated the hysterectomy prevalence corrections        had large influences on the rates and probabilities The        percentage increase was smallest earlier in life and        increased consistently with age This is because the number        of women alive that have undergone a hysterectomy increases        over the age span as evident in the corrected versus the        uncorrected rates and probabilities Yet although the        percentage change increases with age the greatest absolute        change tends to be where the cancer rates are largest        It should be emphasized that correcting the rates and        probabilities had a large impact because of the high        prevalence of hysterectomy The additional influence of        prevalent cases of corpus uterine cancer cases who had not        undergone a hysterectomy was relatively very small Several        studies have explored the benefits risks and costs of        hysterectomy               Despite        the potential risks and costs associated with this medical        procedure over  of women in the United States received        a hysterectomy by age      Hysterectomies are        primarily performed for nonmalignant conditions             with the expectation that the benefits of the surgery        outweigh the risks        Given the high percentage of whites in Utah the study        results primarily reflect this race Hence comparison of        the results to other geographic locations should be        restricted to primarily white populations Yet the results        provide an important baseline for future comparisons        In addition to the limitations stated above because it        is impractical to expect crosssectional rates upon which        lifetime and ageconditional cancer probabilities are based        to remain constant in the long run lifetime probabilities        of cancer are less reliable than shorter term        ageconditional probability estimates They are also less        relevant to a woman already aged to midlife However        lifetime probability estimates of cancer may provide a        guide to individuals and health policy officials as to the        burden of these select cancers        As already well established an accurate representation        of the expected risk of corpus uterine cancer requires that        the population in the incidencerate calculation be        corrected to reflect the atrisk population Similarly an        accurate measure of the burden of this cancer in terms of        lifetime and ageconditional probabilities of developing        the disease also requires a population correction to        reflect those women at risk The two methods developed in        this study reflect unique strengths and weaknesses Yet        despite their potential weaknesses and in the absence of        longterm hysterectomy and cancer data they will provide        more reasonable estimates of the rates and probabilities of        corpus uterine cancer                    Competing Interests        None declared
