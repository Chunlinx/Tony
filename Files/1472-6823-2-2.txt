                    Background                  Free radicals and DNAdamage in diabetes          Freeradicals            eg  superoxide hydroxyl          radicals nitric oxide and peroxynitrite have long been          thought to be a key element in the cellular dysfunction          and death that are central to the pathogenesis of many          aspects of diabetes In type  diabetes it has been          shown that inflammatory cytokines play a central role in          the destruction of insulin producing cells                resulting in the production of oxygenderived free          radicals that induce DNAdamage and apoptosis in both          rodent and human cells          In both          type  and type  as well as type  diabetes the role          of free radicals in diabetic complications is well          studied The most prominent feature of diabetes          hyperglycemia is believed to augment free radical          production     probably due to the increased          mitochondrial oxidative metabolism that is secondary to a          high intracellular glucose concentration Glucose also          leads to advanced glycation end products which initiate          free radical cascades and are toxic to cells including          cells               Free radicals cause damage to cells by various          mechanisms resulting in damage to proteins lipids and          nucleic acids           ie  virtually all cellular          structures In particular free radicals may lead to          nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage and mutations          causing diminished proliferative capacity premature          cellular senescence and impaired mitochondrial function               For the cell one of the most metabolically          active cells in the body mitochondrial function is          essential and diabetes is a prominent feature of many          primary disorders of mitochondrial function              While free radicals play a central role in the          pathogenesis of many aspects of diabetes and it is known          that free radicals can cause DNA damage direct evidence          is sparse for DNA damage in the pathogenesis of cell          failure in type  diabetes The exceptions are a study in          which it was reported that the oxygen radical derived DNA          adduct dihydrooxoguanosine OHdG is present in          the islets of diabetic GotoKakizaki rats a model of          type  diabetes     Also after submission of the          present study it was reported that an increased number          of OHdG positive islet cells is observed in pancreata          from human type  diabetic subjects In that study an          increased number of cells with DNA damage correlated with          a decreased cell mass                              Hypothesis          We hypothesized that oxidative DNA damage plays a role          in the cell dysfunction and loss that occurs in human          type  diabetes To test this hypothesis we screened the          gene expression patterns of islets from a normal control          and a type  diabetic subject with Affymetrix gene chip          arrays with special reference to genes involved in DNA          repair Tyrberg  Levine unpublished data One gene          that was overexpressed in islets from the type           diabetic subject was the DNA glycosylase OxoG DNA          glycosylase Ogg This enzyme is the major repair          enzyme involved in the defense against accumulation of          the OHdG adducts discussed above In light of the          previous publication on the role of OHdG adducts in a          rat model of type  diabetes     and the finding          that the Ogg gene was overexpressed in human type           diabetes we evaluated the expression of Ogg protein in          pancreas specimens from type  diabetic and healthy          subjects as a marker for cell oxidative DNA damage in          type  diabetes                            Methods                  Tissue collection          Specimens from human pancreata were collected in La          Jolla CA Sofia Bulgaria Seoul South Korea and So          Paolo Brazil post mortem or post surgery Normal          control subjects were never diagnosed with any form of          diabetes while patients with type  diabetes had been          diagnosed     or  years before the specimens          were collected Diagnoses were based on hospital records          The patient with a  year history of diabetes also had a          history of alcoholism None of the subjects had a history          of receiving cancer therapy a possible confounding          factor in the analysis of DNA damage More detailed          patient records are found in Table                           Immunofluorescent staining and fluorescence          microscopy          Sections from human pancreata were double stained for          Ogg and somatostatin as a marker for the islets with          rabbit antihuman Ogg Novus Biologicals Littleton CO          and goat antihuman somatostatin antibodies Santa Cruz          Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA after antigen retrieval          by boiling for  min in acidic antigen retrieval          solution Biogenex San Ramon CA Antibody binding was          detected with an Alexa donkey antirabbit antibody          Molecular Probes Eugene OR and an Alexa

media DAKO fluorescent mounting media DAKO Glostrup          Denmark To evaluate the specificity of the Ogg          antibody slides were stained with fluorescent secondary          antibody alone which resulted in no background staining          data not shown Also as a positive control pancreas          from a mouse injected with the oxidative radical inducing          agent alloxan     were stained one day after the          injection with a marked increase of Ogg nuclear and          cytoplasmic staining as a result data not shown          Tissue sections were examined in a fluorescent          microscope with  magnification The pancreatic          islets were evaluated blindly with semiquantitative          morphological scoring of fluorescent intensity  no or          very weak Ogg staining  moderate Ogg staining and           strong Ogg staining They were also scored for Ogg          positive islet area as follows  no or very small area          of the islet stained for Ogg  approximately  of          the islet area was Ogg positive  approximately            approximately  and  approximately  The          total number of islets evaluated in the five pancreata          from type  diabetic patients were    per          pancreas and in the seven pancreata from normal          controls     per pancreas Sections were          evaluated live in the fluorescence microscope with a          combined filter for green and red fluorescence which          means that camera exposure time and other camera          settings did not influence the intensity of the Ogg          staining Also the Alexa dyes are very stable          fluorophores even under UV light exposure so that          fading is unlikely to be a significant issue in          influencing the results

individual was compared with MannWhitneys          unparametric test                            Results        Pancreatic paraffin sections from five type  diabetic        subjects and seven healthy controls were compared by        immunohistochemistry for Ogg Costaining for somatostatin        as a marker of islets of Langerhans was performed Fig         Somatostatin rather than insulin was chosen as an islet        marker because insulin expression can be significantly        decreased in islets from patients with longstanding type         diabetes        Two parameters were chosen to measure islet Ogg        expression The percentage of the islet that stained        positively for Ogg was used as a measure of the number of        Oggexpressing cells The intensity of the Ogg staining        was used as a measure of the level of Ogg expression in        positive cells By semiquantitative scoring both the        intensity and the area of Ogg staining were significantly        increased P   and P   respectively in        islets from the type  diabetic subjects compared to the        healthy controls Fig     Interestingly the Ogg        fluorescent staining intensity but not the percent        positive islet area increases with increasing duration of        diabetes Fig  Pancreatic exocrine tissue expressed        Ogg at various degrees Fig  but no correlation was        found with type  diabetes data not shown                    Discussion        This study demonstrates that the enzyme Ogg which is        involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage is        upregulated in the islets of patients with type         diabetes This is consistent with the hypothesis that        oxidative DNA damage is an important factor in the cell        failure that plays a role in the pathogenesis of human type         diabetes        We interpret the upregulation of Ogg as a response to        an increased level of OHdG DNA the lesion that it        repairs Increases in Ogg activity and expression have        been found by a number of investigators              Although antibodies to OHdG exist     Ogg was used        as a surrogate for the amount of oxidative DNA damage The        reason for this is that we found high levels of background        staining with the antiOHdG antibodies which is not        unusual when using streptavidinbiotin detection systems in        immunohistochemistry     Unfortunately secondary        antibodies directly linked to a fluorophore or a detection        enzyme were not sensitive enough to detect the OHdG        adduct in our hands        The mechanism by which Ogg protein is increased in type         diabetic islets is unknown The promoter of the Ogg gene        does not have a TATA box     but Ogg is        differentially expressed in the rat CNS and its expression        is increased after mouse forebrain ischemiareperfusion             suggesting that regulation occurs either at the        transcriptional or posttranscriptional level        Unfortunately there have been no studies of the effects of        longterm chronic increases in oxidative DNA damage on Ogg        expression The association between the duration of        diabetes and Ogg levels Fig  suggests that such        longterm exposure may be important for Ogg        upregulation        Most of the staining observed was detected in the        cytoplasm of the islet cells As Ogg either is        sublocalized into the nucleus or the mitochondria this        indicates that Ogg the mitochondrial form of Ogg        accounts for the observed increase Ogg is an        alternatively spliced form of Ogg that contains a        mitochondrial targeting signal in the Cterminal portion of        the protein     Specific upregulation of mitochondrial        but not nuclear Ogg occurs during aging in rodents            A specific increase of Ogg in islet cell mitochondria is        consistent with the idea that increased cell        mitochondrial oxidative metabolism due to hyperglycemia is        a major factor behind the DNA damage In a study published        after this report was submitted an increased number of        OHdG positive islet cells in human type  diabetic        subjects was observed     The staining was found to be        mainly nuclear in contrast to the cytoplasmic Ogg staining        found in the present report Unfortunately we were unable        to obtain specific staining with antibodies to OHdG        However the nuclear localization of OHdG    and the        increased Ogg reported here are consistent with a model in        which mitochondrial Ogg is upregulated but nuclear Ogg        is not leading to an increase in nuclear but not        mitochondrial OHdG adducts     Further studies will        be required to resolve this issue but cells in type         diabetes may well suffer from both nuclear and        mitochondrial DNA damage leading to decreased cell        function and eventual loss of cell mass        In this study both the area and the intensity of Ogg        staining were assessed Since it was not practical to        collect specimens in a controlled manner it could be        argued that differences in fixation technique could affect        the fluorescence intensity of the immunostaining However        as we also detected a significant increase in the islet        area stained for Ogg we are confident that islet cell        Ogg is actually upregulated in type  diabetes The direct        correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the        duration of diabetes that held true for samples collected        from disparate locations also argues in favor of the        hypothesis It is interesting that the Ogg positive area        did not show the same increase with increasing duration of        diabetes as the Ogg staining intensity We have observed        that the number of cells varies considerably in the        islets from type  diabetic subjects and that large areas        of the islets are sometimes replaced by amorphous material        data not shown probably reflecting fibrosis or        amyloidosis Such a variation in cell number per islet        would bias a correlation of Ogg positive cells with        duration of diabetes Moreover it is possible that cells        from patients with longstanding diabetes have a higher        threshold for an apoptotic response to DNAdamage than        cells in normal subjects as it has been shown that this        threshold increases with age     Consequently cells        with high levels of DNA damage from younger individuals        with a shorter duration of diabetes might be eliminated by        apoptosis while similarly damaged cells from older        individuals who are likely to have had diabetes for a        longer time may be resistant to apoptosis and so remain        Such an apoptotic defect could account for the increasing        intensity of Ogg staining following accumulated levels of        OHdG adducts with longer duration of diabetes Further        epidemiological studies in which age was specifically        studied would be required to address this issue more        definitively        We noted that the variability in the amount of Ogg        staining is higher in the control group than in the samples        from the diabetic patients It is well known that there is        a high incidence of undiagnosed diabetes in the general        population Since detailed patient records were not        available it is possible that undiagnosed diabetes in the        control group could account for the increased        variability        Ogg knockout mice possess increased levels of OHdG        in their genome particularly in the mitochondrial genome        but do not seem to exhibit an increased frequency of        malignancies       It was postulated that the        consequences of OHdG adducts and Ogg deficiency affects        mainly cells with high oxygen metabolism and slow        proliferation such as liver cells     While cells        were not examined in that study they certainly exhibit        both high oxidative metabolism and a low rate of        proliferation consistent with them being a target for the        effects of OHdG adducts It would be of great interest        to study the Ogg mutant mice to determine whether an        increase level of OHdG adducts predisposes to diabetes        This would be important in establishing oxidative DNA        damage as a causal mechanism in diabetes as opposed to        merely being an epiphenomenon in which the important        targets for diabetes pathogenesis lie elsewhere in the        cell Further epidemiological studies of Ogg expression        as well as studies of the expression of other genes and        proteins that are involved in DNA damage responses should        also be performed to further test the hypothesis that DNA        damage is involved in the pathogenesis of type         diabetes                    Conclusions        We conclude that the expression of the DNA repair enzyme        Ogg is upregulated in islets from type  diabetic        specimens Moreover Ogg expression intensity is directly        correlated with the duration of diabetes These finding are        consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative DNA damage is        playing a role in the pathogenesis of cell damage in type         diabetes                    Competing Interests        None declared                    Authors Contribution
