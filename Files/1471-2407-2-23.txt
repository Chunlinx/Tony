                    Background        A synthetic form of EPO human recombinant EPO has been        successfully used to treat anemia in patients with chronic        renal failure and HIV     Some randomized trials RCT        assessed the role of EPO in anemia related the cancer             However many of these trials were underpowered and        failed to identify clinically meaningful benefits of EPO        treatment As a result there has been persistent        uncertainty about the efficacy of EPO as a treatment for        cancerrelated anemia despite the introduction of EPO in a        clinical practice almost a decade ago Systematic reviews        SR are the best way to offer synthesis of evidence and        are of special utility in settings where many small trials        fail to achieve a significant result            A recent comprehensive SR     addressed the role of        EPO in treatmentrelated anemia in cancer patients This SR        included nonrandomized studies and performed a        metaanalysis MA of  RCTs showing a significant effect        of EPO in reducing the need to transfuse patients who are        receiving chemotherapy Although comprehensive some issues        were not addressed in this previous SRMA a formal        quantitative synthesis metaanalysis was not performed        according to different clinical aspects and to main        methodological quality dimensions empirically linked to        bias            In contrast to this previous report      in this SR        we evaluated only data from randomized studies We also        investigated a broad range of clinical issues including        EPO use according to the level of hemoglobin hb        platinumbased chemotherapy and tumor type Finally to        investigate the stability of our conclusions a broad        methodological appraisal of the quality of the trials was        performed specifically examining those dimensions that        have been empirically linked to bias            We also performed a conservative cumulative        metaanalysis CMA    to determine the earliest point        in time when the use of EPO versus placebo reached a such        statistical significance after which the uncertainty           about the effect of EPO in cancerrelated anemia could have        been considered resolved                    Methods        A previous SR served as a basis for location of the        articles of interest     We also performed a search of        MEDLINE LILACS and CANCERLIT databases last update in        July of  using the optimal search strategy for RCT for        use in MEDLINE    and LILACS    with the additional        terms related to this review  epoetin OR Erythropoietin        and cancer OR neoplasm in all fields        We included only RCTs that compared EPO versus no        therapy or placebo in cancer related anemia We excluded        studies related to transplant setting and myelodysplastic        syndrome since the physiopathology of these diseases is        different more linked to pancytopenia than to anemia            We also excluded trials that used EPO with the primary        objective to magnify hb to improve the efficacy of        radiotherapy        Four trials described more than one comparison of        different doses of EPO with only one control group               We approached these multiarm studies in two        different ways in the first each EPO arm was compared to        the control arm In the second we combined all active arms        in one by adding all EPO treated patients and analyzed it        against the control Both combinations achieved virtually        the same result and data are presented using the second        method        Data were abstracted on patient characteristics type of        tumor treatment details and the major methodological        quality dimensions     see Additional file  The end        point studied was the number of patients requiring        transfusions Results in a conventional metaanalysis were        pooled using the Petos Odds Ratio OR and relative risk        RR both in a fixed effect model     We also        extracted data on adverse effects of the use of EPO        Additional file        Table  Characteristics of included studies        Click here for file        Heterogeneity among trials was assessed using chisquare        test chi The possibility of publication bias was        assessed using the funnel plot method     To assess        the reasons for any heterogeneity found we performed a        metaregression     Sensitivity and subgroup analyses        according to the main methodological quality dimensions           and a number of clinical criteria were also performed        see fig and  The results were calculated with        corresponding  confidence interval CI When the        results from pooled data were significant we calculated        the number of patients need to treat NNT    in order        to prevent one transfusion However the readers are        advised to exercise due caution because NNT and NNH number        of patients to harm are more influenced by the baseline        risk in a control group than the odds ratio        The qualitative conclusion of the authors was assessed        using the method described by Gilberts and Colditz            and adapted to a six point scale where   control group        highly preferred   control preferred to EPO treatment          about equal EPO a disappointment   about equal EPO a        success   EPO preferred to control and   EPO highly        preferred        Finally we performed a cumulative metaanalysis CMA           using a conservative approach setting the  error at         with a two tailored p in a random effects model            The CMA allowed us to determine the point when the        results achieved a level of statistical significance after        which we should expect no changes in the effect by        performing new trials and after which placebo controlled        trials should not have been performed In other words CMA        allowed us to determine the threshold point after which        uncertainty about this question should have been considered        resolved                        Results        Thirtyseven randomized articles addressing the use of        EPO in cancer related anemia were located and retrieved for        full text appraisal Twenty one papers fit our inclusion        criteria Two articles describing two small trials            with a total of  patients were excluded from our        analysis because they did not provide information regarding        our end point of interest        Nineteen articles                             describing  trials see Additional        file  fit our inclusion criteria One paper           described three different trials two of which            were reported later in separate papers We included data        from these latest papers only Therefore we included         trials from  articles with  patients in cancer        related anemia Fourteen trials with a total of         patients described the use of EPO in patients with hb level          gdl and five trials with  patients related to        hb level   gdl Of the latter ones one trial           included patients with hb ranging from  to         gdl The analysis did not change when we excluded this        trial in the sensitivity analysis        The possibility of publication bias was considered        unlikely according to the visual inspection of the funnel        plot     The results of the critical appraisal        according to the most important methodological quality        dimensions of each article are shown in see Additional        file  No single trial met all methodological quality        criteria All trials scored five or six on the six point        Gilbert    and Colditz    scales denoting strong        qualitative support in favor of EPO see Additional file                The metaanalysis of the  trials Fig and  showed a        significant beneficial effect of EPO in diminishing the        number of patients requiring transfusion OR   CI         to   p   without statistical        heterogeneity chi   df   p   When we        used relative risk fig  as a summary point estimate in        the metaanalysis the results remained significant RR           CI  to  p   but now with        significant statistical heterogeneity chi   df          p   However when the study by Porter et al           was removed from the analysis heterogeneity        disappeared from the analysis and the analysis according        to OR or RR did not differ This is likely because in this        small study including  patients in each group event rate        was so high with all but one patient receiving        transfusion        To further explain heterogeneity we also performed a        metaregression     The variables related to the design        and clinical features which possible could affect the        treatment effect of EPO were entered in the equation see        Additional file  We found no statistically significant        association between any of the variables with the treatment        effect of EPO when all data were simultaneously entered in        a multiregression equationdata not shown However when a        stepwise regression model was used two variables emerged        of the potential significance which could explain most the        heterogeneity of our results inadequacy of allocation        concealment p   and Hb cutoff value of  gdl        p   The between study variation tau estimate        was  for the model containing no variables ie the        simple metaanalysis this was reduced to almost zero in        the final model In addition most likely explanation of        heterogeneity seen in our study is related to a small        sample size of the individual trials resulting in random        fluctuation of the effect between the studies When we        divided the trials according to the hb level using         gdl as a cutoff point the results remained essentially        unchanged ie highly significant in favor of EPO fig        and         Thus it appears that the effect of EPO is a rather        robust despite heterogeneity noted in the metaanalysis        Sensitivity and subgroup analyses according to clinical        and methodological quality dimensions Fig and  showed        consistency in the results favoring the use of EPO        Statistical heterogeneity was noted for some of these        comparisons see fig and  It was related to the        magnitude of the treatment effect and not to its        significance since in all trials the point estimate of the        effect favored EPO A stepwise metaregression analysis did        point to the possibility that treatment effect could have        been exaggerated by inadequacy in allocation concealment        and that larger treatment effects are seen at hb level          gdl The heterogeneity was more common when we used        RR than when we used OR        The overall result by pooling all trials indicates that        for each  cancer patients  CI  to  using EPO one        patient will avoid transfusion This result is maintained        when we separately analyzed the trials that included        patients with hb level   gdl NNT    CI         to  and Hb   gdl NNT    CI  to         These NNT should be analyzed carefully since they were        calculated from a pool of data that in some analysis were        not homogeneous        We also performed a CMA fig  using a conservative        approach ie setting  error at  Our CMA demonstrated        that by  a high level of significance OR          CI  to  p   RR   CI         to  p   about the benefit of EPO on reducing        the use of blood transfusions had been achieved Beyond        this point all new trials only improved the precision        without adding any additional useful information We        estimated that  patients representing  of the total        number of cancer patients who participated in EPO studies        were enrolled in  placebocontrolled randomized studies        that were reported after         The previous SR    concluded that it was impossible        to reasonably distinguish between adverse events related to        EPO and concurrent treatments We also tried to extract        data on adverse events but were unable to make a        reasonable approach due to the poor reporting Therefore        we decided not to tabulate data on adverse events and        perform quantitative pooling                    Discussion        According to our overall analysis administration of EPO        is related to an average  reduction in odds of requiring        a transfusion A previous SR     pooled  trials that        used subcutaneous EPO all also included in our analysis        in a Bayesian MA reached results similar OR   CI         to  to ours We could also demonstrate        consistency of the results when analyzed according to OR        RR various quality dimensions and many different clinical        settings fig and         Due to these EPO effects patients with cancer are        expected to have direct benefits through fewer transfusions        and lower exposure to anemia effects Furthermore all        patients will benefit indirectly through conservation of        the blood supply        The use of RR as summary statistics is less robust than        OR    and in this case resulted in greater heterogeneity        than the analysis based on OR see fig and  The        estimate the effects of EPO using RR indicated a smaller        effect than OR but both results were significant p          in both analysis However when events are common        the OR may overestimate the effect of treatment     Due        to these characteristics of the analysis we choose to show        both OR and RR as a summary statistics Nevertheless we        should mention see the RESULTS that the most of        heterogeneity could be explained by high transfusion rates        in the trial by Porter et al and inadequacy of allocation        concealment in EPO trials Similarly it appears that the        larger treatment effects are seen when EPO is given in the        patients with hb   gdl        Because it was not possible to extract data on quality        of life QOL this issue was not addressed here However        a recent systematic review by Bottomley et al           indicated that solid evidence about the effect of EPO on        this end point is lacking We should also mention that the        high cost of EPO has deterred its widespread acceptance           and more studies using economic analysis should be done        to address the issue if the use of EPO is        costeffective        A previous SR     found no increased incidence of        adverse events of EPO when compared with controls We also        did not find any side effect of EPO consistently reported        among trials        Our main goal here is to stress that the basic ethical        requirement to randomize patients in clinical trials is        that physicians and patients must not have preferences for        any of the therapies considered ie they should be in the        state of uncertainty or equipoise     If uncertainty        does not exist it is felt to be unethical to ask patients        to participate in RCTs            To assess if uncertainty regarding a clinical question        exists researchers should evaluate the totality of        preexisting knowledge if we already knew that one        treatment is superior to another nothing new could be        learned and we would unnecessarily expose our patients to        already known inferior treatment by performing a new trial        We showed here that if a SRCMA had been used to formally        address the uncertainty regarding the effect of EPO in        cancer patients this uncertainty could have been        conservatively considered resolved Fig  since  Our        findings suggest that  of the cancer patients included        in this SR participated in placebo controlled clinical        trials that were reported after EPO was shown to be        superior to placebo Had a CMA been performed        prospectively it is possible that clinical trialists may        have decided against initiating  clinical trials We        should note that we analyzed trials according to date of        their report It is conceivable that some trials were        initiated before  but were reported after         However this only means that the uncertainty about the        role of EPO could have been solved even earlier if these        patients were available for CMA or a large RCT For        example if all  patients included in randomized studies        up to  had participated in only one large randomized        study the uncertainty about EPO could have been solved        earlier An alternative approach to large studies in        solving uncertainty is to use CMA to monitor accumulation        of treatment effects in clinical trials     The        technique of CMA is a powerful scientific instrument to        assess the significance of accumulated knowledge             In more than  CMA performed there has never been a        single case where the point estimate switched to indicate        the opposite effect once the difference between treatments        reached statistical significance                        Conclusion        EPO is highly effective for cancerrelated anemia This        effect could have been detected in  if CMA had been        performed at that time The techniques of CMA should be        used more frequently in the future to preserve the        uncertainty principle    and protect patients who        consent to be randomized in clinical trials                    Competing interests        No funding or honoraria were provided for this work to        any of the authors CB and BD served as
