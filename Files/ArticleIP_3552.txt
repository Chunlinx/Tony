your best advice For the pastthree years I have been the girlfriend of a married man We work together Hiswife really does not understand him and he swears that if it werent for hisyoung children he would bail out in a heartbeat Without actually promisinghes made me feel that in time we will formally and legally betogether                                       Strangely enough his marital status is not my problem What is disturbingis that Im quite certain he is seeing someone in addition to me Officecomputer systems have infinite possibilities if you know what youre doingSooner or later I have to deal with this new wrinkle                                       Thanking you inadvance I amConfused in Virginia                        DearCon            The wrinkle you refer to isnot so new There is in fact a wonderful country and western song about thisLady Your Husband Is Cheating on Us            Yourspecific instructions to skip the morality lecture inclines Prudie to cut rightto the chase A man for whom a wife and a girlfriend are insufficient isa louse and a tomcat This romance will ultimately bring grief because youwill come to feel jealous and betrayed So why dont you pole vault out of therelationship sooner rather than later and save yourself some time            Prudie assuredly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I havea teenage daughter  who loves to chew gum To make matters worse she worebraces for years and just got them off She was unable to chew gum while thebraces were on so now she is going cow wild so to speak I find the gumhabit objectionable Could you please speak to this issue with regard to thesocial ramifications of gum chewing in public                                       ThankyouDagupster                        DearDag            Prudie agrees there issomething tacky about being seen chewing gum Your use of the term cow wildinstead of hog is apt With teenagers however the habit does not rank upthere with green spiked hair and nose rings so at least you have one blessingto count            Yourmention of the words in public suggests a compromise that will keep you fromseeming like a completely snobbish ogre Hand down the edict that the newlybracesfree child may chew gum only when she is alone Try tocommunicate that the jaws constant movement up and down is not attractive andsends the wrong message If she feels in need of something to occupy her mouthsuggest breath mints Sugarless of course since you do not need more expensesfor your offsprings teeth            Prudie decorously                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have recently beendiagnosed as bipolar Ive been fairly nutty for
