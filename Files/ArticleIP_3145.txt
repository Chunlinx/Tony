                                 Listlessness            The American Film Institutesays that one purpose in creating its list of the  greatest American filmswas to stimulate discussion In that the list has been a success It hasengendered not merely discussion but objection accusation abuse andexcoriationnearly all at the AFIs expense Its an awful list by traditionalstandards but no less fascinating for its shortcomings and no less culturallylegitimate either            Take yourpick of things wrong with the list It fails to recognize acknowledged classicfilms such as Dracula   and major filmmakers such as BusterKeaton and instead includes many more recent box office successes such asJaws  and Tootsie  that makes it a stupid list Itwas culled from a preselected group of  titles and voted on by prominent persons including celebrities and politicians that makes it anarbitrarily conducted test of popularity It is designed to stimulate videorentals that makes it a commercial list At least one columnist has arguedthat in honoring Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind  it isa racist list  Guess Whos Coming to Dinner the lists onlyantiracist entryand a mediocre one at thatsqueaked in at No             For the sake of argument lets stipulate that the way theAFI went about filling up its list resulted in an approach to movie greatnessthat is at best controversial and at worst dumbfounding But controversy islikely to follow in the wake of any best list The AFIs effort is a freezeframe of American movie taste in a moment of sweeping cultural transition            The AFIslist of alltime greats downplays the influence of credentialed tastemakerscinema scholarship and educated judgment It nods to expertise by anointingCitizen Kane  the greatest American film then largely abandonsexpertise It thereby marks another stage in the decline of culturalgatekeepingthe control over what is deemed worthy as opposed to merelypopular long exerted by critics educators repertory programmers filmhistorians and so forth            Theres no shortage of wouldbe gatekeepersbut in recent years their influence has been waning Compare the influentialmoviead criticblurbists of the past with the current proliferation of nonamequote whores Theyve been done in by the new technologyVCRs cablesatellites computersthat has provided a wide cultural audience with vastlymore choices than it had a generation ago and vastly more power as a resultThe VCR revolution of the last  years for example has completelytransformed access to films past The old classic rep houses are now mostlydark the new rep houses are on cable or on your VCR stand            Enter theAFIa gatekeeper that true to its times has yielded to more commercialconcerns Its choices for the top  American movies on its list areexplicitly designed to stimulate video rentals and TV ratings for anassociated TNT series These are films that in the AFIs estimationAmericans are still willing to pay for and sit through Less commerciallistmakers might have felt the need to pay lip service to for instanceRobert J Flahertys Nanook of the North  an undeniably greatfilm that is not on the AFI list Flahertys famous portrait of an Eskimosdaily struggle to survive was the first attempt to join documentary filmmakingto personal vision in Flahertys case a vision of humankinds struggle toovercome Nature Once one of the worlds most popular works todayNanook is rarely if ever seen by a nonspecialist audience            And yet even Nanook might have made the AFI list ageneration ago as might such other silents as Clyde Bruckman and KeatonsThe General  King Vidors The Crowd  or DWGriffiths Way Down East  Back then moviegoers in search ofculture were not only closer in time to the silents they also acknowledgedtheir stature and stature mattered to audiences then more than it does nowClick to find out why            The AFIcompilation reflects more than just technological change and the shifting powerto confer greatness however It also suggests a change in the characters theAmerican audience enjoys watching and with whom it wants to identify This isespecially notable in the genre films on the list the tales of tough guysdames cowboys spacemen and gangsters traditionally at the heart of popularAmerican movie drama            There are many genre films on the AFI list butmost of them represent their genre in its late period The Godfather  A Space Odyssey  The Wild Bunch  andso on These are indeed great films powerful handsome strikingly edited Butin many ways they seem just the opposite of the movies from which theydeveloped There is a startling difference between the gangster romanticismportrayed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino and the gangsterism embodied earlierin the century by Edward G Robinson and James Cagney You could admireRobinsons and Cagneys toughness their ability to get their way But in theend you knew they were bad They broke their mothers hearts and paid too higha price for their criminal success                           Bonnieand Clyde  on the other hand presents criminality in romantic softfocus The Godfather and The Godfather Part II  are adaydream of limitless wealth and power available to those like Brando andPacino clever enough to survive it The old Warner Bros gangster moralitytales were always said by the gatekeepers to represent the American gangsterfilm in its glory but these morality tales are completely absent from the AFI            The same is true of the cowboy and the tough guy There aretraditional cowboys and tough guys on the list but the former as inStagecoach   and The Searchers   is limited mostly toJohn Wayne and the latter as in The Maltese Falcon   to HumphreyBogart and you get the sense these films were chosen more out of nostalgia fortheir stars than for their dramatic power The old western was almost always atale of a courageous loner imposing order on lawlessness as in the Wayne filmsand Shane  High Noon  which is on the list is aninteresting variation But Sam Peckinpahs The Wild Bunch features existentially disillusioned outlaws going out in a montage of bloodychaos Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  is an outlaw buddyfilm and Dances With Wolves  attempts to revise entirely theconcepts of both order and the west            Few damesmade the cut Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity  is a lonelyworldly wise woman on the list The tough cities that such women and theirfugitive men once haunted are nowhere to be found The seductive and corruptingfilm noir downtowns featured in so many admired cheap second features might aswell all have been demolished along with the longgone Bijous and Palaceswhere these films first played            Perhaps that makes sense Twentieth centuryAmerican culture was largely a downtown experience It isnt anymore It isincreasingly an athome experience increasingly private increasinglypersonal The AFIs list for all its peculiarities appears to reflectthat            Obviously being fairly arbitrary many of the AFI choices may not lendthemselves to sound cultural interpretation But there is an upheaval in canoncreation going on throughout American culture and this list brings thatupheaval to the movies Its worth trying to understand the AFI  for what itis and isnt The alternative is sitting in the dark waiting for a show thatsreally over to begin                           If youmissed the link click to see how the influence of cultural gatekeepers haswaned in the last  years
