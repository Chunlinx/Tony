                                 Kettle Call            Shaping a vessel in which toboil water shouldnt be that difficultmore a matter of duh than design Allyou need is a place to put the water a handle that doesnt get hot and aspout that is well away from the users hand You can refine it by maximizingthe surface that touches the burner putting a whistle at the end of the spoutand providing a lever to open the spout And what you have is a functionalifvisually gracelessdesign one that was perfected half a century ago and isnow ubiquitous and inexpensive            In recentyears though the mundane teakettle has become something else an opportunityfor designers to show offand sometimes an object lesson in how easy it isfor them to mess up Todays kettle can often serve up a searing demonstrationsearing to your fingers that is of how risky it is to redesign ordinaryobjects Such things often work so well that you dont even notice the parts oftheir design that make them work so well Sometimes things look clunky forgood reason            You can buy a kettle whose whistle is in the shape of abrassplated nightingale or a steamspewing dragon One has a handle in theshape of a bent tulip There are kettles shaped like some of the major Platonicsolidscylinders cones and nearspheres They come fluted like a Doriccolumn and mottled and horned like a Holstein cow And onethe best of thelotsports a large plastic collar to ensure that you wont burn your fingersno matter how clumsy you are            The distant precursors totodays designer kettles were the canehandled electric teakettles designed in by Peter Behrens for AEG the German version of General Electric Thesesmall appliances with their clear round or octagonal shapes subtle textureand almost handcrafted look were never sold in the United States Butphotographs of them have been published and exhibited and they represent animportant step in the transfer of aesthetic interest from the teapotwith itslong decorative historyto the kettle which genteel people had kept out ofsight            But inrecent decades even as the amount of time families spend cooking has shrunk tonearly nothing kitchens have become increasingly ostentatious It was probablyinevitable that the functional but dowdy model of the baby boom era would bereplaced with something more stylish            In  the Italian housewares manufacturerAlessi introduced what is probably still the most outrageous teakettle evermade the creation of the German designer Richard Sapper Its vertical domedshape has a certain hauteur not to mention a geometric purity then rare inhousewares And it doesnt merely whistle when the water starts to steam Itplays a note then a second note and finally an insistent threenote chordwith a sound somewhere between a train whistle and the Canadian Brass Sellingfor more than  times the price of an ordinary model the kettle quicklybecame a cult object for designconscious consumers            Gleamingelegant substantial the Sapper design achieves its visual power at someexpense Its burner surface is low in relation to its volume so it boils watermore slowly than other models Its chief failing however is that it allowsyou to easily pull the spout lever and release a plume of steamaimed directlyat your fingers            A design that departs radically from the ordinary may lookgreat in a museum but fail in the kitchen But that doesnt mean it cant dowell in the store where buyers dont get a chance to boil water Sappersdesign paved the way for what is still the most iconic kettle of all MichaelGraves Five OClock teakettle designed for Alessi and introduced in is conical in shape with a long spout Its most distinctive feature is thelittle pink ceramic bird at the end of its removable whistle This removablewhistle was actually a throwback to the earliest version of the whistlingteakettle            Thechirpingbird kettle seemed to prove that high design could also be cuteGraves explained the little pink bird as a reaction to Sappers kettle Becausethe bird doesnt get hot he said it is possible to remove the whistling capwithout burning your fingers There is a danger that the bird might crack andbreak but it can easily be replaced            The little bird is what told housewaresmanufacturers that teakettles could be a hot commercial item and led to thecurrent proliferation The Graves model is still available for about though some might call it pass It has been superseded by newer models allless expensiveand for the most part less memorable            Theexception is the OXO Good Grips teakettle designed by the New York firm SmartDesign and introduced last year It is part of a line of products intended tobe usable by people with arthritis or hand injuries as well as by thosewithout disabilities It is the ultimate answer to Sappers kettle because itsform was generated by the desire to make it extremely difficult for users toburn their fingers            Though it lacks the simple geometric form of Sappers potand those of many of its competitors it is unified in a subtler way Itscomplex curves suggest that it was sculpted rather than drawn You can think ofit as two intersecting incomplete egg shapes one of which is the body of thepot and the handle of its lid and the other of which is the protective collarThe lines of the handle and other elements derive from these implicit shapesIt doesnt photograph well it is one of those rare products that looks betterthan its picture on the box            When I first saw the OXOkettle I resisted it That big black steam guard looked so ostentatiouslyfoolproof that I feared it would be clumsy like a bicycle with trainingwheels But as I handled it used it and carefully examined how it worked itstarted to look better and better This is indeed progress both aestheticallyand functionallyeven though all it does is boil water
