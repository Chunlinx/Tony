                    Background        Mutations in Brutons tyrosine kinase Btk are        responsible for the human disease termed Xlinked        agammaglobulinemia XLA reviewed in reference   The        B cell antigen receptor BCR signaling defect is very        severe such that XLA patients have a block in the proB to        preB cell transition and consequently have no mature B        cells The         xid mouse in which Btk is mutated        and the Btk knockout mouse display similar although        somewhat less severe phenotypes   Btk is the        prototypical member of the Tec family of nonreceptor        protein tyrosine kinases PTKs that includes Bmx Itk Tec        and Txk    In addition to a COOHterminal PTK domain        Btk has an NH           terminal pleckstrin homology PH        domain a prolinerich Tec homology domain a Srchomology         SH domain and a Srchomology  SH domain Btk was        originally identified in B cells but is now known to be        expressed in most leukocytes with the exception of T cells        and NK cells        Btk is thought to be activated upon BCR crosslinking by        a twostep mechanism involving phosphatidylinositol PI        kinase and the Src family PTK Lyn reviewed in references            PI kinase induces Btk membrane targeting by        generating phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate PIP        to which the PH domain of Btk binds Lyn        transphosphorylates Btk within the activation loop of the        kinase domain allowing subsequent autophosphorylation of        the Btk SH domain and full Btk activation The SH        domaincontaining inositol phosphatase SHIP downregulates        Btk by dephosphorylating PIP            Biochemical studies of Btkdeficient B cells have shown        Btk to be necessary for BCRinduced phospholipase C        PLC phosphorylation calcium mobilization        extracellular signalregulated kinase ERK and cJun NH          terminal kinase JNK        mitogenactivated protein kinase MAPK activation NFB        activation and apoptosis        These        signaling events are generally not entirely abrogated and        kinetic analyses have revealed that the sustained phases        are particularly impaired in the absence of Btk            In contrast these pathways are completely inhibited        in the absence of the SykZAP family tyrosine kinase Syk          These data have led to the hypothesis that Btk        cooperates with Syk in PLCdependent BCR signaling and        that Btk functions as a signal duration modulator reviewed        in references    However it is not clear if Btk        alone is sufficient to mimic aspects of BCR signaling nor        is it known whether all downstream signals mediated by Btk        are PLCdependent Indeed additional functions for Btk        have recently been proposed namely in PI kinase        activation   cytoskeletal reorganization   and DNA        transcription            In this study we have generated a conditional form of        Btk by fusing the full length Btk protein with the        hormonebinding domain of the estrogen receptor BtkER        We show that BtkER activation alone is sufficient to        activate multiple downstream signaling pathways in B cells        including calcium mobilization ERK and JNK MAPK and        apoptosis Moreover by analysing BtkER function in        PLCdeficient cells we show that PLC is necessary for        BtkER to transmit these signals                    Results and Discussion                  Construction of BtkER a conditional form of          Btk          In order to determine whether Btk activation alone is          sufficient to mimic aspects of BCR signaling we have          generated BtkER a novel conditional form of Btk BtkER          was constructed such that the hormonebinding domain of          the estrogen receptor was fused to the COOHterminus of          full length Btk Fig A This approach has been          successful in producing conditional forms of the Tec          family PTK Bmx   and also the PTKs vSrc   Hck            and Abl   the serinethreonine kinases Raf            and Akt   and the dual specificity protein          kinase MEK   The mechanism of action of ER fusion          proteins is not clear although it appears that upon          treatment of cells with estrogen or an estrogen analogue          for example hydroxytamoxifen HT the biological          activities of the proteins are induced This may involve          ER domain dimerization andor selective stabilization of          expression within the cell   The ER fusion protein          method has been shown to accurately identify downstream          substrates and effects of the above mentioned          kinases          Two forms of BtkER were generated one using          wildtype WT Btk and the other using a kinaseinactive          KE mutant of Btk as a negative control Fig A The          BtkER constructs were transfected into Btkdeficient          DT chicken B cells and stable clones were selected that          expressed equivalent levels of BtkER The DT cell          system was used because it has proved useful in          dissecting B cell signaling pathways through the use of          gene knockouts derived by homologous recombination            Fig Bshows that WT BtkER was kinase active           in vitro as determined by          autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of an exogenous          substrate GSTIg in an immunecomplex kinase assay          Kinase activity was not detectable for the KE mutant          of BtkER Fig B comparable to control          immunoprecipitations from Btkdeficient cells data not          shown In order to determine if BtkER was active           in vivo  cells were treated with          vehicle control HT or anti and the phosphorylation          status of cellular proteins and BtkER were analysed by          Western blotting Fig C Upon HT treatment a          discrete set of cellular proteins were inducibly          phosphorylated in WT BtkERexpressing cells although          their phosphorylation levels and the diversity of          proteins phosphorylated were reduced in comparison with          BCR crosslinking As a control HT treatment did not          induce phosphorylation of cellular proteins in parental          DT cells without BtkER data not shown BtkER itself          was inducibly phosphorylated upon HT treatment as          measured by antiphosphotyrosine blotting and by a          phosphospecific antiserum that recognises the Y site          of Btk autophosphorylation Surprisingly the          phosphospecific antiserum did not detect BtkER Y          phosphorylation in response to BCR crosslinking          suggesting that the observed phosphorylation in this case          is largely due to the Y Lyn transphosphorylation site          In cells expressing kinase inactive BtkER          phosphorylation of BtkER was not detected and cellular          substrates were not inducibly phosphorylated in response          to HT Fig C These data suggest that WT BtkER but          not the kinase inactive form can be activated           in vivo by HT The mechanism by          which HT activates BtkER is not known but may be          different to the mechanism of BCRinduced activation          since the two stimuli induce phosphorylation on different          sites          The identity of the cellular proteins phosphorylated          downstream of BtkER activation  kD range top          panel Fig C are not known These proteins are unlikely          to include Lyn or Syk the two PTKs that are primarily          responsible for the BCRinduced tyrosine phosphorylation          pattern seen in DT whole cell lysates   since we          were unable to detect phosphorylation of Lyn and Syk          following specific immunoprecipitations data not shown          Moreover the relatively weak phosphorylation of cellular          proteins induced by BtkER does not suggest that Lyn          andor Syk are becoming activated Fig C This is          consistent with the idea that Lyn and Syk are upstream of          Btk activation                            BtkER is sufficient to activate the PLCcalcium          pathway          Btkdeficient B cells are defective in BCRinduced          PLC phosphorylation and calcium mobilization             In particular the sustained PLCcalcium responses are          impaired A model has been proposed in which Btk controls          calcium influx across the cell membrane by modulating          PLC activity and thus IP levels    Here we          tested whether BtkER activation was sufficient to          activate the PLCcalcium pathway          Btkdeficient cells expressing either WT or kinase          inactive BtkER were treated with HT or anti and          PLC phosphorylation was analysed by Western blotting          Fig A Upon treatment with HT a sustained PLC          phosphorylation was induced in cells expressing WT BtkER          that was not observed in cells expressing kinase inactive          BtkER Fig A As a further control HT treatment of          Btkdeficient cells expressing Btk without the ER          domain did not induce PLC phosphorylation Fig B          lanes  This demonstrates that the HT response is          specific to BtkER Interestingly the slow kinetics of          PLC phosphorylation in response to BtkER differed          markedly from the fast transient kinetics in response to          BCR crosslinking compare Fig A lanes  with Fig          B lanes  The slow BtkER kinetics are consistent          with data derived from Btkdeficient cells in which          sustained BCRinduced PLC phosphorylation calcium          mobilization and MAPK activation are impaired but the          initial responses are relatively normal and appear to be          driven by Syk activity reviewed in reference            Additionally the sustained PLC phosphorylation induced          by BtkER is in agreement with the idea that Btk does not          activate negative regulatory pathways that turn off the          signal rather it is Lyn that is thought to be largely          responsible for this aspect of BCR signaling            To determine whether BtkER is sufficient to induce a          calcium flux cells were loaded with indo  and the          concentration of intracellular free calcium monitored by          FACS analysis Cells were treated with HT andor anti          as outlined in Fig C Strikingly upon treatment with          HT WT BtkER induced a rapid calcium mobilization that          was at a low level but sustained Fig C This pattern          differed from that seen in response to BCR crosslinking          where an initial large transient increase in          intracellular calcium was followed by lower but sustained          levels Fig C These kinetics are similar to those seen          for PLC phosphorylation Figs AB again consistent          with the idea that Btk regulates the sustained phase of          calcium mobilization No additive or synergistic effect          of both HT and anti was observed Fig C This data          indicates that BtkER activation alone can induce          intracellular calcium mobilization and is consistent with          a previous study that showed crosslinking of a          constitutively membrane associated CDBtk chimera to          induce a calcium flux            In order to evaluate whether BtkERinduced calcium          mobilization was due to calcium release from internal          stores or calcium influx across cell membrane calcium          release activated channels CRAC cells were pretreated          with EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium Fig D note          change in scale within Fig Dand compared with Fig C          In response to anti treatment of cells expressing WT          BtkER the sustained elevation of intracellular calcium          was completely blocked in the presence of EGTA whereas          the initial transient increase was only slightly          impaired Similarly in response to HT treatment the          sustained increase in intracellular calcium levels was          abrogated in the absence of extracellular calcium Fig          D This suggests that BtkER may induce calcium release          from intracellular stores which subsequently results in          calcium influx across CRAC Our data is consistent with          that of Fluckiger           et al   who proposed that Btk          controls BCRinduced calcium signaling by regulating          PLC activation IP levels and calcium store          depletion          Fig Cshows that kinase inactive BtkER was unable to          induce a calcium flux which in common with the PLC          data Fig A suggests that kinase activity is required          for BtkER function However in the context of signaling          through the BCR we surprisingly found that kinase          inactive BtkER could reconstitute calcium mobilization          in these Btkdeficient cells Fig C This was not an          artefact of the ER domain since nontagged kinase          inactive Btk could also restore BCRinduced calcium flux          data not shown In addition we have found that kinase          inactive Btk can reconstitute BCRinduced ERK MAPK          activation but not PLC phosphorylation Tomlinson          Bolen and Johnston unpublished data This suggests that          Btk can function independently of catalytic activity          perhaps as an adapter protein and that Btkinduced PLC          phosphorylation is not essential for PLC activation          The mechanism may involve stabilization by Btk of the          PLC complex or signalosome   in an optimal          conformation or subcellular location Upon BCR          stimulation Btk is thought to be recruited to PLC via          the adapter protein BLNK as BLNK can associate with the          SH domains of both PLC    and Btk            Membrane localization of this complex is required for          PLC activation   but the mechanism by which this          is achieved is presently unknown reviewed in   It          is conceivable that a Btk PH domainPIP interaction is          important for membrane localization of the complex and          that this function is independent of Btk kinase activity          However it should be noted that reconstitution of          calcium mobilization in Btkdeficient DT cells by          kinase inactive Btk was not observed in a previous study            The reason for this discrepancy is not clear but          may be due to the different mutations that were used to          generate kinase inactive Btk in the two studies In the          present study we used a KE mutation K is the          invariant lysine known to be essential for enzymatic          activity of protein kinases In the study of Takata and          Kurosaki   Btk was rendered catalytically inactive          by an RQ mutation Since K is located on the          smaller NH            terminal lobe of the kinase domain          whereas R is part of the larger COOHterminal lobe          it is possible that the two mutations differentially          affect the capacity of kinase inactive Btk to function as          an adapter in the activation of PLC                          BtkER is sufficient to activate ERK and JNK MAPK          pathways          BCRinduced activation of the ERK and JNK MAPK          pathways is impaired in Btkdeficient DT cells but p          MAPK activation is unaffected   The precise role of          Btk in the activation of MAPK pathways is not clear but          these findings suggest that Btk is required for ERK and          JNK activation We therefore examined whether BtkER is          sufficient to induce ERK and JNK activity          In Fig A Btkdeficient cells that express either WT          or kinase inactive BtkER were treated with HT or PMA          as a positive control and ERK activity was assessed by          immune complex kinase assay using MBP as an exogenous          substrate In response to HT WT BtkER but not the          kinase inactive protein induced ERK activity which          increased over the time period examined Fig A The          kinetics were somewhat different to those seen with          anti stimulation where maximal ERK activity is          detected within min and is sustained for up to min            However BtkER was clearly able to induce sustained          ERK activity and this coupled with the findings that in          Btkdeficient cells the sustained response is impaired            suggest that Btk activation may be responsible for          the prolonged ERK activation normally detected following          BCR crosslinking Interestingly kinase inactive BtkER          was able to restore ERK activation in the context of          anti stimulation Fig A lanes  and  This effect          of kinase inactive Btk is consistent with the previous          calcium data Fig C and supports the idea that Btk          can perform a kinaseindependent adapter function          In Fig B JNK activity was measured by Western          blotting whole cell lysates with phosphospecific JNK          antiserum This antiserum detects phosphorylation of JNK          at sites T and Y which correlates with JNK          activation Addition of HT to cells expressing WT          BtkER induced JNK phosphorylation to a level that was          similar to that seen with anti treatment Fig B lanes           or with both HT and anti Fig B lane           However we did not detect JNK phosphorylation following          HT treatment of cells expressing kinase inactive BtkER          Fig B lanes  The weak JNK phosphorylation in          cells expressing kinase inactive BtkER in response to          anti or both HT and anti Fig B lanes           suggests a partial adapter function for Btk The control          treatment with PMA and ionomycin induced JNK          phosphorylation in both cell types Fig B lanes  and           From these data we conclude that BtkER is          sufficient to activate the JNK pathway in B cells                          BtkER is sufficient to induce DT cell          apoptosis          A major biological response of B cells to BCR          crosslinking is apoptosis a function that is strongly          induced in DT cells The mechanism of apoptosis          induction is not clear but is dependent on the expression          of Btk    We therefore tested whether the          conditional form of Btk alone can induce apoptosis in          DT cells          In Fig C Btkdeficient cells expressing either WT or          kinase inactive BtkER were treated with HT andor          anti for  hours Apoptosis was quantitatively          measured by the TUNEL assay which detects double          stranded DNA breaks that are a hallmark of apoptosis          Remarkably WT BtkER induced apoptosis to a similar          extent to that seen with BCR crosslinking Fig C          despite the fact that PLC phosphorylation calcium          mobilization ERK and JNK were relatively weakly          activated Figs  AB However it is clear that the          amplitude and duration of signaling responses can control          differential activation of transcription factors For          example in B cells NFB is activated by a large          transient calcium flux whereas NFAT is activated by a          low sustained calcium plateau   Thus in DT cells          BCRinduced apoptosis may be largely controlled by          transcription factors that are themselves activated by          low sustained signals which the BCR and BtkER can          activate equivalently          A functional kinase domain was required for          BtkERinduced apoptosis as kinase inactive BtkER          failed to induce apoptosis in response to either HT or          anti stimulation Fig C Interestingly a low level          of apoptosis was observed in response to both HT and          anti in cells expressing kinase inactive BtkER Fig          C This again suggests an adapter function for kinase          inactive Btk which here was facilitated by HT The PMA          and ionomycin control induced apoptosis in both cell          types data not shown                          BtkERinduced calcium mobilization ERK and JNK          activation and apoptosis are dependent on PLC          Biochemical analyses of Btkdeficient cells have          suggested that PLC is a downstream substrate of Btk             However the importance of PLC in Btk signaling          has not been explored In particular it is not clear if          the capacity of Btk to connect to downstream signaling          pathways such as calcium mobilization MAPK activation          and apoptosis is mediated through PLC or whether it          can occur via other pathways In particular recent          reports have suggested that in addition to PLC          activation Btk may function in PI kinase activation          cytoskeletal reorganization and DNA transcription Btk          was shown to be required for normal phosphorylation of a          novel adapter protein named BCAP which couples          BCRactivated PTKs to PI kinase activation   Btk          may also regulate cytoskeletal reorganization by          phosphorylating the WiskottAldrich syndrome protein          WASP   which plays a role in actin polymerization          Finally Btk has been reported to shuttle to the nucleus          and may function in transcription by binding the          transcription factors Bright and BAPTFIII               Thus Btk may have multiple targets and it is          not known which Btkinduced signals are transmitted via          PLC          To address these questions we have expressed BtkER in          parental and PLCdeficient DT cells Parental DT          cells were considered a better control than the          Btkdeficient cells used previously Figs  as both          PLCdeficient and parental cells express endogenous          chicken Btk Thus parental and PLCdeficient cells were          transfected with kinase active BtkER and stable clones          selected that expressed equivalent levels of BtkER as          measured by antiBtk Western blotting of whole cell          lysates Fig A          To test whether PLC is required for BtkERinduced          calcium mobilization parental and PLCdeficient cells          expressing BtkER were treated with HT andor anti          or ionomycin as a positive control Fig B BtkER          induced a sustained calcium signal in parental cells but          not in PLCdeficient cells Fig B suggesting that          BtkER modulates calcium signaling by affecting PLC          activity Consistent with previous data no calcium          mobilization was observed in PLCdeficient cells in          response to anti   but as expected a calcium flux          was detected in response to ionomycin that bypasses          receptorproximal signaling events Fig B These data          argue against the possibility that BtkER directly          controls a CRAC Instead our data are consistent with          the model that BtkER indirectly controls calcium          signaling by regulating PLC activity and thus IP          levels and calcium store depletion              In Fig we have tested whether PLC is required for          BtkERinduced ERK and JNK activation and apoptosis Two          different BCR signaling pathways can result in ERK          activation in DT cells namely a PLCindependent          GrbSos pathway and a PLCdependent pathway that          requires protein kinase C   In Fig Awe found that          BtkER activated ERK MAPK in parental but not in          PLCdeficient cells lanes  and  Thus BtkER          appears to induce ERK activation through its capacity to          activate PLC and not through a GrbSos pathway In          response to a min treatment with anti ERK          activation was detected in parental but not in          PLCdeficient cells Fig A lanes  and  but          control PMA treatment activated ERK in both cell types          Fig A lanes  and  Transient ERK activation  to          min after anti treatment can be detected in          PLCdeficient cells   These kinetics are identical          to those observed in Btkdeficient cells   Together          with our BtkER data this suggests that BtkER controls          sustained ERK activation in B cells by regulating PLC          activity          The mechanism by which Btk connects to the JNK pathway          is not clear One possibility is that Btk can directly          activate components of the MEKKSEKJNK signaling          cascade This pathway is controlled by the small          GTPbinding protein Rac and in DT cells Rac is          essential for BCRinduced JNK activation   Thus          another possibility is that Btk might directly regulate          Rac activity Alternatively since the combination of          protein kinase C and calcium signaling is sufficient to          activate JNK    Btk could activate JNK indirectly          through activation of PLC In Fig Bwe show that          BtkERmediated JNK activation is dependent on PLC          Upon HT treatment phosphorylated JNK was detected in          parental cells but not in PLCdeficient cells Fig B          lanes  and  PLCdeficient cells also failed to          activate JNK in response to anti treatment or a          combination of anti and HT Fig B lanes           whereas parental cells did activate JNK following these          treatments Fig B lanes  In response to PMA and          ionomycin activated JNK was detected in both WT and          PLCdeficient cells Fig B lanes  and  These          data are in agreement with previous reports that document          the requirement for PLC in BCRinduced JNK activation            Moreover the data suggest that BtkER activates JNK          by a mechanism that is dependent on PLC rather than          through activation of more downstream elements of the JNK          cascade          Apoptosis is a major biological response of B cells to          BCR crosslinking and Btk is clearly necessary for this          effect in DT cells    Here we have shown BtkER          activation to be sufficient to induce apoptosis in DT          cells Fig  In Fig Cwe have investigated the          mechanism by measuring BtkERinduced apoptosis in          parental and PLCdeficient cells Twentyfour hours          after HT treatment apoptosis was detected in WT but          not in PLCdeficient cells Fig C The response of          parental cells to HT was consistently lower than in          response to anti Fig Cand data not shown This is in          contrast to the Btkdeficient cells analysed earlier Fig           where HT and anti yielded an equivalent apoptotic          response This partially impaired function of BtkER in          parental cells compared to Btkdeficient cells in          eliciting a biological response may be due to the          presence of endogenous chicken Btk that could compete          with BtkER for optimal subcellular location Apoptosis          was not detected above background levels in          PLCdeficient cells that were treated with anti or          both anti and HT Fig C This is consistent with          reports that PLC is necessary for BCRinduced apoptosis            Apoptosis was detected in parental and          PLCdeficient cells in response to the control PMA and          ionomycin treatment Fig C These data suggest that          BtkER induces apoptosis in DT B cells by a          PLCdependent mechanism          In DT B cells apoptosis induction by BtkER may be          a consequence of its capacity to activate JNK since in          these cells JNK activation correlates more closely with          apoptosis than does ERK activation In particular we          have found that Btkdeficient DT cells reconstituted          with Txk an atypical Tec family PTK fail to undergo          BCRinduced JNK activation Tomlinson and Johnston          unpublished data and apoptosis   but ERK activation          is relatively normal   In contrast to the          proapoptotic role for Btk in DT cells Btk appears to          play an antiapoptotic role in mature B cells           in vivo  The mechanism may involve          Btkdependent activation of the transcription factor NF          B    and subsequent upregulation of the          antiapoptotic protein BclX           L             Previous studies have shown that DT cells deficient          for Btk and PLC have similar BCR signaling defects          Readouts have included calcium mobilization and apoptosis             MAPK activation    and NFB activation            In addition mice deficient for Btk and PLC have          similar defects in B cell development and function          reviewed in   These findings have lead to the          hypothesis that Btk and PLC are components of the same          signaling unit or signalosome   However these          findings have not proved that Btk connects to the above          mentioned pathways via PLC In the present study while          we cannot rule out the possibility that BtkER activates          PLC in combination with other uncharacterized pathways          our data strongly support the BtkPLC signalosome model          by showing that PLC is absolutely required for          BtkERinduced calcium MAPK and apoptosis responses                            Conclusions        The Btk mutations found in XLA patients and the         xid mouse show that Btk is required        for normal B cell development but the important pathways        activated by Btk have yet to be fully identified In this        paper we show that a conditional form of Btk BtkER is        sufficient to activate many signaling pathways downstream        of the antigen receptor including PLC phosphorylation        calcium mobilization apoptosis and ERK and JNK activation        Our findings clearly indicate that all of these        BtkERmediated responses require PLC In future studies        BtkER may be a useful tool for the identification of Btk        phosphorylation sites on PLC and for the discovery of        novel substrates                    Materials and methods                  Cells
