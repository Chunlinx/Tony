            you want to start or should i start   uh yeah you go ahead   okay lets see uh i think that uh i i think that trials by jury are a good idea i just think the concept of multiple attempts uh at trial is when uh with when theyre always saying oh well uh uh i want to appeal i want to appeal i want to appeal i i think multiple appeal is what our real problem is its not the not the the twelve man jury trials uh think that that i i would not be totally adverse to the concept of of uh of uh i guess uh uh judge trials either uh i think our our we have a real big problem with litigation we we spend too much of our time litigation in our legal system and   oh yeah its its just incredibly incredibly complex uh       uh i i dont have any problem with the idea of having the jurors although it is a bit disappointing to see the attorneys manipulate the process by uh raising so many objections to jurors so that they can try and get for their client um a jury slanted one way or the other i mean you can sit there and dismiss people for for trivial reasons and and that takes up a good deal of time too um the the thing i find sort of disappointing about uh a lot of this is that   umhum   often a judge uh and and you hope you get one thats thats really rational and and looks at uh each case separately youd like to be able to give them some flexibility to be able to sentence uh if its a really awful crime to really put the person away for a long time uh or if theres a lot of intent there and its obvious put them away on the other hand you know maybe to to change the sentencing slightly uh that youd like be able to see them give a different kind of punishment uh not necessary community service thats getting a little bit overworked but but but rather some of other sort of of restitution rather than simply putting them away behind bars   umhum uh trial well one thing is we do not have a trial by peers anymore uh thats that that is gone gone gone out gone out the door for one thing the very first thing a lawyer attempts to do is get an ignorant jury as part of in fact as part of the process theyre not supposed to know anything whatsoever about the trial   oh yeah   so particular so particularly for famous trials what that indicates is that the only people who are really at that jury are idiots     people that have been on the moon   right only ignorant people and that means low IQ generally  wherein thats not thats not trial by jury now i guess thats that thats become less so ive noted that um uh the last couple times that ive had to go by jury theyve actually selected intelligent jurors now i i im not so sure that would be true if it were a trial of uh of uh some notorious notoriety notoriety notoriety uh but in the case of the normal trials its much much harder than it used to be to than to get out of it so they do try not to let uh excuses get you out of uh trials now   oh yes my my   you can delay it but you cant get out   oh thats that and and thats actually pretty good my my mother recently uh uh had jury duty uh down in in Texas and uh   umhum   the the judge would not hear any excuses i mean from anybody uh he didnt care if they had doctors appointments or anything he said youre youre here in the pool and youre going to serve but when it came time for and and it turned out it was a rape trial   umhum   uh and the uh uh the attorney asked my mother well uh how do you feel about this and she told him quite frankly that she thought that the punishment should be extremely severe for rapist and then   umhum   the guy began to ask um what does your husband do for a living well hes retired Air Force ah was he retired law enforcement Air Force they they dismissed her on the grounds that they didnt want her that her husband could have been seen as being in law enforcement even though he was a programmer  in the Air Force       they wanted to stay away from anybody that might even have a smidgen of law enforcement so even though she was there to do her duty to serve   umhum   she was dismissed on the grounds that she might possibly remotely have some prejudice and thats       my mothers fairly well read she didnt actually know about this local case it was of rather small import uh but i would agree with you that that not necessarily does somebody have to be ignorant not to know but theyd have to have met   umhum
