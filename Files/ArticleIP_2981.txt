                                 All Work No Play            What tedious work it isconfessed a spinster aunt tending to her fatherless nieces and nephews in The same things over and over It requires a load of patience and I amprincipled against showing any impatience to little folks lest it should lessenmy influence This mid th century godsendwhose letter is quotedin At Odds Women and the Family in America From the Revolution to thePresent  by Carl Deglerwas an unusual recruit to the enterprise of childrearing She neither romanticized her mission nor vented her frustration on hercharges            Whatcleareyed calm Such sanity has been rare in discussions of child rearing inthe century of the child as the  th was christened at its startby historians and social reformers During the Progressive era expertsextolled parenthood as an ennobling profession set apart from the workadaygrind By the postwar years child rearing was being touted as enriching funAt least nowadays parents are allowed to complain about the burdens theirchildren impose But somewhere along the way theyvewevealso lost allpatience for kids This is the disconcerting news delivered by Arlie RussellHochschild in her important new book a sequel to her bestselling TheSecond Shift Working Parents and the Revolution at Home             In that book Hochschild explored the dilemmas faced bytwocareer marriages in which she found women still shouldered the bulk ofthe child care and housework The Time                Bind charts thetransformation of the workplace in the intervening period and looks at howparents and their children are coping now More provisions have becomeavailable for parttime and flexible employment in successful Americancompanies Does that mean that stressedout mothers and fathers are findingbetter ways to balance their home and work lives The answer Hochschild saysis no Parents are working ever longer hours and are startlingly frank aboutwhy Staying home with the kids is tedious work especially when you could beout earning money in a selfesteemenhancing workplace            Hochschilds subtitle When Work Becomes Home and Home BecomesWork telegraphs her basic argument A cultural reversal of workplace andhome has taken place In an increasingly workobsessed society life on thejob has been feminized thanks to efforts to engineer a homelike caringculture for employees complete with solicitous climate surveys andstressreduction workshops The home front meanwhile has been masculinizedIt runs like the soulless assembly line of old Ruthless efficiencycompartmentalized schedules too little autonomy too much anomie No wonderparents would rather stay late at the office            Hochschilds own work has the air of being effortlesslywell timed Here as she did in The Second Shift  shes grabbed a socialproblem out of the air that ordinary people groan about a great deal andscholars and cultural critics generalize about equally ineffectually She givesthe problem a local habitationAmerco a pseudonymous Fortune  companyrated one of the  most family friendly corporations in America Between and  Hochschild interviewed senior managers middle managers andclerical and factory workers She shadowed six families as they did anddidnt participate in the companys WorkLife Balance Program which offersvarious childcare options and arrangements for working more flexible orshorter workdays She followed the parents home from work met their childrenbecame attuned to the tone of their anxieties And she spoke with theconsultants childcare providers and psychologists new to the payroll of abusiness that had lately converted to the Total Quality philosophy Thatsystem the creation of the management guru W Edwards Deming replaces overtlybureaucratic control with selfmanaging work teams and an emphasis on a commonvision            Employees at every level of Amerco fit Hochschilds profileof distracted parenthood Vicki King a manager who strongly endorses thecompanys family friendly policies works inflexibly long hours herself andjuggles her kids lives like a bustling administrator She looks back on hermaternity leave without any nostalgia Gee guys that was six weeks I didnthave anybody to talk to My friends are at work The things that interest meare at work The work neednt be fascinating to exert its pull Mario aworkaholic whose lowlevel job is stacking and loading boxes loves his kidsbut cant wait for his shift with them to end Its very stressful mentallyand I get sick of hearing myself scream Meanwhile Marios wife Deb refusesto cut down on her work at the factory because she knows it means Mario willcut back on the home front            Deb isblunt about why she likes the status quo despite the stress of arranging childcare At work I can do more of what I want At home I have to do what thekids want You can almost hear her stamping her tiny foot These Amercoparents can sound like well children Indeed Hochschild calls attention to apsychological reversal accompanying the cultural reversal We used to feelimmature at work and independent at home Now its the other way around            According to Hochschild Total Qualitypresumes the worker is a capable adult not a wayward child Demingsemphasis on worker autonomy and a joint conversation about the companysgoals revises the much stricter model of scientific management championed byFrederick W Taylor at the turn of the century in which the workers wereexpected to be obedient drones Hochschilds radical proposal is thathome is where Taylorism now reigns Home is where parents feelinfantilized trapped on a treadmill of efficiency Theyve outsourcedfunctions that used to be part of their responsibility baby sitters tutorscamps creating a fragmented regimen The fastpaced pressure of theiroverscheduled lives has produced a balkiness in their hurried childrenand intheir own harried selvesthat they feel helpless to deal with            But isthe Total Quality workplace really as homelike as Hochschild claims And is theTaylorized home front quite the downsized operation she describes Her ownevidence of parents fleeing a world of unresolved quarrels and unwashedlaundry for the reliable orderliness harmony and managed cheer of workpoints to a diagnosis that is if anything more disconcerting Perhaps parentsare eager to go to work not because it gives them autonomy but because it letsthem be safely and comfortably childlike At home they face the dauntingchallenge of being superadults Hochschild acutely observes that what BenjaminSpock did for child rearing Total Quality is doing for work But Spock wasnot pace his critics a permissive advocate of giving the child realpower or of giving parents an easy break He envisioned the parent as thefriendly boss vigilantly and solicitously manipulating a naturally docilechild            At work Deb and Mario dont really get to do what theywant only to enjoy what they have to do They have been given satisfyinglydiscrete tasks for which they are rewarded with boosts to their selfesteemTheir needs are defined and ministered to support is constantly made availablein the form of organized workshops and counseling sessions The goal is notindependent selfreliance but a more internalized sense of dependence on thecompany            At homeDeb and Mario and the rest of uswhether Amerco employees or Slatefreelancers with children like medont exactly fit the model of mererepetitivemotion machines Were more like Total Quality bosses and werejust what many newstyle CEOs are overwhelmed by a vast therapeutic mandate tokeep control while dispersing power and to ensure not just the health but thehappiness not just the productivity but the loyalty of our charges Whatsstriking as Sharon Hays recently pointed out in The Cultural Contradictionsof Motherhood  is how tenaciously we cling to intensivemotherhood as she calls this ambitious mission despite its increasingimpracticality and despite how guilty it can make us feel            The truth is that home hasnt suddenly becomework It has always been workendless work and such close restraint Thesame things over and over No recognition ceremonies for tasks well donefew clearcut goals or tidy limits to responsibility Professionalizing andromanticizing that work as experts and parents have tried to do throughout thecentury has not made childrearing more spiritually satisfying or relaxing Ithas made it more anxietyinducing            Hochschild wants to say thatwe can reclaim safe haven in our family life from a marketdominated world buther idea of a solution ends up sounding like the ultimate triumph of thecommodified mentality In vacuous Demingese she announces that we need tolearn from public debate about the need for emotional investment in familylife in an era of familial divestiture and deregulation Actually Taylorismmight be more in order More fathers need to buckle down on the home frontwhich would improve the attitude and motivation of mothers too And parents ofboth sexes should remember that growing children are the fastestpacedAmericans of them all Surely that is paradoxically the most persuasivereason to slow down a bit at work and hang out more at home The kids will begone in no time
