               yes   uh crime is our subject   umhum   have you ever been accused of a crime   have i um no i guess not   i havent either really i guess other than you want to count car accidents or something like that   yeah   uh they asked for solutions uh   yeah thats it   ill ill be ill be very out forespoken here uh the Arabs dont do everything in the world right but gosh they sure dont have too many repeat offenders over there   thats true thats true they uh in in fact uh also i dont know if youre familiar with the Japanese method of of dealing with crimes   uh no i no im not   but they dont they have an extremely low rate extremely low especially considering the uh the density of the population and stuff um they have uh they have this this sense of of family thats very important to them and and family honor and what they do the the main punishment the most effective portion of their punishment is that they take and publish the offenders name in a newspaper that gets spread all over the country and especially in the region that theyre in   and the familys name too   it well it gives the the persons name and the family is typically so embarrassed that they have to they sell their house they leave they leave the region and move to to the opposite end of Japan of Japan and so it shames the entire family including the grandparents and and maybe aunts and uncles     yeah thats similar to what was this town maybe it was here in some place that on prostitution   uhhuh   when they caught a uh a a a customer trying to solicit a prostitute either way however you wanna say it they would publish the names of the customer and address of the customer in the newspaper   right     there are a lot of divorces lot of family counseling going on but prostitution went down in that city     i im willing to bet yeah yeah   it just about killed the business  well publicity huh it doesnt work over in this country does it   uhhuh yeah well well you know the thing i guess the thing is is you know with the uh the in part uh one of the things to blame is the disintegration of the family in general and and the importance of the family and and and thats   yeah yeah   but you know you cant just magically push a button and make that come back i guess but uh   uh if you yeah if you can wanna compare crime rates by divorce and and single parents and everything else im sure theyll be at a direct proportion to it   probably uh related   uh unfortunately uh   but incidentally incidentally um i just uh just just reading in the newspaper about um uh this theyre i dont know they were moving some of the uh highway uh things in here in Texas recenttly the offices   um   and they had ranked Dallas as being uh seven out of seven on scale of of quality of life and i assume that that that includes that includes crime nowhere nowheres else nowhere else in the state was above about a three point two yeah and and and and Dallas was a seven point O   seven for Dallas if if you live but we cut them off at five hundred a a year and January first we had three in one day   yeah   i swear uh   i i really yeah i really i thought it was pretty surprising   i think Austin should be seven of seven that is i went to school and graduated from UT and oh its hey if i  if i hadnt stayed in Austin i shouldve gone to Stephenville Texas ill tell you   yeah yeah well they they uh even even Austins had its share of of nasty crimes recently right with the with the sort of senseless murder of these girls at the um   um   at uh the ice cream parlor guy just walked in and uh   umhum pull the trigger   yeah i guess so   well obviously in Texas we let them out too soon   but you know look at the whats the cost of keeping them in its something like uh uh yeah its like twenty thousand dollars per per year to keep somebody in jail   astronomical did you see where the private ventures that built the jails and theyre gonna help alleviate the overcrowding conditions are dont have any customers   hum nobody wants  the city or the the government doesnt wanna let them do it     who i i guess   huh   it looks to me like you know whether you you you get government out of it and give it to private enterprise its done cheaper and more economical and more efficiently put the profit motive in front of anybody and all of a sudden it it works   yeah all of a sudden it works huh   isnt that awful no its not thats what makes just customer go around you know i was telling a guy from IRS and and i said something about profit he said thank goodness for profit i said i beg your pardon he said yeah  Internal Revenue Service we tax profits  i wouldnt have a job if there wasnt any profits   yeah huh   yeah yeah thats true you rather have people to cry to yeah but i dont know you know i mean obviously you know obviously some more jails isnt really the solution either i dont know i mean that doesnt seem to be   um well maybe we ought to um   terribly effective   put them in these Air Force bases that are closing and utilize those you know   yeah well theres thereve been several you know those those kind of died on the vine they were there were separate proposals around to do that kind of thing and i havent heard anything about them recently and maybe maybe im the one that just hasnt been paying attention   um i read an interesting article in Texas Monthly a few months back about this guy that was a uh a guard at the Ellis Unit down in Huntsville   uhhuh   and he was a regular guard a a what they call a new boot or something like that and one thing led to another somebody asked for light of a cigarette or a cigarette and before long he was running dope for them and he got caught and now hes in prison himself   uhhuh   and the the article purpose of the article was just to emphasize that nobodys above it um   yeah  yeah i know
