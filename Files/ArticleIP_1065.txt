                                 Telecommunications Reform            The United States is in themidst of something called telecommunications reform What is it and how isit going            TheTelecommunications Act  passed in February  was the firstcongressional overhaul of telecommunications policy since  The new lawpromised to promote                competition by repealing governmentregulations  A key to this hope is digital technology  which turnsall forms of communicationvoice data or videointo streams of numberswhich can be carried by any communications channeltelephone lines coaxialcable or the airwaves Telecommunications reform is supposed to break downexisting barriers between these media so that for example phone companieswill sell television hookups and cable companies will offer telephone serviceIt is also supposed to end the distinction between local and longdistancephone companies allowing each to go after the others business            The early results have been poor to middling Competitionparticularly in local residential telephone service has been slow to bloomAnd the promised convergence  of the various communications media hasnot arrived Some critics say the problem is that deregulation didnt gofar enough The new law deregulates some aspects of the telecom industry whilemaintaining or even adding new regulations in others Other critics say theproblem is too much deregulation They point especially to a series of giantmergers most notably those reassembling the old Ma Bell telephone monopolythat was broken upthat the new law does nothing to discourage            Thetelecom law rewrites the ground rules in three areas of thecommunications industry telephone service cable and broadcasting                           Telephony  The Telecommunications Act isintended to erode the localphoneservice monopoly enjoyed by the sevenregional Baby Bells  and by ATT for most of a century beforethat It requires the Bells to make their facilitiesthe local loop linking home phones to the telephone networkavailable to competitors so thatthe latter can compete without running wires to every house It also requiresthe Baby Bells to resell their entire bundle of services wholesale to companiesthat might wish to compete on the retail level Customers who want to switchphone companies must be able to keep their old phone numbers and cant berequired to dial extra access codes            The drafters of the lawexpected these provisions to leave the Baby Bells facing a variety ofcompetitors  wireless services small startup local service providerscable and utility companies who own valuable rights of way other BabyBellsand perhaps most importantly longdistance companies such asATT            The act permits the BabyBells to offer longdistance servicesomething the ATT breakup decree hadforbiddenbut only after they have taken  specific steps to open up theirown local phone markets The act also explicitly requires the FederalCommunications Commission for the first time to ensure universalservice guaranteeing that rural and other underserved areas receivetelephone services comparable to those provided in urban areas In May the FCCrolled out a universal service plan which included discounted Internet hookupsfor schools and libraries to be funded by charges on all interstatetelecommunications providers                           Cable  In Congress passed a law deregulating cable prices even forbidding localgovernments from setting rates In  it reregulated cable prices In the act it deregulated them again Starting in April  cable companieswill be able to set their own rates except on basic tier service thenofrills menu of broadcast and publicaccess programming Even for basictierservice the statute allows cable companies to begin charging market rates assoon as they face competition from another local provider The act allows localphone companies to provide video programming to homes whether via cablewireless or through telephone lines and it lets phone and cable companies inmost local markets own up to  percent of one another                           Broadcast  As called for by the new law the FCC in April gave each ofthe nations  television broadcasters a second channel of spectrum spaceCritics call this a giveaway of a public resource worth billions of dollarsThe broadcasters are supposed to use the extra spectrum space for the newdigital signals They are also supposed to give their current spectrum spaceback in  when nondigital TV broadcasting is supposed to stop But thebroadcasters are now pushing to hold on to the additional spectrum space            The act also ends longstanding rules againstcrossownership in broadcasting Anyone may now own an unlimited number ofradio stations subject only to caps on local concentration Likewise for TVstations as long as one owners signals do not reach more than  percent ofthe nations households The new law also makes it easier for broadcasters torenew their licenses and requires TV manufacturers to install parentfriendlyVchips Finally the statute included the Communications Decency Act whichwas struck down this week by the Supreme Court Has deregulation worked During cableTV prices shot up at more than twice the rate of inflationNondiscount longdistance rates rose even faster Local phone rates are goingup too though some of this rise may be attributable to a reduction insubsidies            Competitors have not rushed in The Baby Bells still monopolize thelocalhousehold phone market although competition for business phone customersis more visible ATTthough it is gradually losing market share andlives in fear of Baby Bells entering the marketstill dominates long distanceThe cable companies are facing some increased competition fromdirectbroadcast satellite providers  but they have maintained theirgrip Rupert Murdoch recently abandoned plans for a major satellite assault onthe cable market Ironically price competition has emerged most robustlyamong businesses not addressed by the new law such as DBS cellular phone andInternet service providers            The hopedfor convergence of industries andtechnologies has not come to pass The big cable companiesbalking at thecosts of converting oneway cable to twoway voice lineshave shelvedplans to get into the local phone business Likewise the Baby Bells whofacing economic and technical obstacles have abandoned plans to branch outinto video And the longdistance companies have made only tentative stepstoward invading the local residentialtelephone market Even for a mammoth likeATT the economics of going local are close to prohibitive because thelocal loop is the most expensive part of the entire system to build andoperate ATTs plan announced in February to use wireless systems tooffer local phone service has been widely dismissed as unconvincing It wouldbe much cheaper for the Baby Bells with local facilities and a builtincustomer base to break into the longdistance market But that pointchecklist is a formidable obstacle            Meanwhile mergermania has seized the telecom industry The Justice Department approved amerger between Bell Atlantic and NYNEX in April Time Warner bought TurnerBroadcasting Westinghouse purchased both CBS and radio rival InfinityBroadcasting And UK giant British Telecom purchased MCI Now ATT wantsto merge with SBC which became the nations largest Baby Bell by swallowingPacific Telesis a move strongly opposed by outgoing FCC Chairman ReedHundt
