                    Background        The complete sequencing of the human genome led to the        conclusion that the number of human genes is approximately                This initial estimate was proven        to be incorrect because a comparison of the predicted genes        that were identified in public and commercial sequencing        projects and inclusion of a third cluster of known genes        revealed little overlap among the three groups            Although many of the discrepancies between the different        human genome assemblies are caused by fundamental        disparities in the compilation of the sequence information            it is still evident that the human genome harbors        probably significantly more than  genes and that        these genes are not easily identified This is particularly        true for genes that are either expressed transiently at        low levels or in very few specific cell types Such        elusive genes are underrepresented in cDNA libraries and        consequently also in expressed sequence tag EST        databases Computational annotation of such genes from        genomic DNA becomes additionally challenging when the genes        consist of many scattered small exons        Two pairs of previously unnotated genes encoding        transmembrane proteins have recently been identified based        on their linkage with inherited disorders The first set of        genes transmembrane cochlear expressed genes  and           TMC  and         TMC    were found in a search for        mutations causing dominant and recessive deafness in human        and mouse      Mutations in the second pair of genes         EVER and         EVER  are linked to        epidermodysplasia verruciformis that is associated with an        increased susceptibility to infection with some human        papillomaviruses causing a high risk of skin carcinoma            We noticed that the proteins encoded by these genes are        homologous which raised our interest in testing whether        the genome accommodates additional related genes                    Results                  The mammalian TMC gene and protein family          We used human TMC and TMC murine Tmc and Tmc and          human EVER and EVER sequences in conjunction with          database search algorithms to identify homologous          sequences in genomic and expressed sequence tag EST          databases We iteratively assembled contiguous          theoretical coding sequences for individual human and          mouse proteins We verified regions of individual murine          cDNAs that were not unequivocally predictable with          database information by RTPCR and by sequencing This          strategy resulted in the identification of the murine          orthologues of EVER and EVER and four hitherto          uncharacterized human and mouse proteins Figure  Table           All identified proteins have eight

novel TMC protein family Figures            additional file           The eight mammalian TMC proteins can be grouped into          three subfamilies A B and C based on sequence homology          and

TMC subfamily A proteins          are between  and  amino acids in length Tmc          bears a long carboxylterminal tail that is unlike all          other TMC proteins Figure  The overall identity

transcripts          To demonstrate that all predicted murine TMC genes are          transcribed we performed RTPCR experiments Primer          pairs specific for each TMC transcript amplified products          of predicted length and sequence Figure           Tmc and Tmc mRNAs were detectable in most neuronal          organs and we also found expression in some nonneuronal          organs Tmc transcripts were only detectable in testis          we did not reveal by RTPCR Tmc expression in cochlea          However we were able to verify that Tmc is expressed in          the cochlea by using an organ of Corti cDNA library as a          template for PCR which corroborates the results          presented by Kurima et al           We observed that mRNAs encoding Tmc Tmc Tmc and          Tmc are expressed in most murine organs tested Tmc          mRNA is detectable in thymus and lung we also found          expression of Tmc mRNA in spleen not shown We did not          detect Tmc transcripts in any other organs          investigated          Our expression analysis results are corroborated by an          analysis of applicable TMC ESTs obtained from GenBank          httpwwwncbinlmnihgovdbESTFigure                           Nonmammalian vertebrate and invertebrate TMC genes          and proteins          The high degree of similarity between the          corresponding human and murine TMCs suggests a conserved          function of these proteins This role of TMC proteins may          also be conserved among other species We therefore          decided to investigate the TMC genes of other vertebrates          and invertebrates          We identified eight TMC loci in the Japanese          pufferfish Torafugu           Fugu rubripes  Fr genomic          database httpfuguhgmpmrcacuk Whereas the genome          of           Fugu rubripes is one order of          magnitude shorter than the length of the human genome          the total number of genes is estimated to be          approximately the same      Because of the low          homology of amino and carboxylterminal sequences we          were not able to determine the complete coding sequences          of the eight pufferfish TMC proteins unequivocally          nevertheless we obtained sufficient sequence information          of the central parts of the proteins bearing the          transmembrane domains to classify the eight pufferfish          TMCs into the three subfamilies This subfamily          assignment of individual TMC proteins was further          substantiated by an analysis of the degree of          conservation of intron positions within the           Fugu rubripes TMC gene family          Figure B The           Fugu rubripes genome contains three          TMC

derived from the          phylogenetic relation of the corresponding sequences with          the mammalian TMCs Figure  It is interesting that the          pufferfish genome lacks orthologues of mammalian TMC and          TMC           Fugu rubripes Tmc and           Tmc are clustered equivalent to          the clustering of their mammalian orthologues              TMC genes also exist in invertebrates In GenBank we          identified two mRNA sequences encoding           Caenorhabditis elegans Ce TMC          proteins These mRNAs are transcribed from           TmcAh            Tmc subfamily A homologue  and           TmcAh            Tmc subfamily A homologue  Table                    Whereas the           C elegans genome appears to lack          TMC subfamily B and C genes some insects have genes for          all three TMC subfamilies For example the mosquito           Anopheles gambiae has three TMC          genes           TmcAh            Tmc subfamily A homologue

  TmcAh  Figure  Table           We did not find evidence for TMC genes in genomes and          cDNA databases of yeast and plants                            Discussion        In an effort to define a novel gene family we set out        to identify genes related to         TMC          TMC          EVER  and         EVER       We obtained the        coding sequences of additional homologues in human and        mouse which form the TMC protein family Figures   We        subdivided the TMC protein family into three subcategories        A B and C This subfamilyclassification is based on two        major observations First the sequence homologies among        the different TMC protein sequences of individual species        do cluster into three groups Figures   and additional        file  Second our analysis of the organization of        vertebrate TMC genes implied identical allocation of the        individual TMCs Figure and additional file         On the basis of comparative structural predictions of        all mammalian TMCs we propose a basic topology of the        generic TMC protein with variable intracellular amino and        carboxyltermini a conserved core with eight        membranespanning domains and some variability in the        length of several intra and extracellular loops Figure         This prediction further refines the previously        published TMC protein features      The structural        presumptions for the region flanked by TM and TM were        somewhat ambiguous despite the regions high conservation        among all TMC proteins with a high proportion of apolar        amino acids Figure  We hypothesize that it is unlikely        that some members of the TMC family display an atypical        topology thus we propose that the lipophilic intracellular        loop between TM and TM bears some flexibility which may        enable this domain to integrate into the inner surface of        the phospholipid bilayer or even to pass through the        plasmamembrane Figure         The high amino acid sequence conservation of         identity among the individual human and mouse TMC proteins        implies that mutations that alter the coding sequence in        the corresponding genes are subjected to significant        selective pressure thus advocating that TMC proteins have        important cellular roles Mutations in         TMC are responsible for the        autosomal dominant human hearing disorder DFNA and for        the recessive deafness DFNB     the corresponding        murine gene         Tmc also causes deafness in the        mutant mouse strains         Beethoven          Bth  and         deafness          dn              Bth          Bth mice display altered potassium        currents in early postnatal cochlear hair cells in        particular Ikn and Ikf currents appear to be depressed            This observation led to the hypothesis that Tmc may        participate directly or indirectly in regulating the        permeability of potassium channels     Because of the        high level of conservation of the amino acid sequences        among the eight mammalian TMC proteins Figure         Additional file  we speculate that other TMC proteins        may as well be modifiers of ion channels or        transporters        Our assembly of TMC protein sequences allowed us to        analyze their phylogenetic relationships Figure         Because our analysis did not reveal any TMC genes in yeast        and plants we conclude that TMC proteins are a specific        trait of animals The         C elegans genome harbors two genes        encoding presumptive TMC subfamily Alike proteins both of        which branch off close to the center of the phylogenetic        tree which may indicate similarity with the primordial TMC        protein sequence It is interesting that some of the intron        locations of the two         C elegans genes are conserved when        compared with vertebrate TMC genes in particular with the        TMC subfamily A  Additional file         Additional File         Comparison of invertebrate TMC gene structures        Comparison of the intron

Protostomia and the         Deuterostomia diverged because the        genome of the mosquito         Anopheles gambiae contains one        putative member of each TMC subfamily Interesting in this        regard is that the fruit flys genome only has a single TMC        subfamily Alike gene The vertebrate TMC gene family is        diversified with each subfamily represented by multiple        members                    Conclusions        The recently identified genes encoding the cochlear        transcripts for TMC and TMC and encoding the proteins        EVER and EVER belong to a novel gene family that is        conserved in animals The TMC protein family has eight        members in vertebrates and forms three subfamilies A B        and C TMCs are proteins with a conserved core of eight        membranespanning domains Most murine TMC genes are widely        expressed at relatively low transcription levels some TMC        genes however display more restricted expression        patterns                    Methods                  Databaseaided and experimental assessment of TMC          cDNA and protein sequences          We created and continuously refined contigs of

Discovery System           httpwwwceleradiscoverysystemcom We started this          procedure by using sequence fragments homologous to the          known mammalian TMC proteins Individual fragments were          assembled to longer contigs using multiple alignment          tools such as ClustalW                         httpwwwesembnetorgDocphylodendronclustalformhtmlor          Multalin             httpprodestoulouseinrafrmultalinmultalinhtml          Our sequence determination was continuously refined with          the results of repeated BlastN and tBlastN database          searches with the updated contigs and finally we          extended our search by using genomic databases The          majority of Blast searches were conducted with the          default parameter settings With this strategy were able          to generate presumptive framework contigs for the in          databases less abundantly represented TMC genes Because          of the interspecies conservation of
