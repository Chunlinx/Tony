                                 SameSex Marriage            A judge in Hawaii ruled thisweek that the states constitutional prohibition against sex discriminationrequires it to give legal sanction to samesex marriages Although stateofficials plan to appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court the judgesdecision has revived the controversy that prompted Congress to pass andPresident Clinton to sign the Defense of Marriage Act in September That actdefines marriage for the purposes of federal law as the union of a man and awoman thereby denying federal spousal benefits to samesex partners andpermits states to deny recognition to samesex marriages performed in otherstates            While itis true that a large part of the debate over samesex marriage has focused onthe moral and religious issues marriage is also a legal condition withpractical consequences What advantagesand disadvantageswould becomeavailable to samesex unions if they were officially recognized by thegovernment            The federal tax code  as well as many state taxsystems favors marriages in which one spouse earns most of or all the incomeand penalizes those in which income is equally or nearly equally split betweenthe partners The oftcomplainedof marriage penalty  only exists inthe latter case If both partners have roughly equal incomeswhich may be thecase more often among samesex couples than among oppositesex onesgettingmarried will raise their taxes But a working person who is the sole or mainsupport of a samesex partner could realize a large tax saving if the unionwere legally sanctioned This is especially so if they are approachingretirement                           Social Security soldage and disability programs both favor married people For example when afully insured worker retires the spouse receives half of the workersbenefits This is not the case with unmarried coupleswhich fact gives marriedpartners the edge over their unwed counterparts However if each partner hadhad substantial earnings no marriage benefit would accruethe law requiresthe lowerearning partner to choose between taking his or her own earnedbenefit or onehalf of the partners benefit If only one partner in asamesex marriage had substantial earnings the couple would realize a muchhigher rate of return on that partners Social Security taxes than they wouldhave if unwed or earning comparable incomes            SocialSecurity survivor benefits and spousal benefits under other federalprograms such as veterans pensions apply only to a legal spouse notto an unmarried partner            Though the law does not require that businessesprovide their workers with medical benefits  many employers do soBenefits often cover employees families and some companies now are extendingbenefits to samesex partners as well But benefits for employees and theirfamilies are taxfree When businesses offer benefits to unmarried partnershowever the cost is taxable income If samesex partners were legallyrecognized as spouses the benefits would no longer be taxed            Marriagealso grants a spouse automatic medical power of attorney the legalauthority to make medical decisions for an incapacitated person Unmarriedpartners of the same or opposite sex must hire a lawyer to obtain thisauthority Hospitals also generally bar those who are not members of apatients immediate family from intensive care units  The marriagecontract confers numerous rights to a surviving spouse upon the death ofthe other spouse This includes deciding how to dispose of the deceasedsbody             Marriage also helps the survivor to inherit  In moststates a spouse automatically inherits from a deceased partner In the case ofunmarried couples on the other hand the survivor is entitled to nothingunless the deceased specifically wills it to him or her When unmarried peopledie intestatewithout a willtheir assets automatically go to their familiesBecause married people are considered to be an economic unit moreover thefederal estate tax exempts all assets inherited by a spouse Unmarriedpartners receive no such exemption And where a surviving spouse may sue forwrongful death  or for his or her own emotional distress if the deathis arguably someone elses fault a traffic accident for instance anunmarried partner generally has no such right            Some ofthe most important legal consequences of marriage involve getting out of iteven though it is true that one spouse generally cannot be required totestify against the other in court as long as theyre still marriedDivorce laws divide property and dictate the financial support ofspouses who did little work outside the home These laws vary by state But ingeneral when a marriage dissolves each partner is considered to owneverything heshe brought into the marriage while all assets obtained duringthe marriage except by inheritance are considered joint property Whathappens to joint property Most states have equitable distribution lawsunder which it is supposed to be divided fairly though not necessarily inhalf Only eight states have community property laws requiring that allassets acquired during a marriage be divided equally            A samesex spouse probably couldnt count onany longterm alimony  Since the nofault divorce reforms of thes courts have rarely made such awards in cases involving the dissolutionof marriage Instead courts give the financially dependent spousemaintenance payments which provide support while she or he gains a footingin the work force In practical terms maintenance usually lasts only five toseven years and rarely longer than the marriage did            USimmigration law permits spouses of American citizens to become Americancitizens with only a few exceptions such as sham marriages undertaken for thepurpose of obtaining citizenship Although there are still some legal hoops tojump through marriage would enable the samesex partner of a US citizen toavoid the very lengthy and frequently unsuccessful application process forcitizenship            Aprimary argument against samesex marriage is thatmarriage is an institution for the raising of children But laws pertaining tochildrearing are surprisingly marriageneutral Parents have the sameobligations to support their children regardless of whether they are or everwere married to each other And marriage benefits go to all married peopleregardless of whether they have children Samesex marriage would have nodirect effect on the rights and obligations of parenthood It might wellhowever facilitate gay couples efforts to adopt children            The marriage contract pours asea of benefits and obligations into a single I do As a generic set of lawsfor an extraordinarily diverse group of marriages marriage law burdens somecouples some of the time and benefits most couples most of the time Symbolismaside if government extended marriage to samesex couples the new spouseswould find the pros and cons about the same
