        so it says how do you keep up on news um i suppose i had longer to think about it so ill just uh answer the question i     right   okay   i get almost all well the majority of my news from radio and news letters which is kind of unusual but its a pretty cost effective or time effective way to do it because on TV you have to to put up with all the happy talk and the commercials   yeah   and um then on uh like newspapers well they just take too long to read i use to read news papers very faithfully but i just ran out of time so i tape record National All Things Considered from National Public Radio   right   and i i when i ride the bike my ride my bike to campus i i have it on on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news and to get the other side i get a bunch of news letters from organizations which are mostly on the right   uhhuh oh okay   and how about you   uh thats interesting ive ive never heard of the news letters angle im also an All Things Considered person Weekend Edition whatever   umhum umhum   uh i generally enjoy it although sometimes they have a tendency to do twenty minute features on things id just had soon not hear for about two minutes   hm all the all the AIDS cases in Miami for example   yeah yeah exactly   yeah thats right well i mean the the only thing about them is that they the the their news uh most of the time slanted tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just cant tell really whats happening for i mean take for example the economy where theyve not not not them alone but most of the news media but probably they more more uh strongly than a lot of the others have all these programs about bad economic news and as soon as the news gets good it just disappears you know just just dont report it to the same extent that they do about the bad news   yeah although i think thats probably uh true of most news coverage in general good news isnt news right   hm i dont know but i think that for example after the uh after the uh Iran Iraq War when uh oil oil prices came way down i think it would have been news that oil company profits decreased as im sure they did you just didnt hear about it   right   so um i i get pretty upset with them actually a lot but the only thing is theres no other game in town except for monitor which is you you know about um about the Christian Science monitor program   uh yeah on television or radio   uh no no on on radio they have an hour a day news program but thats   yep oh excuse me i was just going to say up here they they broadcast that i think between five AM and six AM which is a a little before i get up so i usually miss it   im sorry right yeah that it i i dont think they well i mean i know they dont broadcast it here at all and the only way that i can ever listen to that is when im in another part of the country so   right   uh you know i mean theyre theyre really the only game in town and if you want to get different news for an hour or a little bit more than an hour thats thats about the only way to do it which i find kind of unfortunate now there is the McNeil Lehrer Lehrer news hour but thats on TV and then youve got to be sitting there   yeah like like you i often i rarely spend time watching news on TV the uh i gave up on network news years ago and it just doesnt usually work out i have time to watch something more in depth like McNeil Lehrer so   yeah   for me its pretty much a diet of uh All Things Considered and i like to look at the Wall Street Journal at work which uh i think does a fine job it too has a slant but uh   umhum yeah well at least its not the same slant is is All Things Considered huh   yeah exactly and   so thats thats true yeah but now i like the Wall Street Journal if i subscribed well lets see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it its itd be that or USA Today but um they they have good in depth articles mostly on things that have to do with you know credit cards or other things relating to to financial things or or financial planning but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page one   yeah i think uh what is it the fourth column of page one is uh kind of famous in its own right just for human interest stories or business interest stories i mean   umhum right i was discussing actually one of those stories with i just happen to i dont know how i acquired a Wall Street Journal it just happened uh last month there was a story on recycling uh i think actually that was a column one story though     umhum   but uh that talked about the way that uh some communities are trying to recycle so much that they dont have anybody to buy the stuff from them to reprocess and in one locality i think it was Portland ended up burning       the stuff some of it some of it because theres nothing else they could do with it   right back to square one   yeah so it was it was you know good to find out a little bit more than than you would in certainly in any story on network news i mean not just that was the only thing but it was it was good uh discussion of the markets for various recycled products   yeah and thats thats the kind of thing the Journal does best i find i dont have time to read through the whole thing certainly but i find if you just
