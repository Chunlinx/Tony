                                 Booked Up            Following a survey of ourwall space plus of the attic the garage the basement and every closet inthe house my wife has estimated that I own something on the order of booksenough she points out that if I read one a day for the rest of mylife theres an excellent chance I wont live long enough to finish them allStill I keep buying books at an alarming rate Thats only partly because Imattempting to deny my own mortality Its also because buying books is so muchfun these days            Ofcourse there have always been plenty of ways to have fun buying bookssuch asprowling through cavernous usedbook stores in search of hidden treasure orfor Washington DC residents driving three hours through glorious Virginiacountryside to attend the equally glorious Green Valley Book Fair But tworecent innovations have ushered in a true golden age of obsessive bookshopping You can head over to a luxurious store such as Barnes  Noblelounge in comfortable chairs sip coffee and listen to music while youcontemplate your selections Or if you prefer you can shop from a Webbasedservice such as Amazoncom which offers a sophisticated search engine reviewsat your fingertips and best of all oneclick ordering Ordering from Amazonis so easy that I often come away from a virtual visit with the exhilaratingsense of not having the vaguest idea how many books Ive just purchased            By and large the amenities you get from Barnes  Nobleare quite a bit costlier to provide than the amenities you get from Amazon Onereason B  N feels so comfortable is that its spaciousand space costsmoney By letting you browse among physical books B  N invites damage andtheft The wellstocked shelves require a substantial investment in inventoryAmazon avoids most of those costs and it passes some of the savings on to theconsumerpopular hardbacks except for best sellers are typically about percent cheaper at Amazon You can enjoy luxury at B  N or you can enjoyconvenience and low prices at Amazon            So far sogood The market offers a range of options Those options that provideconsumers with sufficient value will thrive in the long run those that failto justify their costs will face extinction If enough consumers are willing topay B  N prices for B  N comfort B  N will prosper if notnot Either way economists will applaud the triumph of consumer sovereigntyLikewise if enough consumers are willing to sacrifice physical browsing forAmazon discounts and convenience Amazon will prosper if not not Once againeconomists will stand ready to endorse the judgment of the marketplace            But theres another potential outcome and itsone that economists would not endorse Some consumers browse in thecomfortable atmosphere of Barnes  Noble but then head home to buy theirbooks from Amazon at discount prices In sufficient numbers such consumerscould spell B  Ns demise Even in much smaller numbers those consumerssurely limit B  Ns growth and its willingness to provide even greatercomforts to its patrons            Its onething to watch a business fail because of its own inefficiency thats just themarket doing its job But its quite another thing to watch a business failbecause its efficiently providing a service for which consumers have managedto avoid paying In the scenario Ive envisioned B  N falls victim to theeconomic equivalent though not I think the moral equivalent of theft Amongthe ultimate losers are book shoppers themselves            How can this disagreeable outcome be avoided One solutionis for the bookstores to own the Web sites B  N wont mind losingbusiness to one of its own subsidiaries And to a certain extent thatshappening It and other large superstores such as Borders has begunoperating Amazonlike sites But as long as Amazon itself remains independentand holds a substantial market share at least a part of the problemremains            Inprinciple publishers could come to B  Ns rescue by pressuring Amazon toraise its prices Amazon relies on publishers for timely book shipments sothe instruments of pressure are readily at hand But publishers might or mightnot want to play that role On the one hand they have a considerable stake inthe success of large and luxurious bookstores on the other hand they alsohave a considerable stake in the success of services like Amazon My friends inthe publishing industry tell me that on balance they wish Amazon well            At other times and in other industries thingshave gone the other way For many years the Schwinn Bicycle Co famouslyrefused to supply bicycles to discounters In recent decades the manufacturersof mattresses patent medicines electronics equipment herbicides and lightbulbs have insisted that their products be sold only at the full retailprice            Why wouldSchwinn want to maintain a high retail price for bicycles The naiveexplanation is that manufacturers always like high prices But thatstoo naive The price Schwinn cares about is the wholesale price and itcontrols that directly A more plausible story is that bicycle shoppers like tovisit fancy showrooms with knowledgeable sales staffs but then buy fromdiscounters Eventually retailers recognize that there is no reward tooffering quality service and the fancy showrooms disappear Customers are madeworse off and so is Schwinn as there is now less reason to prefer a Schwinnbicycle to others            By forbidding its dealers to compete with each other viaprices Schwinn forces them to compete with each other via quality of serviceto the ultimate benefit of consumers That was exactly the reasoning endorsedby the Supreme Court in  when it upheld the right of Sharp Electronics toterminate the dealership of a chronic discounter            In itsSharp decision the court showed an admirable understanding and respectfor economic theory Not so the New                York                Times  whicheditorially called for legislation to overturn the ruling The Timesasked for compromise legislation that would give manufacturers the right toset high standards for service and refuse to supply retailers who dont meetthem while denying manufacturers the right to set prices            But in the presence of competition amongdealers there is no difference between setting a standard of service andsetting a retail price For a given service standard competition will lowerthe price until its commensurate with the service standard and for a givenprice competition will raise the service standard until its commensurate withthe price The Times  prescription is comparable to allowing people tochoose how much to sleep while forbidding them from choosing how much to stayawake the reality is that you cant choose one without choosing the other            So as the Supreme Courtrecognized discounters can be clearly detrimental to both manufacturers andconsumers in the market for electronics or bicycles But when it comes tobooks the analysis is a lot less clearcut and heres why A discount bicycledealer offers nothing but low prices whereas a Webbased discount book dealeralso offers special services you cant get from a bookstoresuch as theconvenience of shopping from home Thats why bicycle and electronics firmshave been so keen to stop the discounters while publishers have laid out atentative welcome mat
