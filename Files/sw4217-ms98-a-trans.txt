            so i think the matrix system would be a wonderful thing for the United States and for um United States being able to trade more easy with other people in the world as the world economy become  much more global just having a standard system of measurement especially one that easy to calculate where G not become one and all kinds of nice stuff like that is just a wonderful advantage   yeah i i agree with you there the metric system is very good im um im um do drafting im im a engineer and ive done drawing and and have to do calculation of fluid mechanics and thing   oh right yeah so you get   and if you ever have to try to do four different conversions to to to try and all  four different type of system with gravitational constant   thats exactly right   and it it just goes it just goes on and on another thing thing is that when doing your drawing you can scale them so much easier thing because their increment of tens so much easier   i remember right   i mean your your life is just uh so much easier i i really think that what can be done differently is that its its to ingrain in our society to shift it all our prototype all our our mode our template  our bolts our threads everything   thats right the tools are thats the expensive thing   the tooling the tooling is is so is so uh in in our system that it just it it just going to take a lot to move it away   that right if you think that every garage corner garage has to buy a whole new set of tools   well most of them have the matrix set now but its its its uh i think its more in the the the the bolts and threads and stuff it self i mean the the screw machine and stuff that makes all those thing theyre just they cost millions of you know thousand hundred of thousands of dollars and thing and thats and i guess maybe they could be resented some of them could be resented but the company the business community just doesnt want to do that i think what really needs to be done is that they need to be educated that in the long run their life is going to be so much easier   right but not only will their life would be easier easier theyll be able to make more money selling things abroad   oh exactly also the trade youre youre exactly right yeah its uh we need to do that and uh as i said the the main thing you know like just in the calculation the the   i know i most calculation i remember when i took fluid mechanics and i the professor was telling us how he wanted us to give the answer and i was he said he wanted them the answer in the English system because the engineers needed to know how to use the English system   exactly   i i treat to give my answer in toundar   in what   toundar which is a um toundar T O U N D A R     oh okay i know what that is yeah   so he he didnt like that very much   yeah its its you know and then that each individual company has their own set of guidelines they they they use but we our  our society in the United State in the global in in the world and the economic seem that nobody really wants to be compatible with everybody else we started out with the computers and weve weve had to fight tooth and nail just to get them to be some what compatible and theyre all just going off and all different all these different directions   right right   and i guess one of the problem is is that the goal isnt to produce produce produce the technology the goal is to produce the buck the the all mighty dollar is so powerful that it just it it just control our destiny   well theres always the conflict between innovation and standardization and theyre its always going to be true that the most advantage advance thing and the thing that has the highest performance for any given application are going to be non standard   umhum   but for the general everyday things that have been worked out the standardization is such an advantage so and something like what side of the road you drive on   umhum   i guess there was a time when that had to be worked out and before very many people were driving it wasnt a problem   umhum umhum yeah well i guess so you just yeah i guess thats thats true i really  like first thought i cant really think of what the different would be the different has to do with uh
