                                 Baraks Hard Place            What a difference a plane ride makes The Israel Ileft on Sunday was a nation queasy about peace talks and anxious about its newprime minister Ehud Barak Baraks governing coalition was already squabblingviciously a party allied with Barak had splintered and collapsed theopposition had called for a noconfidence vote West Bank and Golan settlerswere readying PR campaigns against Baraks peace schemes and my inlaws wereshouting at the television every time Barak came on the screen He wants togive it all away            But landing inWashington on Monday I touched down in the middle of Barak Euphoria Duringhis US visit this week Barak is traveling not by limousine but on a cushionof perfumed air The Israel Policy Forums new poll of American Jews findsalmost universal support for Barak and his peace proposals His American visitincludes a triumphal march through the Sunday talk shows backslapping meetingswith the US president and vice president and glowing newspaper profilesWashington has rarely seemed giddier about a foreign visitor American papershave suggested that peace is just around the corner that Israel is unitedbehind its new chief that final rapprochement with the Palestinians Syriansand Lebanese is just a matter of proofreading the treaties and scheduling a fewceremonial handshakes in the Rose Garden            This discontinuity between the thrill in the air here andthe facts on the ground there to use a favorite Israelism is striking andworrisome America seems to be mistaking the opportunity of peace talks for thereality of a peace treaty The challenge facing Barak in the face of thiseuphoria is the danger of unrealistic expectations says Tom Smerlingdirector of the Israel Policy Forums Washington office            True Baraks election isa welcome event for Israel and its Arab neighbors Benjamin Netanyahu waswidely mistrusted and despised by Israelis and universally mistrusted anddespised by Arabs A majority of Israelis admittedly a narrow one favorspeace talks and Barak is the best negotiator Israel could send to the tableHe has constructed a broad coalition of propeace parties He has assuagedIsraelis by presenting a hard vision of peace Baraks peace with thePalestinians will be a divorce not a marriage as former Prime Minister ShimonPeres imagined But while Barak may be the best prime minister to bring peacethat does not mean peace will come Enormous obstacles remain obstacles thatan exultant America should stop and remember             The chasm between Israeli and Palestinian visions ofpeace Peace with Syria is a relatively easy matter for Israel Israelwill surrender the Golan except for a surveillance base the territory willbe demilitarized and Syria will stop Hezbollah guerillas from operating inSouth Lebanon            The Palestinian problem is much more difficultBarak and Arafat are willing to conduct final negotiations but thatdoes not mean their positions can be reconciled Barak may have been electedlargely because he was not Netanyahu but Baraks publicly stated peaceproposals are similar to Netanyahus The Palestinians demand all the WestBank Jerusalem as their capital the right of  and  refugees toreturn full statehood and Israeli withdrawal from settlements Barak rejectsall these conditions except perhaps statehood            Even the most optimisticMiddle East analysts succumb to paralysis when they try to resolve thesedisagreements Barak is likely to concede the Palestinians a capital justoutside Jerusalem and to allow some refugees to return to the West Bank thoughnot to Israel proper but he certainly wont give up all the West Bank or evena square inch of Jerusalem The Palestinians who grabbed the moral high groundwhen Netanyahu sabotaged negotiations have so far shown little willingness tomoderate their demands The Israelis and the Palestinians understandablydelayed resolving these issues until final status talks because they wereintractable Now final status talks have arrived and lo and behold the issuesare still intractable Already some are predicting the final talks wont befinal at all Israel and the Palestinians will again kick the questions ofJerusalem and refugees down the road             Heightened ArabJewish tension Themutual loathing and mistrust that divides Israelis and Palestinians is badenough already but the peace process promises to exacerbate it Serious peacenegotiations are expected to spark antiJewish terrorism by Palestinianextremists bent on sabotaging a halfaloaf agreement Jewish extremists willbe no happier Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank may leave Jewishsettlements encircled by Palestinian territory Surrounding wellarmed andenraged Jewish settlers with Palestinian land is a recipe for disasterAntiJewish terrorism during the peace talks of the mids contributed to thePeres governments defeat Baraks fragile coalition is equally vulnerable ifterrorism or settler violence surges Support for peace could dissolve             Heightened JewishJewish tension The peace processalso endangers intraJewish relations which are already fraught ReligiousJews are feuding with secular Jews Sephardic Jews are battering the Ashkenaziestablishment about decades of discrimination Russian immigrants are fightingwith the Orthodox rabbis Any Palestinian agreement will probably require Barakto remove or consolidate West Bank settlements Any Syrian agreement willundoubtedly require Barak to remove all Golan Heights settlements There are Jews on the West Bank and  in the Golan Most of them stronglyoppose any plan to uproot them            Israel had a nervousbreakdown when Menachem Begin evicted just  settlers from the Sinai duringthe early s Todays settlers especially West Bankers are far moremilitant than their s counterparts Some religious settlers deny theauthority of the Israeli government and believe it is their biblical duty topopulate the West Bank Judea and Samaria They will not leave quietly Itis difficult to conceive how Barak can remove  folks from the Golan andthousands more from the West Bank without fracturing his government             The instability of Syria and the PalestinianAuthority Syrian strongman Hafez Assad is old and ailing His son andheir Bashar is inexperienced hes an ophthalmologist by training Assadsruling Alawites are a tenuous minority only  percent of the populationSyrias former patron the Soviet Union is dead Syrias economy is totallybroken As long as Assad lives he can manage these troubles and keep anagreement with Israel But if he dies its not clear that Syria can controlLebanon or that the Golan border will remain peaceful            The Palestinian situation is more perilous Arafatis also ailing and has no clear successor His authoritarian rule has preventedthe emergence of future leaders and the development of strong civic andpolitical institutions Extremists such as Hamas and moderates are alreadyjockeying for power The Palestinian economy is a disaster devastated byIsraeli limits on Palestinians working in Israel The return of hundreds ofthousands of destitute Palestinian refugees from camps in Lebanon and Jordanwill only compound the economic misery            So if Barak gets his final deal with thePalestinians Israel may find itself with a new kind of problem an autonomousPalestinian state a stones throw literally from sacred Israeli territorythat is sinking into Third World poverty anarchy and civil war This could bea peace even a good peace but it wont be cause for euphoria
