                                 Boycott Nike and Reebok            Two decades ago when I wentfrom a middleclass public high school to a fancy East Coast private college Inoticed an irony The jumbo egos that now surrounded me were less conspicuousthan the gardenvariety egos Id previously dwelt among In my new culturalmilieu it was considered bad form to note that youd made a good grade or toengage in any other obvious form of selfadvertisement Adjusting to this newenvironment I soon began to affect a fairly convincing air of humilitySounds like an impressively deft adaptation I know butreallyit wasnothing            The basicprinciple here is that the higher the socioeconomic class the less conspicuousthe selfpromotion Less conspicuous doesnt mean less chronic and itcertainly doesnt mean less effective On the contrary What my collegeclassmates knew is that as a rule less overt selfpromotion is moreeffective Having an obviously high opinion of yourself threatens and alarmsboth peers and superiors often to your ultimate detriment All of which Icontend explains how illsuited the ethos of innercity teenagers is toeconomic advancement and how big shoe companies such as Nike Reebok andConverse make the problem worse            College basketball coach Al McGuire once said that whereasmany coaches took white players and tried to get them to play black he tookblack players and tried to get them to play white He was alluding to a rarelyspoken but widely known truth There are two cultural styles of basketballwhich we can conveniently label with the familiar code words inner city andsuburban In innercity playgrounds basketball is more conspicuouslyegotistical There is less passing to set up the open shot more driving to thehoop and other forms of mano a mano confrontation More showboatingmore trash talking Vividly humiliating the man guarding you is highlyprized            One can argue about whetherthis style of basketball reflects only the general tendency of lowerincomepeople to selfadvertise conspicuously as described above or reflects alsothe unique historical travails of American blacks The latter Id say Onecan even argue about whether the innercity or the suburban style of play isbetter basketball But one cannot argue about which ethos is more conducive toadvancement in the wider world Like it or not the mainstream American economyis culturally suburban                         Try this thought experiment Two job candidatessit before you One is an yearold version of Chicago Bulls forward DennisRodman There are no visual cues to bias youno tattoos no purple hair nopantyhose Just Rodmans inyourface attitude complete with a sensibilitythat perceives roughly all human behavior as a sign of disrespect Recall hisrecent kicking of a photographer for sitting courtside where photographersalways sit The other candidate is an yearold version of Hakeem Olajuwonthe great Houston Rockets center who though black is a stereotypicallysuburban playerselfless and humble yet exuding quiet selfassurance on thecourt and off Obviously innercity and suburban are ultimately culturalnot racial categories Olajuwon twice won NBA championships with allblackstarting fives that had a suburban playing style By contrast Larry Bird awhite player of lowincome origins was a noted trash talker            OK facedwith the young Rodman and the young Olajuwon whom do you hire CorrectOlajuwon Ergo who would be a better role model for poor black kids CorrectOlajuwon Now which of the two has a big shoeendorsement contract CorrectRodman with Converse            Aside from athletic talent nothing is more helpful ingetting you a big shoe contract than being an asshole There are exceptionsyes such as Detroit Piston Grant Hill who wears Fila shoes But the goodguyshoe icons are vastly outnumbered by the likes of the Seattle Supersonics ofGary Payton Nike and Shawn Kemp Reebok Chicagos Scottie Pippen Nikeand Philadelphia er Allen Iverson Reebok Iverson has done jail time and isfamous for employing his talent in aweinspiring ways that do his team littlegood And humility is not his specialty When he won the Rookie of the YearAward this month he said I thought the award should go to the person who hadthe biggest impact I know we only won  games out of  but if you look atimpact players as a rookie I thought I had the greatest impact Reebokenchanted by Iversons charisma has designed a new shoe in his honor            Reebok isfast displacing Nike as the Darth Vader of the shoe world Reebok sponsors andthus elevates Shaquille ONeal a huge mass of selfabsorption whose teamslike Iversons seldom fulfill expectations ONeals Lakers just got blown outof the playoffs by perhaps the most suburban and ethnically whitest team inthe league the Utah Jazzwhose black superstar Karl Malone is another goodcitizen and great player who gets dissed by the shoe companies ONeal likeIverson in the average job interview            Obviously its easy for me to complain aboutplayers who arent big on selfeffacement or deference to authority Myancestors werent slaves I didnt spend my teens being viewed by merchants andcops as a likely shoplifter Maybe in that sense the behavior of the Pippensand Iversons of the world is defensible But when that behavior is in somesmall way helping to keep young blacks trapped in poverty defending it is notthe liberal thing to do Certainly celebrating it isnt And beyond apoint defending it is patronizing            Nike CEOPhil Knight likes to pose as capitalism with a human face a man devoted tosocial justice Witness Knights ostentatious donation to the legaldefensefund of bluecollar skaterthug Tonya Harding Since Nike doesnt makeiceskating equipment thats the closest Knight could come to subsidizing thatsports biggest asshole Well lets see Knight truly put his money where hismouth is Pick a great basketball role model put him on a pedestal and letthe financial chips fall where they may No Michael Jordan as a great rolemodel            Abit of genuine morality at Nike or Reebok or Converseneednt be vastly expensive Surely Madison Avenue has enough brains to make aHakeem ador a Clyde Drexler ad or a Malone adthat appeals to innercitykids Remember Im not asking for Just Say No ads or any other form ofmoralism Those dont work anyway On the contrary Im asking for ads thatmake their stars look cool thus boosting the prominence of athletes who intheir oncourt conduct and postgame interviews are good influences And Imasking that a shoe companys elevation of someone like Iverson become a sourceof stigma among socially conscious shoe buyers Lets have a real boycott            Which companies to boycott Atough call since no shoe company with a bigname hoops line is wholly withoutblame For now is that we start with Nike and Reebok and let Converse off witha stern warning since Dennis Rodman is its first major offense And rememberWere boycotting not just hoops shoes but running shoes hiking bootssweatpants socks The Nike and Reebok logos are now officially declared badgesof shame Of course it will be hard with those two companies dominating theshelf space of every Foot Locker to sniff out Brooks Saucony Asics Fila orNew Balance But go ahead Just do it
