          hi good morning do you have recycling in Sachse   good morning yes we do weve got um a pickup twice a week that they come out and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it uhhuh   do oh really and its twice a week   uhhuh   really we have recently started uh a bin program here in Plano where uh used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up and now they have uh these large green containers and you have to put your trash that you dont recycle in there and then they havent started curbside recycling yet but theyre but theyre planning on doing it very soon apparently the trucks that they had um lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia  and so that put off the program for a while but uh do you recycle   oh um uh my kids do  put it that way they theyve been recycling cans for extra money so thats thats been their summer money and theyre fixing to go to Disneyland so   do they uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh oh well thats great well thats the way we started too my daughter was going to Camp Goddard um which is through the Plano school system you know in the fall   so yeah uhhuh   couple of years ago and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to babysit so thats how she started she started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and uh aluminum cans and plastics uhhuh uhhuh   really is is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they weigh it or whatever and   no the the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans um the rest of it we just do because   um     my husband has become hooked on recycling and so you know we dont get paid for that but thats okay you know that its its not that much of a bother really you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of two liter bottles     yeah   um and like milk cartons and things like that its amazing how much plastic you generate   yeah i was amazed at how many cans that we got uh because when the kids first went down i said that you know thats great and i was thinking you know maybe id help supplement it you know when they turned them in but   yeah yeah uhhuh   its amazing how many cans you go through   yeah it really is yeah it really is well all that stuff and how much how much we have reduced   and how fast they accumulate   our waste you know that we were generating a week um   uhhuh   i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh theres no way you know were going to have to have pickup twice a week they were real upset but they werent they were only picking up once a week and we said to them if you recycle youll youll you know youll go two weeks without having to put out the green container and uh its its really amazing the other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we dont collect our grass clippings   yeah really   no he he got a little mulcher thing its just a little attachment for the lawn mower   uhhuh   and we mow once a week you know no no more often then that and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the um on the lawn and its amazing its amazing we dont collect any of that and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out   yeah well well we dont ever we dont catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard so if it mows gets mowed i do it normally and i cant mow the yard with the grass catch on it its too heavy   uhhuh yeah   so i just mow i just mow it and leave it and it just soaks in   yeah sure it does sure it does it really does and it actually they say that youre wasting fertilizer if youre not uh if youre catching your grass clippings that thats that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn its amazing   uhhuh yeah oh i like it better doing it well one it cuts down on my mow time anyway and you zip through it quicker   yeah yeah uhhuh thats true thats true thats true well i i really think youre going to get hooked on plastics and paper  before you know it     probably we probably will   its its really not that much trouble we keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage   yeah   and as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near WalMart theyre they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and its really no trouble   uhhuh   and uh i feel like at least were doing something   yeah   you know uh um i read a book one time or a magazine a magazine article and they said something about how you dont realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution but its not if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would save save thousands and thousands of trees a day   really   a day just from not throwing out your newspapers and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know   what what makes me sick is is when they show the the dump sites   uhhuh   you know and and how big they are or like in New York the barges that that go up and down the the river and they dont have any place to put it and it just floats in the and its like ugh   uhhuh yes yeah yeah yeah yeah and thats and thats really not necessary   no   it really isnt if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference it would make a huge impact so im excited about the recycling program in Plano i i cant wait for them to get it started um because that itll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to WalMart it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up um   yeah it its its convenient out here for them to do   now what what do they pick up its just   they pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper uhhuh   oh they do uhhuh and do you have to sort that or do you just put it all in   and they will do the aluminum no you just put it in the one bin and and i guess they do the sorting but um theyll do the aluminum cans too but we dont give them those  the kids keep those so   right right so youre doing that now youre doing the newspapers and the glass oh uhhuh   uhhuh well we dont we dont take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home to to read it so we dont have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass   uhhuh uhhuh   at first when it first started it it it was hard you know because youre just used to throwing everything   uhhuh my husband would come home and go through the trash and say   uh   you threw this away  you know  he would get he would get all upset and id say its just such an automatic reaction and now we think before we throw anything away i mean its really funny we we really     it is   once you get into the habit of it its okay its just its just making it a habit thats hard   oh i know well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they theyre oh no dont do that and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain and and then uh after a couple of days   uhhuh   they take them all outside and i put them in a big bag anyway and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them so thats their activity thing they go out there and crush so   uhhuh uhhuh tha ts fun yeah yeah yeah oh thats a lot of fun thats a lot of fun well thats great well im to hear youre doing that   yeah   i my sister was here recently from Connecticut and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans   oh really
