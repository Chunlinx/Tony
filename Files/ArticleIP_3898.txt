                       r ua c                        Jacob Weisbergs HappyBirthday Heritage Foundation is wrong on one major point In it he wroteHeritage is a taxexempt c organization which means it is notsupposed to lobby Congress This is not true Nonprofit organizations orcs are in fact encouraged to lobby under existing law subject tocertain limitations            When nonprofit organizationslobby they make an invaluable contribution to the publicpolicy processCharities and nonprofit organizations speak for the public interest notprivate interests They often represent large numbers of ordinary Americans onissues like the environment or consumer protection or vulnerable populationswho lack the resources or skills to assert their basic rights            Moreover as serviceproviders charities are often on the front lines combating the worst problemsbesetting our communities Their voices help produce more efficient andeffective public policy Although we might disagree with the HeritageFoundation as a c they are doing nothing wrong by lobbying            Current law does prohibitcs from working for or against candidates for public office and thatis appropriate Nonprofits also are prohibited from using federal funds for thepurposes of lobbying see Office of Management and Budget Circular A but they maylobby using other funding sources such as foundations or their membership            In devising the lawsgoverning nonprofit lobbying Congress recognized that cs should beencouraged to exercise their First Amendment rights Certainly Congress is inno danger of being overrun by Gucciclad lobbyists working for the poor and theenvironment            Weisbergs mistake reflects a common misconception The Washington Postrecently made the exact same error in discussing cs             Reece Rushing OMBWatch                                             Editors noteThe Internal Revenue Code does not encourage lobbying by corganizations but it does allow it under limited circumstances Heres alaying it all out helpfully provided to us by a Washington lawyer who justhappens to be the husband of a Slate editor                                       HotAir                        I read David PlotzsThe NotYet AroundtheWorld Balloonists on a flight from London to LA sittingnext to a New Zealander who had just won a transatlantic rowing race Perhapsthats why I feel Plotzs article is the silliest explanation of the logic ofadventure Ive ever read In particular Plotzs notion that adventures used tobe and need to be driven by practical considerations such as opening traderoutes strikes me as daft While Plotz is right that the number of challengesremaining seems to be decreasingit could hardly increaseI find it almostimpossible to believe that previous recordsetters were driven by the kind ofpractical commercial concerns that Plotz ascribes to Ferdinand Magellan andDick Rutan            If histheory were true Edmund Hillarys ascent of Mount Everest would have beenmotivated by a desire to test new oxygen tanks and Joshua Slocum would havecircumnavigated the world in order rack up frequentsailing miles Yes ofcourse balloons are a uniquely terrible mode of transportation Sticking iceaxes in the sides of mountains is a pretty stupid way to get to  feet aswell The motivation of adventurers everywhere is to achieve something no oneelse has achieved and to derive the pleasure that arises from thatand notincidentally to get famous by writing books about it And the reason why therest of us sit in our armchairs and read about these accomplishments is becausewe wish wed done something as interesting with our time If there is anoccasional practical benefit to these shenanigans so much the better In themeantime the world will probably be content to support the world of adventurethrough an occasional perilous walk to Borders             Ravi Desai                                       Deflating Lindy                        According to David PlotzThe NotYet AroundtheWorld Balloonists Charles Lindberghs crossing wasntjust a stunt It made real the idea of transatlantic air travel By the timeCharles Lindbergh made the first solo crossing the idea of transatlantic airtravel had already been made real by other flyers who had crossed the AtlanticOcean            WhileLindberghs crossing certainly captured the public imagination as some oftodays balloonists have also it did little to advance the technology ofaviation             EdwardEhrlich                                       MustangSally                        JacobWeisbergs No Respect on why the establishment hates Clinton wasoutstanding Of all the obnoxious hypocritical statements he collected theworst was Sally Quinn on why people who have attained a certain social orpolitical position feel dissed by Clinton Lets see Clinton attained hisposition by being elected president Quinn attained hers by marrying her bossAnd hes supposed to suck up to her Another reason for Georgetowns hostilityis that Clintons  tax increase fell hardest on uppercrust types Theylike to talk about their social consciences but Clinton is the first politicalleader in a generation to make them put their money where their mouths are             TomScarlett Hyattsville Md                           RememberVenn                        I wondered if someonewriting for                   Slate                could be dispassionate honest and objectiveabout the browser issue I wish I could say that You Be the Judge fit thebill but I just dont buy it I tried your experiment Yes indeed removethose three dll files and several other files dont work correctly Butrestore those three files without IE  and guess what Everything runsjust fine            So as far as I can see thewhole distinction really boils down to a few overlapping files This is hardlyan existential issue It reminds me of a Venn diagram with two overlappingcircles A and B If Microsoft removes all of A IE  including the littleportion that overlaps B Windows  B is no longer a viable whole            The distinction thatMicrosoft refuses to admit however is that it can and should remove all of Athat is not part of B It can and should include in its operating system thosedll files that Windows  and other applications need The engineers at thatfirm know full well which dll files could and would be needed by otherapplications including the OS            This reminds me of buying acar without a factoryinstalled stereo Just because I didnt buy Fords stereodoesnt mean that Ford left out the battery or the fuse box both of which areneeded for the user to install and operate a stereo after the purchase            Thebullies at Microsoft are simply refusing to obey the judges orders and aretrying to obscure the issue with a lot of techie hot air They should be finedheavily for contempt of court Ultimately I suspect the company will need tobe broken up much as ATT was with the OS division allowed to retain itsnatural monopoly but the other divisions forced to face the same competitivepressures that Netscape and other entrants face             Jim Johnson NewYork City
