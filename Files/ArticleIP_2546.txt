                                 Stop Me Before I Link Again            TicketMaster is suingSidewalkMicrosofts online city guidefor linking to its Web site Ahalfdozen big media companies have targeted TotalNEWS with a lawsuit becausethey say the site is using Web technology to steal their content Suddenlythe ease of linking from Web site to Web site which makes the World Wide Webso useful is generating lawsuits that cloud the right to link            A worldof interconnected information where readers jump from one document to anotherwas first envisioned by engineer Vannevar Bush in  His whirling system ofmotors levers and microfilm is to the Web what Leonardo da Vincishelicopters are to the Chinook CH But you get the idea Bush disciple TedNelson took the idea to the world of digital computers in  calling hiscreation hypermedia and dubbing these jumping points hyperlinks One earlycommercial hypermedia product was HyperCard released with the Macintoshcomputer in  HyperCard allows users to link stacks of informationtheyve written or assembled on computer notecards But the true promise ofhypermedia was linking information across a global network and that had towait until  and Tim BernersLees invention of the World Wide Web            The Webs rapid acceptance owes much to the ease with whichWeb pages can be created And the proliferation of the lawsuits owes much tothe ease with which Web pages can be linked to one another Creating links iseasy because each Web page and each image on the page has a unique address onthe Web called a URL Universal Resource Locator For instance the URL forthis page is httpwwwslatecomwebheadwebheadasp            To see how this all worksfollow me as I build a Web site containing home page A and image B                         A browser loading home page Asees that it refers to image B and loads that too then displays the wholething                         The great thing about this scheme is that ifyou are on a slow connection to the Internet you can tell your browser toignore the images This speeds things up quite a bit click to find outhow            The bad thing about thisscheme is that since every image has a public URL anyone can use it In theexample below some villain has coopted image B for his nefarious andlibelous ends                         The offending page doesnt technically copy or distributethe image in question It just points the users browser to address B Somelawyers think that this may constitute a public display similar to illegallypublishing a copyrighted photograph in a newspaper but this argument remainsuntested            Interestingly if the page simply provides a hyperlink to the image inquestion the law becomes even murkier Entertain for a moment this scenarioIf we at Slate captured your voicemail recording and played it on our sitewithout your permission some lawyers would say that we had violated yourcopyright But if we cited your telephone number instead we wouldnt beviolating copyright lawseven though Web surfers could hear the same recordingby dialing the number Hyperlinks are like telephone numbersbut instead ofdialing them you click on them            The TicketMaster dispute muddles this pointfurther The company is upset not because Sidewalk provided a hyperlink toTicketMasters site but because Sidewalk provided a hyperlink deep intoTicketMasters site What is deep Well the page youre looking at isrelatively deep in Slate To find your way here you probably typed in Slateshome page URL httpwwwslatecom We showed you todays cover then our tableof contents and you eventually clicked on the Webhead link But if a friendgave you the precise URL for this column you could go directly to it So in away the link to this story is a deep hyperlink because it avoids our homepage            This iswhat Sidewalk did It recorded the URLs of TicketMasters transaction pageswhere you buy tickets for specific shows It then placed hotlinks to these URLson its own pages that hype various concerts and theatrical productions Thisangered TicketMaster because it allowed potential purchasers of tickets toavoid ads and promotions on TicketMasters home page and all the intermediatepages you must visit before you can buy a ticket Returning to my voicemailanalogy its as if I cited not only your telephone number but also the codeto skip your clever message hint on most voicemail systems press  Whilethis may not be friendly it doesnt seem like a violation ofintellectualproperty law            While the lawsuit proceeds TicketMaster and Sidewalk haveexchanged some entertaining technological volleys Click for a brief account ofthese            Just as a Web page caninclude an image by citing that images URL so also can it include another Webpage by citing that pages address This technique is called framing Iframed pages in my last Webhead to compare search results from various search servicesSlates lawyer tells me this sort of framing doesnt violate anyones copyrightphew Its called fair use and is comparable to the quotation of a shortpassage of a book in a review            So why did the news sites sueTotalNEWS See for yourself When you click to TotalNEWS a column of icons forseveral news sites appears down the left side of the page If you click sayUSA Today  up pops the USA Today Web site but inside a frameTotalNEWS advertisement remains visible This definitely isnt fair use Ifcourts decide that such framing constitutes a public display or even that itcauses confusion in the market unfair competition then TotalNEWS isviolating intellectualproperty law            As we go to press TotalNEWShas settled out of court For details see this June  WiredNews story
