        so uh i dont know what you mean by camping but i mean tent kind of camping i guess thats what i normally do thats what   yeah yeah well do you   yeah yeah nothing like RVs or anything like that   because uh  my father and i in like back in eighty three we went camping uh camping down the Appalachian Trail   oh really the whole length or uh   no no uh it was just for three days we must have done like uh sixty miles or something   uhhuh umhum was it very crowded out there or   no no not at all but uh you had uh you know there was one part like we were waiting to get some water right and we were looking at where we could get some water and it said you know it was like   yeah   we can either try to get here tonight or just sleep it and try to get there tomorrow morning and we said okay lets just sleep in and try to get there tomorrow morning   uhhuh   and so when we got there  the water that we were supposed to drink wasnt potable like well you couldnt drink it   right   and so what we had to do is we had to get on the trail or on the road   yeah   and start walking down the road and then we found this little hut a couple of miles down that had you know that sold stuff   uhhuh   so we just stopped there uh you know had some breakfast got some water and kept on walking   sure   and then uh my mother who went to pick us up we had a barbecue and it was it was cool it was like you know you see a lot of deer up there   yeah yeah   and uh like one time i opened up the the tent and there was a deer drinking out of a stream   um   and so it was it was cool you know and and it was just uh very tiring though   yeah the last the last big camping trip i was on was uh probably a few years after that but it was in the Pagosa Springs area in Colorado a bunch of us uh from here went up there and uh   okay   and i got hit by the same thing because we thought we were going to be real mountain men and uh we got up there and we had the little pills youre supposed to put in the water and make sure that its potable   yeah yeah   and of course were up you know up above you know fourteen thousand feet or whatever and we said well well how dirty could the water be right you never never think about bacteria or amoeba or anything like that   right   you think well nobodys using the bathroom farther up stream so its got to be all right so we were doing things like uh you know we all had our little collapsible cups and we were going up to where the water was coming over rocks and all that and wed just kind of stick our cups in there and drink and then we were there for five or six days and and and it was neat you know we saw deer and uh   yeah   had to put our uh food up in the in the trees and all that i was the unlucky guy that got up every morning and said well i guess might as well putz around here while everyone else is sleeping so i was usually the guy who had to get it out of the tree and all that   yeah yeah yeah i was uh i told my dad you know it was like listen dad you know that i sleep a lot of hours right      yeah   and so he goes yeah i do okay so he goes you know at least i sleep you know maybe ten hours so if we go to bed at you know eight or something right   right   so he goes well if you go to bed at eight then youll wake up like six in the morning   thats right   and then i go no no maybe i sleep more than ten hours you know and   thats thats right you dont want to be the first one up and have to put the fire on and have to take take care of everything while everyone else is sacked out   yeah   and then if they wake up and you havent done everything its like why havent you done that but uh well we were drinking you know back to that uh water thing and of course i got sick       about the second or third until the end of the day im im uproariously sick and im in the tent sweating it out   yeah   and the two guys i was with they were like well this youre a wimp you know because weve been drinking out of the water and were okay so they went out fly fishing and theyre having a great time   uhhuh   and and just all the way back to Dallas im just uproariously sick and uh we get back here and of course the first day back at work i go to work and where are these guys       and they were off both off a week sick because they were just its just like it took them a little longer to hit it hit and it hit them and they were just like calling into work going oh im miserable im im just     it hit them wham     i cant keep anything down im and i just cramps and im just going hey tell me about it right   yeah   and uh but uh that was probably the last big camp thats probably the last big camping trip ive ive gone on i havent gone in a few years on anything real big   what uh do you work for TI   uh no no but i know somebody who does and thats how i got into this so but uh   oh okay   but in fact its funny thats this was the topic because i was just reading Outside Magazine here this morning and uh and that some big issue on the only way to camp about about canoe camping   yeah   and uh and ive ive done a lot of canoeing but never have camped out over night and and they makes a lot make a lot of good points about at least with a canoe you dont have to carry everything   yeah   you can throw big tents and food and and stoves and everything in and all you have to do is just you dont even have to if you go downstream you hardly even have to paddle and its uh   yeah well it all depends on what the rapids are like   well thats true too as long as youre not going to going to hit any white water or you know if youre just doing a nice calm river its uh its it uh you dont have to put very much effort into it   yeah   and uh boys i guess as i get older thatll get more and more appetizing     and then all youll have will be road camping trips you know lets just go out to the mountains with the car honey and uh   the truck and thats thats right and uh and if were lucky well talk somebody into taking the car downstream and well just throw the canoe in there and uh and uh tell you what well just well just float downstream and uh thats thats   yeah really    no paddling no paddling well just grab the rudder and you you work the rudder yeah   thats about as tough as nope thats just keep us off a rock and well just let the let the stream take us down river and all that   yeah   but uh but uh well you over there in Carolina North Carolina you probably get a lot of chance to youve got a lot of rivers and a lot of uh white white water over there i think uhhuh   yeah but since but im a you know im a student and so   uhhuh   and i also dont have any transportation   yeah   and so the the people that actually do camp do camp i dont i dont really get along with them you know theyre like i dont know if i could stand to being you know two days in the woods with them you know   uhhuh yeah yeah thats probably true because uh thats   and so because you have to know who youre going with to get along   thats true you cant even uh because i know uh even i and my wife would probably uh have a hard time sitting in sitting out in the woods for a couple of days and uh youve really got to be careful who you go out there with and that theyre out theyre out fo r what theyre doing and youre out for what you want to do and then you all get get to do what you want to do i guess while youre out there but uh   yeah yeah oh well   well well all right bye bye   it was nice talking to you bye bye
