                                  quotFindings of Factquot            Jan  Sens Orrin HatchRUtah and Olympia Snowe RMaine went on ABCs This Week to acceptcongratulations for the Senates bipartisan launch of President Clintonsimpeachment trial When asked about polls showing dissatisfaction with theGOPs conduct of the inquiry the two senators brushed them off Im not goingto worry  about polls scoffed Snowe Polls are polls are polls Hatchchimed in You can find almost anything you want in polls Look we wouldnthave civil rights laws if we abided by the polls We wouldnt have a lot ofthings that are right if wed abided by the polls  Our job is not to worryabout the polls Our job is to do justice            Three weeks later thefaade of bipartisanship has collapsed and Hatch and Snowe are singing a newtune In recent days theyve proposed a findings of fact resolution underwhich the Senate would affirm by majority vote that Clinton gave misleadingtestimony and schemed to alter delay impede cover up and conceal theexistence of evidence in the Paula Jones case and the Monica Lewinskyinvestigation In theory censure would merely condemn Clinton morally whereasfindings of fact would certify that despite the Senates failure to remove himthe House prosecutors had proved his guilt But in practice the findingsproposal isnt about facts Its about spin and public opinion            The obvious rationale for the findings resolution is whatit would not do Since many senators who think Clinton is guilty oflying and covering up arent willing to declare him guilty of high crimes andremove him from office the resolution is designed to let them affirm theformer without the latter But the resolutions affirmative rationalewhat itwould dois less clear Its authors and advocates say it has no legalconsequences If it wont cost Clinton his job or punish him for a crimewhats the point            In a Tuesday New YorkTimes oped Hatch explained his purpose The message the House sent toour posterity is that Mr Clintons behavior is immoral and wrong he arguedWere the Senate to adjourn and make these findings affirming the Housesconclusions it would deny the President an acquittalthe result he cravesfor his own historic legitimacy The Senate would also make clear that theHousepassed articles of impeachment are constitutionally legitimate Aboveall Hatch stressed the importance of avoiding a historic vote on the meritswhich could be interpreted as vindicating the President The next day Snoweechoed Hatchs remarks The significance of finding of facts is it would bepart of the permanent record of the court of impeachment  We do owe it tothe American people to inform them of the facts            M essage Posterity Immoral Wrong LegitimacyInterpreted Vindicating Significance The American people  These wordsare not about facts They are about what really galls and worries Republicansas they approach the trials certain demise They have lost the struggle togive the facts meaning and authority which are ultimately decided by publicopinion Their arguments in the trials final days are replete with desperatebelated appeals to the popular will House prosecutor James Rogan RCalifsays the Senate must call witnesses if theyre going to have a verdict thatwill withstand the test of history Sen Chuck Hagel RNeb says closeddoorSenate deliberations on Clintons fate would cast too much of a cloud ofsuspicion            The GOPs mostremarkable complaint is that if the Senate votes not to remove Clinton theWhite House will stage another pep rally and will spin the vote not just asan acquittal but as an exoneration This fear is well justified but itsnaked expression betrays the Republicans tragic knowledge that they havefailed to engender enough public faith in the impeachment process to withstanddismissive words from the president they have supposedly disgraced OnWednesday Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart promised no doubt falsely not tospin the vote against removal as a repudiation of Republican partisanship andof the charges against Clinton I now declare in a postimpeachment era thisa gloatfree zone said Lockhart Here was an astonishing spectacle Thespokesman for an impeached president offering terms under which the presidentsjudges could surrender with honor having lost in the nations ultimatecourt            To pass findings of fact the Republicans need only votes But to achieve the credibility these findings are supposed to bestow onthe impeachment inquiry Snowe and other Republicans admit they need at leastfive Democrats Thanks to the inquirys partisan meltdown that seems unlikelyFearful that Republicans will unilaterally dictate the resolutions languageDemocrats refuse to consider it preferring to end the trial and then debate acensure resolution under normal Senate rules which would give Democrats theprotective power of the filibuster And fearful that Independent CounselKenneth Starr will use a findings resolution to bolster an indictment ofClinton Democrats refuse to supply the ammunition            So the findings resolution has quickly become thevictim of the partisan skepticism it was supposed to overcome WednesdayDemocratic senators called it an unconstitutional Republican scheme to saveface embarrass the president and appease an element of their constituencythat wants conviction The more Republicans persist in demanding livewitnesses and demanding more depositions and demanding extralegal devices likefindings of fact said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle DSD the moreit becomes a Republican trial            The GOPs best option atthis point is to embrace the Democrats plan to vote quickly on Clintonsremoval end the trial and censure him This would achieve most of theobjectives of the findings of fact resolution Instead Senate Republicanscontinue to antagonize Democrats gratuitously Wednesday night they sentClinton an open letter urging him to testify before the Senate disregardingrepeated White House statements that he would not do so They told the pressthat censure wasnt strong enough and that Democrats were trying to turn thefindings proposal into a partisan issue because theyre scared to death ofit But when youre the majority party and your task is to convince the publicthat a president of the opposing party has been legitimately impeachedpartisanship should be the last word out of your mouth Thats worse thanspin Thats dumb spin
