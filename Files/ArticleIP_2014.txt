                                             This idea that harmonybetween the races is impossiblelets call it the National Reviewfallacyrests largely on confusion about a form of natural selection known askin selection The issues are a bit arcane but Ill try to provide a roughsketch of some of them            Kin selection accounts forthe evolution of altruistic impulses toward close relatives The textbookexample of kin selection is a newly minted gene that inclines a ground squirrelto stand up and give an alarm call upon seeing a predator At first glancethis gene would seem to have no chance of proliferating via natural selectionsince it attracts the predators attention and thus endangers the organism inwhich it resides But remember The gene will also reside on average in halfof that organisms siblingsand their survival prospects are enhancedby the genes effect ie by the warning call So even if this warningcall gene occasionally causes the death of its possessor the gene itself maystill flourish by natural selection as long as more than two siblings aresaved for every one ground squirrel that is lost If this Cliff Notesversion of kin selection doesnt seem to make sense then please go and readthe excerpt from the chapter titled Families on the Web site for my bookThe MoralAnimal then come back and keep reading In our species the result ofthis evolutionary process seems to be a kindirected altruism that is roughlyproportional to the closeness of relatives Most people would be more inclinedto risk their lives for a sibling than for a cousin and for a cousin than forthe average Joe This assumes among other things that these people have beenreared in close enough proximity to these relatives to develop the emotionalbonds that mediate kinselected altruism            Here is where confusionenters the minds of people eager to believe that whites and blacks are innatelyhostile toward one another They try to extend the logic of kin selectionbeyond the scope of the family and carry it all the way up to the level ofwhole races They are assuming in other words that there is a universal lawdictating that altruism between individuals be proportional to their degree ofgenetic relatednessand that natural discord among people thus will beproportional to their genetic difference            There are at least two majorproblems with this logic The first is a fairly technical thoughconsequential analytical flaw first identified in another context by RichardDawkins and labeled Washburns fallacy See his Twelve Misunderstandings ofKin Selection Zeitschr Tierpsychol no    I wonteven try to explain the fallacy here except to say that a It consists ofassuming that kin selection would make altruism proportional to overallgenetic relatednessthat is the percentage of all your genes that youhave in common with another organism and b This assumption has been memorablycharacterized as implying that humans should in theory be nicer to mosquitosthan to marigolds That characterization was made by Martin Daly CatherineSalmon and Margo Wilson For their explicit application of Dawkins analysisto the National Review fallacy they dont call it that of course seetheir chapter in the forthcoming textbook Evolutionary SocialPsychology  edited by Douglas Kenrick and Jeffrey Simpson and published byLawrence Erlbaum Associates            The second problem with theidea of some iron law correlating altruism with genetic relatednessand thuscorrelating natural discord with genetic differenceis at least slightly moreaccessible Kin selection isnt some inexorable force of evolution Its just atheoretical possibility one that will only be realized if the circumstances ofevolution are conducive to its realization In the case of altruism directedtoward close relatives we know that circumstances were indeed so conduciveThroughout human evolution people were reared a near close relatives and bnear people who werent close relatives Thus there was lots of opportunity forthe flourishing of genes that led humans to discriminate between the twofavoring the former at the expense of the latter But in the case of comparablediscrimination between members of ones own race and members of other racesthere was no significant opportunity for the evolution of such a trait Becauseduring human evolution that is during that short span of human evolution thattook place after distinct races began forming there was roughly zerocontact among different races people in Africa didnt vacation on the Rivieraback then Saying that white people evolved an innate aversion to blacks orblacks an innate aversion to whites is like saying people evolved an innateaversion to some poison plant that grows only on Mars the opportunity simplywasnt there            None of this is to suggestthat human nature doesnt vastly complicate race relations People areobviously inclined to derogate groups whose interests seem to clash with thoseof their own group and to identify those groups by whatever means areavailable Skin color can be an unfortunately handy means of doing theidentifying Whats more kin selection itself may complicate race relations invarious subtle ways For example Nepotism one legacy of kin selection isoften de facto racial discrimination since your close relatives are usuallymembers of your race When a white boss promotes his niece he isdiscriminating against some whites the ones who arent in his family butagainst all blacks            All told the obstacles tointergroup harmony posed by human nature are big enough that there is littleexaggeration in saying that xenophobia is a part of human nature at least inthis sense Uncritical hostility toward an identifiable group ofpeopleidentifiable by language dress color whateveris an inherentcapacity activated under certain predictable circumstances But that is verydifferent from saying we are designed to automatically dislike people withparticular skin colors and that racial harmony therefore is impossiblewhichis what the National Review article said            Fulldisclosure paragraphThe article in which the National Review fallacy appeared was a reviewof my book The Moral Animal  One of the reviews major complaints wasabout my alleged failure to realize that Darwinism is a thoroughgoingvindication of the reviewers various political beliefs eg theimpossibility of racial harmony No doubt some of my animus toward the articleis related to these comments about my book Still Im not inventing the ideathat the National Review fallacy is indeed a fallacy The same opinionis held by for example George Williams one of the greatest evolutionarybiologists of this century and arguably the chief architect of evolutionarypsychology By the way his  book Adaptation and Natural SelectionPrinceton University Press which laid the theoretical foundation for themodern Darwinian study of social behavior in animals still is in print
