                                 Beyond Good and Evil            A lot of actors have plasticfeatures the kind that mold and remold themselves according to theircharacters moods othersprimarily Republicans such as Clint Eastwood andCharlton Hestonhave Mount Rushmoreesque features whose lack of plasticity ismeant to betoken strength Robert Duvall uniquely has a face that manages tobe both granitelike and plastic In repose it is a chiseled mask with avianeyes that give away little then swamped by feeling those features wiggle andcrack and loosen from their moorings Does Duvall have a screw loose Isometimes think so His volcanic rages dont have the puton quality ofpost Raging Bull Robert De Niro or the preening selfconsciousness of AlPacino nor is he a simpleminded bully boy like Harvey Keitel OnscreenDuvalls madness has a divine purity No actor has ever brought the kind ofbelief to an evangelist that Duvall brings to Sonny the tormented protagonistof The Apostle  And no one else could have created a character who stirsin the film audience such disparate responses Hes magnificent hesdangerously crazy hes magnificent and hes dangerously crazy            The factthat Duvall gives such a glorious performance in The Apostle is likelyto distract people from the fact that he has also written and directed aglorious moviethe most vivid and radiantly made of  The film openedbriefly at the end of last year to qualify for various awards it goes intogeneral release next week The Apostle has a laidback intimacy thatreminds me mutatis mutandis of Jean Renoir and a documentarians penchantfor letting events play out at their own sweet speed And if as an actorDuvall gets drunk on Sonnys megalomania as a director he keeps the charactersoberly in focus so that were simultaneously swept up in Sonnys good whilerecoiling from his evil agog at his purity while giggling at thehamminess            Duvall introduces Sonny as a small boy being led by animmense black woman through the swinging doors of a backcountry Texas churchwhere the restless child is mesmerized by a gospel preacher In no time thegrownup Sonny is perorating before congregations black white and mixedHappening with his mama June Carter Cash past a multicar collision he seizeshis Bible and marches through a field to the worstinjured drivers Sonny leansinto the window places his hand on the shoulder of a young man with gelid eyesand blood trickling from one ear and exhorts him to live  live He says that there are angels in the car that the young man has nothing tofear if he accepts Jesus Christ as his saviorand miraculously the young manmanages to thank him We never learn if he or the woman in the car with himsurvive We see her stir but we know that Sonnys prayers have got through tothem And we believe Sonny when he says almost laughing in amazement at hisown gifts Mama we made news today in heaven            Butfrequently the news that Sonny makes is of the tabloid variety Thanks in partto his wandering eye and wickiewickie ways he has lost his wife JessieFarrah Fawcett and two children he calls them his beauties to HoraceTodd Allen a gentle callow minister who seems to be in every way Sonnysopposite Civil and friendly toward his exwife and her lover Sonny can turnsuddenly scarily needypounding on their door in the middle of the night andthrowing a baseball through their window When the anxious Jessie has him votedout of the Fort Worth church that they founded together something rupturesUnable to comprehend his banishment Sonny spends days and nights in his mamasattic railing at Jesus Ive always called you Jesus youve always calledme Sonny  Primed with liquor he commits a shocking act of violence thenflees Texas for a new lifesinking his car in a swamp and baptizing himselfthe Apostle EF            The next  minutes of The Apostlerecount that new life which the Apostle EF builds from scratch in aramshackle Louisiana Gulf town In almost no time he has secured a position asan auto mechanic and a room in the home of a goodhearted grease monkey WaltonGoggins More important he has sought out Brother Blackwell John Beasley aretired black preacher whose fervor once generated several heart attacks andwho now reposes with his wife in a house under the highway Blackwell doesntknow if this selfdubbed Apostle has been sent by God or Satan nor do we buthe trusts that the former will soon make that plain in the meantime he setsabout helping EF to establish a parish            Surveyinga brokendown church by the side of the former interstate Sonny murmursResurrection time  resurrection time  Yes sir He concludes I coulddo some shouting in here He checks out the space the way a jazz musicianchecks out a nightclub in which hes about to perform The Apostles preachingsone can hardly call them sermons are marvelous production numbersalternately plangent and syncopated they make everyoneeven those of us inthe movie audience predisposed to find a Christian evangelist threateningfeelwelcome Im not sure what he says in those numbers only that Icouldnt take my eyes off him or stop myself from nodding when his congregantssaid Amen Duvall has an abysmal singing voicegargling and offkeybuthis speaking voice his presence is insistently musical His Apostle EF isutterly certain of what hes doing andeven knowing what we know about hispastwe cant help sharing his conviction that something momentous is takingplace in this small town            Where other filmmakers have tried to assert thatshowmanship somehow precludes belief Duvall demonstrates how showmanship andbelief can reinforce and even galvanize each other the former driving thelatter to transcendental heights The roof of EFs church features a neonarrow pointing skyward and the words One Way Road to Heaven Holy Ghostpower  might sound like something out of a usedcar commercialandDuvall is as cleareyed on the capitalismevangelism correlation as theMarxistleaning Antony Thomas in his skeptical s documentary Thy KingdomCome Thy Will Be Done  But Duvall also subscribes to an Americandramatic tradition which can be discerned in works as various as The IcemanCometh and The Music Man  that says that any fervent belief evenone based on uncertain premises and fueled by an impure source can give lifethe way a placebo can be an authentic remedy if it empowers the body to healitself Who cares if the Apostle EF is a madman if he can make peoplesspirits soar this high And whos to say hes a villain if he doesnt violatethe trust that his parishioners have placed in him            Sonnydoesnt seem to have nefarious political aims he simply wants to create a warmand nurturing community with himself at the center He spearheads food drivesand disarms a racist troublemaker Billy Bob Thornton with showstoppingbravura At the same time Duvall doesnt go soft on his character Sonny nevershows a hint of remorse for the crime he committed And when he courts thereceptionist Miranda Richardson never so girlishly charming at a radiostation where he preaches Sonny gives off glints both of his wickiewickieways and the concomitant jealousy that drove him to become a fugitive Hesstill one scary dudejittery and in some fundamental way unformed            The Apostle is not Duvalls first directorialeffort Back in  he made an oddity called Angelo My Love  asemiimprovised account of a boy coming of age among the gypsies Watching thatmovie I found myself simultaneously attracted to and repulsed by thecharacters in ways that left me confused and also impressed At times Duvallseemed to be sentimentalizing the gypsies at others he seemed to be rubbingour noses in their ugliness and duplicityor was that just my racism It washard to know The same kind of tension exists in The Apostle  but theseare Duvalls people and here he seems fully in control of our responses Theperformances down to the smallest congregant could not be richer AndDuvalls Sonny is both in our face and yet tantalizingly out of reachinfantile and of amazing stature We wish we could be like him and we thankthe Lord Almighty that were not
