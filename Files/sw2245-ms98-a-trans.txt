        well whats your favorite shows   oh gosh thats hard to say  its um used to be a big Twin Peaks fan but theyve made me mad so i havent watched them in a while in a while     uhhuh   um oh  i watch a lot of uh public we watch public television a lot Mystery and   hm   oh  oh i oh i really like Mysteries   uhhuh thats one of my favorite yeah Mystery and uh Masterpiece Theater   yeah i watch that occasionally when   yeah   theres something really interesting on   umhum   but uh oh  out out outside of that i its hard to have a i dont really watch a whole lot   yeah i dont not anymore i dont theres just nothing on it   yeah   i got i got sort of hooked on that uh Dark Shadows   have you   yeah i when i watched it originally i didnt know it was a i dont know it was going to be a series i thought it was just a movie   um   and so i started watching it and all of a sudden stay tuned next week and i went what       and then it blows into this whole series thing so i sort of had to stay with it   yeah is is it good is it   not really it it its its gotten to the point its getting ridiculous now and   yeah   they they just had the uh season finale and i dont i dont know what they accomplished but i think the writers just       figure well lets just do anything and   yeah   well well have a couple of months to come up with some new ideas   yeah that thats thats kind of what happened on Twin Peaks they did all this big building up building up building up and then the the solution was ridiculous i had it figured out by the third   yeah yeah   i thought i already had it figured out and i did and that made me mad   yeah i dont like programs that i can figure it out   yeah   um the only one that i watch religiously is LA Law   umhum   i really like that   well my parents my parents really like LA Law   yeah thats thats my favorite     is it good ive ive always heard it was really good   well im im a struggling law student   oh   and i the reason i like it is because they give you good law in there   do they   yeah its not like these other programs where they just make up anything they want   oh yeah   and they they throw little tidbits out that are really good   you know like they they at least you know theyve been in a courtroom before   umhum of course i mean its got its bad side so its limited by the format and obviously you dont get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out that you do   oh of course yeah oh no   theyre theyre in California and theyre theyre waiting list is about four years four or five years for a civil case   ooh Lord   so uh   yeah   i mean you know its very difficult to   itd be nice if justice traveled that quickly but but it sure it it sure doesnt   yeah it would yeah no not at all you know the wheels of justice grind slowly     yeah well its not really justices fault but thats on a another whole subject altogether   yeah ill agree with you there ill agree with you   oh   i know i know the shortcomings too   yeah yeah yeah oh lets see what oh i guess ive got a two year old so we do Sesame Street everyday   uh well not its not on my thats not on my list of     no not it not no its a its not something   now there was some of the some of the classes im in i think im in Sesame Street but uh   yeah     some of the professors i think imitate Big Bird   uh oh yeah  have an intellectual role of Big Bird thats pretty good   thats it i mean Big Bird would make a good judge       better than some of the judges ive seen   oh thats true thats true   yeah ive got my own pet peeve about judges but uh oh well were stuck with them   yeah yeah that were kind of stuck with them   sort of like lawyers you know           oh   um lets see what else is oh i like AE   i wish i wish we got i wish we got that on our cable system we dont theres always good stuff on AE   they dont have AE on cable in Dallas   well not where i am not were were in far north were i mean were   uhhuh   im thirty five miles north of Dallas in McKinney its a small town theres only one cable system here and ive called griped about them not having A E AE but they dont have it i mean in Dallas they do   oh oh yeah ill tell you the um uh AE and Discovery and CNN i couldnt i couldnt live without those   oh yeah i watch oh i like C i like CNNs new uh news coverage better than anybodys   oh yeah i i just leave it when im home during the day i just leave it on just to listen to it   yeah during during when the war was real hot and heavy we just had it on CNN all day long   yeah best coverage   yeah oh the oh much better than anybody elses   yeah       uh the networks got sort of ridiculous with they they they felt like they had to interrupt normal programming for all this but they didnt have anything to say   now theyre plus they had all the inaccuracies were ridiculous then theyd come back five minutes later and contradict themselves to oh it was just get it was ridiculous so i just   oh yeah yeah yeah well the coverage was a little bit ridiculous anyway i mean   umhum   it it it got far more coverage than it should have i it was it was beautifully played out thing i mean   yea h oh yeah   it it roused the patriotism of the of the country and all that sort of stuff and   but uh they they interrupted for no good reason a lot   yeah exactly i mean and sometimes they they would now i like Jeopardy and Jeopardy comes on here at seven oclock   uhhuh uhhuh   and for i dont know it must have been two or three weeks there they were doing this expanded nightly news   oh yeah   you know and im going i will never get to see Jeopardy again   rehash it was just rehash rehash total oh   yeah im saying what are you telling me that you didnt tell me in your first half hour   nothing  and i i know i know the scud attack scud attacks are some are exciting to somebody but after youve seen them seen them for two weeks in a row   nothing yeah oh well there goes a patriot missile oh well thats good thats good     across the black sky a white streak   yeah oh boy golly gee     well maybe maybe were a bit uh uh oh jaded   yeah we are   and and  because televisions brought everything into your living room     yeah well i it was interesting it was interesting   but it wasnt an exciting war it really wasnt   no i mean there there there was nothing to it i mean   which is thats good thats good but   i mean yeah im happy for that   for TV coverage its pitiful   im happy for that but but unfortunately i sort of had the inside track because id been in the id been in the military for thirteen years and i worked and i worked in intelligence   oh oh   and and there was no   contradiction in turn   yes another one of those  military intelligence ha ha thats what thats just like justice for all     yeah   but i mean my goodness theres theyre sitting here making all this big deal out of the Iranians   i know   and im sitting there thinking to myself uhhuh sure   umhum   i mean theyve poured billions of dollars into this stuff but those stupid people cant read comic strips i mean how do you expect them to operate tanks   no they cant its put it in Russian   yeah i mean       they cant even read their own language   yeah it it it was just it was the coverage just went way too far   yeah i it just totally ridiculous i mean the Israelis could have fixed the whole problem years ago if they just sent sent their guys in there and killed Saddam   oh thats thats what my husband says he says just send the Israelis in to to pick off Saddam theyll theyd love it i mean   thats right i mean the Israelis arent theyre not afraid of anything   huhuh no   see what happens when they when they take a plane load of their citizens down in   oh yeah   that doesnt uh that doesnt that situation doesnt sit around and develop very long   no i just wonder whats going to happen to the hostage to the the hostages thats over in Lebanon now that you hear all kinds of things   all right i i i think everybodys jumping to conclusions i dont think anythings going to change   you dont think so i just   no first off i dont think the the Middle Eastern situations going to change i dont think that   oh thats true oh are you kidding but they all hate each other   theyre not yeah theyre not going to come up with theyre not going to come up with a peace plan or any of this kind of crap   huhuh you know you you see them on interview they interview everybody and everybody says the same things   umhum yeah   that they always have   well they they get Oshmid Yakomo you know the janitor for the US Embassy and you know   oh yes i know       yes i keep saying when are they going to knock on my door and interview me theyve talked to everybody else in the world   yeah really and it was it was real it was even worse here in North Carolina because because a lot of the   was it   matter of fact all the units the Marines and and uh the F the F squadrons came out of North Carolina   did they   so every night on the local news they were down in Fayetteville or they were down in Goldsboro and they were talking to the military wives you know   oh yeah oh yeah   and and i and i understand the way they feel about their husbands and wives being over there and all that but to get on camera and just oh  this is so terrible i just i dont what were going to do well im thinking to myself   oh yeah     you know what do these people think they were getting into when they joined the military   theyre theyre voluntary army   you know im going it what did you think it was   uhhuh   a paycheck   uhhuh yeah they do they think its a paycheck   you know run around and and play soldier well the reservists sure do we had a reservist here in North Carolina who who   yeah   whos unit was ordered up and he refused to go   we had a doctor that did t hat here   i hope he got busted   oh yeah she did   yeah the uh this this guy did too he ended up going to Leavenworth which is good im glad   yeah i mean just when uh the they military paid for her education   umhum   and they kept having her on the news every night   and then and then she thats right then she didnt want to do her obligation yeah   uhhuh ooh shes shes in hot water   well i you know im not im not racist or anything but one of my one another one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of Black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the Blacks are poor and therefore they dont have a choice but go in the military   oh yeah oh yeah   so theres more of them getting killed than the Whites   oh yes   now to me that doesnt make any damn sense   it nobody forced
