                                 The Cult of Che            So they have finally givenChe Guevara a proper burialthe interment took place Oct in Cuban soilin the town where he achieved his greatest revolutionary victory You mightsuppose that in these afterdays of communism Ches legendary glamour willsoon enough find its way to a similar interment though perhaps not in Cubaitself where glamour like everything else remains under state control            Che wasnot after all the best of communists He was in his dashing manner theworstan extreme dogmatist instinctively authoritarian allergic to anydemocratic or libertarian impulses quick to order executions and quickerstill to lead his own comrades to their deaths in doomed guerrilla wars Loveof the Soviet Union was his first instinct and when he evolved a second morecritical instinct it was only because the Soviet leaders turned out to be lessrigidly MarxistLeninist and less suicidal than himself            Of the innumerable commentaries on Che that have beenpublished in the last few weeks Alma Guillermoprieto offered the clearest inThe New Yorker  He was a fanatic she wrote consumed by restlessnessand a frightening abstract hatred who in the end recognized only one moralvalue as supreme the willingness to be slaughtered for a cause But I amstruck most by a commentary that appeared in the Mexican weeklyEtctera  under the byline Gilberto Guevara Nieblano relation to Chehimself yet a figure of great importance in the revolutionary history of thes Gilberto Guevara Niebla was arguably the single most important studentleader of the Mexican student uprising of the uprising that was finallyput down in a massacre by the Mexican army in October             He wroteChe offered his life to the cause of the disinherited but he did it byoffering a political method that in the long run had disastrous effects onwhoever tried to uphold it Guerrilla war imposed a militarist logic and closedthe space for democracy What Latin America lived since Che launched hisslogans was a bloodbath and a wave of destruction and terror  The myth ofChe has been a wall impeding the observation of those fatal historicalresults Who was Che A man who wanted to change the world through themeansalways sordidof killing other men            Couldnt be clearer Yet among the kind ofpeople who once upon a time had admired Che and his causea lot of peopleespecially in the generation that was young in the sthe more typicalcommentaries have balanced on a but as on a fulcrum Che was wrong but hewas good His ideas were hopeless but he remains the embodiment of an idealLet me quote the French weekly Le Nouvel Observateur  which devoted anissue to Che earlier this month That his politicomilitary theory  failedmatters little What remains on both sides of the Andes is the example of aman the child of his continent who knew how to die for his generous ideas inan unequal struggle Or last Sundays New York Times Book Review  whichconcluded What is left is simply the mana rebel who could not part with hisdream and who earned a place in history precisely because he refused to yieldto it            Or a Portuguese writer inEtctera s special Che issue Che Guevara is only the other name ofwhat is most just and dignified in the human spirit And so forth onecommentator after another which would be hard to believe except that rightnow the world is awash in Che Tshirts mugs barroom dcor a Che beer inEngland posters and utterly pointless editions let us hope of Chesmilitary writings And the mania is not just a matter of mass culture                         Among the books about Che that have just now come out oneby Jorge G Castaeda Compaero The Life and Death of Che Guevara offers an exceptionally lucid analysis of Ches life and doings based on atremendous amount of research both in Cuba and in Americangovernment filesCastaeda knows more about Latin American guerrilla movements than anybodyoutside of Castros secret agencies Yet in a few paragraphs at the front andclose of his book on Che even Castaeda this most intelligent and admirableof historians extols the fervent idealism and generational arrogance of around the world and then anoints Che as the one man who most closelyembodied its deeper meaning Rgis Debray Ches comrade wrote a memoir lastyear in which he warned against exactly that delusionthe antiauthoritarianrevolt of  taking this hardcore partisan of authoritarianism for itsemblem But then I can understand that particular confusion A couple ofyears ago I wrote a piece of my own about Che in The New Yorker andthough I knew better I ended up adding a superfluous nod to the innatenobility of this man whose fanaticism and lack of human sympathy broughtabout so much suffering and death            Why do people who know bettersay such things It is not because of the doctrines of communism It is becauseof the doctrines of glory which are much more primitive What is glory Thisan absolute commitment to your own principle whatever it may bethe kind ofcommitment that expresses itself in only one way by a willingness to killother people on its behalf and to be killed in turn A commitment finally todefeat For victory is always partial and compromised but defeat and death aretotal and grand Victory is secular defeat is sacred            A Che wholike any ordinary communist politician had never killed anyone a Che who hadsurvived his guerrilla adventures and was today an elderly figureadministering some grim bureaucracy for Fidel Castro or alternatively writingbooks at home in Argentina surrounded by his anticommunist grandchildrenaChe like that would cause no stir at all today and writers around the worldwould not be straining their brains to draw ever finer distinctions between themans calamitous influence and some undefinable greatness            There is a precedent to the Che cult It wasthe cult of Napoleon in the  th century a young mans craze thatwent on for generationsthe craze that Stendhal described in his characterJulien Sorel in The Red and the Black and Victor Hugo in his characterMarius in Les Misrables  In the  th century intelligentpeople in France knew perfectly well that Napoleon had embodied the worstaspects of the French Revolution had betrayed the revolutions democraticideals and had spread death and fire from Spain to Moscow Yet those sameclearthinking people found ways of separating Napoleons horrors from hisglamour They would say He was wrong but he was great It was a question ofgloryof his having risen in the world and having killed his thousands andhaving failed spectacularly and not having flinched It was the appeal ofdeathdoled out and accepted And so the cult of Napoleon was finally acult of the tomb            In Napoleon was murderedhe was poisonedwhile in the hands of his enemies faraway from home just as Che was murdered in  It took  years to bringNapoleons remains back to France compared to  years for Che Napoleonsreburial took place on Dec   People who should have known better foundthe ceremony moving Victor Hugo who stood among the crowd dutifullyrecorded in a poem on the occasion that Napoleon had been wrongthatNapoleon had tried to conquer with the sword instead of with the mind Yet afew lines later Hugo wrote his Bonapartist blood pounding            May the people foreverkeep you in their memory      Day as beautiful as glory      Cold as thetomb            So in the Cuban tropics too there has just now been a dayas beautiful as glory cold as the tomb And because the cult of glory feeds ondefeat and not on victory we can be sure that like the passion for Napoleonin the last century the passion for Che will disappear no time soon Not inthis generation not in the next
