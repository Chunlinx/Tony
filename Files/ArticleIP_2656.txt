                                 Disneys Drop            In the s and earlys Marxist thinkers were fond of using the phrase late capitalism todescribe the American economy With its intimations of the systems decadenceand inevitable disappearance the label sounded both descriptivethese werethe days of stagflation skyrocketing interest rates and highunemploymentand inspiring At least if you were Marxist            You donthear much about late capitalism these days except insofar as it has morphedoddly into the technoutopianism of New Economy advocates But what we shouldstart hearing about more and more is our own late bull market which seemssomehow simultaneously frothy and exhausted Theres no better sign of thisthan the occasional fits of anxiety that have begun to grip investors who forfour years have dismissed talk of overvaluation as irrelevant As a case inpoint consider the recent travails of Disney            To all outward appearances Disney remains among thestrongest companies on the planet It reported earnings about a month ago thatwere typically impressive with earnings up sharply and news of a threeforonestock split The companys new Animal Kingdom park at Disney World opened thismonth to phenomenal business and advance buzz on the latest animated Disneyfilm Mulan  has been very good Mystery writer Carl Hiaasen did comeout with a short book blasting Disney for well Disneyfying the world but ifa month goes by without an article or book on that subject Michael Eisnerknows hes doing something wrong And the company has even got credit for anOscarwinning film since its subsidiary Miramax released Good WillHunting             There werea few question marks in the companys results in the last quarter arisingmainly from the fact that Disneys sales grew hardly at all But for the firsttwo weeks after the earnings report came out all the good news drove thecompanys stock to a new alltime high Disney after all is everything amodern company is supposed to be media giant hightech pioneer owner of animmensely powerful brand and a genius at outsourcing What could go wrong            Well the interesting thing is that nothing hasgone wrong and yet in the course of two weeks Disneys stock fell  percenta fairly hefty tumble for a company with a market cap of  billion Whathappened testifies partly to the continued power of analysts on WallStreet but also to the fact that at these heights its very easy to becomesuddenlyand often justifiablyafraid Like Wile E Coyote investors areable to skate across the air until they look down at which point the fall isoften fast and hard            Thatanalogy is inexact since investors have been more than willing to give manycompanies the benefit of the doubt but those companies tend to be eitherInternet stocks cancerdrug companies or merger candidates The punishmentDisneys stock received on the other hand shows that when the Street changesits mind even blue chips are not immune            In essence what happened was that a few brokerage housesdowngraded Disneys stock from buy to accumulate or to hold or to sellimmediately Actually there is no sell immediately recommendation thoughcommon wisdom on the Street is that you should do so if bodies begin fallingpast your windows Raising concerns about Disneys broadcasting unitsanalysts reduced their earnings estimates while also suggesting that at theseprices Disneys stock might be overvalued Considering that we live in a timewhen stockmarket gurus produce brand new measures of valuation on thespotSee you should buy this because although the company has no earningsits trading at just  times the cost of the phone calls its employees make inany one monththe suggestion that a company might actually beovervalued was enough to send investors streaming to the doors            Since theconcerns the analysts raised were not new you might see this as evidence thatinvestors are now in the same fragile frame of mind as little kids who havestayed up way past their bedtimes But these concerns were also real ABC andESPNwhich Disney ownstogether paid an incredible  billion to the NFLfor the exclusive rights to Monday and Sunday Night Football and they may nothave the ratings to justify that ABC is suffering from a declining revenuebase mainly because its primetime ratings are beyond dismal True ESPN isone of the most profitable TV networks and in recent months has startedpressuring cable systems to increase the fees they pay for the right to carryit Still recouping  million annuallythe cost of the NFL contractmaybe more than even it can pull off            ABC is certainly doing its best to put asmiling face on its recent woes Its been running fullpage ads in the WallStreet Journal saying that ABC offers no pandering and upscalemomentum While pandering is bad I guess its hard to resist the thoughtthat describing yourself as upscale means that youre not ABCs What adifference a day makes ad meanwhile argues that ABC is the top network amongthe coveted  crowd if you leave out Thursday night This is sort of likesaying the Indiana Pacers are the best team in basketball if you leave outMichael Jordan and Scottie Pippen            DisneyCEO Eisner whos actually underrated as a popculture maven he wasresponsible for Happy Days and Welcome Back Kotter  insiststhat ABCs downturn is cyclical and that it will soon return to life But itsinteresting to remember that Eisner was actually hesitant to buy a TV networkand that it was Jeffrey Katzenberg who pushed hard for such an acquisitionthough Disney only bought Cap CitiesABC after Katzenberg had left WithDisneys brand name perhaps stronger than everits theme parks movie studiosand merchandising machine boomingthe fact that the part of the companyunconnected from that brand is struggling must make Eisner wonder whether thiswas an investment that needed to be made            Ultimately whats most important about Disneys struggleto turn ABC around is how impressive it makes the companys management of itsown franchise look After  years of almost uninterrupted superlativeperformancewhich not even the Katzenberg and Ovitz contretemps couldseriously slow downits almost impossible to remember how close Disney was tobeing dismantled in the early s The brand that we now think of asirresistible seemed tired and used up and this now seamlessly efficientcompany lacked even a formal business model before  A lot of what hashappened at Disneybetter advertising smarter merchandising revitalizing theanimation departmentlooks obvious in retrospect But it was only Eisnersrecognition that a brand has to be updated and nurtured if its to flourishthat made those decisions so obvious            ABCs problems one suspectswill be much harder to solve if only because they have much to do with networktelevision as a whole and not just ABC in particular But Disneys longtermfuture seems about as guaranteed as that of Coke or General ElectricInvestors recent flight from quality as you might call it was not completelyirrational But it tells us more about this edgy and anxious market than itdoes about Disney In a market where tomorrow seems like the long term thefact that  years from now the mouse will still be roaring somehow justdoesnt really matter
