              okay well whats happening in New York  well thats what were doing too on our our current events and its all over the   oh whats happening in New York were all reading about Los Angeles i think   of course the TV and were having a little bit of uh uh you know demonstrations here in Dallas but not anything like theyre having in LA   i should hope not   really   i i i was just reading this morning in the paper that its also spreading to San Francisco as well   oh is that right well it   the rioting and all that kind of thing   uhhuh and last night it was going into some of the nicer areas too you know uh rather than just staying in the in the uh in the sections that it started in   hm     but uh i get my current events um all three ways you know talking to people uh some TV although not much TV and uh reading the paper   do you get   and   uh im big on the morning radio i guess i woken get woken up by the alarm and catch the days news real quickly   well thats something i used to do when i had a long drive to work or a or a maybe a thirty or forty minute drive to work i would turn the the news on and listen to that all the way   uhhuh   but i dont do that anymore its just that i guess a habit ive gotten out out of and thats uh thats a real good way to get everything recapped   you know i was just doing some thinking recently on we only hear we hear the news in a slanted fashion by how its reported to us   uhhuh   i was looking at this mornings paper and you see uh you know the cover photo is a truck and and in the background everythings in flames   umhum   and i think they kind of uh set you up in a way   well i know they do i was uh i worked in public relations for um a a Safeway Stores which was a is a big grocery chain in used to be in this area its not here any longer and it used to be in New York i dont know there   yeah ive heard of it   and uh i was their uh press person uh public relations person for about five years and handled all of the press and i would tell them one thing on the phone very carefully   umhum   uh and they would report it not so carefully and in different context you had to be so careful uh whenever there was an interview on television uh they would tape a interview ask you lots of questions and then they would just take excerpts out that uh you know  standing alone would didnt mean the same thing and so but we just really you really had a we had a tough time uh relating to what you actually what was actually going on as to what was being reported   um i i think uh the news is starting to think of itself as theater   well i think youre you may be right there too uh and i can see where did you happen to hear the uh interview of the uh juror   no no no   uh last night on TV she said that the public saw only a small portion of that tape now i you know on this Rodney King   umhum   now i cant side with her you know because they they you know you can see see what was happening and thats totally wrong but you know we were shown just a portion of something we werent shown a whole picture   well well something i read in the paper was you know if you just hear the headlines you dont know that there were three other people in the car that was stopped who got out put their hands up and said okay we give up   umhum thats exactly right   you know and they dont tell you that that makes you so angry to think that oh they beat on this poor man   umhum this one person   but he he had a choice to you know this all could have been you know avoided if he had behaved himself i i i believe they overreacted horribly   exactly right   but you know if you think of the cops point of view he has a wife and two kids and he wants to get home tonight and he doesnt know how crazy this guy is   exactly and hes resisting   so everybodys fighting for their life and you can see how this can get out of hand   umhum exactly   but   but like you said we were not shown that we were not uh unless we you know read indepth you you get that you dont get that impression and so that makes everybody up in arms   ive been very annoyed lately by the sensationalism thats going on i was uh visiting some friends over the Easter vacation in California in uh California near San Francisco and the big thing out there was they were finally after twenty five years going to execute someone   umhum   uh whereas theyve always had a death pentalty penalty they always put it off   umhum   and she had the TV on and they go to say they go on to say well the cyanide came into the room and after about a minute his head slumped and they went into gross gross detail   umhum   i mean why is this on TV is this news do we want to know it   right   it was disgusting and this whole thing with Willie Kennedy Smith you know did he rape this girl did he not why is that headline news   umhum well it wouldnt be if it was anyone else   yeah but i mean i think the newspapers are irresponsible   it wouldnt have been if it
