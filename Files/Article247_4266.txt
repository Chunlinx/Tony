                                 DeParle Gets Half the Story            Jason DeParles New York Times reports on Wisconsins radical welfarereform are typically fairminded and gripping Todays Page One summingup is no exception But it also makes oneof the basic errors of welfare coverage an error that might be called theLeavers Fallacy            Specifically DeParle tends to judge the success of welfare reform by whathappened to families that were on welfare before the Wisconsin reformtook effect but who then left As Christopher Jencks and Joseph Swingle pointout in the current American Prospect  these families areonly half the story The other half includes those families who wouldhave gone on welfare under the old system but who now no longer even applyfor welfare These latter families youd think would tend to be moresuccessful in the marketplace than people who now spend some time on the rollsTo really judge welfare reform then you have to look at what happens toall families who would have been on welfare under the old systemthose who leave and those who never go on Actually you cant even stop thereYou have to look at what is happening to the overall society in which thosefamilies liveat whats happening in the schools and on the streets to poorsingle mothers who might get welfare but also to single men and nonpoorfamilies who live in the same neighborhoods            DeParles piece has good anecdotal reportage about specific women who leftwelfare for work and who still have big problems From this he concludes thatwelfare reform may end up making less of a difference in the lives of thepoor socially or economically than much of the public imagined But hispiece has very little evidence and almost no statistical evidence about whathas happened overall to Wisconsins poor including those who no longer evenapply for welfarethe other half of the story            Thus DeParle points out that a long list of things remains present in thelives of the poor including violent neighborhoods absent fathers barecupboards epidemics of depression the temptations of drugs Thats verytrue But are they getting better or worse That is the issue isnt itDeParle doesnt tell us Are the neighborhoods more violent Are fatherstaking more of an interest in their children Are there fewer kids bornwithout fathers present in the household Are more mothers being beaten up bytheir boyfriends Are kids doing better in school Is the culture ofdrugtaking and drugdealing becoming more or less entrenched Are more peopledepressed Hungry Overall how has the texture of ghetto life changed Welfarereformers said it would be change for the better Were they right            Some of these things would not be difficult to report on some would be verydifficult Thats why we give Pulitzer Prizes DeParle doesnt really seem totry to come up with much We learn a lot about the problems in the lives of thehandful of women he has chosen as his case studiesbut not only are they allindividual anecdotes they are all leavers people who were on welfarebefore The broader surveys DeParle offers are also all surveys of leavers Heoffers no economic surveys of the whole populationmuch less socialsurveys of crime marriage and the like            The Jencks and Swingle article provides some of that necessary missinginformation for the nation as a wholeas much as the existing statistics canprovide Although American Prospect gives the piece a sleazily slantedcover line Welfare Reforms Victims the article contains more positivenews than negative Employment among single mothers has increased more thanalmost anyone expected Most single mothers are a little better offeconomically but a small minority at the bottom seem to be a little worseoff The rise of the singleparent family may finally have been arrestedalthough this began in  so its not clear that welfare reform can take thecredit The most troubling statistic for reformers In Wisconsin theproportion of children born out of wedlock doesnt seem to have improvedlately            DeParles one stab at a general assessment of the social health ofMilwaukees ghetto is rhetorically brilliant but ultimately unconvincing Hetracks down William Love a bus driver who in  along with two otherdrivers gave the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel an upbeat assessment ofthe impact of reform on his clientele The Journal Sentinel clip gotpassed around in proreform circles and wound up in a Clinton radio addressDeParle says Love is now having doubts Love is also a landlord and some ofhis tenants who no longer receive guaranteed monthly welfare checks areoffering excuses for missing the rent So far havent seen a bigdifference one way or another he tells DeParle Its a good shot atwelfarereform cheerleaders but ultimately my suspicion is that Mr Love maybe one of those kind interviewees who winds up telling reporters what they wantto hear And arent there other bus drivers to talk to like the two driverswhose proreform observations in the original Journal Sentinel piecewere actually stronger than Loves What about local church leaders Socialworkers Cops            Some other beefs with todays piece            Discussing one leaver survey DeParle declares that for most familiesthe work has failed to translate into economic progress These families hesays earn  less than they would have received by staying on welfare Buthe later admits this figure ignores earnedincome tax credits which at theselevels typically total about  a year Doesnt that mean families areactually  ahead Isnt that the story            DeParle refers to Milwaukees growing homeless shelter population butdoesnt give any figures on how much its growing When I checked a couple ofyears ago the shelter population had indeed increased but only by a handfulof families Is the problem now more severe Are we talking about dozens ofpeople or thousands            DeParles big concluding anecdote is the story of Michelle Crawford ayearold Milwaukee woman who went to work last year at a plastics plantafter two decades of desperation and chronic dependence on welfare Shesstill working but DeParle notes that even though she earned nearly this year she struggles to simply keep food on the table to feed herfamily But wait a minute DeParle also notes that her husband Donaldrecently found a job as a hotel maintenance man Presumably he gets paidHow much And doesnt that money get added to the  to help feed herthree children Maybe its not enough to make a big difference but DeParledoesnt even bother to tell us            Is there an editor in the house                                             Coming soon                               kausfiles                                  YKpolicy
