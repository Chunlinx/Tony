              i think i was one okay um first thing i thought of was was just the men that put the flyers on the door and im a Christian and i think i feel sorry for people that have to do that you know what i mean i always pray for the guys but when im sitting on my couch and its and a man just walks up and puts his hand on my doorknob   uhhuh     its kind of frightening like whoa and ive ive kind of gotten used to it but it seems kind of bizarre to me to get used to some stranger just coming up from the side because you cant see them approaching your house you know they just   uhhuh yeah because theyre just sort of coming from the side or whatever yeah   exactly and when im sitting here on the sofa crossstitching and all of a sudden somebody a mans got their hand on my door knob its like uh like oh no and so i dont i dont like that and i guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to prevent that or   uhhuh   you know so i think theres other ways to advertise other than a flyer on your door   yeah plus uh you know look at the you know the besides the pollution the the aspect of invasion of privacy theres a big pollution aspect too i find i throw out a lot of those flyers and i have no interest in   uhhuh   whatever they are i i do i find and and they go alone with that just the things you get in the mail   right uhhuh   i you know my my name being sold if i if i give money to the World Wild Wildlife Federation you know its a its a i feel its an invasion of privacy to receive so many pieces of junk mail because they sell my address   uhhuh right right i do too even the credit card things and like we have a Visa and weve got we get ten applications probably a month   uhhuh yeah thats i agree yeah and it   for other Visas and its like wait a minute we have a commitment with the company were with if i want a Visa from your company ill call you yeah   ill call you thats right and they all say that theyre the best Visa but you know i definitely have the one that ive   yeah yeah   you know very rarely do you receive one that has a real low interest rate theyre always more expensive and they uh you know if you stay if you stay with a good one for the while you get a good credit rating and you get a good um a good credit line so you dont like to i dont like to bother with it yeah   right it shows stability but um now i also thought uh i i get calls im a housewife so im home a lot in the day   um uhhuh   and i i get probably four calls probably four a day probably three day a norm but seems like it seems like its more than that of phone calls and and it ive gotten to where ive really had to say okay wait a minute this you know its okay to be nice and sometimes you know i feel like God says talk to this person or something but most of the time i just have gotten where i can say im not interested thank you and i just hang you know and i hang up real nicely but   yeah huh   um i know a few months ago i i would feel that i had to explain to them that im on the other line or im in the middle and its ive just come to a realization that i dont have to explain to this stranger what im doing it and give excuses thats its okay just to say im not interested and go ahead and hang up but i i dont know i dont think most people are secure enough to probably answer   umhum thats right   like that and therefore i feel its an invasion of privacy because i thought all these people share you know what theyre doing even though its none of the business   yeah thats right   it takes uh uhhuh   and i did it for a long time and and i just i feel like that was one i thought of that right off   yeah they ask you a lot of they ask you a lot of personal questions and they yep and you know they and they just keep talking to you too i i i find that a big pain yeah i think   yeah right they dont want to let you go they dont believe you if youre on another line long distance and they just want to keep going and going and stuff so   uhhuh yeah i think do you find that as a woman that you probably see more things of invasions of privacy than uh a man would   um yeah i probably do i feel like i dont know im a Christian i feel like women are more usually deceived you i feel like i dont think thats necessarily a bad thing       because God gave us husbands and fathers to help look out for us but i know that during the day   yeah   the when the cults come by they come by during the day and it says in the Bible that be weary of the people coming door to door trying to proselytize the silly women lay captive with gossip and stuff and i see that they dont come home when my husbands here they dont come to my house       normally when my husbands here they come when im here alone and i notice that and its almost like   uhhuh     theres a a subconscious understanding i think its spiritual that you can rationally explain the subconscious understanding that you know theres theres a more gullibility here when theres not a   huh   a man present i dont think im less than a man because of that i but i see that and Gods really shown me that and i dont talk to them i dont try and witness to them dont try and convert them i just say you can you can either you can come back when my husbands here   uhhuh yeah   if youd like to but were Christians goodbye and i shut the door and thats it and im not ugly to them you know what i mean   yeah what you know whats really funny um is that i get calls you know mostly telephone sales people that i just you know that want to start beating my ear you know   uhhuh right   and um and then they start asking you know well is your wife there and then im thinking well how did they know i was married you know and ill say ill say no shes not because actually my wife and i live apart right now because im in graduate school and um       right   so i only get to see her on Thursday through Monday and its one of those things where theyll say oh your wifes not there and ill say ill say no oh well when is she going to be there and im like well shes never going to be there yes shes never going to be here so you know   yeah are you kidding oh man they do that really   oh yeah uhhuh and and theyll keep going until they get that out of you when your wife is going to be here because they want us to be here together because i guess uh its its   see i she can talk you into that most a lot of women   yeah maybe she would talk me in yeah maybe theyll   a lot of women most women control the budgets and they control the money and they control the husband  i mean most of the time thats how it works so so therefore i guess that they their they see that um     yeah   uhhuh yeah they they do what do you think i just just threw out stuff tonight that uh i walked out of a grocery store and a fellow said you know for a dollar you can win this five hundred dollars worth of groceries   so they feel like i can talk her into   and normally when you see these things its normally um uh a church you know thats doing a raffle or its some type of boy scouts or its some type of group or whatever and i automatically you just think oh its a raffle must be for the kids   uhhuh   you know so you pull out your dollar and you fill out this coupon and   uhhuh   and then when you look at it as you walking away you see that its for some sales pitch of some kind where theyre going to you know and i find that a big invasion of privacy i just im from then on in its like oh this makes me angry you know now you have to question everybody on what theyre doing now you sure this goes to such and such organization   uhhuh   and you sure youre with multiple dystrophy muscular dystrophy or whatever i find that a big invasion of privacy too   yeah uhhuh   because they they sort of pull that over on you you know like um like this is a charitable organization but actually its not its a come on so that they can get your name and phone number   uhhuh   so because you always put your phone number down so they can call and tell you that you won   huh   but actually they started calling me telling me that i could you know buy a soft water softener and they called me for um what else other than water softener the same place called me for   yeah oh great   something else in my kitchen it was all kitchen stuff they put me on and they all called me you know and each one asked me when my wife was going to be here   thats funny uhhuh oh theyre i know its funny how you can look back as a Christian you can see how these things apply and theyre true and in even even in people that arent even Christians theres just a pattern     uhhuh   that you can see in things like that ive noticed that about the cults that they work our neighborhood in the day and they work them good and i consider that i kind of consider that an invasion of privacy but not so much as i do the other   uhhuh   you know what i mean because but i do in to a degree theres also not a day to day occurrence its not that often that they come by but ive notice its kind of gone down before when we first moved here it was pretty often but ive noticed that though they really work in the day and you very rarely see them in the evening because the men are home and so   well i think also you know in the the if men are home during the day theyre theyre um they might be unemployed men who might be more apt to um   right   you know be at the end of their rope you know and be looking for uh uh a salvation in the sense or looking for a uh saving grace you know i   right looking for something yeah kind of depressed or something   looking for something yeah theyre searching for something yeah and also and also you know the woman at home during the day if if the housewife is at home um   yeah i didnt think of that but yeah thats good   she may be bored at the time so shell spend a little bit more time to listen i think you know because she may have finished her work the kids may be taking a nap they may uh they may be playing some place you know or   uhhuh yeah right and and theres nobody but theres no husband there to come in and say wait a minute     yeah   you know i really think this is good and that well i dont know i think we need that but i know i need it   umhum   but um the only thing i would have thought of is my husband just said this he said public bathrooms he   he said what   public bathroom  well he was teasing but he was just being smart because because you know you dont want to go in the public you know   thats an invasion of privacy     oh thats true thats true     what can we do to solve that we can make the architects for all the buildings make private stalls for everyone i thought that was funny but   uhhuh what you know the the terrible thing is i dont know if youve watched the news lately i i guess we just had something up here here im in Baltimore Maryland   uhhuh   so um i get you know we i saw some news out of like New Hampshire and a big thing in the courts right now is um they dont have enough stalls in womens bathrooms as they do mens bathrooms   thats funny   so that men you know because men design these things men can go in and use the urinal or use the toilet but their lines are always you know they go through much faster but but the women have to wait in long lines that are uncomfortable and and if they really have to go its a very difficult problem to be you have to stand in line for an hour and uh and then the whole   yeah i did hear that on the news
