            Interesting clever piece but it seems wedded tothe premise that liberalism  moral virtue But mightnt a columnist offersentiments wholly opposed to Anna Qs and seem to hisher readers the paragonof homespun good sense Dont Pat Buchanans fans think hes simply talkinghorse sense            Others might objectthat Ms Qs warm sentimentality is really smugness Im reminded here of acolumn she wrote on William Kennedy Smith which if I recall it correctlymade the argumentnever established save on the grounds of emotionalidentification with his accuserthat his acquittal was proof of the flaws inour legal system At a time like this Big Sister sounds like kissing kin to BigBrother            Sam Tanenhaus is theauthor of Whittaker Chambers A Biography             To reply clickhere

voice of common sense Q is asophist who tries to make confused thinking look like common sense            In connection with Chris Ofilis painting in herfirst                   Newsweek                column she invokes Joyceand Lawrence but fails to mention that neither was publicly funded Shementions banning and burning but the painting is not being subjected toeither The funding issue isnt supposed to matter because citizens dont havecontrol of every item in the budget anyway Oh Maybe they dont directlyoversee every item but they have every right to complain about items theydont like and demand that they be deleted            Q seems to think that the issue of what is or isnot offensive can be resolved by appealing to analogies in culture and historymedieval Catholic art for example is chockablock with sexual andscatological imagery Do the medieval artists use the imagery in the way Ofilidid Would she apply the same reasoning to her issue of hate speech and say forexample that the n word shouldnt be offensive because it is widely foundin  th century American literature and is sometimes used by blacksin referring to each other            The Brooklyn Museum case isnt about free speechbut rather subsidized ie privileged speech Most speech and artisticexpression are not subsidized by anyone The museum is subsidizing the Ofilipainting because it is supposedly of exceptional value But do our culturalmandarins in the name of free speech have the right to frivolous and likelyselfseeking judgments as to what speech is valuable and what is not            To reply

correct about taxi medallionsand rent control But I am not convinced about parking on two counts            The value of land in Midtown Manhattan is somewherein the neighborhood of  per square foot This high land cost along withthe high cost of constructing underground parking means that more parkingmight not be economically feasible ie land might be used more profitablyfor apartments office space and hotels            Even if new garage space were feasible undercurrent conditions there is a good chance that it should not be built While Itend not to worry about market failure unless it is large in the case ofautomobiles it is large Edwin Mills of Northwestern University estimates thatthe social costs of automobiles could be internalized with a  per gallon gastax in Chicago In NYC the tax would have to be higher than that But thereseems to be little political will to impose rational gas taxes so second bestsolutions such as regulating garage space are likely better than allowingunregulated garage space combined with subsidized auto travel            To reply clickhere                            SubjectYour Diary My Marriage                           Re
