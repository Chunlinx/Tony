                    Background        Sequence homology between the serotonin type  receptor        HT          R the nicotinic acetylcholine        receptor nAChR the GABA         A receptor and the glycine receptor        suggests a large amount of structural similarity within        this superfamily of ligand gated ion channels              This presumed structural homology can be used to guide site        directed mutagenesis studies of particular receptor        subtypes On a gross level all members of this superfamily        assemble as pentameric receptors     In some cases        receptors can be assembled from a single subunit HT         A R and nicotinic  receptors                In other cases at least two different subunits are        required       The ligand binding site is thought to        be formed at the junction between two subunits                    Based on data obtained from affinity labeling and site        directed mutagenesis studies several regions of the        nicotinic acetylcholine receptor have been implicated in        ligand binding     Six essential loops appear to        contribute to the binding site with the position of each        loop differing slightly depending on whether the receptor        is heteromeric or homomeric     For homomeric receptors        such as the  nAChR the loops are identified as A B C        D E and F      The amino acids that interact with        ligands presumably extend into the binding site from these        loops Subunits are composed of  faces  and  with the         face of one subunit forming one side of the binding site        and the  face of another subunit forming the complimentary        side Some binding loops A B and C are present on the         face while the remaining loops D and E are present on the         face     The individual amino acids that form        binding interactions with the functional groups present on        a ligand are likely to differ for each receptor subtype        reflecting the specificity of a particular binding site        however the overall structure of the binding domain may be        similar even for binding sites with different ligand        specificities Identification of ligand specificity        requires identification of both the location or structure        of individual binding site loops and the amino acids        present in a particular receptor subtype        The purpose of this study is to extend the information        available from other members of this receptor family to the        HT          R Sequence homology and a presumed        structural similarity to other ligand gated ion channels        suggests that the E loop region of the HT         A R forms part of the ligand binding        domain for HT          R ligands This region extends from        Y to K and is shown in Table  The homologous        sequences of other representative members of this family        are also shown In the center of this region is a critical        glycine residue that is thought to play a role in        establishing a hairpin loop     Recent xray        crystallographic data obtained from an ACh binding protein        AChBP shows a loop structure in this region resulting        from a  residue turn containing a glycine homologous to        G of the HT          R On either side of this putative        turn region are residues that have been identified as        important to receptor binding                  The formation of this loop structure brings amino acids on        either side of glycine into close proximity and may form a        binding pocket that will accommodate one or more functional        groups In order to identify the interaction of amino acids        in this binding loop with HT          R ligands we have constructed alanine        mutations of residues throughout this region and evaluated        the alteration in binding affinity of  different classes        of HT          R ligands Figure  Our data        identifies  tyrosine residues that appear to interact        selectively with each structural class and supports the        existence of a loop structure in this region of the        receptor                    Results        All mutant receptors were tested for their ability to        bind the HT          R antagonist  Hgranisetron Table        shows the K         d values for wildtype mouse HT         AS Rs and the  alanine mutations we        evaluated  Hgranisetron is a potent antagonist of the        wt HT          R K         d     nM This value agrees        with published data for this compound      B         max values range from the  pmolesmg        protein observed for EA to  pmolesmg protein for        the KA mutation indicating some variability in        expression of the different receptors In general however        receptor expression was similar to that reported by other        laboratories        No detectable binding was        observed for GA and VA mutant receptors For all        other mutants decreases in binding affinity increased K         d  were observed although the magnitude        of the change was less than  fold in all cases A bar        graph showing the change in K         d value resulting from each alanine        mutation is shown in Figure A The largest decreases in        binding affinity were observed for YA  fold Figure         EA  fold and QA  KA    fold        Inhibition binding assays were also conducted Four test        compounds with structures representative of the major        classes of HT          R ligands were chosen serotonin        HT the endogenous agonist         m chlorophenylbiguanide          m CPBG agonist         d tubocurarine          d tc antagonist and lerisetron        antagonist The K         i values for inhibition of         Hgranisetron binding by all four compounds are shown in        Table  Little change in K         i value was observed for the majority of        mutations The values highlighted in bold in Table        represent the K         i values for inhibition of         Hgranisetron binding on mutant receptors that increased        over  fold compared to the K         i obtained for wildtype receptors The        bar chart in Figure Billustrates the changes in K         i resulting from each mutation on the        test compounds Ratios of K         i are shown as positive for increases in        K         i on mutant receptors versus wildtype        and negative for decreases A positive change thus        corresponds to a decrease in binding affinity for the        compound as a result of the mutation Large decreases in        binding affinity were observed for select compounds only on        the YA YA and YA mutations        A more detailed analysis of the competition binding data        obtained for the YA YA and YA mutations is shown        in Figure  For HT the YA mutation produced a         fold increase in K         i and YA produced a  fold increase        No change in K         i was observed for the YA mutation        Figure A The HT          R agonist         m CPBG showed a similar profile for        the changes in K         i values resulting from mutations of the        three tyrosines Figure B As was observed for HT the        YA mutation produced a large increase in K         i  fold while the Y A and YA        mutations produced only  and  fold changes        respectively        The K         i value for         d tc inhibition of  Hgranisetron        binding was altered only slightly by the YA or YA        mutations  fold and  fold changes respectively The        YA mutation however produced a  fold increase in the        K         i compared to wildtype receptors Figure        C        The K         i value for lerisetron inhibition of         Hgranisetron binding was increased  fold by the YA        mutation and  fold by the YA mutation Only a         fold change in K         i resulted from the YA mutation        Lerisetron was the only compound for which a large increase        in the K         i was observed on the YA mutation        Figure D This mutation produced smaller changes in K         i for HT and         m CPBG  fold for both and only a         fold change for         d tc        In whole cell patch clamp studies HT perfusion of        cells transfected with YA and YA cDNA produced no        responses at HT concentrations of up to  mM although        specific binding to these receptors was identified in        receptor binding studies Unlike YA and YA YA        receptors responded to application of HT Due to the low        potency of HT on these receptors only a portion of the        concentration response curve could be determined up to         mM The EC          value was estimated as greater than         M Figure  This value shows a greater than  fold        increase in EC          compared to wildtype receptors a        larger change than was observed for the K         i  fold The most dramatic change        observed for whole cell currents was an alteration in the        kinetics of the response elicited by application of HT        YA mutant receptors displayed much slower rise times        compared to wildtype receptors at all concentrations        tested Peak wt responses were typically obtained in less        than  ms while YA responses required several seconds        to plateau Desensitization kinetics were also altered        While wt receptors desensitized rapidly mutant receptors        showed no desensitization during the  s perfusion        time                    Discussion        The putative Eloop region of the LGIC family of        receptors is homologous to residues Y through K in        the HT          R                   Structurefunction studies of this region have been        conducted in several other members of this family of        receptors including GABA         A and nAChR subtypes In each case        residues have been identified that alter either the binding        of selective ligands or receptor function                    In order to determine if this loop also        contains residues critical to the structure or function of        the HT          R we have constructed alanine        mutations of amino acids throughout the homologous region        of the mouse HT         AS R and investigated the affects on        binding of  different structural classes of HT          R ligands We have identified three        tyrosine residues that appear to play a role in binding of        selective ligands to this receptor In addition our data        support the existence of a loop structure in this region as        has been hypothesized for the nAChR and identified in a        homologous AChBP              Representative members of  major structural classes of        HT          R ligands were tested on all mutants        Figure  These ligands include the antagonists         Hgranisetron         d tc and lerisetron and the        agonists HT and         m CPBG Most of the mutations tested        produced only minor changes in binding affinity for these        ligands Large changes in binding are only apparent on        YA YA and YA receptors for select ligands The        resulting effects of individual mutations are specific to        particular structural classes of ligands The YA        mutation altered the K         i for         d tc inhibition but did not alter        the K         i obtained for any other compound        tested while YA altered the K         i for         m CPBG HT and lerisetron but had        little if any effect on inhibition by         d tc These data indicate the highly        specific nature of the effects introduced by the alanine        mutations and appear to reflect specific changes in        ligandreceptor interaction        Binding of  Hgranisetron is altered only slightly by        the alanine mutations introduced in this study         fold This result indicates the lack of involvement of        amino acids in this binding loop in the binding of         Hgranisetron It is apparent however that         Hgranisetron does occupy the same binding cleft as other        HT          R ligands as evidenced by the ability        of HT         m CPBG         d tc and lerisetron to displace it        from the binding site The lack of any large change in        binding of granisetron supports our contention that there        is little global structural perturbation of the binding        site resulting from the introduction of each individual        alanine mutation        The K         i for inhibition of  Hgranisetron        binding by HT was increased  fold by the YA        mutation A similar increase was also observed for         m CPBG  fold In contrast the        YA and YA mutations produced relatively small changes        in the K         i  Since both compounds are HT          R agonists they are likely to share        the same binding interactions One of these interactions        appears to be with Y Other studies have also identified        binding site interactions for agonists R E F        W and several residues adjacent to the M region have        all been demonstrated to alter the action of HT andor         m CPBG        Within the        crystal structure of the AChBP homologous residues are        located in the apparent binding site     The effects        of agonist on the HT          R are mediated by their interaction        with these binding site residues resulting in stable        receptor conformations including the channel open state        Identification of interacting amino acids and their        location in the tertiary structure of the receptor may        provide clues to the mechanism of channel opening For        example amino acids homologous to Y and W R and        W respectively are in close proximity in the AChBP        although on complementary faces of the receptor subunits            Spier         et al  have suggested that W may        be involved in a cation interaction with the amino group        of HT and         m CPBG     If W and Y are        located near each other but on opposite faces of the        binding site in the HT          R then they could potentially act in        concert to help stabilize a conformation of the receptor        leading to channel opening                d Tubocurarine inhibition was        uniquely altered by the YA mutation An increase in K         i of  fold was observed for         d tc on this mutant Little if any        change resulted for any other mutation Thus while         d tc may form an interaction with        the receptor at this binding loop it appears to interact        with Y rather than Y or Y This difference in        binding site interactions of the antagonist         d tc and the agonists HT and         m CPBG could be the result of a        slightly different positioning of         d tc in the binding site The        antagonists         d tc and  Hgranisetron also        interact differently with this region since         Hgranisetron binding was not altered by mutations at any        of the amino acids tested While the binding of         d tc appears to involve some        interaction with this binding loop the binding of         Hgranisetron does not Previous studies have indicated a        point of overlap between  Hgranisetron and         d tc at W of the HT         AS R     These studies indicate        that the binding regions for these antagonists are        partially overlapping at W but not at Y In addition        to Y and W         d tc has also been observed to        interact with D and several other residues in loop C            The         d tc binding site appears to involve        interaction with at least three different binding loops A        E and C although additional interacting amino acids may be        found Data obtained for         d tc is particularly valuable due to        the rigid nature of this molecule Determination of        interacting functional groups and their relationship to        individual amino acids could enable         d tc to be used as a molecular ruler        to determine relative positions of these amino acids        Lerisetron inhibition of  Hgranisetron binding to        mutant receptors was also investigated Lerisetron is a        potent HT          R antagonist first synthesized by        Orales         et al     As was observed for        HT          R agonists lerisetron binding was        altered by the YA mutation This mutation produced an        increase in the K         i of  fold compared to wildtype        receptors This increase in K         i indicates an important interaction of        lerisetron with Y and a similarity between the binding        location of lerisetron HT and         m CPBG Lerisetron is the only        antagonist tested that shares a binding site interaction in        this region with agonists In contrast to HT and         m CPBG however lerisetron also        interacts with Y as indicated by the  fold increase        in K         i on YA mutant receptors Since        neither         d tc nor  Hgranisetron interacts        with Y or Y there appears to be a difference between        the interactions formed by these antagonists compared to        lerisetron The binding sites of the three antagonists        tested differ with respect to this binding loop Since the        role of a competitive antagonist is simply to block the        binding of agonists and prevent channel opening the        specific amino acids that interact with the ligand can vary        for different antagonists This is less likely to be the        case with agonists since they must produce a conformational        change in the protein to exert their effects        Only two mutant receptors failed to bind         Hgranisetron GA and VA G is the conserved        glycine in this putative binding loop Chirara         et al have suggested that the        highly conserved nature of the glycine in this region may        indicate the existence of a loop structure consisting of        either  or a loose three residueturn in the nAChR            Either of these turns would bring the two putative        strands together such that L Y and S and        Y are all on the same side of an antiparallel sheet        These residues have been identified by affinity labeling        sitedirected mutagenesis or cysteine substitution to lie        on the same surface A classic residue turn would place        these residues on opposite surfaces     Substitution        of the conserved glycine by alanine may disrupt the        structure of this region and prevent assembly or expression        of the receptor The recent determination of the crystal        structure of an AChBP supports this hypothesis The AChBP        displays a large amount of homology to the amino terminal        of LGIC receptors and thus may be similar in structure             The crystal structure of this protein reveals a        loose  residue turn incorporating the conserved glycine        residue     Homologous residues in other LGIC subunits        have also been identified and are shown in Figure  The        residues identified in this study as altering binding        affinity of HT          R ligands would also be present on the        same surface if this structure is present in the HT          R While Y lies somewhat outside        the region identified by Chiara in the nAChR homologous to        N L and L are homologous to Y and Y of        the HT         AS R The ability of lerisetron to        interact with both Y and Y also supports the        hypothesis that these two amino acids are present in a loop        structure since the eight intervening residues would        position Y and Y too far apart to permit them both to        interact with a single ligand even if they were interacting        with functional groups on opposite ends of the molecule A        loop structure would bring them into closer proximity and        permit interaction with the small molecule lerisetron        All three tyrosine mutations were investigated using a        whole cell patch clamp assay to determine if functional        changes could be observed Whole cell responses could not        be obtained for YA or YA although specific binding        of  Hgranisetron was observed These data suggest that        while the receptors do assemble and are capable of binding         Hgranisetron they are either not transported to the        cell surface or are nonresponsive to HT at        concentrations of  mM or less        YA does produce functional channels however they        display distinctly altered response kinetics when compared        to wildtype receptors YA responses do not show the        rapid rise times observed in wt receptors The extremely        slow rise times observed for YA receptors may indicate a        change in rate constants preceding channel opening These        changes in the rate constants for either agonist binding or        channel opening also produce a  fold decrease in the        observed EC          for HT activation The slow rise is        followed by a nondesensitizing phase of the response that        is dramatically different from the fast desensitization        observed for wt HT         AS Rs Lack of desensitization could        result from either a stabilization of the open state of the        channel or a destabilization of the desensitized state        Mutations of homologous or nearby residues in both the        nAChR and GABA         A receptors have also been demonstrated        to alter the agonist response Mutation of the homologous        residue in the GABA         A receptor subunit T to serine        altered the efficacy of the agonist Flumazenil converting        it to a partial agonist     In the nAChR mutation of        mouse and rat P to leucine altered both the binding of        acetylcholine and the stability of the open state of the        channel P is homologous to P in the HT          R and is only two residues away from        Y The authors of this study concluded that this portion        of the acetylcholine binding site was closely linked to the        channel opening region of the receptor     It is        reasonable to conclude that the homologous region in the        HT          R may perform a similar function The        link between an agonist binding domain and a conformational        change leading to channel opening is not unexpected since        the two must obviously be linked If binding to this region        of the receptor is shown to be a critical step between the        binding of agonists and the opening of the channel further        investigation of the amino acids in this loop may provide        valuable clues to molecular basis of this process                    Conclusions        Our data indicate an important role for this putative        binding site loop in the interaction of the HT          R with different ligands and        illustrate the difference in binding of different        structural classes of ligands Each structural class shows        different patterns of interaction with amino acids in this        region of the receptor  Hgranisetron does not appear to        interact with any of the amino acids tested while         d tc interacts with only Y         m CPBG and HT with Y and        lerisetron with both Y and Y Similar selective        effects have been observed on other residues including        W W F and E among others        Our        data in conjunction with those of other laboratories        indicates the differences in orientation of different        ligands within the same binding cleft These differences in        orientation result in different amino acidfunctional group        interactions As the structural detail of these        interactions emerges these differences could potentially        be exploited to produce more potent and specific ligands        For example construction of a hybrid ligand that combines        the interactions of  Hgranisetron with those of         d tc HT or         m CPBG could produce an antagonist        with increased affinity due to the additional binding        energy of these interactions and a greater specificity        since it would utilize more structural features of the        binding site        The requirement of a glycine at position  and the        ability of lerisetron to interact with both Y and Y        also support the hypothesis that the secondary structure in        this region of the receptor is formed by a loop structure        If the loose  residue turn proposed by Chiara         et al and shown for the AChBP is        present in the HT          R then Y Y and Y would be        present on the same side of the sheet and all three would        be capable of extending into the binding site A similar        observation has been made for the nAChR where S Y        L R and T
