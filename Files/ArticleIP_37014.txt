                                 Hell on Wheels                                             Bringing Outthe Dead                provides director Martin Scorsese with a rich milieu forone of his patented pumpedup odysseys of the soulan urban bedlam as seenthrough the eyes of an emergency medical technician Frank Pierce NicolasCage The film is based on a book by Joe Connelly who cruised the streets ofManhattan in an ambulance from the mids to the early s when the crackepidemic was peaking and New York had become the embodiment of everythinguntenable about major American cities Connelly spent a lot of time picking upshooting victims crackheads in the throes of cardiac arrest and homelessdrunkssome from the first wave of Reaganera deinstitutionalizationandbringing them to the overpacked emergency room of what he calls Our Lady ofMisery Hospital The book is a memoir reframed as a novel It boils thoseyears down to a couple of days in which Pierce clutches vainly at the lastvestiges of sanity Night after night he has visions of a young Hispanicasthmatic whom he failed to resuscitate Her head stares accusingly at him fromthe shoulders of people he passes on the street Its not just that he cantforgive himself for not having saved her life its that he cant forgivehimself for putting her out of his mind He cant live with the idea that hehas become indifferent            The material has so many Scorseselike motifs thatits easy to see why the director fell on it and passed it on to his TaxiDriver  screenwriter Paul Schrader who has said he finished thescript in three weeks I can believe that and not just because theres so muchdialogue and narration from the book on screen Its probable that Connellythought of Taxi                Driver and Mean Streets  when hewrote his novel so having it adapted by Schrader and Scorsese was like closingthe circle But what the circle really needed was opening Its not just thatslowmotion scenes of the ambulance gliding past people beating one another upfeel like dj vu  Its that Schrader hasnt rethought Connellystrumpedup story line            The movie starts withPierce and his occasional partner Larry John Goodman trudging to the topfloor of a Hells Kitchen brownstone where a man named Burke has been incardiac arrest for  minutes They manage to get Burkes heart started buthis brain shows only scant traces of activity and in the hospital he keepsflatlining and being resuscitated   times In and out of theemergency room over the course of several nights Pierce gets chummy withBurkes estranged daughter Mary Patricia Arquette a lost soul whoseshellshocked existence she begins to drift back into drug abuse seems tied into her dads neitherlivingnordead condition Pretty soon I got the sinkingfeeling that the movie was building to the possibility of a mercy killing as atest of the heros ability to overcome his internal chaos and feelsomething Its true that Pierces altruistic impulse is not on par withTravis Bickles impulse to shave his head and assassinate a presidentialcandidate but Schrader and Scorsese dont view his actions with anyirony I have a feeling they needed an ending and this one was handy            Their opportunism is a shame because theres enoughtexture in Bringing Out the Dead for several movies Scorsese doescrackerjack work and some of the cruising imagerynot a bebop legato as inTaxi Driver but hyperfast and strobelikeis startling Theres ascary irony built into the material that the people charged with saving liveson the streets cant function at normal rhythms that their amphetaminejagintensity can make them as likely to want to murder people as to revive themScorsese and Schrader are at their most inspired in the raucous theater of theemergency room in which patients on stretchers scream at one another to shutup and an admitting nurse played by Schraders wife the brilliant Mary BethHurt takes pains to let the drunks and addicts and failed suicides know justhow much theyre imposing on her Why should we help Youre just going toget drunk tomorrow Scorsese and Queen Latifah can be heard as the voices ofthe dispatchers and their callsthey often have to bully the drivers toanswerare beautifully shaped comic turns Years of sitcom work haventsoftened Goodman whose Larry is sour unlovable thickened by indifference Asanother of Pierces partners Ving Rhames talks into the radio like atoastyvoiced DJ Big Daddy Marcus is alive and strides through his sceneswith an unlit cigar in his mouth defiantly proclaiming his potency Themixture of jokiness and blood never feels cheapit adds to the movies themewhich is horrified estrangement from ones own humanity            I must admit that themovie made me weep a couple of times Its hard to watch with detachment astubes are thrust down peoples throats or as theyre shocked back to life Someof the more jaded characters act as if life is cheap but Scorsese doesnt Andeverything Nicolas Cage does gives weight to the filmmakers vision Cage hasthe same flamboyantly haggard and toothy look he had in Vampires Kiss yet this time the actor is grounded His Pierce would love to soar offinto the etherto escape into madnessbut he cant quite make the leapSometimes its less about saving lives than being a witness he says invoiceover I was a grief mop It was enough that I simply showed up Cageswary alertness does those words justice            One of the best things about David Lynchs marvelous newfilm                   The Straight Story                is its play onstraightwhich is both the name of the protagonist the failingseptuagenarian Alvin Straight Richard Farnsworth and a description of themovies onethingafteranother mode of storytelling Farnsworth plays an oldduffer who hears that his brother Lyle has had a stroke It emerges that theyhavent spoken for a decade and the last time they did Alvin said somedevastatingly harsh things So as a kind of penance Alvin decides to travelhundreds of miles to Lyles house under his own power The only vehicle heslegally allowed to drive is a John Deere lawn mower that goes maybe three milesan hour But somehow the mode of traveland the hardship of thattravelbecomes the movies message            I was impatient with The Straight Story sopeningthe arty dissolves the crawling pace the sense of stasis But onceAlvin left his mentally handicapped daughter a radiantly simple turn by SissySpacek for the open road it becomes apparent that Lynch needed those earlyscenes He needed to show you that as slow as Alvin is going on his tractorits flying next to what he has been doing As Alvin encounters a lot of plainfolks both the character and the movie threaten to start seeming dear Butthe vein of regret misery and the Lynchian promise of decay is always justbelow the surfaceand always palpable In Lynchs last film LostHighway  the director concocted an original twisty syntax in whichidentity was mutable and the narrative moved by quantum leaps This time hesticks to the path and his work is as transcendentand as spellbindingasanything he has done since Blue Velvet  Lynch has slowed theworld down and gotten back in touch with it The Straight Story could besubtitled Found Highway
