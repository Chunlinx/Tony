            well Julie um are you in a situation where youd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly   well i dont know my grandfather is ninety two years old   umhum   and he is still living by himself my mother grandmother died a couple of years ago   hm   but he doesnt want to to move away he lives in a lil farmhouse on a farm and he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesnt wanna go to a nursing home   is he able to uh still do do everything himself pretty well   well he was until this operation he has arthritis   oh yeah   and now i dont really think hes doing that well and my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot   yeah   but um my greatgrandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three   umhum   and um died six weeks after they put him in the home   yeah and im sure that kind of thing would influence your fathers grandfathers feelings because um i think you know i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left   umhum   and and far as far as im sure a lot of people going into a nursing home is like saying my life is over and im just here for the rest of the stay and so i you know  i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home its more a case of where they are not able to look after their daytoday needs ah they can look after a lot of things but theres some of the daytoday needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore   umhum   um i know my none of my grandparents were in a nursing home they generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all goodness younger than your grandparents like they were in their eighties that type of thing um but i did uh you know i guess uh when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do some take care of themselves physically hum   but i just dont think that nursing homes really do a very good job   and thats thats difficult part because i think what they ofend get used as is uh almost like a very high level or longterm care for uh similar to a hospital   umhum   um i know like here in Saskatchewan we have our hospital care well and the care actually for the elderly older people graded in level in four levels and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires longterm hospital care ah generally are not able to look after thisselves to very to a very great extent physically often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimers disease or those  or or physical and mental handicaps um you know where they really required twenty four hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal   umhum   and uh but i think  it can be helpful in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need um   but i dont i mean at least i mean i think some nursing homes do that but i think a lot of nursing homes really um are guilty of neglect   yeah i think and i think it happens more in areas where its uh i guess uh a broad social medical system where uh you know theres government medical care and that kind of thing if it its the lot where its funded by the individuals and and i guess thats sort of my lack of understanding i think that a majority of the places in the US um you know there is some government aid available but the majority of it is to the ability of the individual to pay   umhum   and uh if youre not able to look after yourself then you have to rely on
