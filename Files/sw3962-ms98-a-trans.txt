                well uh what is your favorite kind of music   well i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be uh classical music   oh same here yeah   oh really what type of music do you like in the classical area or what era do you era do you like the most   oh well i guess i like a wide range uh everything from uh from Baroque through at least some modern music   umhum   and my wife and i these days are especially into opera weve been sort of opera fans for a few years now   um do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages   well we uh generally the places weve gone they sing in the original languages   umhum   like the Dallas Opera here normally does i guess   umhum yeah i i havent gotten into that too much because i  uh if i dont know the story line and um i dont speak the language then i have difficult time comprehending whats going on   well one thing thats helped us a lot is that uh you you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video cassettes uh video tape   umhum   and so we have quite a collection of those and you watch them at home and they have subtitles so you you figure out whats going on after a while and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater       but you know the uh Dallas opera now has uh super titles on on all their performances i think   what is that   well they they give an uh an English translation on a on a screen up above the stage   oh i didnt know that   yeah   that can help people like me      in fact they even do that for operas sung sung in English because it is hard to understand the words some times     well i can understand that so id say Vivaldi is probably my favorite uh composer   yeah well i really like Vivaldi uh hes uh definitely uh one of the one of the top of that era   yeah i like Baroque music i like full body music uh with the uh       uh with brass and winds wood winds instruments uh course i like uh also string instruments and i have two string instruments in my house uh instrument players   umhum   both my sons play string instruments one plays a Cello and the other one plays the Viola   oh   so i get to go to at least four or five concerts a year           uhhuh how how old are they   uh one is thirteen and one is eleven   so theyre doing this in school or what uhhuh   yes yes sure   well youve got half a string quartet there   yeah were on our way   yeah   so uh um i try to enjoy all of it   well since you seem to like uh Italian music have you ever uh gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era the uh uh period right before actually before Vivaldi i guess   um a little bit but um a lot of the um music i dont know about uh as far as the titles and i have to listen to it and and figure out what im listening to   uhhuh   um i do belong to a Musical Heritage Society   oh yes uhhuh   do you belong to that   no i dont but i think i know what it is isnt that a uh uh see cant you get records through that or something recordings   you can get recordings uh they now have them on compact disc or uh or cassettes or LPs   umhum   and uh they do their they do a lot of original recordings themselves   yes yeah i think uh   uh but they also uh they also uh go to the different composers or the different i guess uh what do you call them the guys that orchestrate   uh   the conductors the conductors yeah they go to conductors uh and and they actually have them perform the music and they record it   uh yes right so theyre actually commissioned performances   sure a lot of them are   uhhuh   or they will know find out when theyre performing and they will uh record the music at that time  and so uh it is uh       uh high quality grade music and of course now theyre getting in they also have a jazz section and they also have a uh more contemporary and American uh composer section   uhhuh well i have good heard good things about the uh Music Heritage Society but if i get involved in one of those things i end up spending all my money on the on the music or   yeah well you can control it uh   almost uh almost uh bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when i got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago   oh really   yeah my room mate signed me up he got a bonus record and i got a lot of bills   i see   so we have to watch that   huh well thats good   uh do you play an instrument yourself   yes i i play guitar and and early years played saxophone
