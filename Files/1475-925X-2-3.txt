                    Background        The force produced by a muscle under voluntary        contraction is based on two mechanisms the firing        frequency and the recruitment of the motor units The motor        unit MU is a functional entity consisting of a motor        neuron and the whole set of muscular fibers it innervates        Increasing either the firing frequency or the number of        recruited MUs contributes to increasing the muscle force        The smoothness of the force output of a muscle is enhanced        by the firing rate  recruitment interaction within the MU        pool    and the mechanical filtering effect of the        tissue compensating for the discrete nature of the        process which builds up the actual muscle force from        individual muscle fiber twitches The variation of the        firing rates of the motor units occurs simultaneously for        all the motor units within a muscle and even in different        muscles acting on the same joint according to the        phenomenon of common drive     Accordingly small        variations of the output force acquired via a force        transducer can be noticed Also the control loops        involving Ia Ib afferents are responsible for the        occurrence of certain peaks within the output force in the        isometric exercise and others are due to the activation        from higher levels            Sustained muscular contractions externally associated        with not being able to maintain a certain force lead to        physiological fatigue tremor or pain localized in the        specific muscle localized muscular fatigue Fatigue is        defined as any reduction in the force generating capacity        measured by MVC regardless of the task performed            The fatigued muscle develops tetanic tension more slowly        than normal and prolongs the relaxation phase        simultaneously with inner chemical changes The failure in        maintaining the motor task defines the endurance limit and        endurance time is the total duration of the task up to the        endurance limit        The myoelectric activity detected with surface        electrodes SEMG may be considered as the summation of the        electrical signals generated by a number of motor units        active within the same motor territory in the proximity of        the electrodes The SEMG signal is a convenient mean to        study the muscle behavior under fatiguing exercise as it        proves timedependent changes provided care is taken to        prevent cross talk from adjacent muscles        Fatigue is associated with a compression of the PSD of        the SEMG toward lower frequencies from the very beginning        of the voluntary contraction     This is due to the        reduction in the conduction velocity in direct relation        with the muscular fiber membrane excitability and with        neural adaptations resulting in an increase of the lower        frequency content of the signal Fatigue is also associated        with higher amplitudes of the SEMG signal toward the end of        the exercise       It has been shown that in        sustained motor tasks changes at different levels        including motoneural discharge behaviour develop before an        endurance limit is reached phenomenon called central        fatigue      Central and peripheral fatigue develop        together and have to be seen not as a result but as        complementary elements of a complex strategy striving to        insure the optimality of the motor behavior within the        framework of available resources        Under muscular contraction mechanical vibrations occur        due to three main processes i the inner muscular        vibrations which are the intrinsic components of the        muscle contraction     ii oscillations of the human        motor system eg tremor and clonus     and iii        artefacts They are located in specific frequency ranges        with a certain overlapping the artefacts  due to large        movements  show the lowest frequencies possible tremor        contributions are below  Hz in healthy subjects usually        between  and  Hz     and the mechanical inner        vibrations affect the range between  and  Hz        The MMG may be considered to reflect the mechanical        muscle vibrations generated by the spatiotemporal        summation of the individual muscle fiber twitches which are        evoked through MU activation by the motor neurons MMG        recording is useful in experimental situations when SEMG        usage is not feasible such as in complex working        environments and in areas with heavy electromagnetic        pollution The MMG was recorded with acceleration or sound        transducers         The technique of recording        MMG was refined using piezoresistive silicon accelerometers        in a surface mount package      to provide a        reliable acquisition of MMG      Preliminary results        showed the potential of the MMG signal to monitor the        muscle fatigue     The EMG and MMG recorded        simultaneously from the same muscle seem to have similar        behavior       ie the MF of SEMG and MMG decrease        from the very beginning of the contraction and their RMS        values increase        The actual study addresses another extensive comparison        of the MMG and SEMG in monitoring the muscle fatigue        aiming to appreciate whether the MMG alone may be used to        monitor the muscle behavior under fatiguing contraction We        are hypothesizing that MMG can indicate the degree of        muscle activation and therefore can be used to monitor the        development of the muscle fatigue in the same way the SEMG        has been proved to do                    Methods                  Parameters          PSD The PSD of a stationary random process           x                       n            is estimated via the discretetime Fourier          transform                    PSD              FFT            x                       n                        where FFT is the Fourier transform of the specific          sequence Computed in this form this estimation is          called the periodogram Because using windows other than          the rectangular ones does not necessarily improve the          estimate     a rectangular window has been used          RMS The RMS of the SEMG signal is considered the most          reliable parameter in the time domain     An          increase of the SEMG RMS with advancing fatigue has been          reported in many cases      RMS is claimed to be          not affected by the cancellation due to the motor unit          action potential train superposition which affects other          processing techniques involving rectification     It          is also related to the power of the signal via the          Parsevals relation     thus providing a direct          connection with the frequency domain                    where           PSD                       i                       i           th PSD component                    n  the number of spectral          components          From  it follows that the overall average activity          observed through the PSD of a certain SEMG segment is          expressed by the RMS value computed on the same specific          SEMG segment of data          The PSD and the RMS values were computed for all the          signals SEMG MMG both muscles in all subjects The          evolution of the PSD with time is shown in contour plots          computed to display at  levels the isolines of the          matrix containing the succession of the spectra from the          beginning to the end of the contraction          MF MF is the frequency value separating the power          spectrum into two equal surface regions SEMG MF has been          proved to be a reliable descriptor of the muscle fatigue          evolution        in the isometric exercise          For all the subjects the linear regression was          performed on the RMS and MF evolutions to compute the          slope a and intercept point a

intersex          variability for the MMG vs SEMG          In all cases Figure  SEMG Figure  MMG both          muscles the average slope a of the RMS evolution is          positive The analysis of the RMS shows comparable slopes          a in women and men for the SEMG signal Figure           between the two muscles while for the MMG Figure           they are comparable in men between the Biceps and          Brachioradialis but different in women                            Discussion        The local variations in the MF and the RMS are due to        small local variations in the activation of the muscle        That is why areas of higher activation strips can be        noticed in the contour plots Figures   The mechanical        resultant of the reinforcements in the activation better        illustrated by the RMS peaks leads to oscillations of the        output force around its average Meanwhile there is a        progressive spreading up of the higher frequency activity        within the PSD This may be generated by progressive        recruitment of new motor units in the both muscles A        larger frequency range toward the end of the task may also        witness an increased activity of the controlling neural        loops and modulating subsystems as fatigue develops        The amplitude of the MMG RMS progressively increases        Figure  with developing fatigue This reflects increased        twitch potentiation An increase in the activation        possibly due to progressively higher number of active motor        units together with a more synchronous firing may also play        a role in the RMS increase The same increase is shown by        the SEMG Figures   this demonstrates that not only        peripheral mechanisms are responsible for the MMG RMS        increase        MF decreases in all cases both SEMG and MMG both        muscles all subjects from the very beginning of the        muscle contraction This proves the central intervention in        modulating the activation with increasing fatigue central        fatigue The MF decrease may be the effect of the        centrally generated progressive alteration of the        activation of individual MNs as the relaxation time        increases this may be explained by the withdrawal of the        tonic fusimotor driven spindlesupport via the fusimotor        loop     As the muscle afferents provide up to         excitation to the MN it seems that this mechanism stays as        an important provision of intervention The presynaptic        inhibition may also contribute to reducing the fusimotor        support with advancing fatigue and affects the Ia and Ib        afferents More Ib inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in        MNs also decline in sustained muscular contractions and        the gain of force feedback loop is reduced The group II        nonspindle muscle afferents have increased discharge rates        with increasing fatigue also contributing to the        inhibitory effect Meanwhile the alpha MNs are centrally        inhibited by group III and IV muscle afferents activated        by the accumulation of metabolites in the fatiguing muscle        but this is expected to come into action later than from        the beginning to further accelerate the process This may        be witnessed by the nonlinear spreading up of the frequency        range and increase in RMS        The above discussion shows the intimate link between the        EMG and the MMG as functionally related signals they both        witness the neural activation of the muscular fibers and        its mechanical effect respectively This functional link        helps explaining the difference between the MF intercept        points in SEMG and MMG Figure  The MMG itself results        as a spatiotemporal fused effect of the muscle fiber        twitches Hence the MMG frequency spectrum is located        lower than the SEMG spectrum on the frequency scale This        effect is further enhanced by the filtering effect of the        tissue between the contraction site and the transducer        This mechanical filtering effect may also explain smaller        intersex variability shown by the MF slope for the MMG        compared to the SEMG        The MMG MF slopes Figure  are statistically different        between the Biceps and Brachioradialis muscles in women        men and total In the isometric contraction addressed by        this work this muscle shows a decrease of the MF with        fatigue less accentuated than the Biceps muscle shows        Even if the both muscles Biceps and Brachioradialis are        intensively worked out they are differently loaded        relative to their individual MVCs This may influence the        balance between the centrally modulated activation and the        peripheral phenomena in each of them and may explain the        difference The above explanation may also address the        significant difference in MMG RMS slopes Figure         between Biceps and Brachioradialis muscles        A study    brought results in agreement with our        results regarding the evolution of the PSD and RMS The        study    mentions that the SEMG and MMG give        information on the localized fatigue Our results show that        both the SEMG and MMG demonstrate the central component of        the fatigue the decrease in MF from the very beginning of        the contraction That is why the MMG is as valuable as        SEMG in exploring not only peripheral fatigue but also        sensorimotor interaction and central intervention in the        development of the muscular fatigue                    Conclusion        This study addresses a quantitative comparison MF RMS        of accelerometerbased MMG and SEMG It brings additional        evidence on the central fatigue and provides means of        quantifying the fatigue development in the isometric        exercise        According to this study the MMG signal can be used for        indication of the degree of muscle activation and for        monitoring the muscle fatigue development in the isometric        contraction        The study also advocates the use of the integrated        accelerometerbased MMG acquisition An accelerometerbased        MMG transducer is selective not dependent of the        environmental acoustical and electrical noise and it also        provides positional information on motorunit territory        The transducer can be incorporated into a miniature        standalone radiofrequencypowered device which can be        chronically implanted in the muscle As such it has        multifaceted potential for future research in movement        neuroscience in adverse environments when it is not        feasible to use the SEMG complex working environments and        situations wherein the SEMG signal is contaminated by        electrical noise        The work also encourages further research on the use of        MMG in dynamic contraction                    Authors contributions        MTT conceived the study conceived and developed the        macromodel for
