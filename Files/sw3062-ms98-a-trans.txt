              well weve talked a little bit about the Plano school system um i i really have been pleased with Plano i have a child who uh my son is learning disabled   uhhuh   and uh i thank God every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into   now is he the elementary school   hes in elementary school and hes not severely learning disabled i mean you know he just   uhhuh uhhuh but he is being helped   hes being helped he he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math and they recently released him from resource which im i was thrilled i really was i i just   uhhuh oh great   thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump and um hes in the Herman Method of Reading i dont know if youre familiar with that it is something new and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters   no thats something new to me im oh   um   i think i read about that in the paper doctor Haggard is   its wonderful   is heading that up   yes and its wonderful he didnt have a problem with reading as a matter of fact hes reading on level the problem was his spelling   uhhuh   and you know in in watching the way he has struggled its interesting because im convinced i have the same learning disability or had that was ignored and   oh right so you worked you learned how to solve your problems on your own   thats right and and so its you know its not an intelligence problem its just a problem with learning   has has he had this since kindergarten or is this something that maybe learning phonetics and then he just didnt learn the right way   well you know its funny when um when he was in first grade he had trouble with with spelling and i would say to the teacher   uhhuh   you know its amazing he will be able to youll say to him spell cat and you know hell say C A T and then he would go to write it and he would write C O T   okay   and i kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here something is wrong here and the teacher kept saying oh he has a May birthday hes just immature   youre right right right   well second grade it was i will these teachers as far as im concerned are absolute saints because in second grade it was about the second week of school i went up there and i i requested a conference   good good thats great for parents to be involved   and because all year long they kept telling me i was crazy well i was and i and i went up there the second week of school and i said you know something is wrong and thank God the leader the head teacher the team leader was a special education major   oh how great   it was it was and   so she she was able to zero in oh   she had picked it up yep she had already picked it up and she said you know we we were going to call you if you hadnt called us we think theres a learning disability and we think he needs to be tested immediately because you know once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested and she said i think we can get him real fast   huh uhhuh uhhuh   and sure enough they tested him and you know he qualified for for the help and its been great and i and i thank God im here because i i know i have a sister who has the other extreme she has a a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her   right oh no   and and to me thats the same thing its its like having a child who has a learning disability thats being ignored this poor gifted child is being ignored   uhhuh uhhuh right but thats something that parents i think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child   thats true   so because thats something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home   thats true uhhuh   but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that then it makes it real difficult and this is this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that that uh you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs   uhhuh yes right right   that these students need and im not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem they test kids before they take them   exactly and   and if theyre a behavior problem theyre out that and and uh   they dont take them thats right right   this is kind of a rejection type of thing and and we get it even at our level in in i work a nine ten school   uhhuh   and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the uh parochial and public and uh private schools   uhhuh   and uh they come in and their attitude is im a bad boy and proceed to  prove it   really really   so i i really hate that for them i i would rather they not have that attitude but   yeah well when comparing test scores i know recently i was in a discussion and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools and that was one of the points that i made is that youre not comparing apples to apples   thats right thats right   you know you cant say um you know i know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and into a private school   uhhuh   into a private school and um which is which is too bad but on the other hand i i cant necessarily blame them you know they they are a private school and they can do whatever they want   no thats right they can be selective right   and they can they thats right they have the ability to be selective but you cant say then well public schools are are not as good   right   perhaps they are because theyre theyre   if you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the private to the private school group then i think you would have a more equitable   youre right   way and i have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here in in in uh honesty honesty the kids in Japan are they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten theyre going to get into   oh really   and then after uh and if if you only the in fact theyve had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably wont get into the top elementary and and high school and if they dont then after when they reach a certain age they just thats the end of their schooling   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and and uh they dont ever really go on its only their top ones that go on like ours do   uhhuh uhhuh   and and uh so that that creates a problem and and you cant compare because they go so many more hours   yeah   the other thing is that the priority in the family is that childs education and is that child   right well you see that with the foreigners that come here     thats right   um i i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they where they said that you know these children they they had to be the best and they put off all social life all everything you know well is that good yes the child is very bright   thats right thats right   bright but on the other hand i feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road have are more rounded you know sure sure i think its real important to have friends i think its real important to play sports i think its real important to be part of a team   better coping skills yes right   and so thats why i said their childhood is extremely different from mine we didnt do all that you know  we certainly didnt carpool and run the way i do um   right well and you dont you dont see the parents uh encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or drill teams or band   no right right   its strictly stick to the educational and its interesting to see them as they get older uh then that is the type of adult they are   uhhuh   um
