                okay how did you find out about this   well uh my brotherinlaw sent me the thing   from Texas oh   right uhhuh and were supposed to talk on voting is that right   yes uhhuh uh why we think theres such a shortage uh low turn out   okay um  do you want to start   okay well i think theres a uh a multiple multiple reasons i think first of all a lot of people are fed up and they think they dont really their vote doesnt count   umhum   and second of all a lot of people just arent educated to you know that they should do that  they should participate   they maybe they dont realize the importance of it or something   right we had uh city councilman here that won by like a handful of votes you know ten votes or something   oh uhhuh   so that would have made a big difference if people had turned out for his opponent   boy ill say   and i think another reason sometimes its inconvenient   uhhuh   the hours especially in a presidential election i dont know why it couldnt go on for several days or why we couldnt even phone in our vote you know you can you can uh   uhhuh   now the colleges you can register over the phone i dont see why we couldnt vote over the phone you know on the computers and all   oh thats an idea yeah well no we dont  not   oh you dont do that up there   yeah we have the voting but uh i never heard of   i mean you dont register for college there they doing that all over the phone now down here at the big at the big schools now what city are you in   oh wow oh its Mantua its just a small small community we probably only have like oh seventy well maybe seven hundred people  not very many   really oh my my thats interesting   right so when we vote its like you say theres its a handful of of votes makes a difference in fact this last November they had a vote and i think there was only like oh five to ten votes within the three different you know the three different people that were running for for the office of   right just a difference of five or ten really hm   yes yes in each of them and so like you say it makes a difference but thats thats a good idea about having it the voting over the phone maybe someday it will   right yeah we could use our Social Security number or something there ought to be some way that they could safe guard it but   it will a come uhhuh yeah   uh especially presidential because you know sometimes you do have to stand in line for a long time   right right and you know i wonder i dont know what the satistics are but i wonder what age um the least has the least good turn out for the voting   oh thats a an  interesting point i have no uh no idea i wonder   i wonder if its the younger people or the older people or just in the middleaged or or who it is that doesnt turn out my guess would be the younger   umhum thats true i know a lot of them that dont vote uh because my i have a twenty year old and i know a lot of her friends dont vote   umhum oh   and uh i go to school right now and i ive heard kids say they dont vote   oh oh just because they dont care   i guess well they dont really read the newspaper much you know i you know at that age i can remember being in college the first the first time and i was a journalism major and i hardly ever read the paper  i think i mean its appalling when i look back but   oh uhhuh   uhhuh   you know i think that may be part of it too theyre not really informed   right and i dont know how big of a problem this is but i wonder if ive heard some people say on occasion that that the the candidates they dont care for any of them so they dont want to you know they dont want to give their vate vote for one or of other just because they   yeah thats true thats very true ive heard people on talk shows say that they feel that thats a statement when they dont vote at all   uhhuh right right that thats some thats saying hey you know we want somebody   right   better for the candidate i dont know i think thats kind of a cop out  i really do i think you ought to you know make your opinion one way or the other there i mean if you even if you dont agree with   cop out yeah i think so too i know even if youre voting against somebody more than for someone which i usually am nowadays  in the national elections it seems   right   right we have   uh i dont know when when i voted for somebody with great enthusiasm it was a long time ago oh   and so this last election here in in our community they had um they counted them by hand you know the ballots by hand and i know that on the bigger ones they have little its a punch card system are you familiar with that   umhum no you you punch it something out   right you you have with your pencil you just punch you know they have a little tray that holds the ballots   umhum oh no ive never seen one like that   and and apparently it makes the the counting a lot easier for the   oh   for those that are counting it but um  with just the small ones they just go ahead and count it by hand and i really liked the the punch card one because we got the results so much sooner when it was over   oh right well we have uh where you fill it in with the lead pencil and and the machine counts it its really fast too   uhhuh oh oh yeah that would be they probably can turn those results in   it well well right like the Scantron you know they call it that goes through the machine i half the tests i take in school now are that way   uhhuh oh   its so easy i just stick them in this machine and get the number  out you know   oh wow thats fascinating   right right   oh so have you ever run for any kind of
