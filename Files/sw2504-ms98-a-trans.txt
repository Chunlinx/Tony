        okay   okay well um do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote   i think its somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference and they really dont listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know and so they figure why go out and vote you know theyre going to do what they want to do theyre corrupt anyway   well   and i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and uh you know like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something i mean thats the only thing that i can figure out because       ive heard so many people say well im not going on voting on that one you know i im going to go fishing today or it wont make any difference if if i dont vote  and i think it does we vote every time   well it uh theres no question it does make a difference uh so far as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct   right   because people have to vote in different area and uh not everyone votes at the same place uh i personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools to children from the little ones on up with the idea of the the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference but   right and maybe maybe let them have some mock i mean uh you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young thats a real good idea   absolutely absolutely and and they are doing that in a number of schools however probably not enough of them uh country wide but its going to take at least a whole generation of people uh to get across the idea of voting uh just like its taking a whole generation of people to finally uh realize the harmfulness of drugs   right   and uh hopefully to uh now with the many programs throughout the country on how to resist taking drugs how to say no to it and what have you that uh perhaps well finally get the youth weaned off of it but uh i know i i spent thirty four years in education here in the Dayton area and in nineteen fifty one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin and what have you to get them started   um   and now that was in fifty one thats forty years ago that it was already a problem so its now uh   God   to the forefront and people are finally taking some action against it and to think weve weve neglected the value of voting   right   and uh and what it really means to vote and  we also dont make the uh the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them   yeah well i dont know how it is up there but down here Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all i mean im sure you heard about some of ours and um people are just i mean its like theyre turned off on voting   umhum sure right   and thats the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party okay were going to have a block party everybodys going to get together were going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then were going to go and vote you know were going to go vote like   umhum   maybe they could give something like uh the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know i mean it doesnt have to be it could be like a a sign that they would put down at the end of your block   uhhuh   you know or anything like that but it its really bad here i mean to me it is it seems like people just dont care anymore they say huh well it dont make any difference you know one crook is as good as the other one and they dont bother to listen to what any of them have to say   yeah right   and um i know my husband now we go vote every time i dont care how small the ballot is i mean if theres one thing if theres one issue because the way i feel is if i dont vote then i dont have any reason to gripe   uhhuh right to complain about it right right   right and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change i wish that and you know but they didnt go vote   thats right   and uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all   thats right   then uh and the importance of it because okay if you dont vote for your friend over here well your friends not going to have a chance   that is   he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would because i know here uh until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that but they should start that a lot earlier   yes uhhuh yeah i its the same way with everything in education though it should begin and right down in the first grade uh and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade so that the children develop good learning patterns and have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning uh and not wait until theyre in high school and then its too late to try to change them around at that point   right yeah   but uh everything should be started on the lower levels and uh certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that you know they they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant and uh but it but youre right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians   right   and perhaps its because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run uh that only the most wealthy can do so   right   and theyre not always the best person for the job but they have the money to be able to do it so uh so that there are a lot of problems along that line also and perhaps the government     definitely you know a good i idea for the young kids like that too is to have like a a mock one and okay this this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen and this candidate tells you some things okay then this percentage of the   sure right   voters i mean the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time but they have to do whatever these people whichever one the other people elect do if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them   uhhuh   okay now youre not going to get to vote but youre going to have to do what that person says they would understand probably by the time they were in high school theyd be ready to vote   yes right thats right and i think you know thats an excellent idea they for them to realize that that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didnt vote for it and that maybe maybe to think twice about voting now some people object during primaries having to declare a party   yeah right   whether Republican or Democrat and you do that in the primary uh and i dont know that uh a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason   uhhuh   uh they can declare anything they want and they can actually rig it if they really wanted to vote Republican they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat but uh its uh its just a sad situation and uh i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to uh teach the people uh uh everyone uh more about what is going on with voting and with non voting so that uh we can make some start making some more intelligent decisions and its going to take these young you know its going to take the uh   yeah i think that sounds great   a whole generation of my feeling uh before thats going to be accomplished thats right   well you know theyd have to start when theyre real young i mean you know it would have to be a child that is just coming in the school because i well ill tell you another thing too now whenever the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines now this sounds dumb but i did not know how to use those voting machines   uhhuh   and nobody ever showed us or anything so i didnt vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them they thought that was funny oh she dont even know how   yeah right uhhuh   so there wasnt any way i was going to go in there and vote and it took me i mean it took such courage you wouldnt believe to go vote the first time because i was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because i didnt know how to work the machines   and sure right well sure it is   now thats bad and i mean i was out of school i was a married person and um   uhhuh   i didnt know how to work the machine you know and it really scared me really bad because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i dont know how to work this machine where if theyd if theyd had a class or something or just a short   well just the just the opportunity to try the voting machines yeah   time you know that that okay this is the way right its this is the way its going to be and my son was exactly the same way that i was and i didnt realize it until uh his senior year i said asked him something about well did you who did you vote for for uh cheerleader and he said oh i didnt go vote he said uh theres no way im getting in that machine well then i realized it so when we went and voted the next time i asked the uh lady i said i want my son to come in with me and she said well uh why you know hell have to come back out i said because i want him to know how to use one of these and i said i wont turn any of the buttons down but i want to show him how to use it so that hell be able to vote   right yes uhhuh   and uh so he went in and now hes a registered voter but he would not vote before that   good yeah   and i mean i think thats bad you know here i was and and even of course theres a lot of years between the two of us but even with that many years between the   sure it is absolutely
