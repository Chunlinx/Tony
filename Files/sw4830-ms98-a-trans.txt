        you wanna go first     no you can start   okay um one of the things they talked about was uh did we did what do what do we think about a judge making the decision and i really dont agree with that   umhum   i think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than even having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible i dont think that they could be objective in every case every time   right   you you know what i mean   right theres there this this this topic is kind of moot um there theres no way we we couldnt survive in a system in a in a juror system in a trial system without a jury um   yeah right   one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case   thats it   um every person has their opinions and thats why jury selection is often very difficult um   well i i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system i i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean if if you go to a trial by jury       and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime theres uh no question its beyond a reasonable doubt   right   you all these things i mean you know weve gone through this uh over and over again   right they shouldnt allow an appeal   and it can go on for ten twenty years i i think this is a little ridiculous   yep umhum   i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers   no thats right i work for a law firm i ought i   i im serious and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that happen that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining   right   you know if someone is   well plea bargaining plea bargaining is a different story   well   plea bargaining is something completely different that that actually prevents trials or or at least speeds them up   well i know thats thats what im saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i dont know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh   right right   and that they have to do something but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it   hum   you you know what im saying that we we dont have um well a lot of states dont have capital punishment   right   and um   we do   i i think they should i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someones life and like you say its its theres no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and um you know all they theyre caught dead to rights i i just think that thats theyve theyve taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life   right right when youre saying as as far as the appeal um procedure is concerned we just have the case im im sure youve probably heard of Marion Berry   yeah uhhuh   um his final his last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up   oh really   so i mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail   it uh   for cocaine possession but um   yeah   that was absurd  there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence   i know that the uhhuh and i dont know uh what what would you do to change it to make it better   well uh the the only thing i can i was you know the the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of um i like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence thats absurd theres no way that could work   oh yeah i i i dont agree with that at all   um but   imagine the guilt that person would have i mean it burned out is theres no possible way that you could um you know feel good about yourself if you had to do something like that day after day   oh exactly exactly right no one would want the job   no really not really   um   and you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case   well would do you think people should have a trial if theyre caught dead to rights like   oh yeah i i feel that everyone is everyone is um entitled to a trial by jury that that that right should   i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you   well i mean were there witnesses   in other words youre saying that we you have to find out whether its premeditated or what the circumstances were   right right that you cant you cant remove the jury regardless of the case i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching  a murder take place and you youd still theres still mitigating circumstances   yeah yeah well its i i feel
