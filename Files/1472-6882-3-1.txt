                    Background        Injury of the spine and back are classified as the most        frequent cause of limited activity among people younger        than  years      Approximately  percent of the        adult population has neck pain at any one time     and         of the population will experience low back pain LBP        at some time in their lives     Five to  percent of        the workforce is off work annually because of LBP Indeed        LBP is second only to headache among the leading causes of        pain Approximately  of LBP is mechanical        nonorganic musculoskeletal dysfunction in origin            Patients with mechanical spinal pain often seek and receive        spinal manipulation by chiropractic osteopathic and        allopathic clinicians physical therapists or other health        care professionals            Health care professionals have utilized spinal palpatory        diagnostic procedures and manual manipulative treatment for        several millennia to treat back injury and pain             Along with the history of illness and physical exam        examiners utilize specific spinal palpatory diagnostic        tests in order to identify spinal neuromusculoskeletal        dysfunction Spinal neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction        refers to an alteration of spinal joint position motion        characteristics andor related palpable paraspinal soft        tissue changes The scientific committee of the        International Federation of Manual Medicine has stated        beneficial outcomes and effectiveness of spinal        manipulative procedures rely on appropriate and skilled        treatment that is based on an accurate diagnosis which in        turn depends upon the accuracy of the palpatory procedures        used             Spinal palpatory procedures have been described in        journals      and textbooks                   Static palpation of anatomical landmarks for        symmetry palpation of spinal vertebral joints before        during and after active and passive motion tests spinal        and paraspinal soft tissue palpatory assessment for        abnormalities or altered sensitivity are most common        Several narrative reviews of the literature on the        validity and reliability of spinal palpatory diagnostic        procedures have been published                   However most reviews are disciplinespecific despite the        fact that similar spinal palpatory procedures are used        across disciplines Only two systematic reviews of spinal        palpatory validity studies have been published             One study was a limited review of chiropractic literature        on palpatory diagnostic procedures for the lumbarpelvic        spine    and the other concentrates on validity studies        at the sacroiliac joint     An annotated bibliography           and a systematic review of the primary reliability        research studies published between  and  are in        progress        Validity and reliability are concepts that are often        used interchangeably but the concepts are quite different        Validity is the accuracy of a measurement of the true state        of a phenomenon     while reliability measures the        concordance consistency or repeatability of outcomes            However even if a measurement is consistent and        reliable it is not necessarily valid eg an arrow may        consistently hit the target area but never hit the        bullseye        There are various types of validity studies The concept        of validity differs in qualitative and quantitative        research     Though it can be argued that palpatory        diagnostic procedures are subjective and therefore        qualitative investigators in the field believe they can        measure a physiological phenomenon that can be detected by        objective means They maintain that studies addressing the        validity of spinal palpatory diagnostic tests are        quantitative studies The types of quantitative validity        studies can be distinguished as follows face validity        construct validity criterion validity and content        validity        Face validity is the extent to which a test         appears to measure what it is        supposed to measure In other words whether the proposed        test seems to provide a reasonable measure of the concept        it is intended to measure For example spinal vertebral        joint motion palpation tests which aim to detect the        presence of hypomobility have face validity because they        seem to be reasonable measures of the concept they are        intended to measure     Face validity studies have        been criticized for being subjective intuitive and        unsubstantiated Troyanovich and Harrison    pointed        out that in spite of the common perception or belief that        motion tests are valid and reliable for assessment of        presence or absence of restricted vertebral motion there        was no evidence to support this concept Thus palpatory        vertebral motion diagnostic tests are prime examples of        tests accepted on face validity        Construct validity is the extent to which a test        identifies the concept or trait of that which is being        measured A construct is a hypothetical or conceptual idea        that may be used to label or explain observed phenomenon            For example taking a dysfunctional vertebral joint        as the concept a test demonstrating the ability to        identify the presence or absence of that concept or its        related components is said to have construct validity        Feinstein describes construct validity as an appraisal of        the effectiveness with which a measure does its job in        describing an existing or established construct ie does        the measure behave the way one would predict on the basis        of the concept it represents For example Jull et al           compared cervical spinal static palpation to diagnostic        nerve blocks with anesthesia The construct is that        tenderness upon provocative palpation is related to local        nerve irritation and nerve conductivity A local anesthetic        nerve block of related spinal segments showed that the        identified tender spots no longer elicited a pain response        Thus they demonstrated that there is a high degree of        correlation between the palpatory test that identified a        tender spot and the ability of the anesthesia to reverse        the results of the provocative test Therefore the pain        provocative palpatory tests used were demonstrated to have        high construct validity        Construct validity however is an artificial framework        that is not directly observable     To establish        construct validity of a test or measure the researcher        must determine the extent to which the measure correlates        with other measures designed to measure the same thing and        whether the measure behaves as expected Construct validity        studies do not measure the same phenomena that palpatory        procedures are designed to measure ie resistance to        digital pressure or motion but similar phenomena that are        believed to be related to the palpable phenomena Many        construct validity studies on diagnostic spinal palpatory        tests compare a tests results to another measurement of        abnormal physiology in the same region Studies using        thermography     electromyography     and        coronary angiography    fall into this category        There are other examples of construct validity studies        using instruments to measure skin temperature electrical        skin resistance andor gross range of motion to discern a        dysfunctional vertebral segment These measurements are        then compared to those obtained by another examiner who        utilizes one or several palpatory procedures that assess        resistance to joint motion or paraspinal soft tissue        abnormalities to help to discern a dysfunctional vertebral        segment Or one examiner uses pain provocation and the        other palpatory motion restriction sense to assess for a        dysfunctional vertebral segment        Criterion validity measures the extent to which an        intervention allows a researcher to predict behavioral or        pathological outcomes Criterion validity studies        therefore do not measure the phenomenon being palpated        but attempt to correlate the findings of a palpatory        procedure eg with another measurable outcome like        diagnosed visceral disease For example Beal    and        Tarr    studied the ability of physicians using spinal        palpatory procedures to identify or predict which        patients had visceral disease related to the spinal        findings of altered structure motion andor soft        tissue        Content validity is the extent to which a measure        adequately and comprehensively measures what it claims to        be measuring Although Troyanovich and Harrison           consider face and content validity as synonymous there is        an important distinction content validity studies employ a        reference standard        A reference standard also called gold standard is a        measure accepted by consensus of content experts as the        best available for determining the presence or absence of a        particular phenomenon When there is no perfect reference        standard as in the case of measurement of a patients        sense of pain provocation ie pressing on a tender        point or trigger point then pragmatic criteria can be        used as a reference standard     The visual analog        pain scale has been used as a pragmatic reference standard        for palpatory pain provocation tests        Ideally content validity studies attempt to compare a        test with a reference standard of the same phenomenon as        that which is being palpated ie palpable abnormalities        in structure motion and soft tissue The Chiropractic        Mercy Center Consensus Conference held in January         identified and rated the value of various measurement        instruments related to spinal joint functional assessment        that could be used as reference standards     Based on        their critical review of the literature Troyanovich and        Harrison    suggested postural assessment instruments        and radiographic measurement as valid reliable and        clinically useful objective measurement tools to help        identify dysfunctional spinal vertebral joints        Based on this brief review it appears that construct        and criterion validity studies do not measure the        phenomenon being palpated Instead they attempt to        correlate the findings of a palpatory procedure with        another measurable outcome On the other hand content        validity studies measure the same phenomenon as that which        is being palpated Given how important it is to know        whether the diagnostic tests used in palpatory exams are        valid we conducted a systematic review to assess the        content validity of spinal palpatory tests used to identify        spinal neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction                    Methods                  Study setting          The study was conducted at the Susan Samueli Center          for Complementary and Alternative Medicine University of          CaliforniaIrvine UCI A multidisciplinary team of          clinicians researchers a statistician and a health          sciences librarian participated in the systematic review          The clinicians represented content area expertise in          osteopathic and chiropractic medicine family medicine          and clinical research In addition the researchers had          expertise and experience in evidencebased medicine          research design and methodology                          Inclusion  Exclusion Criteria          The study inclusion exclusion criteria were adapted          and modified from those published previously by the          Cochrane Collaboration    and others               Studies included in the review met the following four          criteria  the studies pertained to manual spinal          cervical thoracic lumbar and surrounding paraspinal          soft tissue but not the sacrum or pelvis palpation          procedures  the studies included measurement of          validity or accuracy of spinal palpation where validity          was defined as the capability of the manual spinal          palpation procedure to do what it is supposed to do and          accuracy was defined as a measure of how well it actually          does that content validity  the studies were          dissertations or a primary research studies published in          a peerreviewed journal  the document could be written          in any language  the primary research must have been          published

  the study question What is the content validity of          spinal palpatory tests used to identify spinal          neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction Specifics on the          search strategy are described in another paper              In brief our search strategy included both online and          manual searches for appropriate literature For the          online search of literature we defined a detailed search          template which we applied to appropriate databases The          basic search template included MeSH Descriptors from          MANTIS Biosis etc Medical Subject headings from          CINAHL and related key terms generated by the          investigators from the review team see Additional file           This defined the research question into four key

  research articles and conference proceedings if in          press dissertations and publications between January            and September   We applied the search          template with minor modifications to optimize and          enhance the search outcome of individual databases to           databases that had a potential coverage for the areas of          osteopathic medicine allopathic medicine chiropractic          and physical therapy The databases accessed by the          project included PubMed MEDLINE MANTIS CINAHL Web of          Science Current Contents BIOSIS EMBase OCLC          FirstSearch Cochrane Osteopathic Database and Index to          Chiropractic Literature The selection of databases was          based primarily on the availability of online resources          that we could access from our affiliated institution          libraries          In addition to the online literature search strategy          we used manual methods to identify appropriate          literature These manual methods included gleaning          references that were cited in studies selected from the          online search consulting experts in the fields of          chiropractic and osteopathic medicine contacting authors          of eligible conference abstracts and manually searching          bibliographies of osteopathic textbooks and review          articles on somatic dysfunction                          Review strategy          We used a threestep selection process to identify          articles for the systematic review First we reviewed          titles identified through the online search and excluded          those which gave no indication that the studies pertained          to validity Second we reviewed the abstracts of all the          remaining studies identified through the application of          our search template and excluded studies that did not          meet the inclusion criteria Third we reviewed the          complete paper and applied the inclusionexclusion          criteria to studies included at step two          In all based on the online and manual searches           studies were fully reviewed Five studies met the          inclusionexclusion criteria for the systematic review          The remaining  studies were excluded because they did          not study spinal palpation procedures did not assess          content

studies reviewed The          instruments were developed taking into consideration          previously published guidelines      and          instruments         To maximize objectivity          in the evaluation of paper quality a checklist of          quality factors was developed and transformed into a          quality assessment instrument The factors were grouped          into  major components of quality study subjects          examiner characteristics the reference standard used          palpatory test study conditions data analysis and          presentation of results see Table           Detailed information on the  components identified to          denote internal validity and quality of a study were          abstracted and scored In terms of the subject          characteristics we considered criteria such as their          sociodemographic description presentation          characteristics and severity of symptoms selection          criteria and sample size determination procedures sample          size and recruitment procedures Information regarding          the examiners pertained to their selection criteria          sample size and background The reference standard if          used and palpatory procedure information pertinent to          the quality scoring included a description of the tests          their reliability and expected outcomes and definition          of positive or negative test results The study          conditions were documented with regards to consensus on          and description of the palpatory procedure the training          of examiners in the procedure and blinding of examiners          and subjects For information on the data analysis and          results we abstracted information on the type of          statistical procedures used to assess validity and how          the results were displayed and described          The quality assessment instrument focused mainly on          the internal validity taking into consideration biases          reported previously namely selection performance          measurement and attrition bias A weight was assigned to          each criterion based on a group consensus A maximum          score of  points was set In designing this instrument          we differentiated between quality of an article ie          conduct of the trial and reproducibility and validity          which relates to the ability of the study to answer the          research question The data extraction and quality          assessment instruments were structured to mirror each          other and facilitate the review and scoring          Using the quality assessment instrument each article          was reviewed and scored on the seven major components          discussed above by twoblinded reviewers title names          of authors and journal were removed The quality          scores included an absolute score ie total points          received on all seven components of the quality          assessment form and a relative score ie absolute          score total score that could be obtained   The          relative score was especially important for studies          wherein certain aspects of the quality scoring components          were inapplicable ie the subjects criteria was          inapplicable for studies which used mechanical models or          measures An articles score absolute or relative          indicated its quality in terms of its internal validity          criteria whether conclusions drawn from study are likely          to be unbiased and the authors explicit description of          the study Although important the quality score does not          imply a studys significance or impact in terms of          findings relevance to the discipline Based on prior          recommendations the overall quality of studies was          assessed through the summary scores and the relevant          methodological issues pertinent toward internal validity          of a study were assessed individually and their influence          explored              A pilot test of the data extraction and quality          assessment instruments was conducted on four articles          randomly selected from the  studies evaluated during          step three of the study selection process After          completion of the pilot test we made changes to further          clarify and simplify the instruments For the final          review the articles were blinded to journal title and          author and randomly assigned to a pair of reviewers In          all six reviewers three pairs conducted the final          review abstracted pertinent data and scored each article          based on the quality assessment instrument          We used descriptive statistics on the quality          assessment data to determine agreementdisagreement among          a pair of reviewers and to present the data The          descriptive statistics included standard deviation SD           Mean ratio histogram and variability To achieve a          consensus between the pair of reviewers on the scoring of          each article we calculated the standard deviation SD          to mean score percentage Agreement on quality scores was          defined as less than  variance SDMean ratio in          the paired reviewers scores on each article When the          SDMean ratio variance between the paired reviewers          score was equal to or exceeded  the pair of          reviewers attempted to reach a consensus on each of the          criteria where disagreement existed When reviewers          failed to arrive at a consensus on the quality score two          content experts reviewed and scored the topic in          contention by consensus                            Results                  Study description          A total of five studies from the  articles          retrieved and reviewed met our inclusion criteria for

studies used digital pressure and          percussion to elicit pain Visual Analog Scale VAS and          pain reported by subjects were used as reference          standards Reliability of the palpation procedure was not          reported in any papers with the exception of              looking at motion palpation in a mechanical model                          Quality Scoring Findings          In general the quality score would indicate the rigor          with which the science was presented in the paper          Quality scores of included studies ranged from  to           out of a possible The overall quality of the included          studies was good for those focusing on motion palpation             and fair for those looking at pain             see Table  Discussion of examiners and study          conditions were the two major areas where weakness was          noted in the two pain studies but not in the motion          palpation studies Statistical tests used were adequate          for all studies this was one of the inclusion criteria          All studies were done in the s hence the time          factor was not felt to be contributive                          Study findings                      Motion Palpation Tests            The three studies examining motion palpation were            similar in using a mechanical model as the reference            standard and focusing on the lumbar spine only While            two studies used similar examiner groups and motion            test the third study    looked only at one group            of examiners using two different motion test            procedures            Two studies     looked at intersegmental            motion restriction using sagital and coronal motion as            determined by two groups of chiropractic examiners with            different experience levels senior students and            practitioners Both studies presented data on            sensitivity ability of a test to detect correctly            restricted motion segments and specificity ability of            a test to detect correctly unrestricted motion            segments The sensitivity for both groups in each            study varied between  and  and the            specificity from  to  indicating less            ability to detect restricted motion segments than            unrestricted motion segments The sensitivity for            practitioners in both studies was poor  and             For students the sensitivity was lower in the            Harvey study  than the Jensen study             Based on the data provided in each of the studies we            calculated the positive and negative predictive PPV            NPV values and the likelihood ratio LR for each            group The PPV was less than  in both studies for            both groups  and for each subgroup While            the NPV was greater than   supporting the            above statement of better capability of these tests at            detecting unrestricted than restricted motion Table                        The third motion palpation study    looked at            intersegmental motion restriction as determined by            lateral flexion and posterioranterior springing PAS            Examiners were  senior chiropractic students            Sensitivity for lateral flexion was  and for PAS             while specificity for lateral flexion was             and PAS was  indicating that the motion palpation            procedures utilized were neither sensitive nor specific            for detecting spinal segmental motion restriction The            calculated PPV   and NPV  for both            tests supported this conclusion                                Pain Provocation            The two studies differed in procedure location            cervical vs thoracic  lumbar reference            standard VAS vs subjective patient report            provocation test used and population studied            The cervical study    assessed presence or            absence of pain as reported by the subjects upon            palpation of their facet joints Sensitivity ability            of the test to identify presence of pain in subjects            reporting pain symptoms was  and specificity            ability of the test to identify the absence of pain in            asymptomatic subjects was  the PPV was  and NPV            was  The results indicate that the test procedure            as performed is moderately good at identifying            subjects with neck pain and very good at identifying            asymptomatic subjects            The thoracic and lumbar spine study    used the            VAS as the reference standard and assessed the            relationship between the clinical back status and            reported pain locations during and after pregnancy Two            types of pain provocation tests were used digital            pressure within  cm of the midline and lumbar            percussion In the thoracic region digital pressure            DP sensitivity was  specificity was             calculated PPV was  and NPV was  In the            lumbar region DP sensitivity was  specificity            was  calculated PPV was  and NPV was             lumbar percussion sensitivity was             specificity was  calculated PPV was  and NPV            was  see Table  These results suggest that the            thoracic DP test was better at identifying asymptomatic            than symptomatic subjects Both tests performed in the            lumbar region were unable to discriminate adequately            between subjects                                      Discussion        To the best of our knowledge this is the first        comprehensive systematic review of literature on the        content validity of spinal palpatory procedures To        reiterate it is imperative to focus on studies assessing        content validity of procedures since by definition they        attempt to measure the same phenomenon as that which is        being palpated Studies with a focus on other forms of        validity ie face construct and criterion although        important provide information which does not directly        answer the question Does the procedure ie palpation        measure or assess the phenomenon it is supposed to        assess but attempt to correlate the findings of a        palpatory procedure with another measurable outcome        The systematic review revealed several methodological        reporting and research issues which severely constrained        integrative qualitative and quantitative evaluations such        as systematic reviews and metaanalysis The evaluation of        the validity of spinal palpatory procedures has a number of        methodological challenges In particular there is no        agreed upon reference or gold standard measuring device        for spinal palpatory procedures A reference standard is        the best available independently established testprocedure        used to determine the presence or absence of a phenomenon        In the absence of wellestablished reference standards one        would use other research designs such as pragmatic        criteria eg pain scales independent expert panels        clinical followup delayed type cross sectional study        standardized protocols or prognostic criteria     One        may also use the most reproducible and reliable test or the        most experienced examiner as a reference standard Some        designs utilize invasive procedures eg surgery        histopathology or angiography or a combination of tests to        serve as a reference standard        It is important to identify a reference standard to        which a palpatory diagnostic test is compared to ensure        that it actually measures what it purports to measure        ie that a test for resistance to motion actually        measures resistance to motion Spinal palpatory diagnostic        procedures like vertebral joint motion restriction        assessment are difficult to objectively measure in humans        The concept of a neuromusculoskeletal spinal dysfunction        that is corrected by noninvasive manual spinal        manipulation has no agreed upon reference standard        Typically a conglomerate of findings of altered position        motion characteristics and paraspinal soft tissue feel is        necessary to make the diagnosis Xrays can be validated by        altered position Altered motion has been difficult to        validate due to the difficulty of finding a suitable        reference standard However in order to assess an        examiners ability to discern resistance to vertebral joint        motion the plastic spinal model with an artificially fixed        vertebral segment has been employed as a reference        standard Altered tissue feel can be validated in part by        measuring skin moisture temperature friction and        resistance to pressure A reference standard used for        palpatory pain provocation tests has been the visual analog        or numeric pain scale              Given that face construct and criterion validity        studies do not measure the phenomenon being palpated but        attempt to correlate the findings of a palpatory procedure        with another measurable outcome only content validity        studies which attempt to measure the same phenomenon as        that which is being palpated were included in this        systematic review        Physicians orthopedists physiatrists neurologists        emergency medicine family medicine sports medicine        etc chiropractors massage therapists osteopaths and        physical therapists use manual palpatory exams regularly in        their practice However very few studies  have        attempted to assess the content validity as defined in        this paper of these widely used tests Among the few        validity studies identified motion palpation tests were        evaluated only by chiropractors and pain studies by        physical therapists        In this review  studies focused on three types of        tests fixation  range of motion  and pain         The quality scores of motion palpation studies were good        however all the tests had poor sensitivity This indicates        that the motion palpatory tests intersegmental lateral        flexion and posterioranterior springing are not able to        identify areas of fixation or motion restriction A poor        positive predictive Value PPV supported this finding The        pain provocation studies reported good validity for        evaluation of pain in the cervical region but not in the        lumbar area This result confirms the results of a        previously published    study indicating a higher        sensitivity for identifying pain in the cervical region        compared to the lumbar spine        Unfortunately most of the research study results        reported are not comparable due to variability in the        palpatory tests terminology research design methodology        and statistical analysis utilized These inconsistencies        make it difficult to rate the relative value of their        results There is a worldwide concerted effort underway to        rectify this problem The International Federation of        Manual Medicine FIMM an international organization of        physicians and surgeons who practice manual medicine held        their General Assembly in Chicago in July  At that        meeting their Scientific Committee reported that their top        priority is to promote validity reliability sensitivity        and specificity studies of spinal palpatory diagnostic        procedures They recently developed guidelines Protocol        Formats on how to perform high quality validity and        reliability studies of spinal palpatory procedures which        are available on their web site     They recommend the        use of valid palpatory tests so that homogeneous        populations with spinal musculoskeletal dysfunction can be        selected and treated as part of a controlled clinical        trial The results of these trials can subsequently be        combined using metaanalysis and would help formulate        guidelines for the practice of spinal manipulation        It is difficult to translate these results into the        clinical setting due to the limited number of studies        focused anatomical sites and populations studied Also        argument could be advanced that the use of a mechanical        model may not have external validity when applied to human        subjects All threemotion palpation studies used a        mechanical model as the subjects and reference standard        and focused on the lumbar spine Findings indicate poor        validity of the motion palpation tests The  pain studies        are of fair to poor quality One focused on examining pain        in the lumbar spine of pregnant women and the other on        pain in the cervical spine among men with acute        injuries        To translate these results into the clinical setting        additional studies exploring the content validity of spinal        palpatory exams using accepted reference standards are        needed Identifying a perfect error free reference        standard for each palpatory test is challenging Even        widely accepted reference standards are imperfect eg        histopathology     Therefore identifying a perfect        reference standard is not as important as identifying an        acceptable reference standard Content experts in this        field should come to an agreement on acceptable reference        standards for spinal palpatory tests        This review is unique a by the cooperative work among a        multidisciplinary team of researchers and contentexperts        b the review was not limited to any specific discipline or        language c the focus on content validity is practical and        clinically relevant to practitioners and researchers d a        great effort and detail went into the development of the        search strategy inclusionexclusion criteria and        qualityscoring instrument        The search strategy included  databases and was done        three times using general and specific keywords and        strategies to verify results The qualityscoring        instrument was developed taking into consideration        strengths and weakness of published instruments        recommendations by the QUOROM    and CONSORT            statements as well as the Cochrane criteria In addition        this study makes a contribution to the field of        manipulation and medicine in general by highlighting the        limited research and reference standards in this field It        also provides future researchers with a guideline to follow        to design a successful content validity study        As with a majority of reviews this is a retrospective        review which makes it susceptible to potential sources of        bias publication quality The focused definition used for        content validity limits the studies that are included in        this review However this strategy allowed more clarity        since only content validity studies were included in this        systematic review Despite the number of safeguards used to        be inclusive multiple databases hand search review by        experts and multiple searches in our search a few        studies published but not included in these databases could        have been missed        The quality assessment tool used for this review was        developed by this team of researchers based on their        evaluation of the literature feedback from methodologists        and statisticians Although we feel that the instrument is        well balanced and unbiased it might have over or        underestimated the quality of certain papers When        comparing the quality scores assigned to studies included        in this paper to scores assigned to the same papers in        another systematic review     one notes that our        scores are consistently lower                    Conclusion        Despite the use of manual spinal palpation by many        health care disciplines very few studies investigated        their ability to measure what they intend to measure        content validity Given the high frequency of spinal        pathology and the use of these diagnostic methods to        investigate them welldesigned studies are needed For the        practice of evidencebased medicine it is important to        assess the efficacy and effectiveness of procedures usually        and customarily used in clinical practice To this end        established benchmarks for the validity and reliability of        procedures are essential        This comprehensive systematic review has highlighted        serious gaps in our knowledge about the accuracy of spinal        palpatory procedures The findings have implications for        research clinical practice and policy From the research        perspective researchers across discipline need to        incorporate more rigor towards the definition of the study        questions methods and measures implementation procedures        and reporting The absence of well identified reference        standards and possible technical difficulties conducting        these studies might have contributed to this scarcity        From the clinical perspective the findings suggest poor        sensitivity of the range of motion and pain diagnostic        tests in the evaluation of spinal dysfunction From a        policy perspective given that manual procedures are a        cornerstone towards diagnostic and therapeutic        interventions across disciplines professional societies        and associations need to enact continuing medical education        and research guidelines to address the efficacy of spinal        palpatory procedures                    Competing interests
