blacks because they argued whitesupremacy could never be displaced Marcus                Garvey andFather                Divine led the movement in the s Separatism fades inand out of media attention Separatists of the s and s received littlenotice            Still segregationists and integrationists havealways coexisted within the civilrights movement In the mids whenthe integrationist ideal reached its peak the blackpower wing of thecivilrights movement grew by advocating black selfdeterminationtheestablishment of exclusively black schools and a selfsustaining black economyMore radical elements called for a black nation in the American SouthEven ultraintegrationist Martin Luther King Jr cast the civilrights movementas an anticolonial liberation struggle late in his career Also some blackleaders in the s sought control over their local public schools whichprefigures the current enthusiasm many AfricanAmericans have for running theirown charter schools within the publicschool system            Recentmarkers of black separatism include the Louis Farrakhansponsored MillionMan March of  to which only AfricanAmerican men were invited thedebate over the teaching in public schools of Ebonics  the socalledAfricanAmerican dialect the establishment of exclusively AfricanAmericandorms on college campuses and singlerace schools  which are evensupported by Supreme Court

neutralitythe American legal system is riddled with mechanisms for oppressing blackpeople Some critical race theorists argue that black jurors should acquitguilty black defendants in protest of the unjust system                           What accounts for separatisms currentvogue Some attribute the new separatism to black demagogues in politicsand the academy who deliberately exploit black anxieties to further theircareers Black conservative Shelby Steele argues that AfricanAmericansembrace separatism to cover for their embarrassing lack of skills Steele alsosays that separatism appeals to unqualified students admitted to college underthe protection of affirmative action These students compensate for theirshortcomings by clinging to one another and striking the defensive pose ofseparatism            Anotherexplanation holds that integration is out of favor because the DemocraticParty has retreated from the goal In hopes of attracting more white votesthe Democratic Party has distanced itself from civilrights leaders like JesseJackson and from issues like welfare reform and affirmative action Cut offfrom the political mainstream some civilrights leaders and grassrootssupporters have embraced separatist politicians and positions            In the past the most obstinate white opponents ofintegration the Goldwater wing of the Republican Party andconservative Southern Democrats  argued that people should have theright to associateor not to associatewith whomever they wish Goldwaterlater recanted this view and even the most conservative
