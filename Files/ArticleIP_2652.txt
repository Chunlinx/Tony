                                 The New Japanese Mythology            Upandcoming challenger toundisputed champion to complete basket case in the span of two decades Thesaga of the Japanese economy looks more and more like a lates boxingmelodramathough one imagines that if this were Hollywood the producers woulddemand that Japan ultimately get up off the canvas and retake the titleWheres John Garfield when we need him            Whilethat narrative may be accurate enough in broad outline on the level of actualcompanies it tells the wrong story The current stock markets infatuation withall things Internet has led to indefensible overestimation of the actualstrength of most Net companies So too has the prevailing picture of Japan as asclerotic economy of tightfisted oversavers and corrupt politicians led to adramatic underestimation of the crucial role the best Japanese companiesstill play in the global economy            Theres no denying the shortterm macroeconomic picture forJapan is dismal though its hard to resist the thought that if the Bank ofJapan just ran its printing presses and dumped piles of yen out onto thestreet things would be OK But its probably true that the Japanese who pickedup the yen would immediately bank it instead of buying a brandnew suit orpower mower as any patriotic American would As a result until thelongpromised overhaul of Japans financial sector is complete and its web ofsubsidies and regulations is simplified its hard to see the country gettingthe dose of creative destruction it sorely needs The impact of domesticstagnation on large Japanese companies has of course been dramatic In theauto industry for instance sales have declined to nearly half their peak The same is also true albeit to a lesser extent of theconsumerelectronics market            Japanese corporations havealso been hit much harder than their US counterparts by the crisis in AsiaWhile much of US business relies on Asia for sales growth in the future mostimportant Japanese corporations have been relying on it for growth in thepresent Japanese companies own more than  percent of the Asian car marketexcluding Korea and are dominant players in most other industrial categoriesAs a result when Thais and Malaysians are forced to slash purchases of newcars or investment in earthmoving equipment Japan feels it long before theUnited States does            Add tothis the fact that for most of this decade the cost of capital in Japanactually went up as bank lending was cut back stock prices declined andJapan began to dismantle its elaborate system of crossinstitutionalshareholding In real terms that means it has cost Japanese companies more todo businessto expand plants develop new products and market Even withnearnegative interest rates the cost of capital in Japan is now much closerto what it is in the United States and Europe            Nonetheless the best Japanese corporationsstill occupy places in the global economy remarkably similar to those they heldin the s Toyota for instance continues to be the pacesetter in the worldauto industry and most other Japanese car makers and parts producers arethriving as

movies andmusic that play on them Given the track record of most diversificationexperiments Sony should have a do not try this at home label attached butits adaptability and innovation belie the traditional critique of Japanesecorporations as hidebound and conformist The same might also be said ofNintendos rise from the dead and of Canons emergence as a key player inwhats now called the imaging market thanks primarily to its aggressiveintroduction of new technology and its relatively unusual alliances with UScompanies            The fact that successful Japanese corporations have notrolled over and died with the rest of the countrys economy is hardly arevelation After all these companies were able to export cars and televisionsto the United States even when the yen was trading at  to a dollar Now thatthe dollar is worth half again as much and Japanese goods are correspondinglycheaper in US markets business is that much easier Still the companies aresuffering guilt by association with the generally failing Japanese economy justas the Net stocks are prospering for precisely the opposite reason            Animportant consequence of this dismissal of Japanese business is the dramaticrevision of our understanding of what has happened to UScorporationsespecially manufacturingin the past decade and a half In thes American businessmen were beseeched to adopt the art of Japanesemanagement to pay more attention to quality and market share to pushauthority down to the factory floor Of late that whole phenomenon has beenthe subject of considerable mockery along the lines of Remember when wethought we should emulate Japan How foolish we were Dramatic improvements inUS manufacturing productivity as opposed to simply corporate profits areattributed to greater emphasis on shareholder value and improved costconsciousness not to the impact of Japan            Whats ironic about this revisionism is thatits easy to dismiss the s vogue for Japanese strategy and techniques onlybecause so many of those techniques have become part of the fabric of everydaylife at many perhaps most US industrial companies The cords that assemblyline workers can pull to stop the line are now ubiquitous as are Japanesequality control standards Continuous improvement which compels workers tolook for ways to make their jobs more efficient is de rigueur atcompanies ranging from Polaroid to GM And justintime production is notsimply the goal to which all manufacturing companies now aspire It has alsospawned an entire new business model exemplified by Dell Computer that isreshaping the entire personalcomputer industry Much that was said aboutJapanese management style in the swith its supposed Zen focus and greatersense of process than outcomewas pure buncombe But the value of Japanesemanufacturing practices was if anything understated            Insofar as the best Japanesecorporations are not the global hegemons we once thought they would be it maybe because everyone else has learned from them which is of course exactly howcompetitive markets are supposed to work In this moment of Americantriumphalism its hard to resist the temptation to rewrite recent history asthe narrative of Americas selfreliant inevitable rise and to see the futureas the story of Americas continued ascent into the higher reaches of the NewEconomy Recognizing that Japanese business is not down for the countandremembering the role it played in getting us to where we areis a necessarystep toward a saner appraisal of where this economy might be going
