        okay uh you want to start by telling me what camping is to you do you backpack or hike or   well uh a little bit uh nothing nothing overly strenuous no the majority of my camping experience is uh a tent by the lake type situation or uh maybe a canoe trip or something like that   no ive never done a canoe trip that sounds interesting   oh it its weve had a lot of fun uh i i moved to Dallas about five years ago and weve made three different trips since ive been here the group of friends that i run around with of varying degrees uh of difficulty the the last one we did and we havent had a chance to duplicate was uh was a canoe trip in Arkansas and the river was it was up about three feet so it was uh it was pretty it was pretty challenging   i imagine   but uh and then we uh as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and uh find uh find a clearing in the woods and go for it   so theyll actually fit in the canoe and then you go for days at a time   well yeah yeah its the that that particular one was a two day trip so what uh uh theres uh theres a outfitter and uh they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you get to you spend the night and then uh the second day head on down to the to the pool at the end of the river   God that sounds like fun   yeah it it really is   well the camping i grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type and uh you know that just either out in the woods or actually i i grew up water skiing i was uh from California and so we would go up to the Sacramento uh river sloughs the delta there   okay okay   and you just pick a campground on the river if it got you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water   right right   you know cooled off but uh when i got married my husband had always backpacked and so we did that uh   okay   i guess that we havent done it since my kids were born so about three years ago and that was a new experience to me but i enjoyed it i like being able to go back up into the mountains or you know where the trail didnt necessarily lead and where you couldnt necessarily pitch a tent   boy i bet yeah uhhuh   but uh that that was interesting i i have always wanted to do some white water rafting and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that   yeah thats that was uh thats always been our next step our our our little group of friends here weve weve been kind of getting married off and what not but uh thats   dont let that stop you   yeah that well it it it just puts a damper on things for a little while but were were starting to get everybody back together yeah wed like to do a float trip down uh oh like Big Bend area or something like that   i know yeah so you havent done that before   no no we havent made that trip yet   my parents uh were sailing uh this last year down off uh Costa Rica and they took about two weeks and went into i dont even know the name of the river there but they went white water rafting and Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience she said it was truly incredible   ill bet yeah   and you know i theres that sense of it you know youre kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it   uhhuh yeah exactly   so well do you have anything planned for this summer   um not really just yet weve uh well i i do have uh a little bit of property i grew up in South Dakota   oh okay   and ive got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet theres uh theres a little lake up there and uh a group of friends that i i went to college with um got together and we basically own all the land around this little lake there its divided up into ten lots   oh   so weve got a private lake and its completely undeveloped at this point so thats a possibility and the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime it its its about two hours north of Minneapolis   i imagine oh that doesnt that sounds good   so uh yeah in fact uh uh well i got married last summer and uh thats thats we ended up there for a couple days uh on our honeymoon we kind of took uh a tour of the United States for about a week   that sounds   and uh up through that area but uh my wifes real excited about it so were uh were going to hope to get up there sometime early enough last year it was the end of July and it was a little too late for the fish but uh hopefully get up there early enough to to get into some of the some of the fish and uh the the good weather and what not   weve been wanting to start camping again this year too uh my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half and then i have a little one that just turned two and we are in the process of potty training i didnt want to go camping with diapers   uhhuh oh gosh yeah yeah   you know i and and you know at a time when theyre afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent theyd be awake all night   thats right   so but i think with him almost potty trained and you know shes not afraid of her shadow anymore that im im hoping and crossing my fingers that well be able to go uh this summer you know even if its like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started uh   sure   with little back packs of their own and you know things like that   right you bet yeah well that you know  and theres a lot of places with uh like nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too   thats just uhhuh well thats true   you know its like okay this this is  this is what uh a pheasant looks like you know and okay now well go look for one and that kind of thing that   ugh i would need that before i could teach them   well  yeah thats everybody everybody might learn something that way but uh but yeah thats there isnt theres an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do like like you say it can be uh a water ski trip or uh fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt hunt with a camera type of thing or theres a lot of different opportunities for things like that its a lot of fun it really is hello
