                okay well i how how how do you feel about that   i think its great um i think like socialized medicine um i think its a very good idea personally because right now i dont have any health insurance at all   umhum   and i just know that its first you know i could get it where i work and but it would be like a hundred dollars a month which is a lot to me and i really just cant afford it uh i have worked places where i had insurance but you know on a more i work for a very small company now and i i realize that you know it would for that to be true youd youd have to increase taxes and stuff like that but uh i know other people that are you know in the same situation and when its just uh i if you dont work for a large company its really hard to have insurance um i would be willing to you know pay more taxes but uh and i i think its just i think everybody should have the option to have health care i mean i dont think you know but the only way to do that would be to you know have to tax more   yeah there there wouldnt have to be some way to pay for it the the i agree with you that that uh its no fun to to not have insurance im ive had health insurance through my uh either my parents uh employment or my employment for many years but uh now im looking as at a layoff situation and im sitting here saying well how much is it going to cost me   umhum   the uh the prospect of going without health insurance is is uh not very exciting to me either   umhum   uh the the problem that i have with with uh universal health insurance is the problem of basically just absolute and complete distrust for the politicians theyll start i mean they could they could say were going to do it the right way in the beginning and convince me   umhum   but i dont have a lot of faith that they would uh that they would not use it as a as a uh oh as a carrot to get votes uh my i called and asked uh the uh unemployment insurance people here i said how long you know whats the unemployed what do i get if im unemployed and how long will i get it you know its very interesting the guy on the other end is a young man he said uh uh with a good sense of humor he says well he says right now its twenty six weeks uh in periods of severe unemployment and just before an election they will extend it and get all the votes of the people that that like that but he says in your case uh if youre going uh to be needing it in a little while by the time you get to the end of your twenty six weeks uh the elections will be over and we wont have it anymore i can tell you that   umhum   so i so im uh uh im im uh for the first time im im seeing things to a uh im paying attention to things that i never paid before uh attention attention attention to   right yeah you dont really think about it until you youre in a situation where you have to think about it   on the other hand like i say they i have i have lived in places where they had uh free medical care and i have to say that that uh that it that it was uh it was comforting to know that you had it but but the way it worked in practice was that uh in order to get enough doctors the uh they used a lot of student doctors a lot more than people would put up with over here   umhum   and uh my wife has dozens and dozens of stories of people that went in for a simple operation and then died on the table because of the incompetent care   um   so im and and she didnt have any axe to grind you know she just grew up in that situation and said well thats the way it is and uh so on the one hand i im im saying well now i know how people that dont have insurance feel and on the other hand im saying uh i dont trust the politicians very much i think that they are very good at at uh   huh   i think theyre so corrupt that they just use it as a vote getting       uh situation and they dont pay and and they dont make it a very uh theres not a lot of integrity to the things that they do   well by the um the same note of what youre saying there could be pros in that situation um for their being
