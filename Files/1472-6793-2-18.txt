                    Background        Synchronization between heartbeat and respiration has        been intensively studied during the last century As early        as the s Hildebrandt and coworkers     investigated        the phase coordination between both oscillators in man        They used an apparatus named coincidence analyzer which        was able to determine the absolute time delay of the onset        of inspiration precisely after the preceding R wave  see        Footnote   and which calculated the coupling rate on        the basis of the distribution of the detected time lags        The authors concluded that the coupling rate is a        prominent marker of physiological relaxation and        regeneration after work load     In recent years        cardiorespiratory coordination has again been brought into        the focus of research                           The popularity has been mainly caused by the rise        of nonlinear system or chaos theory and by the rapid        progress of computerized physics and mathematics        Surprisingly the majority of analytical methods used are        still very similar to the early methods even though modern        physical models have been applied to explain how complex        systems might interact and how such interaction manifests        itself in recorded data The methods are based on the        evaluation of synchrograms        or post event        time series    and differ only in the definition of the        respiratory or cardiac phase or in the statistical        quantification of the strength of synchronization Common        goal of these studies was to demonstrate that phase        differences between cardiac and respiratory cycle remain        constant over a specific time period or that certain phase        combinations or time lags are significantly more frequent        than others In this way many different types of        shortterm synchronization between heartbeat and        respiration could be shown in individual subjects under        experimental resting conditions                          Common to all techniques which are applied in the above        cited literature to analyze synchronization is that they        rely on simultaneous measurements of the electrocardiogram        ECG and respiratory flow This method has its pros and        cons On the one hand the combined registration guarantees        reliable information on both oscillators and enables a high        resolution of their phase relations in time On the other        hand longterm respiratory flow measurements are not easy        to perform particularly without affecting respiration        itself or even destroying the weak coupling between        heartbeat and respiration Therefore we focused on        respiratory sinus arrhythmia RSA in order to derive        statistical information on cardiorespiratory coordination        without respiratory flow measurements  see Footnote  In        earlier studies we could show that the statistical        evaluation of the musical rhythmicity of heart rate        HRR ie the predominance and cyclicity of socalled        phase locking pattern classes in binary differential heart        rate dynamics binary RR differences has certain        advantages over other linear or nonlinear heart rate        variability analytic tools        Evidence was        given that HRR reflects mainly the degree of        cardiorespiratory coordination and also enables the        determination of the weighted phase coordination ratio        PCR that corresponds to the frequency ratio of heartbeat        and respiration during intermittent periods of apparent        cardiorespiratory coordination However a conclusive and        detailed proof of this relationship on the basis of real        respiratory data is still lacking and was addressed in the        present study The main question therefore was How does        the univariate binary RSA pattern analysis Method         correspond to the bivariate analysis of phase relations        between the cardiac and the respiratory cycle Method                            Results                  Method  vs Method           Only one nighttime recording is used to demonstrate          visually and exemplarily the various interrelations          between cardiorespiratory phase recurrence PR and          binary pattern predominance PP Subject b reveals          many of the features best although the overall          correlation between the grayscale maps is not optimal          see parameter           r            in Table  In Fig both          grayscale maps demonstrate visually high conformity but          going in detail differences can be observed in the          lower diagram the overall bit pattern recurrency is          slightly higher than the recurrency of all other          patterns whereas in the upper diagram the phase          recurrency indicates a pronounced  phase coordination          shortly after falling asleep sleeping time             Moreover the correlation coefficients demonstrate          a high concordance of the grayscale maps with respect to          PCR            and PCR                       r              but not with respect to PR          and PP            r              ie PCR            could be reliably reproduced by PCR            mean PCR              mean PCR              mean PCR             PCR              but the strength of          coordination PR was not likewise reproducible by PP          see also Fig  However in other subjects the PRPP          correlation see linear correlation coefficient           r            in Table  is much better                          Sleep architecture and HRV          Apart from the obvious but very subtle relationship          between phase and pattern recurrence another trait is          common to most recordings a remarkable PP oscillation          with an intraindividually constant period between  and           hours The oscillation can also be observed for PR but          in many subjects it is much more prominent for the          pattern predominance data see eg Fig  As this          oscillation most probably corresponds to the subjects          sleep stage rhythmicity a close relationship also to          certain HRV parameters was expected see discussion          Particularly HF LF and BAL are supposed to be highly          dependent on sleep stages         and might          therefore help to identify the source of the PP          oscillations As can be seen in Fig  BAL is indeed          markedly correlated with PP            r              which is also reflected by          the inverse time courses of PP and BAL in Fig           Surprisingly this close relationship is not a matter of          course Fig shows exemplarily the time courses from          subject b which also discloses a pronounced periodic          oscillation of PP between  and  with obvious          REM sleep minima but reveals definitely no sleep          architecture for BAL                          Verification of synchronization          The lower diagram of Fig displays the grayscale map          of the phase recurrency in the shuffled surrogate data of          subject b The course of both type and strength of the          phase recurrency is very similar to the original data          see upper diagram in Fig  though slight differences          can be observed Whereas the   coordination seems          in no way to be dependent on the order of the RR series          and therefore probably does not result from a          beattobeat synchronization with respiration the           phase recurrency decreases markedly in surrogate data          Thus it is more likely that the latter is caused by real          phase couplings due to physiological interactions These          findings are confirmed by the parameter            q  The bivariate variation of both          signals which is per se the same in the original and the          surrogate data decreases noticeably during           coordination but only slightly during  coordination          Moreover the course of            q reveals minima which are not          accompanied by high phase recurrency This shows that low          bivariate signal variability does not automatically lead          to spurious phase coordination since for the latter the          average frequency ratio must also be close to           m                           Dependence on age          There is a remarkable decrease of mean PP with age          see upper diagram of Fig  and also a notable          dependence on age of the interrelations between          cardiorespiratory phase recurrence and binary pattern          recurrence see Table  Particularly the correlation          between the two grayscale maps decreases with age see          lower diagram of Fig                             Discussion        The first step towards a practical comparison of both        methods was to describe cardiorespiratory coordination on a        beattobeat basis Phase coordination was assessed by        determining the respiratory phases of R waves which follow        a reference beat The phase was defined as linear function        of time between two onsets of inspiration This is easier        to calculate and yields similar phases when compared to the        calculation of the phases via Hilbert transformation            Intermittent phase coordination was then defined as phase        recurrence with accuracy  after         m heartbeats over a period of at        least         k heartbeats following the reference        beat In the context of this work Method  is        straightforward and not based on any physical model of        coupled systems It is merely descriptive while also        allowing a confirmative statistical detection of epochs        with deterministic synchronization when compared with        appropriate surrogate data        Whereas Method  is still very close to the        synchrogrambased approaches     Method  is completely        different and strictly based on the univariate analysis of        the RR interval series It has been adopted from earlier        studies       and only slight modifications were        made in order to ensure comparability with Method  Only        recently Galletly  Larson      described a        technique to determine cardiorespiratory coupling during        anaesthesia which is like our method based on HRV pattern        repetition The specific pattern of heart rate        acceleration and deceleration which occurs with breathing        is determined by the pattern of vagal modulation and the        positioning of heart beats within the ventilatory phases         Because the coupling interval that between the        initiating cardiac trigger and inspiratory onset is fixed        for a cardiac triggered breath at approximately  s        heart beats tend to fall in fixed relationship with the        waxing an waning pattern of vagal tone     However        their quantitative approach to pattern repetition is a mix        of linear and nonlinear analytic tools and is based on a        pure triggering model It does not consider nonlinear phase        couplings Moreover the methods were only applied under        anaesthesia which is not comparable with cardiorespiratory        regulation under normal resting conditions Janson et al           also recently derived information on cardiorespiratory        coordination solely from RR interval series which were        called return times in terms of nonlinear dynamics From        the maps of return times better known as scatter plots        the authors calculated phase angles of vectors RR                   i          RR                 i   with respect to the        center of mass within a specific time window a similar        method is used also in     The phase angles were then        compared with the phases of the R peak within the        respiratory cycle In case of detectable RSA both phases        increase synchronously and result in very similar        synchrograms At first glance this method seems to be more        accurate than the binary pattern analysis but its        practicability remains to be proven Recently Ashkenazy        and Kantelhardt and coworkers     investigated binary        coded variations of heart rate which were called sign        series of heart rate increments by means of detrended        fluctuation analysis DFA This method revealed high        anticorrelations in the range between  and  heartbeats        which were associated with linear dynamical properties by        means of surrogate data analysis But in their physical        papers the authors do not refer to RSA or even to        cardiorespiratory coordination which would obviously        explain this kind of linear sign series regularity        In our study the comparison of phase and binary pattern        recurrence demonstrated high similarity between the        frequency statistics of both methods Particularly the        weighted phase coordination ratio could be reliably        reproduced by the pattern analysis but also the phase        recurrency PR ie the frequency of intermittent        coordination is mirrored by the binary pattern        predominance PP In a group of  healthy subjects the        strong relationship between both methods could be        confirmed particularly for subjects younger than  years        The age dependence may be explained by the fact that that        RSA decreases with age which inevitably leads to smaller        detection rates of coordinated sequences by binary RSA        pattern analysis see upper diagram of Fig         Apart from the physiological correspondence with        cardiorespiratory coordination the binary HRV pattern        technique also points to a strong relationship between        sleep stages and cardiovascular regulation which is not        revealed as clearly by classical HRV parameters In most        subjects a large PP oscillation could be observed during        the night which was present even when all other HRV        parameters failed to unveil any periodicity two data        examples are presented in this article In some cases PP        was also highly correlated with the parameter BAL which is        believed to be a very good HRV marker of REM sleep               This suggests that PP oscillations with periods        between  and  hours correspond to the periodic succession        of sleep stages On the other hand as encephalographic        registrations of sleep stages were not made in this study        such a conclusion can only be tentative However our        findings are in accordance with the early results of        Raschke and coworkers who already comprehensively discussed        the dependencies between cardiorespiratory coordination and        sleep The authors emphasized that coupling is intensified        during relaxation and that the coupling rate changes        systematically with sleep stages                Moreover in the above cited paper of Kantelhardt et al            anticorrelations in heart rate increment sign series        were also seen to be closely linked with sleep stages        shortrange anticorrelations  are strong during deep        sleep weaker during light sleep and even weaker during        REM sleep And these results are absolutely identical with        our findings though as already said RSA and        cardiorespiratory coordination was not a focus of their        article This is a bit surprising as in an earlier paper        by the same group     the correspondence between        sleepstagedependent cardiorespiratory modulation RSA        and correlations in heart rate series but not in sign        series were already a main subject of discussion        We have already discussed the methodological link        between PP and BAL in a recent publication     We        assumed that a change of BAL ie a shift from low to        highfrequency heart rate variations or vice versa is        accompanied by a shift in the distribution of predominant        pattern classes A decrease of BAL for example was        thought to be related with a higher detection rate of        cardiorespiratory phase locking patterns which also results        in higher PP values This assumption could be impressively        confirmed in this study        Both the analysis of bivariate variation and the use of        surrogate data suggests that intermittent phase        coordination with         k   and    results primarily        from central adjustment of heart rate and respiratory rate        and not from real beattobeat phase synchronization This        was not surprising because in our experience phase        coordination over periods of more than  seconds which        correspond to sequences of at least three breathing cycles        or  heartbeats are relatively seldom in physiological        data and can therefore not essentially contribute to the        frequency statistics of shortterm phase coordination        Increasing the parameter         k might help separating the effects        of real synchronization from those of low bivariate signal        variability or longterm frequency coordination but it is        not realistic to count only RSA patterns which are stable        over at least         k   heartbeats By increasing         k  only very few sequences would be        detected resulting in statistically nonreliable frequency        distributions Fig shows this by way of example The data        are the same as in Fig but the stability condition has        been set at         k   Only the sequences with         coordination shortly after two oclock meet this        requirement corroborating the above finding with respect        to the surrogate data analysis and          q  see results that in subject b        only the  phase recurrency partly indicates real phase        couplings                    Conclusions        Binary pattern analysis of heart rate differences is        strongly linked with but does not substitute for bivariate        cardiorespiratory phase coordination analysis The        univariate pattern analysis provides essential information        on shortterm phase recurrence and suggests a strong        relationship between sleep architecture and cardiovascular        regulation but is only weakly linked with coupling        processes and real phase synchronization        We feel also encouraged to conclude that if the primary        goal is to analyze physiological phase synchronization and        entrainment in the physical sense it is necessary i to        analyze highly resolved combined thermistorECG recordings        ii to find longer periods of continuous phase        coordination ie phase recurrence over several breathing        cycles and iii to require high bivariate signal        variability However as all three criteria are seldom met        even during resting periods it is thus questionable        whether the application of physical synchronization        criteria is appropriate in the identification and        quantification of synergetic effects in physiological        processes of man                    Methods                  Subjects and data acquisition          In  healthy subjects ECG  Hz including          digital R wave detection and airflow  Hz using a          nasaloral thermistor were recorded simultaneously with          an ambulatory solidstate recorder Medikorder          TOMSignaltechnik Graz Austria during night sleep over          at least  hours between  and  The ambulatory          device provided Matlab data files which were further          analyzed on a personal computer using C and Matlab          routines Two subjects had to be excluded from data          analysis one because of sustained ventricular          arrhythmia a second one because of losing the thermistor          during night The remaining  subjects were aged  to           years mean  SD    years and included           males and  smokers

   are calculated for each heartbeat and the R wave as the          reference point within the heartbeat cycle          cardiorespiratory phase coordination can be determined by          calculating the phase  of the respiratory cycle at all R          times                        i                        R                       i             The easiest way to define the normalized

these definitions intermittent phase          coordination can be defined by the requirement that the          phase  must recur within the range    after           m heartbeats for at least

      i              which corresponds to an acceleration of heart          rate and RR differences greater than or equal to zero          are marked with           b                       i              which corresponds to a deceleration of heart          rate see Table  and lower diagram of Fig           Subsequently the algorithm looks for musical pattern          classes in the resulting binary sequences A binary          musical pattern class is defined as a set consisting of          all binary patterns with constant pattern length           m  The patterns in a set can be          transformed into each other either by rotation shifts in          origin or by exchange permutation of s and s This          can be pictured as a closed necklace with white and black          beads Moving beads from one side to the other rotation          or exchanging white and black beads permutation does          not affect the symmetry type of the necklace          Alternatively the s and s can be interpreted as          strokes and rests or as strokes on two different drums          The formal musical rhythm which results when repeatedly          playing a pattern does not depend on the entry point          chosen rotation or on the type of the sounds played          permutation In the music of African or          AfricanAmerican origin for example complementary          rhythms strokerest permuted patterns are often played          or thought simultaneously If a complementary rhythm is          not heard it can usually be still seen in the moving          patterns of the drummers or dancers              The pattern classification system used in this study          had been derived from a scheme originally developed to          classify timeline rhythms bell patterns in the music of          African origin     In a previous publication we          constructed a scheme consisting of  pattern classes          comprising all binary patterns with  to  bits pulses          heartbeats      Later the scheme was extended to           pattern classes to also include the most relevant          pattern classes with up to  bits applied in               Many of these binary patterns are associated with RSA          and are generated constantly and repeatedly when phase          coordination between heart beat and respiration is          present see Table  Fig demonstrates this by way of          example for a  phase locking which results in a          cyclical recurrence of pattern class  The same effect          is also shown in the lower panel of Fig using real          data          The basic idea is to make use of the recurrence of RSA          pattern classes in order to detect intermittent          cardiorespiratory coordination A detailed description of          this method can be found in recent publications               see Footnote  In the present study the binary          pattern analysis is reduced to detect only those patterns          which belong to the pattern classes in Table  A second          important modification of the standard method is that a          onebit or twobit pattern deviation from a RSA pattern          in Table is allowed ie all but one bit or two bits          respectively of the pattern under consideration must          coincide with the bits of a pattern in one of the pattern          classes This makes the algorithm more flexible as also          asymmetrical breathing patterns are identified more          effectively Furthermore the parameter           k is introduced to preselect the          required number of subsequent heartbeats for which a          pattern class has to remain unchanged This parameter          corresponds to the phase coordination stability           k in the previous section and is          subsequently referred to as pattern stability Then RSA          pattern recurrence could be formally defined by the          following condition                    m           l             k            class              class   RSA pattern classes                    with  The term in braces denotes the set of the          pattern classes summarized in Table  including those          which are identical after permutation of  bits pattern          tolerance Definition  has to be extended as it          ignores an important requirement successive patterns          must not only have the same class number but must also be          identical after rotation Thus in a single run swapping          s and s is not permitted in successive patterns ie          successive patterns may not be complementary This          restriction is taken into account by the following          definition                    m           class   RSA pattern classes           l            i            i            k             b                       l                       b                     l            m            which is therefore more appropriate for the definition          of RSA pattern recurrence The form of  is also          similar to the form of condition  in the previous          section          In the heartbeat table the pattern class number is          displayed for all heartbeats which meet the first part of           ie           k   with           m  see columns  to  in          Table  in Additional file  Negative class numbers          denote complementary patterns                          Implementation          The heartbeat table is the basis for further analysis          Only phase coordination ratios in the range from  to           as well as bit to bit patterns are considered          This ensures comparability between the two kinds of          statistics and allows equal treatment of the integer          ratios         and          the noninteger ratios   and           Frequency statistics are performed in the same fashion          for the combined signal analysis Method  and the RSA          pattern analysis Method  A window of  heartbeats          centered around the           i th heartbeat is moved in          equidistant steps of  heartbeats over the entire          heartbeat table The stability requirement is set to           k   for both methods and the          phase recurrence accuracy is set to    Within the          window all heartbeats which comply with  and           respectively are counted These counts are referred to          as absolute frequencies           F                       i            m  and           F                       i            m  respectively The          corresponding relative frequencies are denoted as           f                       i            m             F                       i            m             N and           f                       i            m  definition of           f            see below          A problem occurs when comparing the values of the          resulting pattern class frequencies           F                       i            m  with different pattern length           m  because some of the pattern          classes are per se more frequent than others For          example class  encompasses  different patterns out          of    possible binary combinations ie  but          class  only  ie  of  possible patterns          Allowing a onebit pattern tolerance the relative number          of all bit patterns classified as RSA patterns          increases to  the number of all bit patterns to           ie only the  and the  pattern are          not identified as RSA patterns see parameter                        m            in Table  Therefore it is reasonable i to          adjust the relative sizes                        m                       m of the RSA pattern classes by          choosing an appropriate tolerance value     or           and ii to normalize the absolute frequency by dividing          by the respective relative pattern class size          Furthermore to obtain relative values the absolute          frequency is also divided by the total number           N of patterns within the window          centered around the           i th heartbeat and multiplied by            k to compensate for the stability          requirement                    The resulting normalized frequency           f            is  if the pattern class          recurrence is less frequent and  if the pattern          class recurrence is more frequent than would be expected          in equally distributed random symbol sequences which          corresponds to a random walk RR tachogram In this          study the tolerance is set as follows    for           m      for           m    and    for           m   see underlined values in          Table           In comparing Method  and  quantitatively different          techniques are introduced The first is a grayscale map          of the resulting seven frequency values           f                       i            m  of each beat interval          against the time of day see Fig  This map best          illustrates coordination preferences during the nocturnal          course          Two types of parameters are calculated to reduce the          information given by the frequency distribution i the          weighted phase coordination ratios PCR            and PCR             see Footnote   and ii the          strength of coordination denoted as phase recurrency PR          and pattern predominance PP respectively  see          Footnote  The latter are simply defined as the mean of          the two maximal           f values in vertical direction and          quantify the vertical gravity of the grayscale maps           f            and           f             PCR            and PCR            can be interpreted as the vertical          centers of gravity and are defined as the weighted          averages of the           m  frequency ratios                    All four parameters are plotted together with their          corresponding grayscale map see Fig  to reveal the          type and the strength of phase and pattern recurrence          respectively and are plotted against each other to show          their interrelation see Fig           The correlations between pattern and phase recurrency          are expressed by the linear correlation coefficients           r            overall correlation between both          grayscale maps           r            PCR            vs PCR             and           r            PR vs PP                          Heart rate variability HRV          A Fast Fourier Transformation FFT based spectral          analysis of HRV is performed on all heartbeat          sequences The resulting spectral power density function          is integrated in the low frequency band  Hz          LF and the high frequency band  Hz HF LF          and HF power LF HF are computed in milliseconds such          that they correspond to the standard deviation of the LF          and HF bandpassed RR tachogram times between R waves in          milliseconds Furthermore the balance BALLFHF is          calculated The spectral analysis is performed according          to the methods of Rottman and coworkers              The linear correlations between HRV and coordination          parameters are numerically demonstrated by the          coefficients           r            PR vs LF

of synchronization          Most interesting from the physical point of view is          whether an apparent coordination of two oscillators in          general is only an occasional coincidence or if it is          really caused by coupling mechanisms Only the latter          deserves to be called synchronization in the physical          sense  see also Footnote  Answers can be found i by          looking at the variability of both signals and ii by          constructing appropriate bivariate surrogate data which          preserve essential univariate properties of the original          data but lack typical traces of phase coupling          Intermittent phase coordination between heartbeat and          respiration may appear if the two signals occasionally          reveal both a reduced variability and a lower order          rational frequency ratio Then the signals seem to be          coordinated although no entrainment or synchronization is          necessarily present Therefore a simple indicator of          synchronization is a prominent phase recurrency together          with high signal variation ie high variability of          heart rate and respiratory rate In this study the          bivariate variation of heart rate and respiratory rate is          estimated with respect to their influence on the          frequency ratio of heartbeat and respiration according          to the error propagation law                    where           II and           RR can be replaced by the mean          values and            II and            RR by the standard deviations of          the II and RR differences respectively Small values of                     q suggest spurious frequency          coordination which results solely from low bivariate          signal variability If intermittent phase coordination is          accompanied by small            q values phase synchronization is          not likely or hard to detect          Appropriate surrogate data are constructed by          shuffling the RR differences within each part of a          partitioned RR tachogram A partition size of           heartbeats ensures that shuffling destroys all          deterministic properties of the RR series on the LFHF          time scale while preserving longterm RR variability The          respiratory data remain unchanged Within the windows of           heartbeats for which coordination statistics is          performed mean value and standard deviation of heart          rate are the same in original and surrogate data but due          to the random order of RR intervals deterministic phase          relations between the heartbeat and any other oscillator          particularly respiration are destroyed                            Footnotes                  Footnote           The terms used by Engel et al     are somewhat          problematic A time delay after the preceding R wave or          inspiratory onset eg      which is also denoted          as post event time     is not identical with a phase          within the cardiac or respiratory cycle as only the          beginning of the cycle is regarded Therefore the term          phase coupling is inappropriate eg     in a          strict physical sense In the Hildebrandt group this          problem was addressed by Raschke who determined real          relative phases of inspiratory onset in the cardiac cycle                  Two different modes of coupling were          discussed modulation RSA and triggering The latter is          divided into the advancement of heartbeat by inspiration          when inspiration starts during the diastolic phase and          vice versa triggering of inspiration through the          heartbeat which was called pure phase coupling              However although calculating true phases Raschke also          focused solely on m phase and frequency          coordination                          Footnote           In physical applications           synchronization is understood as an          entrainment or locking process due to interaction                And strictly speaking one has to prove that an          observed adjustment of rhythms is not an occasional          coincidence but caused by coupling mechanisms This proof          often fails in living systems for two main reasons          First periods of synchronization are naturally very          short and consequently testing for deterministic phase          relations is not appropriate Second as the underlying          dynamics are unknown it is very difficult to decide          whether rhythm adjustment is caused by couplings or not          In this context the term           coordination is less restrictive          It is widely used in a purely descriptive manner          Introduced by von Holst in the thirties of the last          century see references in        relative          coordination is equivalent to the existence of certain          phase relations without claiming that these phase          relations are due to real coupling mechanisms          To avoid misinterpretations it is also important to          note that RSA and cardiorespiratory phase synchronization          are both caused by cardiorespiratory couplings but RSA          results solely from modulation which is seen as a          unidirectional interaction between heartbeat and          respiration breathing modulates heart rate but not vice          versa However modulation does not lead to an adjustment          of phases Synchronization is typically bidirectional          and even more important it depends on phase relations          between two or more interacting oscillators                          Footnote           A detailed description of the HRR method can be found

defined as the weighted average of          phase locking ratios according to the frequency of the          hourly predominance of binary phase locking patterns              Thus the interpretation of PCR is different but the          calculus is still the same                          Footnote           It has to be noted that the above definition of PP          differs from the original definition in      i          it considers only the two maximal           f values not the difference          between maximal and minimal values and ii it includes          the demand for pattern
