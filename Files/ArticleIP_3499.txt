                                 Helter Shelter            In  a group called theCoalition for the Homeless began handing out sandwiches and fruit every nightto the horde of homeless people who gathered around Grand Central Station Itwas a pretty dismaying experience straight out of Les Misrables  thetattered crowd the forest of groping hands the healthylooking young guys whoconned their way to seconds or thirds while the quiet or confused went homeemptyhanded But at least the coalition was doing something  It was thecoalition too that had won a court order mandating a right to shelter asignal victory in those Darwinian early Reagan years Throughout the s thecoalitionand its founder Robert Hayes a former corporate lawyerwas theprincipal voice for the homeless both in New York and nationally Hayesinsisted the problem of the homeless could be summed up in three wordsHousing housing housing            Thecoalition succeeded by turning homelessness into a simple powerful moralequation but the equation wasnt actually so simple In  a commissionchaired by Andrew Cuomo now the federal housing secretary released a studyshowing that up to  percent of single homeless men suffered from severemental illness and  percent used drugs or alcohol The numbers for familieswere smaller but still substantial Homeless advocates had always knownsubstance abuse was a problem but they had rarely aired their knowledge inpublic for fear that it would shift public debate and blur the image of thehomeless as victims of an unjust housing policy They attacked the Cuomo studythough they couldnt discredit its findings In  Hayes who had returned toprivate legal practice and had begun to question his old singlemindedformulation proposed to Mayorelect Rudy Giuliani that the court order berevised so that the city would guarantee the homeless the continuum of carethat Cuomo had proposed and the homeless in turn would be obliged to acceptcounseling work training and the like Despite Giulianis interest the ideawent nowhere since Hayes says it created a grave sense of panic at least inthe coalition because it was seen as undermining the ultimate entitlement toshelter The coalition seemed to be painting itself into an ideologicalcorner            This past March that corner became smaller still GeorgeMcDonald another longtime homeless activist filed suit against the coalitionon the grounds that officials of the organization had engaged in harassmentand physical interference of his rival program called Ready Willing Able The allegation would have seemed bizarre if it hadnt been familiar Twoyears earlier coalition officials had accused another nonprofit of using goonsquads of homeless men to roust other homeless people from ATMvestibulescharges later found to be groundless            ReadyWilling  Able which runs private homeless shelters requires participantsto submit to frequent drug tests abide by a range of rules inside the shelterand make modest payments toward their own room and board In exchange they getjobs renovating apartments or cleaning streets for  an hour plus whenthey graduate a bonus that normally amounts to  to help them findpermanent housing McDonald is a former sportswear executive with abusinessmans regard for the therapeutic power of the marketplace The premiseof his program was that since society will never pay for the kind of longtermdrug treatment Cuomo and others have envisioned and since such treatment sooften fails the most effective form of treatment is as he puts it thepositive reinforcement of a culture thats established around work aroundearning money McDonald says that half to twothirds of single men on thestreet can benefit from his program This sounds pretty optimistic and LarryRhodes a formerly homeless man who does intake at the shelter McDonald runsin Harlem says the program has succeeded partly because it screens out drugaddicts and hard cases In other words McDonald may not have so much solvedthe Cuomo problem as avoided it            Still Ready Willing  Able provides notonly work but what appears to be a relatively calm and secure environment andit would hardly be surprising if this drastic change from the world of thestreets or even of the typical shelter motivated men to turn around theirlives McDonald says twothirds of those who graduate from his program holddown permanent jobs and apartmentsan almost unheardof success rate amongsingle homeless men Most of the nine or  men I interviewed at the shelterspoke of their experience in overtly moralistic terms They talked about takingresponsibility for themselves for the money they earned and even for thechildren whom they had fathered and then neglected The program with itscombination of rules and incentives had prodded them to do something theywould not have done for themselves            McDonalds problems began when he tried to impose his program on men in theHarlem shelter who were accustomed to getting their three squares with noquestions asked McDonald acquired control of the Harlem facility widelyconsidered one of the most dangerous and disorganized in the city when thecity turned over the shelter system to nonprofit providers When McDonald tookover many of the men rebelled against the programs strictures especially therandom drug testing Some left for shelters elsewhere The coalition serves asthe courtappointed monitor for the shelter system and what McDonald allegesand others at the shelter corroborate is that the official who represented thecoalition at the shelter worked actively with the dissidents who remained todisrupt the program In a meeting of all the tenants in late January thecoalitions monitor allegedly called McDonald a Nazi who was enrichinghimself by exploiting poor blacks and berated the black shelter manager asMcDonalds lackey Coalition director Mary Brosnahan supposedly stood nearbyand said nothing The dissidents lead by the former head of the coalitionsclient advisory board urged the other homeless men to stop working andallegedly issued threats of physical violence            McDonald claims the coalition is ideologically opposed tohis program Brosnahan has lent some credence to this charge by describingMcDonalds work program as indentured servitude She declined to talk aboutthis case but her lawyer Steven Banks says the defendants deny making thestatements McDonald attributes to them It is true Banks says that thecoalition was so disturbed about the program that it contemplated suing himThe reason he says is the  a week McDonald was withholding for room andboard in violation of rules that govern the shelter system But sinceresidents were free to go to a conventional shelter its hard to see whatright was violated And since the money was being deducted from salaries theyotherwise wouldnt have had it seems perverse to focus on the issue of rightsin the first place            Thefundamental issue is whether its permissible to impose obligations on thehomeless in exchange for various goods to regard them as something other thanvictims to whom certain rights attach This is of course the same question weare now asking about welfare recipients We have moved very swiftly from seeingwelfare as an unconditional right to viewing it as no right at all Perhaps wecould have found our way to a middle point if welfares champions had seentheir way beyond the language of rights to a different and more reciprocalkind of social contract The sad story of the Coalition for the Homeless andof its decline from the moral pinnacle it once occupied is a parable of thatfailure of vision
