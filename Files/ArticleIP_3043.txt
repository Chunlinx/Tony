                                 All Kings Men            Shortly after he won thePulitzer Prize for Parting the Waters  which chronicled the firstdecade of the civilrights movement author Taylor Branch told a reporter thathe would probably complete his second and final volume by the fall of when the money runs out Eight years and  pages later he has inPillar of Fire  covered roughly  months from the beginning of through early  A third volume is promised Branch who now knows betterhasnt predicted when it will be done                           Pillarof Fire s sprawl doesnt come from the kind of notebookemptyingselfindulgence that often clogs up journalistic histories Rather the booksbreadth reflects Branchs enthusiasm for his subject and his appreciation ofits epic dimensions The years he covers here were the highwater years for themovement There were previously unthinkable triumphs protests at Birminghamand Selma Ala that helped topple Jim Crow a quartermillion Americansgathering in Washington to demand racial equality black activists and Northernwhite volunteers registering hordes of black voters a civilrights actoutlawing racial discrimination passed despite a threemonth Senatefilibuster            And yet there were also appalling setbacks NAACP FieldSecretary Medgar Evers was assassinated Freedom Summer volunteers AndrewGoodman James Chaney and Michael Schwerner were murdered The DemocraticParty spurned Mississippis Freedom Party delegation seating a bloc ofsegregationist whites instead Fissures widened within and among the leadingcivilrights groups in some cases irreparably            Amagisterial storyteller Branch ranges confidently over these peaks andvalleys but he also stops along the way to explore a slew of seemingly lesssignificant tales The great strength of this book is the way Branch zooms inon the dozens of local skirmishes from Greenwood Miss to St AugustineFla through which the movements shock troops waged their nonviolentcampaigns He returns again and again to these chosen locales lingering overthem patiently narrating their miniature dramas a march by schoolchildren toget library cards a black mans fatal decision to attend a white theater Atbreaks in the action he will inconspicuously cut away to the White House orthe Supreme Court or Martin Luther Kings plane But though he amply coversthe higherstakes political events he never allows them to eclipse his largerstory farmers and teachers sharecroppers and dentists prying their freedomloose from the grip of segregationist whitesand in so doing stripping awaythe racist restrictions that had always made the achievements of Americandemocracy ring hollow            Branchs most powerful scenes are his unflinchingdescriptions of the horrors endured by hundreds of activists from themedieval privations of  to barbaric beatings by  to the arson and murdercommitted by  When TV cameras covered events like these the nation wasriveted but often these individual sacrifices went unnoticed by reportersswooning over King At one point in his account of the Mississippi FreedomSummer voterregistration drive Branch describes the release from a Greenwoodjail of  protesters on the same day King arrived in town            Foulsmelling and haggard from a sixday hunger strike  some of thembriefly mistook the commotion downtown as a welcoming ceremony for themUnfamiliar reporters prowled with clipboards and camera equipment wrotevolunteer Sally Belfrage who noted that for Negroes there hardly seemed to beanyone who wasnt rushing around looking for King cooking for King talking ofKing as if they couldnt find him and thinking of him as if there was no oneto talk to            Branch does place King at the center of his history butPillar of Fire is far too broad to be labeled a biography of one manNor is King here the mythic figure who has become our only undisputedcontemporary hero Branch restores to the man his human dimensions            That Kingwas fallible was almost forgotten in the mad rush to immortalize him during hisown lifetime In  Time named him Man of the Year praising hisleadership in the Birmingham desegregation protests that made him theunchallenged voice of the Negro peopleand the disquieting conscience of thewhites The next year he won the Nobel Peace Prize But Kings prominenceturned out to be a mixed blessing Whipsawed between the need on the one handto preserve good relations with the White House as it cautiously pushed thelandmark civilrights bill and on the other to placate the fiery youngactivists of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee King clung tomethods suited to his stature as a prince of the Negro church He backed awayfrom protests such as a stallin at the New York Worlds Fair as often ashe led them He frequently emerges from Branchs narrative as indecisivefeckless even weak At one point he states that his own leadership wasstanding still doing nothing going nowhere            Unknown to the public King was also hemmed inby blackmail threats from the FBI J Edgar Hoover despised King whom hegenuinely believed to be a Communist and further resented for assailing thebureaus sometimes laggard enforcement of justice in the lawless SouthHoovers agents received special commendations for such petty deeds as gettingMarquette University to withdraw an honorary doctorate it had planned to awardKing Worse the bureau tapped Kings phones and shadowed his every movehunting for any damaging secrets            On Jan  FBI men installed microphones in Kings Washington DC hotel roomand turned on the tape recorder According to officials who heard the tapesKing that night betrayed his wife Corettanot for the first or the lasttimeshouting amid his most private activities Im fucking for God andIm not a Negro tonight Later that year agents anonymously shipped King ahighlight recording of bugged sex groans and party jokes along with a letterwarning him You are done There is but one way out for you You better takeit before your filthy abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation Theycalled it the suicide package            While King vacillated Malcolm X seized the nationsattention with his calls for retribution tempting blacks weary of Kingsnonviolence and sending whites into a panic Throughout Pillar of Fire Malcolm upstages Martin Kings speeches may seem like part of the Americanpolitical canon now but in the despair of the early s they could appeartoothless next to Malcolms rhetorical daggers Anyone can sit the angryMuslim preacher sneered belittling the transformative techniques of theprotesters for desegregation An old woman can sit A coward can sit  Ittakes a man to stand When Malcolm rejoicing over a plane crash that killed white Atlantans chalked the disaster up to our God and hoped that everyday another plane falls out of the sky King could only reply feebly Iwould certainly disagree with him Privately too King brooded over Malcolmsjibes about my being soft and  my being a sort of polished Uncle Tom            Branchinterprets the MalcolmMartin choice not as the press did as a simplecontrast between violence and gentleness but as a contest between democracyand its critics Branchs King is a theologian for the American way In Kingsletter from the Birmingham jail where he languished for a week in April he pulled up hope in paired phrases of secular and religious faithrepeatedly invoking constitutional and Godgiven rights in acharacteristically American  notion of divine sanction for democraticvalues            Where King invoked Americas promise Malcolmunderscored its betrayal It was people who advocate democracy who sold uslike cotton and cows from one plantation to another he told a gasping crowdat New Yorks City College It was people who advocate democracy who had blackpeople lynched from one end of this country to another  All the hell ourpeople have ever caught in this country they have caught in the name ofdemocracy As Branch notes King and the movements established leaderssounded ponderous against Malcolms avenging swagger And yet for the widerpublic black and white Malcolm was also a helpful foil to King whosemunificence looked noble and whose radicalism looked moderate in contrast            But Pillar of Fireisnt a study of two charismatic leaders any more than it is a biography Itslasting impression is of a portrait gallery of inspiring individuals King justone among many I think for example of yearold June Johnson who joinedBob Moses and his troublemakers as her mother called them in an excursionto Selma only to wind up beaten by authorities in a Winona Miss jailPeople such as Johnson never imagined that history would remember them Butquietly compellingly Branch shows how they forced America to rethink what itmeans to be a democracy achieving with their deeds what King so brilliantlyarticulated with his words
