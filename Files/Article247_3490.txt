                                 Harry in the New World                        Dear Polly            Though the series Britishness is vital to its charm and appeal Id like toknow what the wizards beyond the shores of Albion are up to We do hear aboutthe elder Weasley brothers who work in Romania and Egyptobvious enoughmagical placesbut Id love it if Rowling could inject a bit of Tintinstyleglobetrotting into the Potter saga What if the Hogwartians took a year tostudy abroad in say the United States What are the witches of Texas like orBrooklyn or Salt Lake City or Salem Mass Or are we a nation of mugglesafter all Do American wizards play a sport superficially like Quidditch butwith a completely different and to the British wizards utterlyincomprehensible set of rules Do they prefer WarlockCola to pumpkin juiceand have their mail delivered by eagles or pterodactyls instead of owls Ormaybe if the stateside magic kingdom is too much to contemplate the nextDefence Against Dark Arts Master theres a new one each book just to mixthings up could be a voodoo priestess from New Orleans or a Wiccan fromNorthampton            Id also like to know more about the political economy and socialorganization of the magic world There seems to be a class system ofsortsaristocrats like the Malfoys at one end cockneys like Hagrid and theknightbus drivers in Prisoner of Azkaban at the other with strugglingmiddleclass civilservant types like the Weasleys in the middleIntellectuals like the Hogwarts masters are as ever a class untothemselves But where do these distinctions come from What is the source ofthe wealth that sits in Gringotts bank Is all that coveted Quidditch gear madeby workers in offshore magic sweatshops Are they unionized What is thestructure of wizard government Who appointed Minister Fudge Ill stop butits testimony to the fertility of Rowlings imagination that these seem likeplausible and interesting questions and ones I bet shed have answers toPerhaps someday shell publish a concordance to Harry Potter and explain itall            Meanwhile I dont see Harry falling for a succubus I think thats the wordyou were looking for Hagrid might though what with his affection fordangerous monsters Funny that all of the Hogwarts teachers seem to besingle            Which brings me to an intriguing point in your letter I owe you a silversickle since it seems plain to me that the homosexual themes are alreadythere and treated with the sublimation and symbolism you predict Well nothomosexual themes per se since whatever sexuality there is in the books isconventionally and safely infantile What I mean is that being a wizard is verymuch like being gay You grow up in a hostile world governed by codes and normsthat seem nonsensical to you and you discover at a certain age that there arepeople like youwhats more theres a whole subculture with its own codes andnorms right alongside the straight muggle one yet strangely invisible to itIn outoftheway spots in the middle of large cities are secret placesbarsbookshopsthat cater to this special clientele and suddenly one day youfind your way to them The reaction of many straights muggles is hostilityand denial on the order of the Dursleys But some muggle parents likeHermiones love their wizard children and support them Hermione reciprocatesby taking a course at Hogwarts in muggle studies the one moment in the seriesthat made me laugh out loud Consider too that there are wizards born ofmuggles and muggles born of wizards so that having magical power like beinggay at least according to some schools of thought is while not hereditaryclearly innate Your use of the phrase a place for us was especiallysuggestive though by us you meant the muggles since thats the title of afascinating book by DA Miller published last year by Harvard about the roleof the Broadway musical in forming at once in secret and out in plain viewmodern gay male cultural identity The process of acculturation he describeswhich involves playing the cast album from Gypsy in your parentssuburban basement is not unlike what Harry undergoes in the early chapters ofSorcerers Stone             Is this completely crazy I wont be offended if you say yes Will JerryFalwell now take out after Harry Potter having raised the alarm about TinkyWinky Our dear colleague Chatterbox that estimable muggle thinks he mightbut for other reasons namely that the Potter books take a benign view ofpaganism magic witchcraft and other things that scare Christianfundamentalists A few years ago they went after Barney because he could flyand because he taught kids about the powers of the imagination in theircrusade they had the tacit support of parents across America who are fullyprepared to believe that the purple dinosaur is the instrument of Satan Therehave also been outcries raised about Dungeons and Dragons and about the mereuse of the word imagination in school textbooks So Im sure its only amatter of time before school libraries start getting calls from concernedparents complaining about our dear Harry Which makes me like him all the moreof course            Thats it On their year abroad in the United States Harry and his palsfall afoul of the local Christian Coalitiondominated school board in a smallKansas town where theyve come in search of Dumbledores old teacher theWonderful Wizard of Oz and Minerva MacGonagall goes head to head with PatRobertson on Nightline  What do you think            BestTony
