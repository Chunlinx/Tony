                why dont you start   oh i dont know i um i refinished a couple of old uh dressers that were given handed down you know its nice tongue and groove um uh construction uh huh thats just ive been pretty successful with that   things you already owned or things that youve picked up just to do that   what   are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing   no ive done some other things too um you know   ive yeah ive done both  uh i have had my wifes picked up a couple things saying uh boy if we could refinish that thatd be a  beautiful piece of furniture and uh and weve done it a couple of times   yeah   i guess that weve been fairly successful with those thats uh thats a kind of low risk sort of project isnt it i guess   oh yeah yeah thats a good way to get started   um i have a a um really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire and uh   umhum   we stripped it all the way down and refinished it it turned out to be really nice uh pretty nice desk maple top i think or   umhum       umhum   or something of that sort   yeah i i put together um a um rolltop desk from scratch you know a kit   oh really oh im jealous   still had to cut it and everything but yeah its fun   uhhuh yeah  ive i do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking ive built my own deck and   uhhuh   um  things like that   yeah ive ive done the same you know like the trim around the house you know the baseboards and things like that   and i i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too my i uh i picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wifes father owned when he was alive and so i do have a band saw and a router and um things like that out in the garage but i cant say i use them very often   uhhuh       um i im looking at trying to get a router right now   theyre handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times putting doors in is the time when im uh i bought myself a um       template for making mortices and doors and thats a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel       but ive also ive also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh   ill bet   because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain   umhum   so i got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it and now i i use it twice a year maybe   yeah my brothers my brothers used it a lot for making drawers     the big stuff   i dont know what whats your opinion of what a good router is like   uh i guess it   you know i had because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in arent all that great theyve plastic parts and stuff   the ones that what   that you dial in on the side   uh i have never even seen ive never even looked at one closely and the the little use that ive gotten from my router i would say   umhum   uh i would spend my money on the bits   uhhuh   um i have a id guess youd call a medium quality Craftsman router and the um   how strong is it     its strong enough for any job where you dont try to take more than say three eighths of an inch at a time but the problem is that the uh as with any any time you buy um a a tool with as as as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end   dont they umhum umhum     so  the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably um i mean a a good set of bits is probably gonna run you a hundred dollars and uh um if youre gonna use it for a lifetime i suppose its worth it because  um imagine if i go and sharpen them myself uh it wont last and ive never had the bits sharpened   uhhuh   so thats a thing to consider is to   they they really get hot dont they   yeah and they they dull after a while especially i did some cabinets in um ash and oak and uh that that wears a bit down   uhhuh   we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen   uhhuh right   and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth  and uh routing hardwood will um take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast so   yeah ive cut some one by eight oak before   boy was that fun big solid pieces of oak are just tough   right thats uh and then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right           well that was you know with a with a circular saw like oh my gosh this gonna be fun   uhhuh right yeah       well ive used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening   yeah   because uh the treated wood will also chew them up   yeah treated wood can really make you sick too if youre not
