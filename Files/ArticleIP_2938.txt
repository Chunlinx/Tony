                                 The Fat Man Sings            Its a pity that eating disorders have beenpasted over with banal notions such as body image and selfesteem andunappetizing medical terms such as morbidly obese because obsession withfood is by no means a dull subject How much could be said that has nothing todo with olestra or the bad example set by supermodels about a person absorbedin strange hostile negotiations with her own body There is no end to themental or at least nonnutritive uses to which food can be put and no end tothe rituals surrounding that perverse form of group autoeroticism known as ameal            RichardKleins EAT FAT tries to reclaim one aspect of eatinggetting fat andfeeling bad about itfrom the boring debates about health and fashion in whichits usually stuck EAT FAT is a postmodern diet book as Klein putsit employing a rather eccentric definition of postmodern which seems roughlyto amount to counterintuitive an encomium to corpulence and an excoriationof all the industries that encourage you to be skinny Kleins goal is totransform an uncontrolled and miserable hatred of fat his and yours into aflabophilic delight that by robbing fat of its malevolent power will lead tobecoming thin His idea is that you can dissipate an obsession byaestheticizing its object and embracing your urge to indulge in it            Klein a professor of French and literary critic of thedeconstructive variety has done this kind of thing before A couple of yearsago he wrote a book his first Cigarettes Are Sublime  in praise ofsmoking in order to stop It worked then and so Kleinwho as we discoveris on the chubby sideis doing it again But while the Klein who wroteCigarettes had succeeded in mastering his obsession by the time hedfinished the book hed quit smoking FAT Klein is still in the processof recovering from the throes of diet Consequently he has written anextremely strange book In reading it you are subjected to changes inpersonality as abrupt and jarring as nasty little electric shocks administeredto the base of your spine            Youll befloating contentedly along in Kleins pleasant foamy prosethe gorgeousdisplay of her colossal adiposity her thundering moonfaced crevicedposterior evokes a vastly delicious sublunar landscape in which an explorercould lose himself in pleasure forever O blessed fatwhen all of a suddenDzzzzz Science and authority come together to serve each other to make moneyand murder fat The writing gets bubbly for a bitthe profusion of theirdcollet flesh billowing up and cascading down over and out of theirdressesand then Dzzzzz Evil doctors foist new drugs on desperate people Thousands die of starvation and the rest sooner or later get fat            There are you are forced to conclude not onebut two Richard Kleins lurking in this book Richard Klein No  is an urbanecritic who delights in a clever lyrical celebration of creamy fleshiness Hisevil twin Richard Klein No  is hurt and angry at the system for making himfeel bad about himself all his life and perpetuating evil unattainable imagesof thinness to get him addicted to its demonic diet drugs and make him sick andmiserable plus its not just him but men and especially women all over Americawho are falling victim to the greedy maw of the medicalindustrialconspiracy            Richard Klein No  haswritten an elegant seductive book that sets you to musing how nice it might beto put on  or  pounds to feel that sensual private fatty softness allover Klein No  can tell any number of amusing fatrelated anecdotes Did youknow that Socrates used to dance every morning to keep his weight down Thatthe  th century French writer Thophile Gautier declared he couldnot in his youth have accepted as a lyric poet anyone weighing more than pounds            Best ofall fat Hamlet Citing an essay by one Laura Keyes Klein quotes lines fromthe play eg Queen Gertrude about her son He is fat and scant of breaththat suggest that Hamlets indecision may be due more to the lymphatictemperament of a pudgy little porker Hamlet get it than to heroicparalysis The interpretation certainly makes the play funnier Is not thisline of Hamlets for example lent a certain zing when read as a dietfantasy Oh that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolveitself into a dew            But Richard Klein No  delivers snoozy tirades against theBeauty Myth designed to oppress and exploit us all  inventedmanufactured sustained and promoted by a vast industrial ideological systemin order to obscure the reality of our bodies Why is it one wonders thatthe Beauty Myth is oppressive while the Superbly Rendered Sonata Myth or theBrilliant But Also Commercially Successful Book Myth is not Klein No throws around the silly word vast in order to convey a sense of imminent dietapocalypse as in vast unknown consequences administration of these drugson a vast scale And he displays a certain navet about scientific standardsasking for instance about a diet drug What perfect assurance can the FDAgive that the dex effect wont be the same on human brains Why take chances ona massive scale with human neurons until proof of dexs safety can beunambiguously established How does Klein propose to establish a drugssafety with perfect assurance Surely safety is the product of an adhoc costbenefit analysis rather than some kind of empirical property that adrug does or doesnt have In short Richard Klein No  quenches our pleasurein Richard Klein No  in much the same way that the health and beautyindustries are supposedly determined to quench our pleasure in fat            Kleinbeing a poststructuralist is fascinated by the materiality of signsthat isin this case by the way words look and sound as opposed to what they meanThis fascination crops up in the book in a number of ways which will seemthoughtprovoking or irritating depending on taste The book is liberallyseasoned with wordplay and typographical experiments the words eat fat arealways in capitals with FAT printed directly under EAT so you can see howsimilar the two words are and rhymes why this should be so at this moment inhistory is a mystery A mystery of history The books first sentence isSKIP THIS PREFACE            The most pervasive sign of Kleins brand ofFrench poststructuralism though are his narrow ideas about pleasure andcontrol For Klein control is always badwhether its the evilhealthandfashion industry dictating our ideas about beauty or thebeleaguered dieter struggling to curb his cravings in a spirit of misguidedselfhatred Klein has a horror of what he rather predictably perceives to be aNew Puritan movement in America attempting to eliminate badforyou indulgencessuch as fat or cigarettes Pleasure for Klein is the opposite of controlIts all about gratification and excess            But there are two kinds ofpleasure the pleasure of doing and the pleasure of not doing the pleasure ofindulging and the pleasure of abstinence Control can be fun And it is arather uninteresting onesided kind of hedonism that fails to take this intoaccount If only Klein werent so categorically averse to American healthculture he might allow that a little selfimposed Puritanism now and thenalittle punishing exercise here a little culinary deprivation therecan be asensual pleasure too albeit of a different sort            In Cigarettes Kleins mascot was the Baudelairean dandythat rare figure for whom thecultivation of personal elegance is more important than health and who istherefore a model for the unrepentant smoker So Klein of all people shouldappreciate the stricter kinds of pleasures Because while the dandy stands forbeauty and elegance he also stands for the restraint and selfdisciplinerequired to appear refined at all times As Baudelaire put it in his essay ThePainter of Modern Life All the complicated material conditions to whichdandies submit from an impeccable toilette at every hour  to the mostperilous feats of the sporting field are no more than a system of gymnasticsdesigned to  discipline the soul  The strictest monastic rule  wasno more despotic            You would think thatcultivating a taste for such ascetic modes of enjoyment would be at least aseffective a diet strategy as glorifying blubber but Klein fails to entertainthis possibility Alas all he writes about all he thinks about all he wantsto do is give in to fat
