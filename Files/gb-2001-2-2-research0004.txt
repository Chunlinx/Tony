                    Background        The need for technologies that allow highly parallel        quantitation of specific proteins in a rapid lowcost and        lowsamplevolume format has become increasingly apparent        with the growing recognition of the importance of global        approaches to molecular characterization of physiology        development and disease    The ability to quantitate        multiple proteins simultaneously has applications in basic        biological research molecular classification and diagnosis        of disease identification of therapeutic markers and        targets and profiling of response to toxins and        pharmaceuticals Many standard assays are amenable to        parallel analysis in microtiter plates but sample and        reagent consumption can be prohibitive in largescale        studies Twodimensional gels are now widely used for        largescale protein analysis in cancer research   and        other areas of biology   Twodimensional gels have been        used to separate and visualize  proteins in a        single experiment   and subsequent excision of protein        bands and detection by mass spectrometry can enable        identification of the proteins          Ordered arrays of peptides and proteins provide the        basis of another strategy for parallel protein analysis        DNA microarrays have demonstrated the effectiveness of this        approach in many areas of biological research see            for reviews Protein assays using ordered arrays have        been explored since the development of multipin synthesis          and spot synthesis   of peptides on cellulose        supports Protein arrays on membranes have been used to        screen binding specificities of a protein expression        library     and to detect DNA RNA and        proteinbinding targets   Arrays of clones from        phagedisplay libraries can be probed with an        antigencoated filter for highthroughput antibody        screening   Antibodies bound to glass can be used as a        flowcell array immunosensor   and antibodies spotted        into glassbottom microwells have been used for        miniaturized highthroughput ELISA   Multiple        antigens and antibodies have been patterned onto        polystyrene using a desktop jet printer   and onto        glass by covalent attachment to polyacrylamide gel pads          for parallel immunoassays Proteins covalently attached        to glass slides through aldehydecontaining silane reagents        have been used to detect proteinprotein interactions        enzymatic targets and proteinsmall molecule interactions                 We explored the use of protein microarrays for the        highly parallel quantitation of proteins in complex        mixtures A robotic arrayer was used to print protein        solutions onto the surface of a coated microscope slide in        an ordered array This array provides specific binding        sites for proteins that we wish to measure in complex        samples Protein solutions to be measured are labeled by        covalent linkage of a fluorescent dye to the amino groups        on the proteins The labeled solutions are placed on        arrays and specific binding interactions for example        antibodyantigen interactions result in localizing        specific individual components of the complex mixtures to        the corresponding specific spots in the array To maximize        the robustness and quantitative accuracy of the array        comparative fluorescence measurements are made using an        internal standard for each protein to be assayed Two        differentially labeled protein solutions are mixed together        and then incubated with the array so that the fluorescence        ratio at each spot corresponds to the concentration ratio        of each protein in the two protein solutions We        characterized the performance of the protein microarrays        with approximately  antibodyantigen pairs using both        printed arrays of antibodies to detect antigens and printed        arrays of antigens to detect antibodies To assess the        applicability of this method to realworld samples we        examined protein microarray detection in various        concentration ranges and background conditions                    Results                  Using antibody and antigen arrays to measure          variation in protein concentrations          We assembled a set of  antibodyantigen pairs to          evaluate the use of protein microarrays for specific          detection and quantitation of multiple proteins in          complex mixtures Microarrays were constructed by          printing microscopic spots of either antibodies to          detect antigens or antigens to detect antibodies onto          a modified glass surface The microarrays contained six          to twelve spots of each antibody or antigen about           spots all together We performed controlled experiments          to measure the specificity of binding the accuracy and          precision of quantitation and the detection limits Six          different mixtures of the  antibodies and six          different mixtures of  antigens were prepared so that          the concentration of each species varied in a unique          pattern across the protein mixtures over a range of three          orders of magnitude Each of the six protein mixtures was          labeled with the dye Cy red fluorescence and then          mixed with a Cylabeled green fluorescence reference          mixture containing each of the same  proteins at a          constant concentration The variation across the six          microarrays in the redtogreen RG ratio measured for          each antibody or antigen spot should reflect the          variation in the concentration of the corresponding          binding partner in the set of mixes By comparing the          observed variation in the concentration ratios with the          known variation in the concentration ratios we could          assay the performance of each antibodyantigen pair          Six antibody arrays were used to analyze a set of six          unique antigen mixes Figure  Each antigen ranged in          concentration from  gml to  ngml The          concentration of each antigen in the reference mixture          was  gml The inset in each panel highlights          antiFlag and antiIgG spots and the labels indicate the          concentration of the antigen applied to each array The          images were produced by merging an image taken with the          Cyselective filter represented as green with an image          taken with a Cyselective filter represented as red At          the highest concentration  gml the Cylabeled          antigen was tenfold more abundant than the Cylabeled          antigen and both the antiFlag Figure  panel  and          antiIgG Figure  panel  spots appeared red At          progressively lower concentrations the color of the          spots appeared more yellow and at the lowest          concentration of  ngml Figure panel  for antiFlag          and Figure panel  for antiIgG the spots appeared          green These color changes provided visual confirmation          that the spotted antibodies specifically detected          variation in concentration of their respective          antigens          In a complementary experiment six different          Cylabeled antibody mixes were compared to a constant          Cylabeled reference antibody mix using six antigen          arrays Figure  The inset in each panel highlights          AIM and Kalanin B spots detecting the indicated          concentrations of corresponding antibody Like the          antibody spots the color of the antigen spots varied          appropriately with variation in the concentration of the          corresponding binding partner providing evidence that          these spotted antigens specifically detected their          respective antibodies          To assess performance more quantitatively the log            of the redtogreen ratio log            RG for each antibody spot was          analyzed as a function of the concentration of the          cognate antigen Figure  For each of the  antibodies          depicted the median log            RG of the nine to twelve          replicate spots is plotted The error bars represent the          standard deviation in the log            RG The dashed lines represent          the log            of the true ratios of the antigen          concentrations in the two mixes For several of the          antibodies for example antiMEKK and antiHCG the          results closely paralleled the ideal dashed line over          the entire range of concentrations Several antibodies          for example SOD and MAP showed a nearly ideal response          at high concentrations but deviated from linearity at          low concentrations The plateau at low concentrations          corresponds to the fluorescence signal in the Cy red          channel approaching the background indicating a          detection limit of about  ngml for SOD and MAP For          each antibody depicted in Figure  the RG ratio was          very similar among the replicate spots evidenced by the          small error bars At low concentrations of cognate          antigen the ratio measured for replicate spots typically          showed increased dispersion as with antiMEKK and          antiSIN and in some cases the ratio could not be          measured that is the Cy signal was below background          The complete data set including primary images and          quantitative data for all the antibodies and antigens          tested can be found at   and as Additional data          files available with the online version of this          article          The deviations from linearity were usually consistent          among all the replicate spots For example all of the          antiHCG spots showed a slight positive deviation at the           ngml dilution and all of the antiPer spots showed          a slight positive deviation at the  ngml dilution          For two of the antigens HCG and Human IgG two          independent antibodies were printed and in both cases          the deviations from linearity were highly consistent          between the antibodies with the same specificity These          close ratios suggest that the errors reflect deficiencies          in the preparation of the antigen solutions such as          pipetting errors or inconsistencies in the dyelabeling          reaction Additional results pointed to variation in the          labeling reactions as the most likely source of          variation when we repeated an experiment using the same          labeling reaction the shape of the curve relating          fluorescence ratio to concentration remained the same for          each antibodyantigen pair However when the same          antigen mixes were relabeled under slightly different          conditions the curve shape changed data not shown          Thus variation in labeling appears to be a more important          source of imprecision in the measurements than          crossreactivity of antigenantibody pairs or dilution          errors which would be expected to be consistent among          all experiments using the same antigen mix As the          protein labeling reaction is sensitive to changes in pH          local environment of reactive amines and the          concentrations of other reactive species the efficiency          of the conjugation of the dye to each protein may be          variable among the proteins in each mixture in a way that          varies from one labeling reaction to another Including a          diverse set of internal control proteins in the protein          mixture to be labeled could provide a way to correct for          this source of measurement error Modification and          careful control of the labeling reaction should lead to          improvement in performance          Many of the antibody spots that showed significant          deviations from ideal performance still provided reliable          qualitative or semiquantitative measurements For          example although the slope of the Mint response curve          between  ngml and  ngml was threefold greater          than the slope of the ideal line the fluorescence ratio          varied monotonically with the concentration ratio over          the entire range tested The horizontal dashed line in          the graph of the Mint response represents a RG ratio          two standard deviations above the value measured at the          final dilution Such a threshold is useful for defining a          fluorescence ratio that would signify the presence of an          antigen All of the fluorescence ratios measured at the          Mint spots exceeded this detection threshold when the          cognate antigen was present at concentrations of  ngml          or higher Thus this antibody could be used in a          microarray format for detection and approximate          quantitation of Mint levels above this threshold          The performance of antigen microarrays in detecting          and measuring the cognate antibodies was analyzed in a          similar way Figure  For many of the antigens the          experimental data very closely follow the ideal response          represented by the dashed line For antigens such as          P delta Numb and AIM we obtained reproducible and          accurate measurements over the entire concentration range          Figure  These antigens have detection limits of less          than  ngml for their respective antibodies An upward          deviation from ideal was occasionally observed at the          lower concentrations as the detection limit was          approached The ratios measured at replicate spots were          highly consistent and exhibited coordinated deviations          from linearity except in some cases at low          concentrations where the dispersion appeared more random          for example GBP and ARNT          To summarize the overall performance of the protein          arrays for the  antibodyantigen pairs used in this          study the number of antibodies and antigens that met          certain criteria for qualitative and quantitative          performance are represented in Figure as a function of          the concentration of the target protein in a complex          solution The standard for qualitative measurement          accuracy was defined as described above for the example          of Mint An antibody or antigen was considered to          perform satisfactorily for qualitative measurement at a          specified concentration if the RG ratio measured at           of the replicate spots exceeded the threshold whenever          the target protein was present at or above the specified          concentration The fraction of the  antibodies and          antigens that satisfied this standard for qualitative          measurement was plotted as a function of analyte          concentration Figure a Over  of the arrayed          antibodies and over  of the arrayed antigens met the          criteria at the highest analyte concentration tested           gml and  ngml respectively and both percentages          decreased with decreasing analyte concentration The          performance of the antigen microarrays was better than          that of the antibody microarrays over the entire          concentration range          Similarly we plotted the percentage of antibodies and          antigens that provided satisfactory quantitative accuracy          as a function of analyte concentration Figure b          Detection was considered quantitatively accurate if the          above criterion for qualitative accuracy was fulfilled          and the median RG ratio was within a factor of two of          the known concentration ratio Nearly half of the          antigens provided quantitatively accurate measurements at          concentrations above  ngml and the percentage          decreased with decreasing antibody concentration A          smaller fraction of the tested antibodies gave accurate          quantitation of soluble antigen See the web supplement            and Additional data files available with this          article for quantitative data on the entire          antibodyantigen set          We believe that the differences in the performance of          the antibody and antigen arrays are likely to be          explained by differences in dye labeling and protein          stability Antibodies of varying specificities all have          very similar overall structures and all antibodies          irrespective of specificity can be labeled with the          NHSactivated dyes at lysine residues in the Fc region          In contrast many antigen proteins do not have easily          accessible amines Inefficient highly variable or          nonexistent labeling may explain the  fewer          antigenantibody pairs that performed satisfactorily in          qualitative detection in the antibody microarray format          as compared to the antigen microarray format Antibodies          are also relatively stable proteins and their greater          stability in solution relative to their cognate          antigens may also contribute to the better performance          of the antigen arrays                          Background effects and detection limits          Because the background signal from nonspecific          adsorption of labeled protein increases with increasing          protein concentration the detection of a specific target          protein is limited not only by its concentration but          also by the concentration of the noncognate proteins in          the mixture We therefore investigated the effect of          protein background on quantitation by adding varying          concentrations of fetal calf serum FCS to the set of          six antigen mixes increasing the overall protein          concentrations by fold and fold before labeling          and detection Figure  The images at the top of Figure          show details from one array in each set The background          fluorescence was about tenfold higher at the higher          protein concentration The spots in the right image are          much less clear against the high background but the          fluorescent signals are still measurable Higher overall          protein concentrations significantly reduced the          precision of the measurements of specific proteins          presumably because of either the increased complexity of          the mixture or the higher background For example the          antiFlag spots showed good quantitation of Flagtagged          Bacterial Alkaline Phosphatase FlagBAP down to an          absolute concentration of  ngml and a partial          concentration of   when measured in solution at a          total protein concentration of  gml In a           gml protein solution the data were very noisy below          approximately  ngml FlagBAP Likewise antiSOD and          antiHCG showed increased dispersion and decreased          linearity when measured in a higher total protein          concentration Higher background at higher protein          concentrations is probably the major cause of the          diminished performance since at equivalent partial          concentrations the measurements were noisier at higher          absolute protein concentrations For example at a          partial concentration of    the measurements of SOD          were very noisy in the highserum samples but remained          closely correlated with the ideal response in the          lowerserum samples We conclude from this experiment          that antibody microarrays can allow detection of a          specific target protein at concentrations below  ngml          and partial concentrations below   At least for the          present however the total protein concentration in a          sample to be analyzed using this system should be less          than  mgml for optimal performance A reduction in          background through improved blocking of nonspecific          adsorption should further lower the detection limits          We also investigated the detection limits using the          antigen arrays Figure  The six antibody mixes were          added to either a fold or a fold excess by total          protein mass of FCS The highconcentration set was          diluted fold so that the total protein concentration          was equivalent in the two sets of protein mixtures The          images at the top of Figure show a detail of a          microarray from the analysis of each set The background          is very similar between the images but the fluorescence          intensity of the spots is greatly reduced as the partial          and absolute concentration of the cognate antibodies          decreases The graphs below the left image all show good          linearity down to  ngml and a    partial          concentration The graphs on the right of Figure show          similar performance at similar partial concentrations          but more noise at the lowest concentration where the          specific fluorescence signals were low The level of          performance depicted here is representative of about            of the antibodyantigen pairs tested We conclude          from this experiment that detection down to          concentrations of  ngml and partial concentrations of           is possible using antigen arrays Reduction of total          protein concentration below approximately  gml did          not improve the signaltonoise ratio                            Discussion        We have shown that a simple microarray assay using        comparative fluorescence allows simultaneous detection and        quantitation of multiple proteins in a miniaturized        lowsample consumption format Microarrays of antigens        allowed detection and quantitation of specific antibodies        down to partial concentrations of less than  and        absolute concentrations of  pgml Microarrays of        antibodies allowed detection and quantitation of cognate        antigens at concentrations as low as  ngml and partial        concentrations of   In comparison to other        highthroughput protein detection methods particularly        twodimensional gel electrophoresis the detection limit of        protein microarrays compares favorably Around  ng of any        protein is required for detection on a twodimensional gel          Several antibodies on the microarray had detection        limits around  ngml corresponding to an absolute        detection limit of only  pg of protein in the  l        probe volume        Our results suggest directions for further improvement        of the accuracy in quantitation such as the inclusion of        internal calibration proteins to control for variation in        fluorescent labeling and the adjustment of dye labeling        conditions to reduce the variation The detection limits        are likely to be improved by better passivation of the        array surface by using antibodies with higher affinities        and by reducing the complexity of the protein solution        through fractionation The antibodies we used in this        analysis were not optimized for affinity and specificity        Antibodies used in clinical diagnostic applications are        commonly selected for affinities orders of magnitude higher        than those of the researchgrade antibodies we used in this        pilot study The use of clinicalgrade highaffinity        antibodies in this format would presumably allow a        corresponding increase in sensitivity        Many of the tested antibodyantigen pairs allowed        parallel detection of proteins in a microarray format at        concentrations suitable for measurement of clinically        important proteins in patient samples For example        concentrations of  gml  gml and  gml are        routinely used as threshold prognostic values for the        breast cancer markers cerbB CEA and CA         respectively   The partial concentration of a protein        at  gml in the blood serum using an average total        protein concentration of  mgml is     within the        range of  of the antibodies tested and  of the        antigens tested The prostate cancer marker prostate        specific antigen PSA is clinically useful in the         ngml range   or a partial concentration of            The best antibodyantigen pairs tested had detection limits        in this range The prospects for clinical application of        antigen microarrays in monitoring antibody response to        immunization infection or other disorders are extremely        promising A natural immune response typically yields        specific IgG concentrations ranging from approximately         ngml   to over  gml   well within the        detection limits most of the antigens tested        In conclusion these experiments demonstrate that a        comparative fluorescence assay using microarrays of        antibodies and antigens can provide a practical approach to        specific quantitative and highly parallel detection of        proteins at physiologically relevant concentrations                    Materials and methods                  Preparation of arrays          Ninetyfour antibodyantigen pairs were provided by BD          Transduction Laboratories Cincinnati OH six pairs          were provided by Research Genetics Huntsville AL and           pairs were purchased from Sigma Chemical Antibodies          and antigens that were provided in glycerol solutions          were transferred to a glycerolfree phosphatebuffered          saline PBS solution  mM NaCl  mM KCl  mM Na                     HPO              mM KH            PO             pH  using a BioRad Biospin P          column Antibody and antigen solutions were prepared at           mgml in well plates using approximately           l per well A robotic arrayer spotted the protein          solutions in an ordered array onto polyLlysine coated          microscope slides at a  m spacing using  steel          tips The coated slides were prepared as previously          reported   or purchased from CEL Associates Houston          TX Briefly glass microscope slides were cleaned in           M NaOH for  h rinsed thoroughly in ultrapure H            O soaked for  hour in a           polyLlysine solution in PBS rinsed in ultrapure H            O spun dry and further dried for           h at C in a vacuum oven The resulting microarrays          were sealed in a slide box and stored at C The          location of the array of spots was delineated on the back          sides of the arrays with a diamond scribe the spots          disappear after washing The arrays were rinsed briefly          in a  nonfat milkPBS Tween solution to remove          unbound protein They were transferred immediately to a           nonfat

removed in three room          temperature PBS washes of  min each and the arrays          remained in the final wash until application of the probe          solution see below                          Preparation of protein solutions          Protein solutions and NHSester activated Cy and Cy          solutions Amersham PA and PA were prepared in          a  M pH  sodium carbonate buffer The protein and          dye solutions were mixed together so that the final          protein concentration was  mgml and the final dye          concentration was  M Normally approximately           g protein was labeled per array The reactions were          allowed to sit in the dark for  min and then quenched          by the addition of a tenth volume  M pH  Tris base a          fold molar excess of quencher The reaction          solutions were brought to  ml with PBS and then loaded          into microconcentrator spin columns Amicon Microcon           with a  Da molecular weight cutoff After          centrifugation to reduce the volume to approximately           l approximately  min a  nonfat milk blocking          solution was added to each Cylabeled solution such that           l milk was added for each array to be generated from          the mix The milk had been first spun down as above          The volume was again brought to  ml with PBS and the          sample again centrifuged to  l The Cylabeled          reference mix was divided equally among the Cylabeled          mixes and PBS was added to each to achieve  l for          each array Finally the mixes were filtered with a           m spin filter Millipore by centrifugation at            g for  min                          Detection          Each microarray was removed individually from the PBS          wash see above and excess liquid was shaken off          Without allowing the array to dry  l dyelabeled          protein solution was applied to the surface within the          marked boundaries A    mm cover slip was placed          over the solution The arrays were sealed in a chamber          with an underlayer of PBS to provide humidification          after which they sat at C for  h The arrays were          dunked briefly in PBS to remove the protein solution and          the cover slip and they were then allowed to rock gently          in PBS Tween solution for  min The arrays were          then washed twice in PBS for  min each and twice in H                     O for  min each All washes were          at room temperature After spinning to dryness in a          clinical centrifuge equipped with plate carriers          Beckman the arrays were scanned in an Axon          Laboratories Palo Alto CA scanner using  nm and           nm lasers                          Analysis          The relative concentration of each protein in two          separate dyelabeled pools was determined by comparing          the fluorescence intensities in the Cy and Cyspecific          channels at each spot The location of each analyte spot          on the array was outlined using the gridding software          GenePix Axon Laboratories Palo Alto CA and ScanAlyze            The background calculated as the median of pixel          intensities from the local area around each spot was          subtracted from the average pixel intensity within each          spot The backgroundsubtracted values in the red channel          were multiplied by a normalization factor to correct for          detection differences in the two channels The          normalization factor was found by comparing the redgreen          ratios of three to four wellbehaved antibodies or          antigens which served as internal standards to the          ratio of the known concentrations A factor was          calculated which when multiplied with the signal in the          red channel minimized the difference between the ideal          and observed redgreen ratios A separate normalization          factor was calculated for each array To normalize the          ratios for the antigens or antibodies that were used in          calculating the factor a separate factor was used in          which that particular antibody or antigen was dropped          from the calculation that is a spot was never used to          normalize itself Finally the ratios of the          backgroundsubtracted normalized signal intensities were          calculated to estimate the relative concentrations          between proteins in the separately labeled pools
