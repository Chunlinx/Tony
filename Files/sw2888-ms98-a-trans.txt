                okay   okay i guess were set   um   current events   i get my current events basically from news uh just because i watch pretty much a lot of television um   television news is it uh CNN or Headline News or just local news or what it   uh i watch a little bit of everything i like to tune into CNN to CNN because uh and you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on everything in about five or ten minutes i think news today um   right right   its kind of losing its importance like on in in on radio if you hear any news at all its like two seconds you know really quickly on regular stations   right well on commercial radio i guess i i tend to get more of my news from national public radio in the morning on the way to work evening on the way to school so   yeah thats good too uhhuh i like KRLD   so i dont uh i dont see much TV mostly when im in school but i do here   yeah where do you go to school   uh University of Texas at Dallas   oh okay i went to UT at Austin   so right   but uh im a news reporter so i  i should get all i can my news from the news from the TV   really   but um   i do tend to throw on Headline News when im doing things around the house and just let it play and listen but uh   yeah i usually dont intentionally although i should i dont intentionally turn on the television to watch news   right   or i dont intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news if it comes on i just happen to hear it now i will intentionally buy a newspaper to watch to to look at the news but other than   yeah all i ever get out of the paper is the Sunday paper so   yeah thats true   i read the comics thats about it yeah   thats about it the Sunday paper its so full of stuff but you pick your favorite section and the rest you throw away although you paid what almost two dollars now to get it but   right right i like to listen to uh national public radio on the way to work because its   yeah   i dont know its variety you know they throw in a little news and a little bit of other stuff it   umhum yeah   tends to get like Headline News if you listen to it for an hour when you   is it is it pretty good coverage on there i mean umhum   yeah it usually is and they throw in a lot of you know a lot of interviews and commentaries its kind of like getting a newspaper theres a lot of   yeah yeah   sections to it and they they present different sides of things   hum because i find like on KRLD i like to listen to that but each story is like no more than two or three lines you know so its   oh well they spend a little more time you know they cover the headlines and then they go into a lot of issues and things where they they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and interviewing people   yeah uhhuh yeah thatd probably be better especially when you listen to the like popular radio stations like mostly the music stations   and its   news is is pretty much nonexistent theyll have little little teeny weeny news breaks you know   yeah and only in the morning i guess theres a little bit   yeah yeah basically   i havent listened to a top forty radio station in so long i wouldnt know   yeah   so   so lets see um   and i guess i get some kinds of other of you know business related news through trade journals and things but   uhhuh   thats about it   the only reason i get trade journals is like if im looking for a job or something   right   which is what im doing now   yeah   but uh yeah  trying to get out of wherever they are   a lot of people are but uh   but uh i think i think news is im wondering where its going you know how i think it would be nonexistent pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper uh i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news and now its its kind of your final choice you watch first you go to CNN then you go to radio or something like that i think it   yeah well nobody wants to sit down and read   yeah yeah   its it takes a lot more time to read something and youve got news bombarding you from everywhere now you know you turn on the TV turn on the radio   yeah so much for my effort yeah yeah but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again   why is that   i dont well just because im im thinking that it its getting so short on radio just you you still you have two or three i know in Dallas you can probably get two two all news radio stations out of i dont how many popular radio stations and then on television you have just the news at six and ten   yeah i just   and i just i just see that dwindling in in   i find it hard to believe that peoplell go back to reading over television i mean just given the way society is and i enjoy reading but most people would rather turn on the tube and   true yeah true thats true too yeah   and and flip through the channels you know and get the headline news that thirty minutes of   than sit down and take the effort to read the paper   right and they dont have to go get one you know   one thing i like about the paper um as opposed to television is that uh when i like when i report because im in television i have to get the basic the main facts and thats it thats all you have time for whereas in the paper i like to read the articles because they get every side every single side and   right right   and every point they make you know and and its all there   right well thats why i like uh national public radio because when they get on one of these little they they give you headlines that are brief   uhhuh   just they touch on whats going on and then theyll get into something and really explore it   umhum umhum   and its its informative its a lot more informative than you know a quick half hour news show that   yeah yeah   they tell you what they want you to hear   yeah because thats what we do i mean its like each each story is thirty seconds   right   you know so its like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time so and itll probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by i think     yeah theres so much going on in the world communication you know spans the world now and   oh yeah   theres too much going on you cant afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there   i think that is one good thing one great thing about news and that we saw right during the war just now is that we got all the information within minutes you know whatever happened we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it   yeah and the question is how much of it or some how some of it i guess theres a lot of debate about censorship and and what were really seeing is it is it the true story or is it a little bit biased   yeah yeah umhum yeah because even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they could tell us so all we had to sit here and and ask is well what arent they telling us   right   you know so that that was pretty scary but we i talked to one woman and she said that she didnt want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia she wouldnt want to know you know that theyre bombing or or this and thats going on and at the same time i talked to another woman and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam and she didnt know what was happening at that time and she was so happy to get the information   right   you know so its just a lot of different opinions on that   i i you know i like to to know whats going on sometimes i think theres just a little bit too much   yeah   you know you get in the habit of like i say turn on Headline News and itll play over and over and you just tune it out because its the same thing but   yeah and then too a lot of times i think uh especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion its like   yeah they tend to dramatize things that are   you know like this Kennedy thing its just i mean everywhere you turn Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy you know what kind of shoes did he wear on the night and you know its just like okay this is ridiculous   yeah like who cares really   so   well   but what are you doing something on a computer oh i heard the little clicking   yeah trying to do some C programming   oh okay well it was nice talking to you okay take care byebye   okay take care umhum bye
