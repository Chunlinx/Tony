                                 Robert Reich Quote Doctor                           Locked in theCabinet  Robert Reichs new memoir of his years as labor secretary in theClinton administration is an engaging policy memoir insightful often wittyand whats most unusual for wonk kiss and tells easy to read partly becauseits told in long stretches of wellwritten dialogue that add up to scores ofnovelistic scenes of Washington at work The book reads like good fictionUnfortunately some of it is            Call me oldfashioned butIve always believed that there is something special about quotation marksWhatever is between them in nonfiction is supposed to reflect accuratelywords that some real person actually said Now accurately leaves room forquibbling and a memoir will be understood by most readers to be offered on anas remembered basis Reich says in his prefatory note that he jotted notesto himself usually late at night and then consolidated them to make thebook People know that Reich is not a reporter and will adjust theirexpectations accordingly Fair enough Maybe he has a good memory            Certainlyfrom a former Cabinet officer however one would expect if not wordforwordaccuracy at least some checking of his memory especially when publicdocuments are available Suspicions mount as Reich spins out page after page ofcrisp conversation especially when the same remark issues from two differentmouthsas happens on pages  and             Again and again Reich offers zippy dramatic dialoguesculminating in pithy and revealing quotes For instance he has Robert MichelRIll who was House minority leader at the time telling him this about NewtGingrich and friends They talk as if theyre interested in ideas in whatsgood for America But dont be fooled Theyre out to destroy Theyll try todestroy anything that gets in their way using whatever tactics are availableReich may believe Michel said this but Michel says he knows otherwise Thatsnot my quote no he says Michel says he probably complained about thedecline of comity and bipartisanship But I would never say thatthat theyreout to destroy Id never say anything like it            Reich says that on March  Democratic Rep Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota House Budget Committeechairman told him this about congressional Democrats Were owned by themBusiness Thats where the campaign money comes from now But Sabo says thathe could not have spoken with Reich on March  they did talk on March  andthat in any case he neither said nor believes that Democrats are owned bybusiness Reich certainly does not capture the substance of any conversation Iever had with him Sabo wrote to the Minneapolis Star Tribune  Reichalso reports a conversation in which he tells Rep David Obey DWis histheory about bluecollar hostility toward Clinton The vignette ends with Obeysaying Youre either a genius or youre nuts If I were you I wouldnt sharethat theory with anyone else Obey says through an aide that hes sure henever said that since he was talking up a similar theory himselfthough hesays the rest of the conversation seems accurate Former head of the AFLCIOLane Kirkland whom Reich portrays unsympathetically in several privatedialogues protested in a recent letter to Reich I did not in fact utterthe words that you attribute to me in various places in direct quotationmarks as though you were repeating my words verbatim            Askedabout these denials Reich said Our recollections differ And its certainlytrue that in Washington quotedenying is endemic But some of Reichsdialogues are checkable and turn out when checked to be inaccurate in waysthat serve Reichs rhetorical ends            At a  press conference just afterPresident Clinton and Reich have failed to settle the baseball strike Reichhas reporters asking the following questions Mr President why did youinvite the players and owners to the White House in the first placeIf you cant even get these parties to agree what hope do you have inBosnia Does this mark the nadir of this administrations influence Firstit was the minimum wage and now its baseball Why do you and your laborsecretary think Washington should be involved in every employment issue inAmerica            Those questions certainlyhelp Reich paint a picture of piranha journalists intent on humiliating theadministration But none of the questions nor any like them was ever askedThe reporters focus was on majorleague baseball not on Reich and Clintonand their tone was puzzled rather than angry            Here areall the real questions that the reporters asked Mr President youve met nowwith the players and the owners In your opinion who is more to blame for thisimpasse And why wont they simply accept voluntarily binding arbitrationMr President what gave rise to the optimism you felt during the course ofthe evening that a settlement might be possible How do you compare this MrPresident to say President Kennedy acting on steel prices and former uses ofthe office and the Oval Office for labor disputes There was a question aboutlegislation And most scathingly Mr President if the season begins withreplacement players would you throw out the first ball            Life unlike Reichs book is not a series of moralityfables On Feb   Reich testified on the minimum wage before the JointEconomic Committee That much his memoir gets right The Republican attackmachine is gearing up Reich writes and Im one of the targets Then hepaints a scene in which committee chairman Jim Saxton RNJ interruptsReichs initial testimony and lights into him savagely starting with Wheredid you learn economics  Mr Secretary and then jumping up and down inhis chair and crying Evidence Evidence  while pointing to a chartThere was a time not long ago when congressional hearings were designed toelicit information for members in order to help them draft legislationrecalls Reich ruefully Now theyre attack ads            When Ichecked the transcript I was flabbergasted so I checked the CSPAN tapes andthey leave no doubt Reich appears to have fabricated much of this episode fordramatic effect Saxton was in fact decorous and polite He did not jump upand down he did not impugn Reichs education he did not shout EvidenceEvidence The chart to which Reich refers was actually presented duringSaxtons opening statement hours before Reich testified and did not look asReich claims it did Worst of all most of the lines that Reich attributes toSaxtonstarting with where did you learn economics  MrSecretaryappear never to have been said at all Reich has replaced a dullearnestly wonkish hearing with a Hollywood script in which a mean Republicanhammers a decent Democrat Dont take my word for it I invite you to compareReichs account with reality by clicking             Or perhaps most striking of all consider aset piece in which Reich speaks to the National Association of ManufacturersHe describes himself as being ambushed by cigarchomping capitalists who hissat him so loudly that he has to yell to be heard They plan to carve me upinto small pieces he writes There isnt a lady in the room All men indark suits Theyve finished lunch Some are smoking cigars Others are quietlysmirking ready for the kill His speech over Reich is lambasted by a Johnand Reichs answer elicits an eruption of Wrong Bullshit and Go back toHarvard As Reich speaks the audience hisses so loudly that Im not sureanyone can hear me The cigar smoke he says is making my eyes water I feeldizzy He says Were in a boxing arena Johns the champ and the crowd isloving every minute Finally the meeting over he races out the back exitbefore they can pummel me            As ithappens the meeting was a breakfast not a lunch The NAM says the attendancelist shows that a third or more of the people present were women including theNAM representative with whom I spoke If anyone actually was inclined to lightup a cigar after breakfast he would have been breaking the NAMs nosmokingrule according to an association representative who like another witness Italked to saw no cigars Most important a transcript of the meeting shows arespectful Q and A session in which none of the comments attributed toJohnnor any like themwere actually made            One would hardly expect a roomful of corporate reps tohiss boo and shout bullshit at a sitting US labor secretary Sure enoughthe transcript shows nothing nastier than sprinkled applause and laughter Iasked Richard Boyd the professional court reporter who transcribed thesession whether his transcript might have omitted hisses boos andimprecations I never witnessed anything like that with Robert Reich oranybody else at a NAM meeting he said Im absolutely certain I wouldremember it Reich portrays himself as the little guy standing up to a roomfulof abusive capitalistspure Hollywood Again dont take my word for it click            I askedReich what was going on in each of these cases In reply he pointed to hisNote to the Reader I claim no higher truth than my own perceptions This ishow I lived it He said that his notes accurately reflected how he felt andwhat he perceived In the three cases cited above he felt varying degrees ofhostility I am not representing the book to be anything other than it iswhich is my account of my experiences my perceptions what I saw and heardaround me he said Thats all I can say            In effect Reich is saying that hes notwriting journalism or history Hes writing  well what He elides the verydistinction between history and myth memoir and novel reality and perceptionThe problem is that those are real people he misquotes real history herewrites            SteveWasserman a former Random House editor who now edits the Los Angeles TimesBook Review  points out an irony Books are often viewed as better sourcesfor history than newspapers but newspapers which are generally much morecareful than the average publishing house about such niceties as checkingquotes are often the more reliable source Reichs memoir if thats theproper word for it is now ensconced between hard covers and will be read foryears to come as part of the historical record That is a shame Quote me            Followingthe publication of this article Robert Reich asked for a chance to respondClick here to seewhat he has to say and here to read Rauchs
