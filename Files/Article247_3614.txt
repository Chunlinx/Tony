                                 In the World and of the World                        Dear Russ            Well OK OK so you liked Ross book            While I dont share your enthusiasm I agree that Rossand youmake animportant point Celebration is not a world apart It islike all real estatedevelopmentpart of local politics for example It exists in a place wherepeople have options where they want to live which is also why it is unfair toexpect Celebration to be all things to all people            You point out that Disney was uniquely burdened I think thats very wellput One of the parts of both books that most surprised me was the extent towhich the homebuyers themselves saw Celebration as a utopia  chiefly becauseDisney was involved On the other hand especially in the early days Disneyaggressively marketed the town as a solutiontojustabouteverything So itwas disingenuous of them to withdraw from the town at a later stage Anotheraspect of Disneys involvement that struck me was that while they were verygood at the architecturalscenographic aspects of creating Celebrationas onewould expect and it is a beautiful placewhen it came to education theyseemed out of their depth In hindsight this too was to be expected Whyshould an entertainment corporation understand anything about education TheCelebration school is the one part of the town it seems to me where Disneyslipped up and slipped up badly Both books tell that part of the storywell            The burdens that Disney carries also mean that it would have been almostimpossible for Celebration to be for example a social experiment Both booksbemoan the lack of affordable housing for example But almost no new privateresidential developments including New Urbanism have succeeded at mixingincomes to any considerable degree the exception are Hope VI projects whichdo achieve income mixing although they are still too new to draw categoricalconclusions from Could Disney really have done better in this area It is notan issue of moneythey could certainly afford itit is one of riskCorporations have money and a certain degree of powerat the same time theyare vulnerable to public opinion Look at what happened when the school failedAn article immediately appeared in the Wall Street Journal quotingdisgruntled parents More recently a crime in Celebration was prominentlyreported in the New York Times  Which raises an interesting point Doesthe occurrence of crime make Celebration a failureas the story impliedorprove that it is a real place after all            Witold
