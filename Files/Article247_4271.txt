                                 Reality Bites Value America                        Whatever the Internet will become one of the things its been in the lastcouple of years is a consumers paradise at least from a price perspective Intheir hunger to acquire new customers Net retailers have engaged in goodoldfashioned price wars and have more generally made Net shoppers soaccustomed to sizable discounts that paying anything close to retail feels likeyoure being robbed            The question of course has always been whether these retailers wereactually ever going to be able to make money when their business often seemedas venture capitalist Bill Gurley so smartly put it to be the equivalent ofgiving consumers who visited their sites a dollar in exchange for  cents Inthe past few weeks were starting to see signs that in fact a lot of theseInternet retailers are not only not going to be able to make money They maynot even be able to stay in business for much longer            The most telling such sign was the announcement yesterday by Value Americathat it was going to slash its work force by  percent slim down its productofferings leave five of the  buildings it now occupies and make meaningfulcuts in its ad spending Value America also announced that its revenue for thefourth quarter will fall  percent to  percent short of analysts estimatesand that it will lose significantly more than analysts had expected in thequarter            Value America has been this onestop shopping site where you could buyeverything from food to printers to appliances to computers Computers likethe one on which Im writing this column actually bought this summer for avery nice price It now plans to focus on selling computers and consumerelectronics which on the one hand is a natural strategy for targeting Webusers and on the other hand is a strategy that everyone else in America hasalready figured out and embraced So the idea that the new approach is going torescue the company seems rather dubious            Whats interesting about the Value America story though is that itrepresents an unusual intrusion of the things weve gotten used to aboutoffline business into the online world Up to this point with rare exceptionsbusiness on the Internet has seemed to exist in this fairytale realm where noone ever gets fired where expenses are irrelevant and where all losses aretolerated as simply necessary investments in the future By eliminating jobs cutting the number of suppliers it uses by  percent and admitting thatits running through its capital much faster than originally planned ValueAmerica is essentially demonstrating what we all knew but just werent surewhen it would come true Eventually you have to earn a profit or else youllgo under            Now there are limits to the value so to speak of Value America as acautionary tale In the first place the site was never that popular and evennow is only the th most popular Web shopping site More important ValueAmericas everythingincludingthekitchensink strategy was illconceivedespecially for a company that had no real brand name For Amazoncom to branchout from books into CDs and then videos and then consumer electronics means onething For Value America to start by offering everything is another Andfinally there are Net retailersAmazon most notablywho are not justrunning a business on hope smoke and mirrors who have thought seriouslyabout their cost structures and understand things like return on investedcapital That doesnt mean they will succeed but it means they have a muchbetter chance than most of the companies out there            Even so whats happening to Value America does have implications for theNet as a whole especially when so many Net retailers dumped tens of millionsof dollars into preChristmas advertising with by all accounts very littlepayoff relative to investment And perhaps the most important thing to thinkabout is that if Value America goes under it increasingly looks like it willdo just that go under and disappear In other words no one is going to comealong and acquire it because ultimately theres really nothing there toacquire The conventional wisdom has been that eventually wed seeconsolidation in Net retailing through mergers and acquisitions Its startingto seem more likely that well see consolidation through failure
