                                 Of Conspiracies and King            A bad liver killed JamesEarl Ray last month but not everyone believes it No sooner had Martin LutherKing Jrs assassin died than rumors began spreading that his death was part ofa government plot Not surprising For  years Ray had promoted the theorythat the civil rights leaders murder was part of a larger conspiracy            He wasntthe first to say so Right after Kings death his aidedecamp RalphAbernathy hinted at some vast unfathomed plot White supremacists claimedblack militants were responsible Before Ray was arrested a group called theKennedy Assassination Inquiry Committee claimed he was one of the three men ina famous photograph famous at least for Kennedy assassination buffs ofDallas Dealey Plaza where JFK was murdered            Despite multiple debunkings these fantasies endure Mostrecently a crackpot named William F Pepper has convinced Kings entire familythat the US government including President Lyndon Johnson             Why do welove conspiracy theories so much Many people refuse to accept James Earl Raysguilt or Lee Harvey Oswalds in JFKs assassination because they cant acceptthat one insignificant lowlife could topple a hero and alter history Moregenerally conspiracism as Middle East scholar Daniel Pipes calls itflourishes during turbulent timesrevolutions in particularwhenlongestablished orders seem imperiled by uncontrollable events endangeredpowers imagine secret plots to undermine them and the dispossessed worry aboutpersecution With their grand designs in which everything has its placeconspiracists seek to impose a reassuring order on the randomness of historyAs the late historian Richard Hofstadter noted in his famous essay TheParanoid Style in American Politics They regard a vast or giganticconspiracy as the motive force in historical events History is aconspiracy            The histories conspiracists concoct areconvolutedcounterhistories full of strange codes and logic through whichfactual history can be glimpsed as in a funhouse mirror Conspiracy theoristsadopt the trappings of scholarship touting irrelevant titles and credentialsThey burrow into the arcana of their topics and inundate potential acolyteswith a barrage of pedantic details Rather than build a case from evidenceconspiracists deny the available evidence maintaining that appearancesdeceive Rather than admit to inconvenient facts they dismiss them as liesmaking their own theories irrefutable King conspiracism             Modernconspiracism is almost a thousand years old Pipes in a book calledConspiracy How the Paranoid Style Flourishes and Where It Comes From pinpoints the Crusades of the  th centurythe wars waged byEuropes Christians on the Muslims who controlled Palestineas its first massoutbreak To legitimize their attacks Crusaders demonized their Muslimfoesnot hard to do since the Muslims had a competing empire and religion ofvast size and power But Europes Jews too had to be converted or killed Howto justify the eradication of a weak and numerically insignificant group TheCrusaders convinced themselves the Jews were a secret cabal with insidiouspowers out to destroy Christendom            Besides this antiSemitism Pipes identifies a secondrelated strain in Western conspiracist thought fear of secret societies Thisvariety focused on small groups other than Jews whose rituals seemedmysterious and whose beliefs seemed threatening to ChristianityMasonsprofessional stonecutterswere the earliest targets Since medievaltimes masons had devised confidential phrases and handshakes to recognizefellow craftsmen and protect their trade secrets from outsiders During theEnlightenment their guilds became clubs for discussing the new liberal ideasof deism and toleration and also came to include nonstonecutters as membersReligious authorities feared that within their lodges the Masons too wereplotting Christianitys doom            Pipescontends these two strains of conspiracism coexisted and intermingled over theyears giving rise to various fantasies of global schemes Typically thesefantasies have centered on such staples as the Bavarian Illuminati a Masonlikeorder founded in  the Rothschilds a Jewish banking family of the th century and later the Council on Foreign Relations a bunchof foreignpolicy wonks who meet on East  th Street            Though European in origin conspiracism hasthrived in the United States But where aristocratic Europe feared closeddoorcabals of powerful men democratic Americas suspicions focused on its owngovernment The American Revolution most scholars now agree was itself anoutgrowth of conspiracism The colonists rebelled because they imagined asystematic plot by the monarchy to deprive them of their liberties King GeorgeIII and his ministers were actually just blundering their way through thetricky business of running a transAtlantic empire but suspicious Americansviewed each restriction of their rightsthe Stamp Act the Tea Act and soonas part of a scheme to reduce them to slavery And so the Revolution            Democratization fostered more conspiracymongering By the s and s moststates were allowing all white men to vote before that they had to own landand President Andrew Jackson was leading his famous war on the national bankIn this climate popular hostility was trained against powerful privateinterests and gave new life to antiMasonry as a political movement Masoniclodges were often made up of leading figures in the community The AntiMasonParty was formally born in Rochester NY in  when a Mason who had quitthe organization was murdered and it became a robust third party in the elections Masonry came to be seen as Hofstadter put it as a standingconspiracy against republican government            So it has gone with conspiracism playing a role in crisisafter crisis The Civil War arose because Northerners feared that a smallSouthern Slave Power had seized control of Washington while Southerners wereconvinced the North was determined to destroy their way of life In the depthsof the Cold War many Americans suspected Communists had infiltrated Washingtonand were about to subvert our democracy Some of these folks are still writingfor Commentary today            Todaysconspiracism stems mainly from the instability of the late s and earlysa period of both uncontrolled violence assassinations urban riotspolitical protests turned bloody and antigovernment ideology the leftchallenged laws regulating speech sex and drug use the right fought busingthe Warren court and the welfare state            Social breakdown plus antistatism bredwidespread conspiracism as the King case shows King visited Memphis a weekbefore his assassination for a march in support of striking sanitation workersthere During the march a black gang called the Invaders began looting thecops

Huie ajournalist and Rays confessor when Huie claimed in a  Lookmagazine article that Kings wellplaced killers wanted to use Kings murderto trigger violent conflict between white and Negro citizens            Ofcourse there was a good reason to think the government had it in for Kingthegovernment did have it in for King FBI Director J Edgar Hoover loathedthe civil rights leader thought he was a Communist and waged a relentlesscampaign of surveillance and sabotage against him Author Taylor Branchrecounts a shocking episode in which the FBI tried to make King commit suicideas noted in this review of his book Hoover never contemplated murder but youdidnt have to be crazy to think powerful figures had it in for King            As the White House FBI and CIA became increasinglyinvolved in

peoplesoon stopped buying the explanation By the Nixon years the presidents menwere tapping the phones of prominent journalists such as the WashingtonPost s Joseph Kraft stashing envelopes full of

resignation and increasedvigilance by the press Congress and the courts covert government activitieswere if not eradicated at least no longer the rule Hatred of the governmentgave way to a jaded contempt Outrage settled into anomie It was no longernews that the state might resort to such activities The seeds of paranoia thatwere planted in the hothouse of the late s and early s germinated and inthe cynical offhand conspiracism of the s we reap their fruit
