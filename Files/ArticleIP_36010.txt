                                 The Road to Beverly Hills            Monday Oct  HolidayInn Express OFallon Ill outside St Louis            As far as I can tell there have been threebrilliant dietfood innovations over the last  years The first was fatfreeEntenmanns I was skeptical of this product until the Gulf War of  Duringthe congressional deliberations on whether to approve the use of force to driveIraq from Kuwait House Speaker Tom Foley delivered a rousing call forbipartisan patriotism I covered the speech and was struck by how thoughtfulFoley was what a skilled orator he was and quite frankly how thin hedbecome over the past few months After the speech I went grocery shopping atthe Georgetown Safeway and as luck would have it spotted the speaker pickingup some provisions himself I went over to him and under the guise ofcongratulating him on his moving speech attempted to check out what he had inhis cart It was filled with boxes of fatfree Entenmanns I mean his cartwas a virtual Entenmanns mountain I became a believer            The second great dietetic discovery was Baked LaysPotato Chips Oprah has already discoursed at length on this delectable treatso there is no need for me to elaborate here            Yesterday on the first day of our journey to LosAngeles I discovered the third major innovation We were just outside ofHagerstown Md when we chanced upon a strangelooking McDonalds It waspacked with the usual pimply highschoolers but it was tiny and carried abunch of McProducts we hadn t seen before One stood out from the rest TheMcSalad Shaker The McSalad Shaker comes in a slurpeestyle cup with a domedlid You add the dressing I chose a lowfat calorie concoction then shakevigorously            The McSalad Shaker solves two previouslyintractable problems of salad consumption The first is the unequaldistribution of dressing The second is the tendency of lazy restaurateurs tochop salad into large unwieldy pieces making it impossible to eat withoutviolating the etiquette rule against eating vegetables with a knife TheMcSalads are diced into tiny pieces barely discernible to the human eye Youcan spoon them into your mouth as if you were eating a hotfudge sundae Likefatfree Entenmanns and Baked Lays this product fools your brain intothinking you are consuming some obesityinducing treat But unlike those otherinnovations the McSalad is actually nutritionally sound Indeed it providessomething that is desperately missing from most American diets            There is a slight problem with the McSaladsloganDress em Shake em Enjoy emwhich sounds vaguely lewd And alsobecause the product fits into an automobile cupholder there are potentialliability concerns McDonalds recently issued a press release that readsWARNING WARNING WARNING Salad consumption requires a fork and hence twohands so do not partake of this product while driving a motor vehicle oroperating heavy machinery  a disclaimer that rivals Do not take yourtoaster oven into the shower with you            Sadly as we have discovered during a longMcSaladfree trek across Kentucky the McSalad Shaker is available only at experimental outlets American politicians should stop focusing on transformingthe entire health care system and pass legislation requiring that the McSaladShaker be extended to all McDonalds outlets Full coverage The country wouldend up saving so much on the health care of otherwise obese Americans thatsolvency of Social Security could be ensured into the next millennium            Besides not being able to find another McSaladshaker there are two things Im scared of on this trip sex and deathRegarding the latter Bob tells me that in his experience every time youdrive across the country there is one moment when you almost die Youll havebeen driving for  straight hours across North Dakota when suddenly the windblows a huge metal road sign into your lane Or a row of trucks barreling at miles an hour wont let you merge into their lane Ive been certain that thismoment of doom has already occurred several times but Bob assures me itsstill to come            Regarding sex I think Im safe at least throughthe Eastern Seaboard and the Appalachians            On the radio they are still talking about theBrooklyn Museums controversial art exhibit Giuliani is clearly wrong intrying to stop the exhibit but how many people defending the museum right nowwould be trying to shut it down if the art was offensive in other even lessacceptable ways If it were racist for example What if there was a bigpicture of say the Jews killing Christ That would cause a sensation MrSaatchi            Regarding my traveling companion Bob forbade mefrom talking about his germ phobia although it was kind of hard to understandwhat he was saying through that surgical mask he was wearing Just jokingBut just between you and me its really bad He thinks the water is socontaminated he won t take ice cubes in his drinks He calls them deathcubes And we cant have the coffee that comes with our complimentarycontinental breakfast because they might have drawn the water first thing inthe morning without letting the taps run for the two minutes required to flushthe lead out of the pipes Even if they said theyd done it Bob sayswould you believe them            Pray for me
