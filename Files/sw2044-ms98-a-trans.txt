        i guess were um uh were were experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter uh  weve had a lot more warm weather than usual and we havent had any ice storms uh usually we have at least one um course ive only lived here three years but uh but that in still in that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm   my husbands been in Dallas during an ice storm he said that he pulled up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped just slid to the side of the curb that theyre that bad Lubbock   yeah yeah yeah   we get ice storms but not not quite to that extent its not the thin sheet you know all across the road ours if it ices over its thick its with snow its something that you can drive on you can get a little traction with   yeah yeah   uh i think weve been fortunate that weve missed any of the real bad weather this year because we went to California instead  but right now   oh   um were having unusually warm weather its its almost like theyre trying its trying to skip spring and go straight to summer its either   yeah   uh thirty degrees you know one day and ninety the next and and were missing the fifties and sixties in there somewhere   right thats right its its the same way here how long have you lived in Lubbock   well i have been here permanently or full time since nineteen eighty and uh   uhhuh   pretty much off and on since seventy four so really quite a while and ive watched the weather shift you know i can remember being here back in the seventies in college and the spring dust storms were   wow yeah   uh they were massive i mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see buildings across the street   dust storms whoa  yeah   that dust yeah  not fun to be in but i havent seen any like that in probably five or ten years   huh   so its its changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but i guess i can live with it   well i know when we first moved here it was uh it was at the very beginning of the year nineteen eighty seven   umhum   and uh we when we left we moved from New Hampshire where it was snowing   umhum   and we got here and we just couldnt believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like Eskimos and uh and then soon after we had this big ice storm uh where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather   thats true   and uh we were feeling very cocky because course we always in New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather but um         uh and i just i just assumed that was the way it was you know you didnt get snow which was nice because you didnt have to shovel it and but you always you could expect to have this ice storm and i think there was in the three years weve been here theres been one other ice storm um you the second year we had an ice storm and i was really surprised that uh that we didnt have anything like that this year   well now does Dallas get snow or is it usually just the ice storm   it it uh well it if you get any snow its barely enough to hide the brown grass   okay   you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about um   well that was one reason why i figured that i could stand Lubbock Texas that was about as much winter as i could get because i grew up west coast sunshine green leaves on trees     yeah   came back here and could not realize why id been so depressed through the winter   yeah   and realized that that was the first time in my life i had seen trees lose their leaves and uh and course when spring and everything came out again   oh   uh it was beautiful but thats about as much winter as i can take i mean it gets cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets you know fifteen twenty degrees below because of the wind   sure   right yeah   but its not six feet of snow and it doesnt stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming   right well thats the thing uh with us too its uh just we just you know in up in New England you had more winter than you had a summer summer and uh you could expect a long winter period uh for instance um   umhum   we could you could uh in New England it would still be cold i mean ice cold snow kind of weather uh now in March it just in March is is just when things start uh approaching the fifty degree mark and course weve already had eighty degree weather here and day day before yesterday it got up to eighty eight i think   yeah well now when did winter start there you said you had more winter than summer   oh winter would start oh yeah winter would start uh in September it would start getting cold in September   now was there actually snow on the ground all that that time from September through what March   there could be yeah there could be and and it came i mean i used to i used to work in Boston which was an hour and a half away   oh goodness uhhuh   and i would get up at five oclock in the morning just to shovel out driveway   oh   and thats so i could leave by seven       and uh so i would sometimes take me you know an hour or two to shovel the driveway in the morning and then id sitting in that car for an hour an a half and and well it was actually if the if the weather was bad enough to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work   oh my goodness   so and so now it takes me ten minutes   well now was that expected though i mean employers expected people to not necessarily be there on time due to the delays or   oh yeah   uh well they not they didnt expect you to be on time but they did expect you to be there and you the schools well you know they also did a very good job of of shoveling the the streets   yeah   they had the snow plows and the salt trucks and and uh they just you know they were equipped for it whereas here if you have a bad snow nobodys prepared to do anything about it you know the   everything stops yeah   right right you know you you youd you get the first you know the first first ice uh storm and the place closes up   well now do you work at TI   yes uhhuh   i was gonna say thereve been several times when i know they had ice storms down in Dallas uh that we would be up here trying to call and it wed figure out after about the first hour that there aint nobody at work   yeah theres nobody there yeah yeah i that happens a lot i i just live ten minutes away and i dont work i dont work in the at the Dallas site i work at the Spring Creek site which is which is in Plano   oh okay   and uh and so i usually i can usually make it i n its just a hop jump and a uh whatever the expression is im im real close  right  um but uh yeah id id hate to have to get it go to Dallas drive into Dallas when the weathers like that   hop skip and a jump there you go well thats good well are you uh do you prefer the kind of weather that youre getting in Dallas over your years in New Hampshire or do you miss the winters or   oh yeah oh yeah well its like i keep telling people you dont have to shovel sunshine you know its uh its uh       its just great i mean were really spoiled i mean theres a lot of things we miss about New England you know uh uh where theres no trees to speak of and the big you know thick trees we used to have in New England and we used to enjoy it we had a we had two acres of land attached to our house course we only had a thousand sq uare foot house but we had two acres of land and um   oh my goodness   and so we that now we have this we have a house thats three times as big but we have less than a quarter acre lot you know and uh and uh   sure once youre out of the house youre in the street   thats right and uh so we kind of its its weve gone from one extreme to the other and thats thats been hard to adjust to but uh the weather we cant oh the weathers been wonderful   thats good i did go up to New England one time during their fall season when the weather was just   oh yeah yeah   you know it was kind of a a brisk feeling outside but it wasnt freezing the leaves were turning and now that part of a winter up there i could truly love but uh   yeah yeah oh i can remember uh walking around you know taking a lunch break uh you know when the airs real brisk and the the colors on the trees are just so vivid um oh it was just that thats something i miss i i keep im  i get homesick thinking about it you know   uhoh well what about your summers in Dallas now is that similar was it humid up in the New England states like it is down there   oh yeah humid very humid in New England i mean you got hundred degree weather i mean in in in like in the Boston area i Bostons right on the water   yeah   and uh youd have these hundred degree days where the humidity was just one hundred percent and it was stifling uh here you in in Dallas in the Dallas area the humidity you get some humid days but its not nearly as bad you get you get a lot of dry days too   well so thats really no big tell i tell you what thats funny to hear you talk about that because for me to come to Dallas in the summer is stifling humidity to me because Lubbock is so dry uh you know it may be a hundred and a hundred and five or whatever up here but there is no humidity and its   is it  is it okay yeah okay   you know if theres a breeze blowing its a nice comfortable day and you dont feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humiditys so great you know youre sweating to death again   oh   yeah yeah everythings relative i guess yeah because i grew up on the east coast   yeah oh   and uh im originally from Virginia and uh and my memories of summer have always been that stifling humidity   yeah   and compared to the humidity here you know in fact uh whenever i think about moving you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling summers which which i dont experience here
