          okay   well what what do you think is the uh the main change in uh what what generation are you im im thirty years old   im twenty nine   youre twenty nine okay so were were were both uh children of the very early sixties   right and i have i mean ive seen some change like i know um when i was young most mothers pretty much were housewives and stayed at home with the kids and to me it seems like   umhum umhum   its almost the opposite now where the the woman is working and and they you know take the children to child care or maybe they work parttime or something   umhum umhum umhum umhum   so that seems to be a pretty big change   yeah the family structure in general is being really restructured from one income to two incomes which means from one parent to two parttime parents if youre lucky  um   umhum yeah right   i uh its its funny because both of us both of us then were really just adolescents when when i think most of the major changes for adult women were going on   uhhuh   in America i dont think changes are are still progressing but it seems to me that the uh really the seventies the early seventies was a period of the most change and if i had to be somewhat abstract about it it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice   umhum umhum oh thats true thats true   uh i mean thats sort of the overall the meta the meta change as it were uh where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do   umhum umhum   um of course they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your you know you can choose something you really want which is a wonderful thing but it does seem like an awful lot of my uh   umhum   my adult women friends are anguishing over over some of these choices um   right well i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children and you   umhum   you want to be with the children yet theres so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think oh but if we both work we can get a really big house and we can get two really nice cars we can take a vacation we can do this and   yes yes yes   and its kind of almost expected of you anyway people kind of look down on on a you know the role of a woman as a housewife its kind of like oh well you know she didnt go to college and shes just a housewife and thats all she does right   right she just settled for that yeah   right even though theres probably women with MBAs maybe even PhDs that are staying at home with the children um   well i only know i have my friends who have had children uh i only know one woman whos decided to go the quote unquote traditional route and i have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice   umhum umhum   she really knew that she didnt have to do that but she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life and she wanted that role shes a shes a marvelous parent and   umhum   and i you know i say all power to her because shes an example to me of someone who really does have the choice i feel that a lot of uh women dont well i i said they have the choice but they dont necessarily feel that they do because they no longer  feel like if they were to just be a parent   umhum   rather than uh you know the sort of super woman success in the business world as well they would somehow be perceived as a failure in their own eyes or in others and and then you see then its not a choice anymore   umhum right umhum   um and and frankly its the way that men are um men dont have this choice you know they dont feel this choice um uh   umhum   in most subcultures in America that that ive been exposed to if the man were to say uh no ive decided not to work i want to stay home and do the child rearing my wife has a good job and i want her to keep that   uhhuh   and im going to im going to be the primary caretaker and you know and then then take care of the children because we dont want to put them in day care and this and that i think most Americans would feel funny about that and maybe sort of feel like he isnt that success that he could have been   yeah right   so its um   theres some TV show on now and i i i think ive seen it once i dont get to watch much TV but uh   umhum   theres a TV show where the man is the one raising the kids and the wife is and i maybe they based it on that Mister Mom movie but uh   umhum i didnt i didnt see that   but uh there there is a TV show out there i guess theyre trying to gain you know more public acceptance of things like that because i know there are cases where that happens and   oh yeah ive i knew people who did it years ago but they they were very apologetic about it because you could tell they were used to people kind of going what are you doing that for you know   uhhuh yeah right its probably getting more and more accepted today in fact it seems like its kind of almost like anything goes now you youre not too surprised on much of anything when you know the husbands the one at home raising the children the mother works thats not real surprising and   yeah yeah ive seen more and more companies that have um parental leave not just maternity leave they can grant paternity leave as well as maternity leave   right yeah in fact im pretty sure TI has something like that because uh one of the area supervisors uh in my area as a matter of fact took off um       for a couple of weeks when his wife had their baby now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby instead of having you know a a nurse or someone come in or whatever midwife or whatever you call it that they have for the first couple of weeks but   umhum yeah umhum umhum yeah   but i dont know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity he put paternity leave up there but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while i dont know   umhum umhum umhum   but im not real sure how that goes   yeah the other big change i see in in in womans lives is um   to remain biological they uh women are because they have choice are having children much later in life   yeah   uh i mean my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty   umhum   and uh if id been a couple of generations ago they would have had kids running around by then   right well people they in general are just getting married a lot later im still single so im sure ill be one of those parents thats you know one of those women in her thirties when when i get around to to ever getting married and then having kids so   yeah yeah   thats uh i think i think thats getting a little more common too   yeah i actually think i im im somewhat encouraged by that trend because after all people live long er lives now so its not like you can you know its not like youre going to uh you know pass away before your child is an adult i mean barring unforseen you know unforeseen circumstances   umhum right   and i think most people make better parents when theyre a little bit more mature i really do   yeah i agree i agree i think it also gives a woman a chance to if she does have a job a nd a career it gives the man and the wife both a chance to both be working and maybe save up some money and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while theyre young   umhum   and be a mother for awhile and then once theyve gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work so shes kind of got that option if if they wait till later theyve saved up some money that its not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income or something   yeah yeah yeah thats true so i guess i oh im pretty encouraged  i really am but then im a product of my generation i dont know i if id been born a hundred years ago and were looking at this time i might not like it but it sure seems nice to me   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   uh i mean i have other things to complain about but in terms of uh womans roles um things really seem a lot more flexible   umhum i seem to see more women in uh in leadership type roles and management positions in politics and   yeah i mean its still still admittedly a a a small minority but but its an improvement it really is   yeah like the Mayor of Dallas is a woman and im sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened but yeah shes i think shes in her second term now so   oh really uhhuh   shes shes yeah this is her second term i think shes going to going to uh not going to run again after this but   uhhuh   but uh we do and we have several council women that are women but you just start hearing more and more in fact oh the the Governor of Texas is a woman too  cant forget that one so Ann Richards   yeah oh what whats her name no it we dont get much Texas politics out in California to be honest   she used yeah she was inaugurated in January so   uhhuh   so youre starting to see more of that and i know when i was younger it was all the President and still all the President are men but im sure one of these days we will well look at Ferraro ran for Vice President and i guess one of these days well well eventually have   thats right although during during during the uh Presidential debates there was some really nasty patronizing   uhhuh   stuff toward i mean i dont know if if you saw those but i thought she was treated badly at for being a woman frankly i really did by by uh   umhum   the then vice presidential candidates uh who really sort of i thought had a very demeaning attitude towards her   uhhuh yeah   and  it was sort of it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldnt say back that kind of thing which i i i i found myself getting really quite enraged about   uhhuh umhum   but really thats a previous generation i dont like its harder to imagine people of our age doing that and not feeling really stupid   uhhuh right right i agree well i think weve weve gotten our five five minutes or six or seven or whatever so   well theyve gotten their five minutes worth of us ive enjoyed talking with you   it was nice talking to you too   okay take care byebye   you too byebye
