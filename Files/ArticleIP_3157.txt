                                 Moody Blues            The decline of the big bandwas belabored and cartoonish it kept coming back long after it seemed to havedrawn its last breath World War II is what really did it in since the gas andrubber shortages prevented large groups from going on the road But once thebig band no longer played dance music it morphed into some strange decadentformsStan Kentons small municipalities with five trombones for instance orintellectual ensembles like Boyd Raeburns that magnified bebops hustledrhythms and tricky harmonies            Onetradition that survived in altered form was that of the mood arranger who wentfrom scoring music for big bands to orchestrating tone poems for individualjazz artists That role was honed to perfection by Gil Evans in hiscollaborations with trumpetplayer Miles Davis between  and anoftenmisunderstood body of work chronicled in a sixCD box set called MilesDavis and Gil Evans The Complete Columbia Recordings  released this monthDeluxe semiclassical and exotic a hydroponic creature of the recordingstudio this music cant be understood simply as jazz Its a lot morecomplicated than that            Gil Evans got his start in the early s arranging for aband in Stockton Calif which later made theme and incidental music for BobHopes radio show He could have gone the way of Henry Mancini a dancebandjazz pianist who realized that there would always be more money in HollywoodBut instead he walked the tightrope between commercial and art music Hiskeenest influence was another composer Claude Thornhill who hired Evans to doextra arrangements for his band The music from that period was slow andhaunting moving like someone trying not to sweat on a boiling day It had novibrato and a lot of French horn which would be combined with clarinets ortubas in odd hothouseflower voicings            Davis onthe other hand had been through smallgroup bebop in the s and found ittoo intense and inward as he noted in his autobiography he was struggling tofind a way to make bop sound sweet When he convened a nonet with Evans andGerry Mulligans help in  and recorded the music which would later bereleased as Birth of the Cool  he was blending bebop with a reducedvision of Claude Thornhills instrumentation This new sound prefigured whiteCalifornia cool jazz but so had Billy Strayhorns arrangements for DukeEllington through the s and so had Lester Youngs diaphanous tenorsaxophone playing with Count Basie even earlier Davis always insisted thatcool jazz was as much if not more AfricanAmerican as white musiclikewise he never had any problem understanding that jazz was a form ofpop                           T he duality of high art and mass sensibility is at the heart ofMiles Davis and Gil Evans  The three records at the core of theset Miles Ahead  Porgy and Bess  and Sketches ofSpain are music of fantasy of dreaming The drums usually so central tojazz are for the most part rendered useless by the intricately accented horncharts within the piece ensemble sound The orchestra gathers around thesoloist rather than the soloist trying to ride the waves of the orchestra andevery move is keyed to Davis sighing sensibility But the most impressivemoments oddly enough are Davis tremulous theme readings laid down as meresuggestions like soft wet clay            Evansarrangements were plotted like wily preparations for a siege In the first measures of The Meaningof the Blues from Miles                Ahead  the contents of a risingcounterpoint behind Davis melody keep mutating French horn and trumpet giveway to oboe which slides back into trumpets and the progression into thefourth measure with nothing but the treble of muted trumpets in unison feelslike an airplane taking off Its power as an organic whole is no accidentMiles Ahead was recorded in bits and pieces and The Meaning of theBlues was the only full unspliced ensemble performance on the albumBess You Is My WomanNow from Porgy  has a brushed drum pattern underneath that keepsshifting its emphasis from the first and third beats to the second and fourthconstantly renewing a stirring chill Sketches sets up processionalrhythms and rich slowmotion harmonies behind Davis and then slyly extendstrickles of harp or flute from the rest of the mass It is music of painstakingcare and the box set with its alternate takes including  different takesand portions of Springsville from Ahead  gives you an idea of howDavis managed to protect an inchoate subconscious quality in his trumpetplaying session after session            The records were received as instant masterpieces inbreathless appreciations that couldnt begin to take in the complex way thatMiles and Gil had at once gone more commercial than Benny Goodman and yetcreated some of the most deeply vulnerable American music around But theydidnt transform jazz Few musicians followed Evans lead though fragments ofhis sound wash up here and there His timbral combinations and unlikelyharmonies surface in the work of avantgarde jazz composers Butch Morris andFranz Koglmann as well as that of Maria Schneider a composer and band leaderwho was Evans assistant for three years before his death in  But sinceits mainly jazz educators and historians who grasp the significance of Evansyou hear his music most often being played by repertory bands One of the mostfamous pieces of music ever to have emerged out of Sketches of Spainisnt jazz at all Its Jefferson Airplanes White Rabbit with its flamencorhythm and cavernous studio sound            Itspuzzling how midcult how kitschy some of this music sounds today A quickcheck into the sounds of its era reveals what the sets  pages of linernotes dontthat  the year Sketches of Spain was recorded wasalso the year The Soul of Spain by the mood orchestra  Strings hitthe Top  Livingroom exoticism was in Nearly every major label at the timehad its own Spanish mood act MGMs was Jose Greco ABCParamounts wasMontoya with his fiery Spanish gypsy guitars countless LPs promisedgenuine bullfight music Sketches  which some have taken as the highpoint of Evans and Davis collaboration was also another chapter in amassmarket gambit                           T here are several differences between the  Strings album andSketches of Spain  Solos have no place in true mood music theyre toounsettling and risky And Evans and Davis calculated rhythmic displacement isa major jazz metaphor one that more commercial composers would never try toattain On the other hand the music on Miles and Gil is more aboutsustaining a moodand less about forward motionthan most of what wed calljazz            The real point of moodmusicalbums though is to let them work on you Phil Schaap the reissue producerand editor for Miles Davis and Gil Evans  has made a fitting gesturetoward that end He has provided a second pause track on each CD so thatyou can reflect on what youve just heard He writes that its the first timehes added such a track Music that conjures up a sense of suspended time and astill suburban afterglow seems a perfect occasion for its debut
