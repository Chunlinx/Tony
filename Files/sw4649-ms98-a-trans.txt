        um       ive had uh three boys through i guess uh some child care each one of them and now theyre in school so its all over but uh i guess i would say its not easy to find what what most parents would want   well i can profit by this because im due with my first in about three months   is that right         i guess uh the um the only rule i can think of is that uh i like to find look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that if theyre associated with a college or a university theyre usually pretty good bet   no   um i think its sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy car or refrigerator something youd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care   i guess not usually i suppose youre absolutely right there umhum   i yeah for profit places i would really look at them awfully carefully but uh when i was when my kids were young i was teaching at a university and uh the child care center associated with our university was quite good so i felt confident that they would do the right thing   umhum of arent dont they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their personal for their pet theories or some such thing   oh you mean uh learning type uh  yeah i mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission but yeah i suppose um   yes   if youre if theres a psychology department or an education department around you might find that theyre pushing one form of education or another i guess thats true but uh i never had a bad experience in that respect  of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents and theyre you know pretty good people   um well the thing i really worry about is um the sexual abuse cases you read about   umhum   and i mean you just feel awful if something like that happened   i yeah i never really worry very much about it i tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public so i never really worried too much about that being uh   umhum   uh the case with my boys   oh   um i you know i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but i dont think its as common as uh the newspapers would make you believe   umhum umhum and another thing is cost     oh yeah i mean     i mean i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now and they finding some cases theyre finding that its just not worth it to work because its all going out in day care   that   right   hm   well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were um in school and im really happy we did it although it was very very difficult and i think it was the right thing to do when we were um   hm   we just decided that we would do it and we went ahead  but um not everybody can make that choice and even even though my wife wasnt working we did have um one or another of the boys in uh child care for part time just for part of the day um or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on so   hm   so we did look around i think my wife       is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for  whether its a loving and caring place or not and uh so i would always trust her judgment on that   hm hm well im just thanking heaven my husband just got a new job his last company he was only working four days a week so its and he just got a new job hes getting lots of overtime he got a pay raise   uhhuh   and so im just grateful that we dont have to worry so much about my working or not   theres absolutely no question that youre gonna be the best  child care provider for that kid so  yeah do it as long as you can   i suppose   but i think you know you you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for um how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you uh commit your child to them and i think   umhum umhum   you have the main thing is that you have to determine that theyre perfectly open that youre welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth and if theyre at all queasy about that then   you have to start wondering if they dont want yes   id look elsewhere yeah right     hm   you have other friends that have kids uh being taken care of in uh child care   um i have one but i havent really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while   umhum so but i really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems i think the problems are more ones of   umhum   cost and resources and um pay and exhaustion and  human things like that rather than these um uh       really wild wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy   this is true   yeah   Current Affair can get  several shows with those cases   yeah right uhhuh well
