              okay there we go so do you play golf at all   okay great yeah i do im a player i im kind of embarrassed im talking to a man cause im sure that you are you play a lot more than i do oh really   actually i dont no uh i uh when i was younger i played a little bit and i was horrible  so i just stopped playing   oh well my husband is is a very good golfer hes got like a six handicap   wow that is real good   so um and hes been playing since we weve been married for twenty two years so i had to start playing because he was you know such an avid golfer so ive been playing now well i have had clubs for for twenty years you know but but i really enjoy it so i i had to check that you know and and uh and uh talk about it well have you played recently   wow so youve been playing no actually i dont even know if i checked that or not to be perfectly honest um  it seems to have been a mistake i dont know um   oh oh thats okay   yeah i havent played in a long time um when i was uh about five or six years ago my dad who plays every now and then took me out with him and and i basically um i had a horrible slice or hook i forget which one it was it wound up tossing the ball into the trees virtually every time   yeah yeah yeah the slice goes to the right and the hook goes to the left i think   yes i was slicing actually and as it turns out uh i went and took some lessons for a while because i just i would lose so many balls and it uh make it a horrible time for everybody i went and took some lessons and i got a little bit better but i still but then i sort of   yeah yeah yeah   you know time you know went went back to school and didnt have time and this and that and and the only thing i do now is i occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what i can do and i   yeah i think thats really a good thing to do so where are you in your life i mean are you in school oh okay at the University of Rochester oh great   and i still have this slice im a graduate student yeah yes as a matter of fact um so i dont have time to do much else except for graduate work   yeah yeah   so i so i hang around this way and uh occasionally uh uh a bunch of us i have some friends who are pretty avid golfers golfers so well go out and well uh well well play you know um   sure uhhuh and you dont have the time you dont have the length of the playing time that we do   no i have i have very little at the moment i have very little playing time when i when i go on vacation my father and i uh play a little bit but i dont you know we play a par a par three nine hole course is because   yes oh thats my favorite kind to play because uh for a woman its really nice to play a   yeah my   a par three course because thats my i cant hit a driver very far and in fact i dont even like to use a driver i use a three iron off the tee because i have more control over it   yeah um uhhuh   and i can i can just have better contact with the ball that way so im still using a three iron and my husband trying to get me into using a you know like a high number wood instead     right but those are uh still not your favorite huh   no its not my favorite but i i uh i enjoy i i really do i think im going to like golf the the older i get and the more time i have to play i we have three teenage daughters one     oh wow so so you must be very busy   one is uh yeah yeah im very busy i have a part time job and and during the year i dont play much golf but im when im were on vacation i love to play just like you said   um   and uh we got to play in Monterrey in California uh right you know along the Pacific Ocean this past spring and that was i told my husband that was the way to play you know that was  i would if i could play there every time i want it was it was great         really a a neat experience   miniature golf theres my game uh miniature golf there you go putt putt   miniature golf is great yes  well thats the thing my kids like to do that with you know on dates and stuff but golf is um we we we probably are talking about golf because i did check it you know     uh i dont i dont i dont know i may have actually i may have just checked random things i dont i dont recall anymore   well yeah if you ever played i mean i feel like anybody thats ever played golf can talk about it and maybe if you can even talk about it if youve if youve um watched it on TV   right yeah we actually we have a very very um we had the uh   yeah tell me about your clubs up there what   well we had i havent played around here too much we have a very good one called Locust Hill though there uh the L yes the LPGA comes here every year the Rochester International and then we had a PGA actually a very big PGA uh tour stop here last year   Locust Hill uhhuh right oh great   and it actually um they say the the i havent played the course but they say the course is very is is is pretty tough pretty challenging   uhhuh   and its um not only that but its exceedingly well kept apparently because   oh yeah   those those are the comments i kept hearing from the pros you know they kept saying you know we we hear  you know on on television so granted that it is biased but they keep saying its just wonderful uh the course is so well maintained and you know it it it rained through half the um   uhhuh   tournament so people had to finish it down and stuff but they still the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about getting things back up again and this actually when when the um   oh yeah   when the LPGA came here i guess that was about a week and a half ago it was just it it takes over the whole town you know its all over the news and lots and lots of people take off work   uhhuh oh sure yes yeah to go and watch them yeah   to go to go and watch the the uh the ladies play so i mean i think its actually wonderful to see   the ladies yeah im sure the people love golf up there like they do down here i mean people are just crazy golf is just its just the coming thing i mean a lot of people are just crazy about it   yeah it seems to be it seems that a lot of people are really you know either um either you havent played it   yeah   or or you youve played it and you sort of stink like me and you sort of play every now and then or you   well its its just such a difficult thing i mean its i just i watch my husband and hes he was a professional athlete he hes a very good athlete and hes got the coordination that God given coordination and he just struggles   yeah yeah   you know all the time to um to master this game   yeah well same here i mean im a brown belt in karate at this point in time and uh and and i cant and i cant hit a golf ball  you know i   oh my really yeah because it well i watch my husband swing and his swing you know when i compare to the pros is so its ridged its like hes trying so hard its not that flowing movement you know   uhhuh right thats because hes probably doing what i do worrying about is my head straight is my arm right is this correct am i holding correctly stuff like that   yeah yeah or if how how far hes going to hit it i think you know and i worry about that you know oh ive just got to get this drive you know really far ive got to hit it a nd then so yeah well that thats interesting   yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah i have this nasty habit of doing things like either turning my head at the last second or or just keeping my arm wrong   yep or yeah turning your head is probably the most common thing for women they say you know you are always so anxious to see where it goes uhhuh   is it right ex actly exactly its just like i i dont watch the ball die i have to it took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before i looked up   yeah yeah i have to do that especially even more so with a short iron than a long iron you know than with a driver or something because those short irons its just you want to look up   oh on his driver yeah   because you are getting close to the green and you want to hit the green and you know thats why yeah so   it depends on where its going that that is certainly true thank you   can i dont know whether im supposed to ask questions about im not supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure i know that i i well when i   thats okay go ahead i its no big deal   do you get get um reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too both okay okay well i really didnt know so i was just   both i believe so i i i actually dont know i get sort of random reimbursement every now and then and dont really   yeah   dont really figure it out i mean until afterwards   okay because this is only my second day doing it and i just didnt i didnt know and that was the detail yeah we i just started yesterday   oh really ive been doing this for awhile actually and it seems like its been a while and they just i just get these random checks in the mail every now and then and my wife and i both do it as a matter of fact   have you oh good yeah i havent i see i see   and we both just sort of get these random checks in the mail and to be honest i i really have not been accounting i just sort of figured well its going to work you know if it works it works so   yeah uhhuh well my uh
