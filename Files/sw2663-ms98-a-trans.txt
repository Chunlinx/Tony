        i just pressed my uh   were supposed to talk about recent political developments   i got one thats interesting not too controversial not too controversial i you know not doesnt matter whether youre Democrat or Republican i i do get somewhat of a kick out of because Schwartzkopf or the other generals who i admire how everyone wants to make get them in politics i think thats kind of an interesting recent thing that that i could think of recently that uh i was wondering what you thought about that making the generals uh   umhum yeah umhum   getting a general into politics   they want him because hes popular not because he can do the job   right although ive ive been thinking about it and i uh i kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero those were looking for a hero although Time magazine was saying that in essence the the generals staff   yeah   was comparing to corporate presidents and they said that in general generals are more familiar with training that they believe in training more   umhum   they are much more educated than the average corporate president and so the really were very positive on a generals staff person having a a very much better education than the average uh corporate president so i thought well maybe   yeah i i think they probably have a better education than the average congressman   well that too that too and uh you know they talk about the Army and because of the war and why did we win and all that and they talked about how the training was so important and thats so important in industry so   umhum   you know theyre liable to be right that that generals generals in the service and Schwartzkopf uh you know might make a good uh politician whether it be Governor or whatever you know   yeah he he you know we know hes a good leader we know hes a good organizer the question is you know can he be the man whos ultimately responsible you know like what he said is you know a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about you know people asking why are you doing this why are you doing that he says im following the orders of my President im not the one who writes the orders im just the one who follows them   yeah its interesting how they say that when theyre usually the top dogs you know everyone has a boss of course   umhum well you know Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait   yeah   and so he went to the President and said okay heres how i want to do it but uh he wasnt the one that decided that Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait   no thats true thats true   uhhuh   uh you you you pick one i i i just thought of that one when when they brought up about politics that was uh pretty easy     yeah   uh you dont have to pick Democratic or Republican you can pick anything you want go ahead   well the the thing that im wondering about is how we get a new congress how do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them to not get reelected over and over again   well i have an easy answer for that oh i wish they would do it is that limit it you know to eight or ten years max you know whether thats two five year terms or whatever   yeah i think yeah that may be our only answer but i dont really like it i dont like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve   oh you know youre not   because i think if the President be him Republican or Democrat i think if the President can prove that hes popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want i think the reason why weve got these guys in congress is because of the fundraising rules i mean   yeah   how many of these big campaign contributions that theyre running on this year did they get after they were elected just you know just after they were elected two years ago   yeah   basically the people as soon as they get elected the people dump all kinds of money on them and say yeah yeah youre my friend youre my friend and two years later he remembers that so what theyve done is bought this congressman for two years   yeah yeah i dont know i do like the the limitation of the President and uh i think there is a needed change i i i think the same thing should happen for Congress uh id like you know that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years my God its ridiculous you know   yeah well umhum thats thats the easy way i think the harder way out would be to make the uh the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground   we had   and thats thats what the financing rules and the uh the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff   i think voting is a problem i think i had one of the subject about voting and uh voting apathy or something like that and i think that uh the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time i i cant believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven oclock in the morning till seven oclock at night you know of course they have absentee which is getting to be more a lot easier and i i vote as often on absentee as i can because its so easy now but   yeah umhum   i think gee whiz you could make it a couple days uh its just uh if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days   yeah well i think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that its something worth caring about   yeah yeah   you know like you know the the recent uh election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up that election last December   are you in Dallas   im in yeah im in Dallas city limit   boy i i am in Arlington i am so happy not to be part of Dallas when i see those those folks there   umhum yes its an ugly mess   i mean uh i dont know if you like the mayor but i think your mayor the city council the what is the womans name whose uh not the mayor but the   umhum yeah the manager   yeah the city manager all of them need to be thrown out i mean theyre just awful theyre awful   yeah i dont yeah well what gets me you know this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes   umhum   and if if it had passed if these people had gotten out the vote it would have passed and thered be no more argument but theyre still fighting about it because of the way that election went last December   i know its so awful that uh politicians always spent consulting money that we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars   umhum   to buy consultants and then they dont even do that recommendation you know i mean its amazing the money that they spend once they get in   yeah umhum umhum yeah but but this was for supposedly to benefit the minorities and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote and they would have had their way   well youre right there youre right there uh uh people are uh uh politics uh the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really   yeah its pretty sad   yeah it is uh uh hopefully people will get more involved uh   umhum uh my my position is people who dont vote dont have any right to complain about the way the governments going   oh yeah but but those are the ones that are complaining i i think a lot i see it here at TI   yeah   the guys that dont take any interest in and and constantly on the negative of everything   umhum   and uh   and and you ask them why they dont vote they say well they dont want their name on the uh jury duty list   is that right ooh   that thats where they get the jury duty list is from the voter registration list   right youre right youre right       i think they could do more about uh voting   i think they could   what are the issues i im a Democrat i want to just say that im so sad that there isnt a strong Democrat i dont even know i could i could go out and and debate George Bush better than i see any Democrat doing it you know i mean at least id like to see competition because i like competition you know     yeah   and i think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead im so disgusted with the Democratic party i can not believe it you know   in Presidential races thats about what theyve done but theyve got a pretty good lock on Congress and a lot of local things   yeah but i still think in the last uh ten years you know of course thats not a recent event thats only my opinion i guess that way i shouldnt talk about that but uh i dont know whether theyre recent events i guess they were on this uh speech thing they want us to use a variety of words you know   wight   how many times have you called by the way i   actually i havent made any calls but i received about a dozen i i think yeah i have to make these but i get distracted and get to do something else and all of a sudden my phone rings and go oh what the heck well talk for a while   oh really i i yeah i ive already got uh twelve cards you get any cards in the mail you know   yeah we got a whole bunch i cant remember how many   i dont know im amazed by of course were not talking about politics but i am amazed by people say they got thirty i wonder why you need       thirty renditions of the persons voice but im not in voice uh synthesis but id sure like to see a summary of it well get to politics im sorry   you might be well i think weve used up as much time as were supposed to anyway were supposed to do five minutes and that was three minutes ago hey well thanks for the call yeah bye   yeah right yeah yeah byebye
