                so uh i i guess its subject is uh gun control   yeah i um probably would put myself on a um five or six scale being up here in the uh northeast um im considered liberal  but uh i believe in the right to own and uh have a gun for yourself if thats what if thats what you want as long as you dont have a record   umhum      in the past of um committing crimes or uh something in that order i think that its important that there be some check um background checks before they just hand a gun over to any old person   umhum yeah i sort of believe the same way i think im im probably considered more of a conservative but i still think that uh        uh with regards to gun control the uh like convicted felons you know they shouldnt be able to have one um also im in if if if you look at it uh like say a waiting period im in favor of a waiting period as just that a waiting period before someone buys a a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period but uh i i guess the uh NRA they kind of look at it as a springboard towards more restrictive gun controls and so i can kind of see both both sides of of the of the uh issue on that   yeah absolutely you know thats thats the one concern that uh i have too is that you know once you go down the path and you start with first its its background checks and and uh then its suddenly age restrictions and then its totally illegal   umhum yeah umhum   and you know i i come from up here im not in New York City area by any means so im in a a Rochesters not heavy crime area   yeah      but um you know and i and its been a political issue up here um a a big deal about whether or not they should people should have access to handguns and uh some of these Saturday night specials and plastic handguns and   uhhuh   all of these new things i think pretty much up here everybody agrees that  there should be more control on semiautomatic slash keeping automatic weapons banned   uhhuh   um just because you know what kind of legitimate hunting use can you do with an AK i mean   yeah that that is true um as a as a toy you know i mean if you call a gun a toy they would be it would be interesting to have one shoot one but uh        but youre right theres no no real legitimate need for one unless you consider um like personal defense like if your home or something thats its kind of extreme i i dont personally own one but uh its its really it really is a touchy issue i know uh the uh like you mentioned the plastic handguns the Glock   yeah   it seems to me like like that that weapon they could it seems it seems to me like they could bypass all the i i think the um the major concern is is that they think        that it can be slipped through airport security like it it say invisible X rays seems to me like technically thatd be very simple to solve just put some sort of a uh a metal flake flake or something that would show up on on X rays you know it to show the outline of the gun and then youd still have the advantages of the gun which is i believe light weight and uh it would   yeah yeah up here you know we have a lot of hunters up here if you go just to the south of uh Rochester here you have a bunch of state parks and theres a lot of hunting that goes on and uh that i think is by far the majority of people that own guns around here   uhhuh   tend to either be hunters or they live in the inner city and theyre concerned about um uh their safety        um weve had up here the NRAs main focus up here has been on protecting the hunting uh the people who are doing a lot of hunting because being not a large urban area like New York City where you have an NRA movement thats more um attuned to personal protection versus hunting um thats pretty much how theyve gone about it up here and some of the tactics i mean i noticed they changed their commercials   umhum   um used to be theyd mention and with every membership you get fifty thousand dollars dismemberment insurance   yeah   yeah its uh the NRA theyre uh theyre almost a little too radical in the other extreme im im im pretty strong in favor of of personal gun ownership but they uh they might even get a little carried away you know with the lobbying and and whatnot but     well its a powerful lobby i mean ive debated issues um on some other issues regarding the cable TV and that and uh the NRA lobby is the most powerful thats up there in Capitol Hill and uh they do a number   yeah yeah uhhuh
