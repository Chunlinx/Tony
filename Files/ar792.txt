                    Introduction        In diarthodial joints cartilage provides a smooth        surface that enables joints to articulate and to withstand        compressional and shear stress     Embedded in the        cartilage are chondrocytes that respond to biochemical and        physical stimuli to maintain this tissue Cartilage is        primarily composed of type II collagen and proteoglycan        which are synthesized by the chondrocytes In addition        chondrocytes produce enzymes such as the matrix        metalloproteinases MMPs that degrade the cartilage            In arthritis an imbalance of these processes in favour        of degradation results in a loss of cartilage For the        patient this is manifested as a degeneration of joint        function loss of mobility and concomitant increased        morbidity and mortality      For the clinician this        imbalance identifies a need for therapeutic agents to        prevent cartilage loss            In identifying targets for therapeutic intervention it        is important to note that the loss of collagen rather than        proteoglycan is correlated with disease severity            Furthermore whereas lost proteoglycan is replaced rapidly        degraded collagen is resynthesized very slowly             Consequently understanding collagen degradation and        providing therapeutics to prevent it are valuable aims        Within the MMP family MMP collagenase and MMP        collagenase are expressed in arthritic joints and        efficiently degrade type II collagen     MMP is more        effective than MMP in cleaving type II collagen but it        is debated which is the principal collagenase         in vivo      These enzymes        have been implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid        arthritis RA and osteoarthritis OA and have long been        therapeutic targets     Historically inhibition of        MMPactive sites has been a strategy however with        wideranging sideeffects and lack of efficacy these        studies are proving unfruitful in providing an effective        drug            Although the etiologies and pathologies of RA and OA        differ it is clear that in both of these diseases        proinflammatory cytokines are present resulting in an        inflammatory state as well as cartilage degradation            As further evidence for the role of proinflammatory        cytokines in RA antitumor necrosis factor antiTNF        and antiinterleukin  antiIL therapies can reduce        inflammation and retard the progression of disease as        assessed radiographically      However sideeffects        with these approaches such as the development of lymphomas        in patients using antiTNF therapies demonstrate that        alternative therapies are needed            An alternative approach to the prevention of cartilage        degradation is the inhibition of MMPs by targeting either        the expression of their genes or the synthesis of the        proteins Triterpenoids are a novel family of steroidlike        compounds with weak antiinflammatory properties            Synthetic triterpenoids have been produced with the aim of        achieving increased potency             Cyanodioxooleandienoic acid CDDO is a        synthetic triterpenoid that has been shown to inhibit        expression of the inflammatory genes inducible nitric oxide        synthase and cyclooxygenase       In a recent        report MMP and MMP expression were induced with IL        a known proinflammatory mediator         in vivo in joint tissues     It        was shown that CDDO could inhibit the ILinduced        expression of these proinflammatory MMPs These findings        make CDDO an attractive molecule to study as a potential        antiarthritic agent        Here we report quantification of the effects of CDDO on        gene expression in the human chondrosarcoma cell line        SW with the use of realtime reversetranscriptase        polymerase chain reaction RTPCR To ensure that the        chondroprotective effects of CDDO are not limited to this        cell line we studied its effects on human primary        chondrocytes We found that at concentrations that do not        induce apoptosis CDDO effectively inhibits the induction        of both MMP and MMP gene expression by IL in these        cells Whereas the inhibition of MMP by CDDO requires        pretreatment inhibition of MMP does not We have        recently reported the role of the inhibitor of NFB IB        family member Bcl in ILinduced MMP expression            Here we show that overexpression of Bcl can partly        abrogate CDDOs inhibitory effects on MMP in SW        cells suggesting that Bcl might be a target for        CDDO

NH USA          Human SW chondrosarcoma cells were purchased from          the American Type Culture Collection Rockville MD          USA Stable SW cell lines carrying a pBkRSV vector          with a Bcl expression insert were created as described          previously     Freshly excised macroscopically          normal cartilage and synovium from OA patients undergoing          knee replacement surgery were obtained from a local          orthopedic unit Dartmouth Hitchcock Memorial Hospital          Lebanon NH USA These tissues constitute waste from          the operations Under our current protocol with the          Committee for Human Subjects as mandated by HIPPA we did          not collect subject information We therefore made no          selection on the basis of age or sex Cartilage and          synovium were degraded in  mgml collagenase Sigma St          Louis MO USA for  hours at C with shaking at           rpm and cells were cultured to one passage

realtime RTPCR Glyceraldehydephosphate          dehydrogenase GAPDH was assayed to normalize data          Reverse transcription and quantitative realtime PCR          methods were as described previously     MMP          primers used were as follows upper          TGGCATTGCTGACATCATGA  lower          GCCAGAGGGCCCATCAA The product size was  base          pairs A plasmid containing MMP cDNA provided by Dr          Carlos LopezOtin Oviedo Spain was used to generate an          MMP standard curve Primers and standards for MMP          Bcl and GAPDH were as described previously              The generation and use of standard curves were as          described previously                              Measurement of programmed cell death by staining          with Hoechst           SW and human primary chondrocytes were seeded at             cells per well in well plates Becton          Dickinson Franklin Lakes NJ USA At           confluence cells were treated with CDDO  nM to  M          for  hours followed by IL for  hours Hoechst           Sigma  gml was then added to each well to          detect cells with condensed chromatin a hallmark of          programmed cell death After  minutes of incubation at          C cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope          as described previously                              Statistical analysis          Analyses of realtime PCR data were performed with          unpaired twotailed Students           t tests on triplicate wells          cultured simultaneously                            Results                  Effects of CDDO in SW cells          Previous work suggested that preincubation with CDDO          was required for the effective inhibition of ILinduced          MMP gene expression in SW cells     To quantify          the effect of altering the period of CDDO preincubation           nM CDDO was added to SW cells simultaneously          with IL or  hours before treatment with the          cytokine We found that SW cells expressed very low          basal levels of MMP and MMP and that these were not          significantly affected by incubation with CDDO Fig           IL induced the expression of MMP and MMP and          these were significantly inhibited when the cultures were          pretreated with CDDO for  hours the respective          decreases being  for MMP            P   and  for MMP            P   In addition when          added simultaneously with the cytokine CDDO          significantly inhibited the ILinduced expression of          MMP but not that of MMP Under these circumstances          MMP expression was decreased by             P   The different          profiles for MMP and MMP inhibition when CDDO was          added simultaneously with the cytokine suggest a          difference in the action of the inhibitor on the          expression of each enzyme          Previously with the use of Northern blotting          doseresponse assays in SW cells showed that  nM          was the lowest dose of CDDO sufficient to decrease the          ILinduced expression of MMP and MMP     This          was confirmed by using quantitative realtime PCR Doses          below  nM did not decrease MMP expression whereas          those above  M resulted in poor RNA harvests and low          expression of the MMPs data not shown This effect at          higher doses might be due to the reported apoptotic          effects of CDDO      To examine for such effects          SW cells were treated for  hours with CDDO under          serumfree conditions and then IL was added for a          further  hours Cells were stained with Hoechst           and examined under a fluorescent microscope Doses of           nM and  M CDDO with or without IL did not increase          apoptosis compared with control medium alone or IL          data not shown However a dose of  M caused          apoptosis in SW cells as seen in lower cell          numbers changed morphology and an increased number of          fluorescing cells These data demonstrate that at  nM          and  M doses that inhibit MMP gene expression CDDO          does not cause programmed cell death                          CDDO timecourse in human primary          chondrocytes          As described in the Introduction the aim of studying          the triterpenoids is to develop a therapeutic agent for          the treatment of arthritis We were therefore interested          in studying the effects of CDDO in human primary cells          Quantitative realtime RTPCR revealed that human          chondrocytes expressed low levels of MMP and MMP in          the absence of IL and increased levels with addition          of the cytokine Figs ab Pretreatment of cultures          with  nM CDDO for  hours resulted in a decreased          expression of ILinduced MMP and MMP MMP          expression was decreased by             P   and MMP by             P   As was observed with          SW cells MMP expression was significantly          decreased when CDDO was added simultaneously with the          cytokine we observed a decrease of             P   MMP expression was          not significantly inhibited by CDDO added simultaneously          with IL                          Effects of CDDO on expression of Bcl in human          primary chondrocytes          In the same timecourse experiment we assayed for the          presence of Bcl an IB family member that we have          previously shown to have a role in MMP expression We          found that Bcl was inducible with IL in human primary          chondrocytes and that CDDO significantly inhibited this          expression Fig c In a similar manner to MMP          inhibition the decreased expression was observed only          after preincubation of the cells with CDDO for  hours          Figs ac This was in contrast to MMP whose          inhibition was possible without pretreatment with CDDO          Fig b These results present further evidence of a          link in MMP and Bcl expression and indicate that          both molecules are similarly affected by CDDO                          CDDO doseresponse study in human primary          chondrocytes          To examine the effects of increasing doses of CDDO in          human primary chondrocytes cells were preincubated for           hours with CDDO  nM to  M or with medium          alone before the addition of IL for  hours Figure          shows that human primary chondrocytes have low basal          expression of MMP MMP and Bcl and that they are          increased in the presence of IL Increasing doses of          CDDO resulted in a decreased expression of each gene For          example MMP expression was inhibited by             P   with  nM CDDO by                      P   with  M CDDO and by                      P   by  M CDDO Similar          patterns emerged for MMP   and  and Bcl            and  in response to the respective doses          of CDDO all results being significant Using Hoechst           we assayed for potential toxicity of CDDO in human          primary chondrocytes we found decreased cell numbers and          increased apoptosis at or above  M CDDO data not          shown Lower concentrations did not result in          apoptosis                          Inhibition of MMP MMP and Bcl in OA          synovial fibroblasts          In parallel with the study on human primary          chondrocytes we examined the effects of  nM CDDO on          synovial fibroblasts excised from OA synovium There were          low basal expressions of MMP MMP and Bcl which          were increased in the presence of IL and inhibited by          CDDO following the trends observed in SW and human          primary chondrocytes data not shown                          Effect of overexpression of Bcl on the inhibition          of MMP by CDDO          To examine further the role of Bcl in ILinduced          MMP and MMP expression we used SW cells stably          transfected with a Bcl expression construct These          cells were pretreated with  nM CDDO for  hours and          then cultured with IL for  hours In the presence of          empty vector IL induced both MMP and MMP and          their expression was decreased by CDDO by  and           respectively Fig  In cells stably transfected with          the Bcl expression plasmid IL induced MMP          expression to levels fold higher than in the cells          transfected with empty vector Fig a In comparison          MMP expression was not significantly altered by the          overexpression of Bcl Fig b Furthermore the          presence of exogenous Bcl sustained MMP expression in          the presence of CDDO in comparison with cells expressing          empty vector When cultured in the presence of IL and          CDDO cells transfected with Bcl expressed fold          more MMP than did cells transfected with the empty          vector Fig a In contrast Bcl did not sustain          MMP expression in CDDOtreated cells Fig b Thus          Bcl which is repressed by CDDO preferentially          contributes to MMP gene expression                            Discussion        In a previous study Northern blot analysis showed that        treating SW cells with  nM CDDO for  hours before        treatment with IL inhibited the expression of MMP and        MMP     In the present study we used quantitative        realtime RTPCR to examine the action of CDDO on the        expression of MMP and MMP in SW cells and in two        primary cultures human primary chondrocytes and OA        synovial fibroblasts We have shown in a quantitative        manner that in all three cell types MMP and MMP are        inducible with IL and that CDDO inhibits the expression        of these collagenases with optimal inhibition being        observed after  hours of pretreatment with CDDO        Differing effects were found on the two enzymes MMP was        inhibited more than MMP In addition significant        inhibition of MMP did not require the pretreatment of        cells with CDDO In addition the observation that synovial        fibroblasts respond to CDDO in a similar manner to        chondrocytes suggests that the inhibitor can act in all        cells of the joint to decrease the expression of MMP and        MMP        In the human primary chondrocytes and OA synovial        fibroblasts we assayed for CDDOs effects on Bcl        expression We have recently described the role of Bcl        an IB family member in the signaling pathways of IL        leading to MMP expression in SW cells and rabbit        synovial fibroblasts     We found that IL could        induce the expression of Bcl and that Bcl had a direct        effect on MMP expression through cooperation with        NFBp In the present study we found that Bcl        expression was inducible by IL in human primary        chondrocytes and in OA synovial fibroblasts In addition        we found that pretreatment with CDDO decreased the        ILinduced expression of Bcl in these cells        Furthermore with the use of SW cells stably        transfected with a Bcl expression plasmid Bcl could        sustain the expression of MMP but not that of MMP        against inhibition by CDDO These data show that Bcl gene        expression is a target of CDDO in chondrocytes and suggest        that this might contribute to decreased MMP expression        Consistent with this model is the finding that pretreatment        with CDDO for  hours is required for the inhibition of        MMP unlike that for MMP We speculate that during        this period the inhibitor is entering the cell and        altering the expression of components of the IL        signalling pathway Bcl is decreased by CDDO during this        preincubation period and it might be one of several        proteins involved in MMP expression whose own expression is        lowered by CDDO        In all cell types CDDO inhibited the ILinduced        expression of MMP mRNA more effectively than that of        MMP This might be due to the much lower MMP        expression in all tissues examined There is disagreement        over which collagenase predominates in cartilage        degradation         in vivo      It is therefore        of interest to find the levels of MMP expressed compared        with that of MMP in SW and human primary        chondrocytes For example in human primary chondrocytes        Figs ab IL induced MMP to  molecules per        molecule of GAPDH whereas MMP was expressed at         molecules per molecule of GAPDH a more than fold        difference These results suggest that MMP expression        might be a dominant target for IL in chondrocytes        It is interesting to note that there was significant        variation of both MMP and MMP expression in the        primary human chondrocyte experiments In excising        chondrocytes from the extracted knees of OA patients great        care was taken to remove only tissue that seemed        macroscopically normal with the aim of excluding cells of        diseased tissue When these cells were cultured with medium        alone they expressed low levels of MMP and MMP        similar to those found in unstimulated SW cells These        results support the contention that the cells were in a        basal state unaffected by the environment of the diseased        knee from which they had been extracted Furthermore both        enzymes were consistently increased by IL and inhibited        by CDDO Thus the observed variation of MMP expression is        probably due to genetic variability and not to experimental        artifacts        Naturally occurring triterpenoids such as ursolic acid        have been found to have mild antiinflammatory effects             These have been improved with the development of        synthetic triterpenoids such as CDDO offering a potential        therapeutic tool for the treatment of arthritis and other        diseases       Furthermore it has been reported        that CDDO at high doses  M can have proapoptotic        effects ideal for the treatment of leukemia but of concern        with regard to chondrocyte cell death      However        we found that CDDO at concentrations that decrease MMP        and MMP expression namely  nM and  M did not        cause cell death The inhibitory effect of CDDO on MMP        and MMP expression as well as that of Bcl is very        encouraging for future applications of triterpenoids in        arthritic disease CDDO is an earlygeneration synthetic        triterpenoid and further modifications continue to be        made Further analysis of these compounds will provide        additional information about their mechanisms and potential        as therapeutic agents                    Conclusion        Inhibition of collagen loss is crucial to minimizing        cartilage destruction in the arthritides MMP and MMP        have been identified as the significant enzymes involved in        this process         in vivo  We examined a novel        synthetic triterpenoid CDDO as a potential inhibitor of        collagenase expression We found that CDDO inhibited the        expression of these enzymes in a chondrocyte cell line        human primary chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts        Furthermore CDDO decreased the expression of the        proinflammatory mediator Bcl suggesting one possible        mechanism of action CDDO is an earlygeneration        therapeutic agent with great potential for the treatment of        the arthritides and other inflammatory diseases                    Competing interests        None declared
