                    Background        In order to foster genetic studies there has been        increased emphasis on the development of appropriate        phenotypes to describe cognitive functions such as        attention see for example     In general these        efforts have used tasks that do not distinguish between        different functions of attention However imaging studies        have revealed quite specific anatomical networks for        functions of attention such as orienting to sensory events        developing and maintaining the alert state and executive        control used in resolving conflict between stimuli and        responses for a review of these networks see     We        seek to use this anatomical information to define        appropriate endophenotypes for genetic studies of        attention        Imaging studies show that the alerting network depends        largely on frontal and parietal areas of the right        hemisphere      The orienting network has important        involvement of superior and inferior parts of the parietal        lobe in conjunction with frontal and subcortical structures        related to eye movements     The executive control        network involves frontal areas including the anterior        cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex            Each of the networks is also differentially dependent on        a particular neuromodulator Studies of alert monkeys        suggest that the effectiveness of alerting produced by a        warning signal can be eliminated by drugs that block        noradrenaline     Lesions of the cholinergic system           and of drugs blocking ACh transmission have effects on        orienting of visual attention in monkeys     The        executive network involves dopamine rich areas of the        prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate Lesions in the        cell bodies of dopamine DA neurons    as well as in        the terminals located in prefrontal cortex    result in        cognitive deficits in executive function tasks        There is considerable evidence that insults to parts of        the brain containing these networks or to the        neuromodulators involved can produce specific neurological        or psychiatric deficits For example strokes to the        posterior parietal lobe involved in orienting produce        neglect of the contralesional space and specific deficits        in tasks involved the orienting network     Reductions        in striatal dopamine seen in Parkinsons disease result in        an inability to shift sets from one instruction to another        possibly reflecting a difficulty in control of conflict            Many psychiatric disorders whose anatomical origins        may not be well understood also show deficits in attention        For example patients with schizophrenia exhibit        difficulties in sensorimotor gating     smooth pursuit        eyetracking     setshifting     and working        memory tasks     Children with        attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder ADHD exhibit        abnormal performance in sustained attention tasks           and studies on autism reveal slowed covert orienting of        visual spatial attention     Patients with Alzheimers        disease show covert orienting deficits in visual attention        tasks     Interestingly many of these disorders show        familial patterns of inheritance and increased concordance        in monozygotic MZ vs dizygotic DZ twins suggesting        genetic origins            There is evidence that some kinds of variation in        attention in normal subject and patient populations        involves genetic variation Studies using the Continuous        Performance Task CPT have shown that the         d signal detection component of CPT        performance has a heritability among normal subjects of             The Span of Apprehension task SPAN a        visual search task has been shown to have an heritability        among normal subjects of     and the PN ratio of        the Spontaneous Selective Attention Task SSAT was shown        to have an heritability among normal subjects of             Twin studies using discordant twins affected with        schizophrenia show that spatial working memory divided        attention choice reaction time and selective attention           and attentional setshifting    are underlain by        inherited factors Studies on infants suggest that        effortful control and duration of orienting are heritable        as well            Recent studies have proceeded to associate genetic        variation with performance variation in attentional        function For example persons homozygous for the  allele                apoe gene who are asymptomatic but        at risk for Alzheimers disease have been shown to have a        specific deficit in orienting of attention that is in the        same direction as the Alzheimers patients     Other        studies using endophenotypic measures of attention have        linked variation in the         chrna gene with sensorimotor gating        performance    and variation in the         drd gene with attention deficits            However the tasks used in these studies have not        generally involved either the orienting network alone or        the task involves an undefined combination of different        networks        In previous work we have provided an Attention Network        Test ANT for measuring the efficiency of the alerting        orienting and conflict networks     The advantage of        this measure over other neuropsychological measures of        attention is that it provides a rapid measure of the        efficiency of each of the attention networks which have        been linked to a specific anatomy and specific chemical        modulators The ANT task is a combination of the cued        reaction time    and the flanker task     Its        simple design permits use with adults children nonhuman        primates and patients with various abnormalities of        attention Our previous paper    and other studies        using the flanker task suggest that performance on this        task follows a roughly normal distribution Performance is        also stable within normal adult subjects across a wide age        range and not detectably different in males and females It        has also been shown that practice or previous experience        has little impact on the attentional measures although the        overall reaction time is reduced In this small scale        preliminary study we take a step toward the use of the ANT        as an endophenotype in genetic studies by exploring the        heritability of each of the networks studied by the        test                    Results        The mean efficiency scores for each of the three        attention networks were calculated according to the        operational definitions described below see Materials and        Methods Table shows means and standard deviations SD        for each of the attention networks and overall reaction        times RT separately for MZ and DZ twins        The values obtained for the three attentional networks        were similar to those found previously     To        determine if these values or the overall RT differed        between members of a twin pair or between twin type MZ or        DZ we carried out a  three effects and mean RT           twins in each pair   MZ and DZ analysis of variance        ANOVA with twin type as between subject factor There        were no significant differences between twins in the pair        F    MSe   p   and twin type        MZ and DZ F     MSe   p                 The study consisted of two sessions which permitted        analysis of reliability in the present sample The        testretest reliability for alerting orienting and        conflict were   and  respectively They were        significant p   Since the means of the two test        sessions were used the expected reliability composite of        two measures were   and  for alerting        orienting and conflict respectively        The alerting orienting and conflict scores may be        influenced directly or indirectly by the overall mean RT        Generally one expects larger subtractions when the RTs are        longer In order to reduce these effects ratio scores        effect divided by overall RT were used in the correlation        analysis and the estimations of the heritability of the        three networks Table shows the correlation values between        twin pairs of MZ and DZ twins for each network        Heritability is generally thought to be the proportion        of variance that can be attributed to genetic rather than        strictly environmental factors Most often it is estimated        by comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins            Although there remains controversy in how purely genetic        these calculation are    and the best way compute        heritability    we chose to calculate heritability in        two ways First using the classical approach the        proportion of variance attributed to additive genetic        factors narrow sense heritability was estimated by        doubling the difference in correlation between MZ and DZ        twins This approach provides a simple and reliable index        for twin studies which vary across time and culture            This method however is ineffective at disentangling        nonadditive genetic factors and epistatic components as        well and unique and shared environmental components Table        shows the efficiency of the conflict network is heritable                 h                   F                    h                   H            while low heritabilities were observed for        alerting and median reaction time          h                   F            and  respectively and         h                   H            and  respectively The orienting response        shows no evidence of heritability The orienting response        shows a higher correlation in DZ twins than MZ twins        In addition to the classical estimation of         h  we applied the structural        equation modeling package Mx    which allows the        explicit representation of observed and latent variables        The advantage of this method lies in the ability to best        fit the observed data according to path models that        hypothesize varying degrees of additive and nonadditive        contributions as well as shared and unique environmental        contributions We chose a conservative approach setting        the expected genetic correlation among DZ twins to  and        used the standard twin analysis path Table shows the        heritability estimates for three attentional networks and        mean RT and  confidence limits The contributions to        the additive genetic variance          h  common environmental variance                 c  and unique environmental        variance          e  values are given Interestingly        the         h s were in agreement with those        calculated using the classical approach The effect of        conflict was highly heritable          h   while low heritabilities        were observed for alerting and reaction time and          h   and  respectively                    Discussion        Because of the small Ns involved in this study only the        effect of conflict is significantly different than  and        this is due to the very small correlation found in the DZ        twins The correlation among DZ twins in conflict is        suspiciously low because it is a smaller number than for        any of the other networks this of course would inflate        the overall heritability of the conflict network To        compare the heritability of the various networks would take        a much larger study For example a power calculation        suggests that with the current size of the effect it would        take more than  pairs to reach significance for the        alerting network        Nonetheless there is some indication favoring the        heritability of the executive network The heritability of        the executive network has been observed in other conflict        tasks such as the Stroop colorword task    which also        activates the cingulate and other frontal areas            However the flanker task has an advantage over the Stroop        in that it does not involve language and our results show        considerably higher heritability        The heritability of reaction time has also been observed        in other twin studies on normal subjects     In        genetic studies where cognitive assays for executive        control or general intelligence depend on reaction time        measures the heritability of lower levels of processing        involved in RT may thus influence the performance scores        To avoid this we normalized all efficiency scores as a        function of median RT        There have been no reported twin studies on the alerting        response         per se  but this function namely        the maintenance of the alert state is inherently a part of        many neuropsychological tasks Interestingly studies on        depression and mood have shown deficits in simple reaction        time tasks in patients that report sadness or depression             These RT deficits are specific to left visual        field right hemisphere and are consistent with the right        frontal and parietal networks involved in alerting Changes        in the efficiency of the alerting network as a consequence        of mood and depression are further supported by the        findings of Liotti and Tucker    where subjects induced        into sadness showed no improvement in RT when given        alerting cues before target stimuli were presented The        mean probandwise MZ concordance rate for unipolar        depression  is more than twice that for DZ twins            as well as for narrowly defined depression            suggesting the presence of genetic determinants        In our study there is no evidence of heritability for        the orienting network This may be because of low power of        this small study There is evidence that genes can        influence orienting in a task similar to ours Alzheimers        Disease is a heritable condition with a well described        visual orienting deficit and where associations have been        found in unaffected relatives between visual orienting and        the         apoe gene     In order to keep        the ANT simple the peripheral orienting cues are         valid This differs from similar tasks of visual orienting        where usually only  of the orienting cues are valid In        the visual orienting studies of Greenwood         et al    the association with        the         apoe gene was observed only when this        validity manipulation was utilized It is possible that the        use of  validity and the lack of any specific        instruction may have made use of the cues a matter of        individual strategy and thus both relatively unreliable and        less subject to genetic influences Future genetic studies        may be more fruitful when the validity manipulation is        included in the ANT        While it is likely that our failure to find any evidence        of heritability of the orienting network is due to either        the small scale of our study or weaknesses in our assay it        is certainly possible that low correlations among MZ twins        reflects differential experiences that these twin pairs        undergo            The advantage of using an endophenotypic measure can be        extended when information about the neuroanatomy physiology        and development underlying performance on the task is        available Knowledge of brain structures involved in        performance will serve to constrain candidate gene identity        and function and thus facilitate the integration of genetic        information In the case of the executive attention        network multiple imaging studies have shown activation of        midline and lateral frontal areas These areas are strongly        modulated by dopamine and suggest the importance of        examining genes that modulate dopamine One of these genes        the dopamine D receptor gene has been repeatedly        associated with attentional disorders see    for a        review While one allele of this gene the  repeat has        been found not to be associated with abnormalities in        interference in the Stroop effect it is reasonable to        examine other variants of this gene and other genes related        to the dopamine system        Studies of human development have shown that the        executive attention network is related to effortful control        as measured from caregiver reports of their childs        behavior     Effortful control has also been shown to        be heritable in twin studies    using larger numbers of        subjects and has been linked by behavioral studies to the        ability to delay gratification development of conscience        and other aspects of self regulation                        Conclusions        We have developed phenotypic measures for the three        aspects of attention alerting orienting and executive        control that have been the best described anatomically Our        small scale preliminary study of twins suggests that at        least the dopamine rich executive network is appropriate        for use in molecular genetic studies                    Materials and Methods                  Subjects          Twenty six MZ twin pairs and  DZ same sex pairs          participated in the study Twins were recruited in the          vicinity of Peking University via newspaper          advertisement Paid volunteer pairs traveled to the          Department of Psychology to undergo a pretest interview          by a resident psychologist Subjects with a history of          psychopathology andor taking medication were excluded A          total of  twin pairs interviewed  aged matched pairs          from ages  years old met inclusion criteria All          participants reported normal or corrected to normal          vision Zygosity status was determined by close          inspection of physical features birth records parental          interview and genotyping of buccal swab DNA at           polymorphic genetic loci           maoa drd dbh maoa badr and           gsalpha                                  Procedure          The ANT was performed as previously described              Briefly participants viewed the stimuli and responses          were collected via two response buttons Stimuli          consisted of a row of  visually presented horizontal          black lines with arrowheads pointing leftward or          rightward against a gray background where the target was          a leftward or rightward arrowhead at the center This          target was flanked on either side by two arrows in the          same direction congruent condition or in the opposite          direction incongruent condition or by lines neutral          condition          The participants task was to identify the direction          of the centrally presented arrow by pressing one button          for the left direction and a second button for the right          direction Cues consisted of a  msec asterisk          presented  msec before the target There were four cue          conditions  nocue participants were shown a cross          which was the same as the first fixation for  ms           centralcue which was at the central fixation point           doublecue in which cues were presented on the two          possible target locations simultaneously both above and          below the fixation point and  spatialcue cue was          presented right on the target location either above          below the central fixation point          A session consisted of a trial practice block and          three experimental blocks of trials Each experimental          block consisted of  trials  conditions  warning          levels x  target locations x  target directions x           congruency conditions with  repetitions The          presentation of trials was in a random order          Participants were instructed to focus on a centrally          located fixation cross throughout the task and to          response as fast also as accurately as possible Twin          pair participants performed  sessions of the ANT          allowing a break in between sessions while the other          member of the pair performed the task                          Calculation of attention network          efficiencies          Values for attention network efficiency were          calculated from the raw reaction time data as previously          described     Medians were calculated for each test          conditions  conditions in total  cue levels by           target levels combined target locations and target          directions to avoid the influence of the outliers The          alerting effect was calculated by subtracting the mean RT          of the conditions with double cue from the mean RT of the          conditions with no cue Since neither of these conditions          provides information on the spatial location of the          target the subtraction gives a pure measure of alerting          The orienting effect was calculated by subtracting the          mean RT of the conditions with spatial cue from the mean          RT of the conditions with center cue In both conditions          the subject is alert but only the spatial cue provided          spatial information on where to orient The conflict          executive effect was calculated by subtracting the mean          RT of congruent conditions from the mean RT of          incongruent conditions
