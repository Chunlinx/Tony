        have you gone to college yourself     yeah i have   did you whered you go   i went to Western State College in Gunnison Colorado   oh yeah   what about you   uh i went i graduated from ah Weaver State University here at in Ogden   oh okay   yeah so what did you uh or what would you recommend for a good college i guess   i personally would recommend the smaller college just because   uhhuh   you know you get a lot more individual attention and and you can go speak talk to your professor and   umhum   and uh its just more i think its more conducive to studying especially if youre like a freshman   yeah i agree with you a hundred percent i Weavers a pretty small college we have uh about ten thousand to twelve thousand students and i i have some friends who went to Brigham Young University and the the University of Utah that you know they got twenty five thirty thousand people and   umhum   you know all they are is a number you go to a testing center for everything and you just check in by number or you most all most of the time they said they actually even had uh uh student or not student teacher but you know graduate students teaching their classes   right   whereas you know all my professors i knew they were PhDs or whatever and that they were tenured and everything and felt like uh like like you say i got a lot more personal attention and   right is that uh is that in the mountains   uh yeah we are   oh great   yeah     well thats the way thats what Western State was too   oh yeah its beautiful i id   yeah i wouldnt trade it i wish i could move back     yeah yeah   im tired of the big city thats for sure yeah   are you are you close to Dallas or   yeah were just uh uh out skirts of Dallas     yeah uh we uh in fact my campus was right on uh the benches of the mountains so i was it was really pretty all the time   yeah   sure enjoy i i dont know if i could ever move away   did you ski   of course yeah you i i havent uh actually the last couple of years i havent been able to as much because       uh out of school but uh i i did a lot when i was in high school and stuff when i didnt have to spend the time studying and working and supporting a family but   right   i love it you yourself   oh yeah definitely   yeah you dont get as much of a chance down there in Texas do you  i would think   no   i regret it too i i really wanna   yeah   id like to go this year we were supposed to go on a ski trip but thats one thats one thing i would recommend too because you know   go up to Colorado or yeah   most college you go to a college and you make what you what you uh what you can out of it you know   uhhuh   and when you get out then you know youre you basically promote yourself and you try and network into a company or or get a job or start a business or whatever   yeah umhum   but uh you just cant trade the the the time you know that you spend in the mountains you know if you if you fish and hunt or whatever and ski   yeah thats true umhum     you know i id never give up that   oh yeah they offer i mean anymore they offer cook theres a you know we have uh we had a mountain climbing class we had you know we had a ski class   yeah   and there was all kind of that stuff that was offered as you know electives and those were i mean those were the funniest ones i mean   right sure   that made up for all the English classes or you know the science classes you had to take but uh   right   yeah that was what made it like i say made it worthwhile and at least kept you going to school on a semi regular basis i know it was pretty tough come spring or in summer or especially when it was so cold man if you didnt have a reason like a ski class you never went   right       yeah   it just wasnt worth it so       but yeah i uh im convinced that after getting me my undergraduate degree i would like to go to a big name school to get my graduate degree but       theyre so expensive im not anymore i i almost think people just require they require a graduate degree or an undergraduate degree they dont necessarily care where from and if you wanna set yourself apart you have to go get that big graduate degree from Harvard or some place like that   yeah they do thats right   or else it you know youre just Joe Blow off the street nobody knows but   right   whatd you get your degree in   uh business administration   oh did you did you have an emphasis in anything or   yeah emphasis in finance   oh did you thats what i got mine in was in finance yeah so where youre working at now   yeah really im at uh company by the name of E Systems were a defense contractor down here   uhhuh uhhuh   its its pretty good company so     oh really are you  an analyst for them or   yeah im a scheduling analyst yeah   oh really great   so   yeah im a little out of my field of what i wanna be im an  auditor for a credit union but   oh really   its not something i wanna do for very long           is there a lot of   were kind of the bad guys its kind of a negative type thing but   a lot of companies up there or   uh not not a lot of private ah there i mean theres a lot of companies but theyre not really large enough theyre mainly theres a lot of family type companies and just small ten fifteen people   uhhuh   we uh  pretty much are you know the government plays a big part in our economy and   for what reason how do they do that   well we got we have uh
