                 okay what do you think of the public school system first off do you have children that are in it   i have children that are in the Plano Public School systems and i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a fulltime job in the public school system  so   oh okay well then you should be a good one to know because i my children are grown now i now have grandchildren in the school system so uh   oh   i dont have first had experience right now with it so what do you think   uhhuh uhhuh well i think the public school systems are doing a good job i think they have a long way to go yet but i think that um they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier you know my kindergartners were on the were on the computers and i think that with the way the world is today thats got to be done and i think that uh the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them you know skills you know you dont just add one plus one you figure out why youre adding it and what youre going to do with it once youve got it together and i think that thats something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think they literally cannot come in out of the rain   right thats right   you you know and that just i dont care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted       and uh this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education   correct   so i think you know theyre theyre trying to head into into teaching them to think and use the education that they have and i think thats very very important   yes it is i i agree with you that theyre starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren we have a uh fourth grader and then we have one thats in kindergartner and and i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing were doing in the fifth and sixth grade   oh yeah   you know its amazing to me and stuff that i didnt do until i was in junior high which of course shows my age     oh yeah uh i tutor a girl thats in eighth grade and her prealgebra book is higher then some of my algebra two when i was in high school and its like oh i going to take this home and study it before i can help you   thats kind of scary right   you know so theyre really theyre really moving them along but yet  at the same time you know they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life and thats what you know a lot of the things that we did in school ive never used and never will use   now yes   and uh so i think that its its appropriate to teach them you know why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this   correct are you finding that uh since youre doing substitute that youre wanting to do fulltime um i have a friend thats a teacher that one of her complaints is she cant teach because shes so busy filling out all the forms   yes thats a   and and do are you do you find that   well filling out the forms and also all of these uh statewide and national wide testing things so that they compare and say you know you can as far as im concerned   uhhuh   you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say   umhum   and its just a matter of how youre going to interpret it and you waste so much time quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best theyre possibly going to be you know that   be umhum   i think its uh i think its crazy personally you know the first the whole first nine weeks of school is is used       as a review but more than a review theyre getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in October so that you know your school district shines throughout the United States   umhum   and i think thats totally useless i think you know theres a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons but i think theyve taken it to the extent now that its just ridiculous its like bragging on your grandchildren   right   you know and everybodys kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth and nobody elses children are going to ever live up to those and thats great but thats what theyre doing with the school systems and theyre wasting too much time on that i think   uhhuh well i i know that this again this this friend uh is in the Plano School District and she teaches uh     uhhuh   uh it must uh emotionally disturbed children and she says she has some six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade   uhhuh yes   and she says shes getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though theyre not ready but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money       when theyre passed on or something i didnt quite understand it   yeah theres not yeah the bottom line line is always money   and uh
