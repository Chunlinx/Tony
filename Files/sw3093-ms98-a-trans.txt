          well this is the season for vacations and uh i guess for places i like to go i enjoy going to the beach and having having outdoor being outdoors somewhere and someplace thats very different than Texas and uh as far as   right   maybe maybe as the summer heat comes along id sort of like going somewhere where its not so hot and being able to be outside and enjoy outsor outside activities so   yeah   enjoy going places where i i enjoy playing tennis so i like to have a tennis court there or or if its at the beach the beach is great a pool is great and uh   where where do you usually go   oh well lets see we have plans this year to drive up to the uh to Colorado and well be going to Estes Park and Colorado Springs so   umhum hum uhhuh   one year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado into Durango and north of the area there and uh   uhhuh   boy thats thats a nice nice place to visit its really nice uh theres a nice nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining   right   and uh and then actually north north of that is another town and a smaller on a smaller scale i guess than Silverton but uh and then theres lots and lots of real uh of mountains that are covered with uh boulders   umhum   so i guess people Jeep through that area and we didnt have a chance to do that but i sure would like to go back there and do that again   right were um uh we havent had a vacation in several years so so  be our first chance in awhile in awhile uh were going to go to uh Destin Florida which is a very nice beach area if youre not familiar with it it   i havent been but ive heard its wonderful   oh its its gorgeous uh we used to go quite a bit uh before i moved out here we were closer and uh used to  go almost every summer uh and just just rent a condo there on the beach uh theres quite a few uh theres a lot of development of of condominiums there along the beach front   right   and uh   so they have uh theyre very very large condos and they have quite a few rooms and uh so we well usually rent one for about a week or so and   right and the beach is nice the beach is really nice isnt it   and go down oh yeah its it just uh just beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and uh a lot of   oh   nice waves usually uh   sea shells   enough enough to make it im sorry   sea shells   uh theres not as many sea shells along there uh thats the only thing that they really dont they have some but not not so much um if you go further down uh   yeah   but youll usually find some but not right in there uh i dont know why it is but uh just it seems not to not to have as many there but uh we we enjoy it uh its the place where we stay is we stay we usually stay at the same place every year and   they are like i say right on the beach so its uh   oh where do you stay and my husband always wants to go to Destin we just havent gone that direction yet   its a place called Jetty East uh J E T T Y E A S T and its uh called that because its at the very end of uh a jetty there which is uh sort of the end of this little little point and uh its a at the very end its the last set of condominiums there and its uh   okay   its very nice uh its not very expensive uh you can i think were going to go with another couple and their their kids and uh they have a we have a uh i think its three bedroom or two bedroom uh condominium which will sleep i dont know quite a few uh six or eight and uh   right   because its got you know pull out couches and all that and uh i think its going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week   oh  thats nice   yeah it really is because um the uh you know its got its own kitchen full size kitchen and everything and this one i think has two baths and its the one we got is on the uh on the beach side so   right oh nice   weve got a beautiful view and balcony and uh just you know really its really a nice stay uh in fact we stayed there on on our honeymoon we i had won a trip to the Bahamas but didnt get to take it on our honeymoon time so we instead went there uh and loved it just as much as as if we had gone to the Bahamas we in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked the uh the particular room uh uh uh   oh   uh suite that we had gotten was very nice and so we decided to stay   right oh   but uh its a pretty nice place youll need to try to go and and stay there sometime but   well weve just weve just   its a little far from here but uh   are you driving   yeah we are were itll take uh a day and a half to get there probably   oh   so   well well were uh the neighborhood that we live in theyre switching to an alternate calendar this year so it starting well starting at the end of July well have two vacation weeks
