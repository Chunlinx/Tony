        hi um   hello   basically i wear pants im a real pants person and um like when im at home since and and ill say im a homemaker since thats my basic thing um i wear a pantsuit most of the time not a pantsuit i guess pants and a shirt and um in the summertime i wear cotton tops cotton top shirts and in the winter i wear uh like sweaters i like sweaters a lot and so i do that but when i go out for meetings uh then i will wear  either uh skirts or um a dress and i have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time but thats basically what i do   well i think our tastes are fairly similar similar although im i government worker i do tend to im um a scientist   oh   so that technically i suppose i could get away with with extremely casual clothes but for the most port part i dont i wear fairly respectable looking shoes and   umhum right   and a pantsuit of sort one sort or another and um i guess dress it up with a with a a very nice black jacket when i have some have visitors or have to give talks   well that sounds nice   right   um it said the seasons do do you change much through the season or   no actually i guess this summer i i wore some fairly nice jeans um more than i wore have in previous seasons   uhhuh   but um no i tend  to to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer i dont know whether they think by you know freezing them up overnight then they can save electricity during the day or something  but but you know you wear a heavy sweater in your office all summer  so   maybe i dont know     right um yeah i dont i dont i you know im not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends   uhhuh   and i guess although in as i recall the stereotype of of secretaries was you know overdress overkill sort of and   yeah yeah   in a sense uh in a sense the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and theyre not meeting the public   right   it i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would would be to spend this money here you know  i mean i suppose if you were a a more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up   uhhuh then maybe yeah um well i dont have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway  and so my note change dramatically over the years if i need something new i will go and buy it but basically im a a pretty much the same in the summertime i wear the light cotton and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters   umhum umhum   and so its not a whole lot of of change for me either   right   and um especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses i i i enjoy that but it just wouldnt be um smart for me to do that in my home with my children   umhum umhum   so i have to um think about things like that too i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that now i dont know if they consider that a job i dont really get paid for that uh often but uh when i do that then i i think i become more businesslike   umhum   um but it doesnt really change in my clothing style   exactly i mean you can look businesslike in in a pantsuit uh the same pant suit you would you know wear for other things   yeah yeah   yeah im im really glad about that pantsuits are popular because im allergic to many of the synthetics   oh   and so i used to have a problem when when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash   uhhuh oh dear   so   thats not helpful   right right but otherwise now im i i guess were both pretty practical   yeah i guess so  well its been great talking to you have a great day bye   okay well have a good day byebye
