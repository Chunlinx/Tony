                well Brent ive been um i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because i thought uh if it its only going to be another year until the youngest is in school   right   and i thought it was a good sacrifice to make   uhhuh   because um it was important to me to to spend some time with kids i know that when i was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was it was really hard on our family because i would he would come home and i would leave and then when i would come home and he would leave and um   right   so i think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something it was like that they thought thats the way life was that you didnt have two parents at home at the same time   uhhuh   and so i think um its become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family so theres one or two nights a week we have a on Monday nights we set aside time where its called uh family home evening and we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together   uhhuh   um     you must be LES   yes   so am i yes what a coincidence   oh you are         yes and   yeah i know what family home evenings all about   so you do that and right and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday usually in the morning     umhum right and then the family home evening too   right and then you know sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday but   right   were its real important to us to spend time together   well thats good um how many children do you have   i have two   two what what do you have   umhum i have a girl and a boy and the boys five hes in kindergarten and the girl is four shell be in kindergarten next year   five and four   umhum   i have two daughters   umhum   my oldest is uh four and my youngest is about to turn three   hum uhhuh   two girls and they are a handful   they are a handful   yes we weve my uh well when we first got married my wife worked for a year       then we decided to have kids   uhhuh   and uh she she got pregnant and then we decided she would stay home with the kids we would make that sacrifice it is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one   umhum   and uh we made that decision and uh so she after she had the first baby she stayed home and and we had a second baby and shes still at home     yes   and so uh you know at work a lot of people are you know i think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our in our world we live in most of them uh continue to work if they have have kids   umhum   i only have one other person i know in my in my group here that works where the wife stays home and thats because of religious values as well theyre Baptists and they and they think thats important   umhum   but everybody else works and they drop their kids off at day care and and leave them and i dont know i just dont want i just dont want strangers raising my children   well no and its its just not um its not as stable for the kids and they everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now but uh its yeah   right thats how it is at our house when youre on the phone oh its open       anything goes when moms on the phone           well its also important i think um for my husband i i try to go out of my way to to plan things that he can do with the kids because   umhum   since i am home with them and so i get a lot of time with them he needs to have um some time with them so he when he comes home he um you know its his job at night he puts the kids to bed and he reads   right right   to them and he he spends about an hour doing that and thats thats pretty good quality time with them and um but its hard for him on Saturdays he he wants   right with all the yard work and things like that   right he wants to run out and get things done and so um i try to say well why dont you go fly kites or why dont you do something and   umhum   if i have something in mind then he he remembers that thats what he wants to do   umhum right we feel that you know just spending time together you dont necessarily have to be doing anything you know that costs money or or you know that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that its just the kids like to being together as a family   uhhuh   like last Saturday we went had some errands to run and so we took the kids and and we went by the Farmers Market down in in down there in Garland   umhum   and they had a blast running around the Farmers Market looking at all the you know the food and tasting all the free samples       they were giving out and they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet you know and they liked that and   uhhuh   then on the way home we drove by the local high school and there happened to be an FA FAA Future Farmers FA Future Farmers of America FFA   yes   going on there and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything you know all out in this in the in this schoolyard there so we just said hey lets stop and   umhum   and the kids got to go around and you know see pigs and animals and things like that and and for them thats wonderful you know they they they thought it was the greatest fun you know and it didnt cost any money and uh you dont have quite as much money when when the wife doesnt work   well thats right but i do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated its not nearly as important we find that   right   you know back just even fifty years ago when people had had financial problems the fir st place they went to was their family and families took care of themselves and um   umhum   but now you know people dont they dont support each other that way   right right oh definitely motherhood is devalued in this society society if youre stay home and youre a mother its like what a waste people think you know you should be fulfilling yourself and and a mother isnt an important   umhum thats right and   important thing as as having a career and and that should be first and and children second but they dont have kind of an what we call an internal perspective of things  that   right right right and its not an easy sacrifice for a person to make because you know i you know i have interests   no right   that too and it is hard to make uh those interests not be as a major part of my life   uh at this point its not to say that some day you wont go back to work my mothers a school teacher and   umhum   and when when we started uh having kids she had to work for a little while but then she just started substituting   uhhuh   so she would just substitute once or twice a week you know just for that little extra money when we were in school then we would just come home and just be you know go to a neighbors house for an hour then shed be home but she wouldnt do that every day   right   but now that my my uh youngest sisters at BYU now and so they have no one at home shes back teaching school full time now again       so if you know its not its just a temporary thing   it is temporary it in the middle of it it seems like a long time but youre right it is temporary   umhum   well i see that we both share the same belief here that its important that we spend time with our kids and and in spite of   yeah yeah   yeah you its its hard sometimes at work because you know people say oh were taking a cruise were going here were going there you know because they have a lot more money   umhum   and a lot of them decide just not to have children its its amazing they either have one or none   yes thats true   and and the one person i know that has one they they feel guilty she has this continual guilt trip that shes not doing the right thing and so on uh on weekends she would you know spend all of their time with their kids and spend lots of lots and lots of money basically i think they they really spoil the child to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings   umhum   and and and they dont want to have anymore children because they just dont think you know that she doesnt think she could be a mother at home thats not her bag so she just doesnt think she could you know the guilt feelings she cant deal with with it anymore so   yes well it is the hardest thing ive ever done as much as youd go out   you know umhum yeah my wife uh     and   likes staying home   uhhuh   uh she works at home some though   uhhuh   the place she works with worked with before um worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home   well thats good   part time and so uh that its kind of a seasonal thing three times a year shes really busy doing certain things based on that kind of business but the rest of the time shes free   umhum   she likes to sew and do crafts and things like that so she enjoys staying at home but uh the money part of it is not as rewarding obviously but   no   theres different rewards you know different kinds of rewards   yeah i think so i think its an investment in your future even if its purely not not religious you can at least say that its important to our country that our family unit stays strong   right right right and you really have to make a quite a bit of money the wife doesnt make it worth it with the cost of day care   umhum yes   i know theres you know when you adjust your income for what you put out for day care you know youre only making like five
