            do you own a PC     yeah i do i own a um i own an i an X T clone its a Samsung and uh with a Hyundai monitor monochrome monitor that i just keep at home for work   yeah   and acts as a terminal for me because im a graduate student and i log out of school from there   oh good what are you taking in school   im a graduate student in psychology yeah i do uh language acquisition work   hum   but its its its very helpful its nice to have a machine at home that i can use locally for things like writing and so forth but i dont   oh it its uh ideal for that   yeah and then i dont need printer or anything   word processing part is is extremely useful i think   yeah i dont need a printer or anything because i just sort of i can just call school and transfer everything over to school over the phone lines so how about you do you have um a machine   uhhuh an an P S E and   okay i know it   ive been used to working and this my first years but all of the work that i do is plus getting to know it a little bit better theyre powerful little rascals   yeah P S twos are general architecture   uh   theyre a little bit different though um we have two model seventies that we just bought last year and they um   yeah   there are some slight differences between those and other machines im finding oh i fell its fine i actually dont i havent actually noticed a major difference between a P S two and everything else actually   uhhuh   um you know in in in terms of performing faster or better or anything im not actually sure what the major advantage of a P S two over anything else is with the possible exception of the fact that its got a mouse port built in the back   yeah id ive noticed uh there was some scattered at work and i notice the uh through put is much faster on mine than than those but i think its just because of the the lower level in expectation out of them that the processing speed is much faster on uh the same canned programs   yeah yeah i think so um its its although although its funny because i just i just had a discussion on break on one of our machines because its just too slow   uhhuh   we have a decent somehow it slipped by us that we had bought one with two meg and of of memory of of RAM and one with only one   yeah   and were running this new version of Lotus i dont know if youve ever seen this or not you know   or performed to uh eighty percent expectation anyway   yeah thats true actually i um i found that this particular version three of Lotus one two three actually i think performs maybe even in the high ninety per cent of what im expecting at this point i am   yeah   its its its because im new enough at it yet that i havent figured everything out   what was your first exposure to the computer   my first exposure was i guess when i was an undergraduate um a couple of years ago we had they they inundated us with Macintoshes   uhhuh   they brought a bunch of Macs into uh there must have been some sort of program and they brought Macintoshes in for us to for the school to do you know for all the kids in the school to do word processing on and   right is there an undergraduate requirement on them   no there there never was an undergraduate requirement it just everyone really everyone took to them very quickly because there were a number of them available and   what about all the majors are there any such as business or uh or other undergraduate majors do they require it of any of them   uh im not sure they must have they didnt in my case i was a psych major and they didnt i know that here theyre required of some of of um where i am now   yeah   they require it of of actually a number of different uh majors you know um some psychologists people psychology can take that in lieu of other courses and people in business have to uh i think are supposed and people in cognitive science definitely have to   well actually its expanded your field too because the psychology of of man working with machine is  is a whole new element that   oh yeah i i actually um you said you said you work on mainframes a lot thats a lot of what i do is on a a Sun i dont know if you work on Suns at all um   uhhuh   so Sun Microsystem machine which is another mainframe in a type of a mainframe we do lots of um sort of brain you know neural network modeling   uhhuh uhhuh   on on on a on a lot of mainframe machines so yeah this is been a lot of expanding and having to be able to have things at home and and to study the interaction too has been wonderful   yeah its interesting i think uh ive ive worked with computers since nineteen sixty sixty   wow   yeah im an old man   well no i mean wow they must have been very different back then   no they were the IBM six fifty took up a whole room as a vacuum tube uh machine and it was binary quinary um base five   uh uh wow why base five   i have no idea  i didnt never did learn why but it was a base five which is very interesting   God so youve really watched the whole the whole field grow up   oh its been amazing it really has been   i mean the the the notion of personal computer back then meant you had to have your own living room   oh i know it i know it and its almost like talking about the checkless society and and all of that and you know there was talk in fact my brother uh was with IBM from nineteen fifty four until about three years ago so we really had a family history of talking about development of uh of equipment   wow so this is the perfect topic for you   oh       you know and i do i do some programming of my own too using Cobol rather than any of the newer languages its just one that ive known for a long time and still use it even on this   okay   PS two so i have to learn a tolerance with canned programs because im so used to being able to do exactly what i want to do rather than having to work around or go through two or three different steps to get to the the final one but i am amazed at the power and uh ability of these small units that sit on a table or desk   well how do they compare with like um you know the the big um the big you know the ones that that took up a whole room in the sixties i mean how would you you know power wise was that less well actually less powerful   oh it it was almost well its hard to describe but its almost like uh an abacus versus an electronic electronic calculator you know you   oh God really   you go   that that much and and and that much bigger too for the same analogy wow   oh yeah but i mean the speed using punch cards and for your information Ken this first uh first computer had one had two accumulators   okay   and one focal point that you had to channel everything into it was called a distributor and you moved it from memory you had to know exactly where in memory it was there was no relative memory   oh God okay   and you had to know exactly in memory where it was move it to the distributor put it into one of the accumulators and add it take it back out of the distributor and put it somewhere else so it it was as basic as you can get and uh of course the speed of processing was very very slow but compared to anything then it was very very fast   right   so it everything is relative   thats true   twenty twenty years from now well well call up again and say what do you think of the new uh thought computers   thats true       right and theyll and theyll say  imagine those big clunkers   right   of big laptop computers way back one   yeah but i think theyre theyre excellent tools for people to learn how to use and id like to see them in grade schools right now i think they are in fact   does it yeah theres theres   the computer system uh instruction   going to say theres a big move for that   yeah   my uh my my sisterinlaw is a principal of a school   uhhuh   and she just switched but before she was in a um a in a in a different school and she wrote a grant with i think it was Apple or IBM one of the two   uhhuh   im pretty sure it was Apple actually to uh to get a whole bunchy of you know PCs into or PC type machines into the school for the kids to use and and it just according to her its just a wonderful thing kids go in and are able to work at their own pace and you know computers arent impatient   yeah   theyll sit there and wait forever if the kid doesnt want to answer for awhile or itll um itll you know the kids for those kids who really have a problem working with faster than the class or slower than the class it lets them go what shes finding now is that in evenings the parents will come in and do it too   oh yeah yeah but it has a lot of home uses too ive ive not i dont have mine hooked up to anything uh you know its just a stand alone but the abilities in the future will be networking throughout uh automatic builtin telephone
