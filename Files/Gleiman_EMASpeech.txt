Edward J GleimanSpeech before theEnvelope Manufacturers AssociationWilliamsburg VA October  Good morning ladies and gentlemenThe law provides that the Postal Service may from time to timerequest that thePostal Rate Commission recommend rates and fees that shallprovide sufficient revenues so that total estimated income to thePostal Service will equal as nearly as practicable total estimatedcosts of operating the Postal ServiceOn January th the Postal Service submitted such a requestseeking an additional  million dollars in revenue to begenerated by an overall average rate increase of approximately percent After lengthy deliberations during which the Commissionheld  days of hearings to consider  pieces of testimonypresented by  witnesses representing  participants includingthe Postal Service the Commission has concluded that the Waita minute I think I picked up the wrong presentation on my way outof the office yesterdayLet me try againGood morning ladies and gentlemenWhen Maynard invited me to visit with you I plumb forgot thatthe Commission would be in the final throes of the R ratecase in late October So while it would certainly be a pleasure tobe here under normal circumstances I want to extend a specialthanks to you for having me here today If for no other reason ithas provided an excuse to escape for a day the pressurecookeratmosphere associated with putting the finishing touches on a majorrate case decisionGood Lord willing and the creek dont rise or perhaps I shouldsay if the computers dont crash we hope to have that decision outon Monday November thMaynard suggested that I talk about the future about postalreform its impact on the Commission and other changes the postalcommunity may be facing Before I whip out my somewhat cloudycrystal ball I thought you might be interested in a brief outlineof the process currently associated with postal rate making Andas I talk about the process I will attempt to debunk a few mythsand set the record straight on what you may have heard at previousget togethers I will also talk about an issue that I believe hasgreater potential to impact the future wellbeing of the PostalService and the postal community than the much discussed diversionof transactional mail to electronic bill payingPrior to  postage rates were set by the Congress Ratesgenerally did not cover the costs of providing service soCongress appropriated tax dollars to make up the difference ThePostal Reorganization Act of  changed all that It replaced thePost Office Department with a new United States Postal Service andcharged it with operating in a more businesslike fashion Congresswould no longer set postal rates but it wanted to ensure that thepublic had an opportunity to be heard before the Postal Servicechanged rates or services Therefore it simultaneously establisheda separate independent Postal Rate Commission to provide an openprocess in which the public could participate in the development ofpostage ratesMyth Number One Contrary to what you may have heard or readalthough the PRC was not among the  recommendations of theKappel Commissionappointed by the President to study the futureof the Post Office Departmentneither did it spring forth like aphoenix from the ashes in some secret conference between House andSenate legislators Permit me if you will to correct the recordThe key elements were there the entire time I read from theconference report on the  Act at page The House bill containeda Postal Rate Board as an independentagency not part of the Postal Service The Senate amendmentcontainedan independent Postal Rate Commission within the PostalService The conference substitute adopts the House provision fora freestanding entitychanging the name to the Senate proposedPostal Rate CommissionPerhaps there is a lesson or two here for those who yearn for anew Kappeltype presidential commission as some sort of panacea tomakerecommendations to mold the future of the Postal ServiceCommissions study and recommend the President proposes and theCongress disposesas it sees fitCongress intended that mailers should be able to use the PostalRate Commissions proceedings to assure that some mailers were notcrosssubsidizing other mailers and to assure that postage ratesreflected the costs actually incurred to provide service Furtherby requiring the Service to justify rate and service changesCongress hoped to provide a check on inefficiencyEach of you probably has your own point of view on how well thesystem works to keep the Postal Service lean and efficient But Ihope you would agree that if mailers participate and if the PostalService is subject to public scrutiny the result is likely to bebetter than if proposals go entirely unreviewed A case in pointcan be found in the last omnibus rate case the R caseMailer participation in developing the public evidentiaryrecord was responsible in part for enabling the Commission to shavesome  millionalmost one thirdoff of the Services requestfor additional revenue As a result almost everyone received asmaller rate increase than would have otherwise been thecaseAnother example periodicals mailers stung by sharplyrising costs associated with the processing of their mail insistedthat postal officials join them in an effort aimed at findinganswers and ferretingintervenor told us on the recorda rocket shot compared tomost ratetype proceedings Moreover when the Commission doesattempt to shave some time off of the  months provided in thelaw representatives of mailers both large and small objectMailers want as much time as possible to examine the reams of datathe Postal Service provides in support of its proposals With theirmoney at stake Mailers prefer that things be done right ratherthan fast By the way the original  law contained no timelimit on rate cases The month limit was added after one of theearly cases overseen by an administrative law judge recruitedfrom another agency seemed to go on foreverSome think that we ought to go back in time ought to get rid ofthe Commission and replace it with not one but three administrativelaw judges to be borrowed from some other government agency Badidea But dont take my word for it Shakespeare wanted me toremind those who prefer a return to Admin Law Judges that Whatspast is prologue And Santayana asked me to add that Those whocannot remember the past are condemned to repeat itI mentioned that the Commission also has other responsibilitieswhich impact the postal community These include  approving bothchanges in existing services and the establishment of newservicesthose are known as classification cases  adjudicatingcomplaints from anyone who believes the Postal Service is notproviding rates or services as required by law  issuing advisoryopinions when the Postal Service proposes a substantiallynationwide change in the nature of its services and  our mostlyrecently assigned task providing Congress with annual reportsabout the costs and revenues of international mailFinally the Commission is given  days to consider appealsfrom those who contend the Postal Service has proposed closingtheir local post office without following the safeguard proceduresCongress wrote into lawThis brings me to Myth Number Three The Postal Service cannotclose a post office without first obtaining the approval of thePostal Rate Commission which supposedly takes four yearsThe facts are that the PRC gets involved in only appeals ofclosings and then for only  days Thats four months Not fouryears You cant get four years out of the equation even if you useWashington fuzzy mathAnd how many closings have been appealed According to a GAO report only  of  closings were appealed over a yearperiod I make that to be about  percent And what was thedisposition of those appeals you ask USPS affirmed in  cases cases dismissed and only  remanded on grounds that the USPShad not complied with the procedural requirements of the lawNumber of times the Commission took more than  days to rule onan appeal Zero Number of cases in which the USPS was told by thePostal Rate Many years ago when I was just starting my governmentcareer one of my mentors gave me some advice in the way of aquote purportedly from one Petronius Arbiter in  BCActually Im not opposed to changeto postal reform Duringmy time at the Commission weve made quite a few changes Weveissued rules to encourage experimentation by the Postal Service andestablished procedures for expedited treatment of noncontroversialcases Weve established a website on which we post overnight everydocument filed with the Commission and weve created a searchengine that enables everyone to word search these documentsWant to find out how many times and in what context the aspectratio of envelopes was mentioned in the current rate case Howabout in each and every case all the way back to  Try ourwebsiteChange is not the problem The problem ismy concern isthat much of what has been on the table in the way of postal reformover the past several years is tantamount to an uncontrolled anduncontrollable experiment Maybe it is my training in the sciencescoming to the fore or maybe its my belief that the Postal Serviceis too important to our economy and too intertwined in our everydaylives and livelihood to leave too much to chanceLet me make clear at this point that I have a great deal ofadmiration for Representative John McHugh and his staff In thealmost  years I spent on Capitol Hill I cannot remember more thana handful of instances in which a member invested more of him orherself in an issue And although I took issue with a number ofprovisions in his bill I consider it unfortunate that theChairman has run out of time in his search for the Holy Grail ofpostal reform It is unclear who if anyone will take up thechallenge in the th CongressIn the event that someone does take up the McHugh gauntlet andseeks your support I think it is important that you that mailersnot just blindly endorse a bill simply because its title includesthe phrase postal reformWhich rates would be lawful in this scenario The capped ratesthat do not cover cost or the rates that exceed the cap but covercosts Whats a Postal Regulatory Commissioner to do More to thepoint whats a mailer really likely to experience in the way ofrate increasesBy the way its not altogether clear that this price cap regimewould achieve one of its other principle objectives that is toput downward pressure on future cost increases Why Because thebill has an exigencies escape clause and another provision thatprohibits the PRC from taking any action that might impact labornegotiations No Im not suggesting that the last provision Imentioned be drop from any future bill I do think however thatsome consideration should be given to a statutory revenue cap asone means of adding a bit of starch to the spine cost containmentWithout an effective cost containment programand I have yet tosee onethe Postal Service reformed or not cannot be whatmailers want It cannot be a low cost efficient provider ofserviceThese examples are just a couple of the problems in the reformbill that many in the community wanted to put on a fast trackthrough CongressEveryone talks about how it has been  years since the PostalReorganization Act was enacted that the postal landscape is verydifferent that now is time to change the law Again I am notopposed to legislative reform but if we are going to put ourmoney on legislative reform we had better get it right becauseonce that next major postal billa reform billis enacted itmay be another  more years before we get a shot at fixing thingsagainAnd what would legislative reform mean for the PRC Ifsomething akin toHR were enacted the Commission would be neitherstrengthened norweakened It would be different It would berelegated largely to after the fact audits as opposed to itscurrent preapproved role And it would grow to perhaps three orfour times its current complement of  bodiesNow while we are figuring out what should be done in the way oflegislative change wethe postal community the Postal Serviceand the Postal Rate Commissionshould not just sit back and waitThere is much to explore much that can be done within the confinesof current law We need to push the edges of the envelopeallthemThe EMA is already working on a number of forwardthinkingprojects As one of the worlds slowest and worst typistsI guessthey call it keyboarding nowI especially like the idea ofenvelopes carrying information I can scan into my computer toconnect with a vendors website or with an information sourceLet me throw out a few of my ideas for change that are notconditioned on congressional action NSAs or negotiated service agreements have been a hot topicin the legislative equation NSAs are for all intents andpurposes not very different from narrowly drawn classificationproposals a number of which the Commission has received andapproved over the past few years If the Service has any suchproposals on the drawing board it ought to send them over Ifmailers have ideas they ought to submit them If someone thinks weneed to modify our regulations to encourage niche classificationcases let us know NSAs are doable under current law Why wait forlegislation if we can act now to drive costs out of the system andlower rates for qualified mailers Just before the R case was filed when many in thecommunity were concerned about the size of the Services request Isuggested that a case calling for rates to be phasedin over timemight help avoid the rate shock that comes with large double digitincreases This was not an entirely new idea It was a takeoff ona joint USPSPRC task force recommendation in the early s for afouryear rate cycle with a midcycle adjustment These proposalsreflected the purported desire of mailers for smaller andimplicitly more frequent rate increases We now seem to be in atwoyear rate case cycle Mailers are however understandablyconcerned over the cost of litigating these more frequent casesBut by phasing in rates they may be able to have their cake andeat it too smaller periodic increases and fewer cases tolitigate It is time I believe to dust off the task forcerecommendation andor to give some serious thought to the phasedrate approach I mentioned our website a bit earlier Weve been told thatgetting documents posted overnight and providing a search enginehas resulted in substantial savings to intervenors and the PostalService The Commission can and should do more in this area With alittle cooperation from the community I think we can implementelectronic filing and service of documentsIve already made several suggestions in the package servicesarea When I spoke to the Parcel Shippers Association in June oflast year I suggested that given the Services economies of scalein delivery alliances with other transportation or delivery firmsto carry their parcels the last milemade senseand would make dollars for the Postal Service Thisishappening already Ive also suggested that the Service explore making low weightParcel Post a wholesale only product and pushing low weightoverthecounter retail parcels into Priority Mail The pricedifferential between Priority Mail and single piece parcels is verysmall For just a couple of cents more an individual can send apackage Priority and if the individual purchases deliveryconfirmation it becomes actually less expensive to use the fasterPriority Mail service Faster service at a lower price meanssatisfied customersSpeaking of delivery confirmation it is currently available forPriority and Parcel Post The USPS has proposed extending thisservice to Standard mail My thought here Why stop with StandardThere are roughly a quarter billion pieces of FirstClass mail forwhich individuals purchase the more expensive Certified Mailoption Delivery of a Certified Mail piece is more costly to thePostal Service than handling a delivery confirmation pieceCertified mail requires the carrier to make a special trip to thedoor If the carrier is already equipped with a scanner fordelivery confirmation purposes the Service has an opportunity toavoid the timeand time is moneythat it takes the carrier tomake that special trip to the door Delivery confirmation providemore information quicker at less cost to both the Postal Serviceand the customerAs an old vaudevillian might say Ive got a million ofemWell maybe not that many but it is I think time to moveon I do want to assure you though that while I have been talkingtrees I have not lost sight of the forestLast October there was a congressional hearing at which theGeneral Accounting Office presented unverified Postal Serviceestimates of the impact of the diversion of FirstClassmailbills and paymentsto new technologies The lead on thestory was USPS volume to decline with a loss of  billion inrevenue At  cents a pop I make that to be just short of billion pieces of mail And the price of a stamp according to thestory it would increase by  centsThat is a pretty bleak picture However at the risk of beinglabeled a troglodyte may I suggest that if you scratch the surfaceof that picture you might find that a few rays of sunshine stillremain for hard copy mail While I have no doubt there will bediversion my uneducated guess is that the glide path will belonger and the incline not so steep Many believe that there willbe gains to offset losses in transactional mail volume Forinstance Bob Wientzen of DMA reported just a couple of weeks agothat high tech ventures are generating new volumes of hard copymail as what he called pure play Web companies launch cataloguesand direct mail campaigns to drive traffic to their Web sitesMaynard expressed similar views in a news article this past summerMoreover unless the Postal Service is incapable of shedding volumevariable costs or waits until  before adjusting FirstClassrates the price of a stamp does not have to go up by  centsUnless it waits until  to shore up its base volumedeclinesMay not be so severe What if Im wrong What if the worst casescenario does come to pass As I recall from the numbers in thatJuly th Atlanta JournalConstitution article there goes much ofthat  percent of envelopes that currently carry bills andpayments That is not a pleasant prospect but it is a heck of alot better than the prospect of losing a big chunk of the remaining percent of your business because an overreaching law restrictsthe sharing of personal information and results in direct marketingvolumes going southPersonal privacy ones right to control the use of his or herpersonal information is a hot issue It is a hard one to beagainst And it is a dangerous one to ignore either as anindividual or as a business personElements of the postal or mailing community or whatever youmight call it have been engaged in the privacy issue at both thefederal and state levels More often than not those involved havebeen the businesses that would feel directly the impact ofrestrictions on the collection and sharing of person datathelist companies the direct marketers Think about this if thedirect marketers and list companies are forced to cut back becauseof data restrictions wont that impact the manufacture of goodsthat are marketed Might it result in printers printing fewercatalogues Wont it impact the envelope manufactures And couldit not result in a decline in Postal Service volumesacrosstheboardThose members of the greater mailerpostal community who havenot been paying attention to the privacy issue must do so Theymust join with others in a broadbased coalition that ignoresdifferences they may have on traditional postal issues If there isless information and less prospecting there will be fewer salesFewer sales means fewer parcels to deliver whether by white truckswith an eagle or big brown trucks The community needs as awhole I believe to be proactive in pursuing of a rationalnationwide approach that addresses both the concerns the rightsof individuals and the needs of the business communityI cut my teeth on information policy and personal privacy issuesabout  years ago as project manager at the then Department ofHealth Education and Welfare I worked directly on implementationof the federal records Privacy Act of  and the  schoolrecords access law I support the cornerstone concept of theselaws known as fair information practices And I submit that thefederal privacy law governs the collection and use of personaldata by federal agencies and which provides agencies a modicum offlexibility is a reasonable point of departure for futurediscussions of either industry selfregulation or legislationI had best stop at this point since Ive taken more time andspouted off more than I should have But let me leave you with athought to keep in mind in the event you are asked to evaluate mypresentationThis fellow is flying a hot air balloon and suddenly realizes heis lost He cuts back on the hot air descends and yells to a manhe spots on the groundExcuse me can you tell me where I
