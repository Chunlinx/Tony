        so what is your favorite TV program   well probably my favorite TV program is Murder She Wrote i happen to be a mystery fan and uh programs such as Perry Mason and Ironside and Murder She Wrote and Columbo all of those uh are my my favorite kinds of programs   yeah uh um ive watched Murder She Wrote a couple of times but um i like mysteries and i do like Columbo but there what is opposite Murder She Wrote theres something else that i watch i think its that family home video show   uhhuh well the   that Famous Home Video is whats opposite it here i dont know up there but um i like that because it it really makes me laugh people send in have you ever watched that where they   yeah   no well i dont think we get it here   oh they send in they do videos of funny things that happen at home you know and then send it in and show it on TV and oh boy i tell you what its its hysterical   huhuh oh what kinds of things do they uh show   oh gosh well uh one that comes to mind is a lady i dont know what the heck she was doing in her dishwasher but she was in her dishwasher her head was in her dishwasher and her hair got caught   oh my word   and she couldnt get out and her hair it was and she was heavy kind of like me  and so what you could see was this big bottom sticking out of her of her dishwasher and her husband was   uhhuh   say he was videotaping this thing you know there she is caught in the dishwasher you know oh it was hysterical and   oh my word   just real funny things you know people skiing and doing funny things on in the water and you know just really its its really a good program i really enjoy that     uhhuh probably things that that there happen every day and we dont even notice them until someone videotapes them   i know it and then some the winner the one thats voted the best wins ten thousand dollars so you know   is that right   i often think gee i wish i had a video camera because i could sure use ten thousand dollars so but i like things like Evening Shade with Burt Reynolds i really enjoy that and uh     umhum yeah i saw that for the first time yesterday in the evening   i really like that thats a good show and i like Rosanne now i know not many people probably like Roseanne but   uhhuh yeah uh i have never seen her show but after hearing her sing the Star Spangled Banner anthem i will never watch her show     well she doesnt sing on her show but i i do enjoy seeing that   uhhuh   and uh so i like a lot of comedy stuff i guess you know but then i like the police things too Cops you know we have   yeah oh yeah right umhum   and i like that you know so i dont know i guess i just like a variety variety of things and every day i just tape Regis and Kathie Lee   do you oh yes thats a good program uhhuh   do you like them i watch them every day i tape them well not this week because its uh theyre on vacation so its just old tapes but   oh okay   but every i run my VCR while im at work i tape that and i watch it every evening when i come home and i dont know what it is about that show thats different about other talk shows     well i think that they uh they seem like they are friends with one another and with all of their guests rather than just interviewing   yeah and shes so cute and her and Frank and the baby and i dont know i just you know they took it off down here for a while uh oh gosh for about a year year and a half well   yeah   did they   yeah i guess about a year and so i missed her pregnancy and everything you know and when they took it off i have never called a station before or complained or anything when they took it off the air here i called the station and complained i said   uhhuh     you took my favorite program off the air and do you do you think itll ever be back and they said no we dont think it will be well that was channel eleven and now its on channel four   uhhuh   so im really thrilled at you know that they you that they have it here so   well great course i have to admit i i love uh when the fall comes i love uh football   oh   and i watch all the football games Monday night Thursday night and Sunday afternoon   my mother does too im not a big i used to be a football fan i dont know what happened im just not a football fan anymore   well and not everybody is   yeah but my mother does not miss a game and you just dont know she lives in California and i do not call her on Sunday in football during football season i just dont do it       you know she might call me during a halftime or after the game or something but i just dont call her and now theyre starting up with new football   yeah but uh i cant get too enthused about it yet it seems to me i have to feel that the fall weather to really do something uh with regard to football   its you think its seasonal you think it goes with the season   yeah i because i always hate to see it end in January id like to see it go on for a couple of months but football to me uh in real real hot weather it just doesnt uh doesnt click now i enjoy going to baseball games but i dont enjoy watching them on television and i dont enjoy watching basketball on television theyre theyre both well baseballs so slow   yeah   and uh basketball seems like all all that you can really see is run and shoot run and shoot run and shoot  and um       uh because the average person doesnt get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh develop develop and so uh uh i dont usually watch them ill listen to baseball and ill listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the world   but you watch it   but uh but uh no i wont watch it ill listen to it on the radio yeah while im doing something else but i wont sit still long enough to watch them go round and around and around to me that is very boring   oh listen to it yeah yeah   but i i dont watch i dont sit and watch for long periods of time anyhow   now see in Ohio you really have four seasons dont you   yes we certainly do   well we kind of do but ours  our it its hot here im in shorts     are you   and people have their air conditioners on already it has been hot and humid here and so but our summers sometimes start in June and they dont end till like November i mean its hot so we watch football in the heat here   umhum sure right i guess so   so i it might not matter Texans are real football minded people   um oh with the Dallas Cowboys although they havent done very well the last couple of years but uh theyll be back up there   oh oh well i know i think so i think they did better this last year so   yeah theyll theyll climb back up again and that Texas Stadium ive been there that is a phenomenal place   yeah people say they wish they had a roof on it though it doesnt look finished     well and i think thats maybe what i like about it in that so many of them are totally enclosed     ive never been in an enclosed one   oh i well i have and theyre very noisy and uh then of course ive been up to uh Cleveland Ohio where the Cleveland Browns play and thats just a wide open stadium and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable oh but um now go down to Cincinnati and they have a nice stadium down there but its its all open also   yeah yeah so Ohio has how many football teams two well so does Texas   two yeah yeah and then of course Indianapolis which is only a hundred miles away from us has the Colts yeah   thats right they have the Colts now like   so uh they  theyve got a lot of sports going on around here   yeah i went one time to um okay Minneapolis   uhhuh   to the uh Vikings i went to a Viking Bear game one year oh many years ago now my gosh its probably been twenty years and that was a real experience because there are some fans there and i guess thats a big game   oh yeah oh yeah well i uh im retired from education i worked thirty four years as a teacher and administrator in the Dayton here this the Dayton school system and uh several of my players uh players several of my former students uh played with Minnesota Vikings and then with the Cleveland Browns   oh oh how neat   yeah it was it was fun because uh they would call when they were with the Browns they would call and say we left tickets at the gate for you all come on up so we would hop in the car the next morning and drive up and   oh   we have tickets waiting for us   on thats wonderful oh thats what an experience to see your students you know grown up and playing football   yeah yeah oh oh sure one of them was grown up and was Chief of Police here   oh that must be neat to see what happens to them like that     yeah right when you see the ones who are successful and there are many of them around and uh makes me feel good to know i played one small part in their rearing   yeah you sure did what grade did you teach or   well i i uh when i first started out teaching it was uh at college level and then uh after we moved here to Dayton then i went to the high school level i really enjoyed that more and so then i taught the physical education actually uh with the i was the specialist in water safety and uh so i taught uh the  the physical education   oh my gosh   and swimming um on the high school level and then they just kept pushing me into administration and and i wound up as an assistant principal and then i went down to the central office and was part of a team to to to develop a program to evaluate schools and and to uh try to resolve problems within schools   so no wonder you like sports so you were a physical education teacher   yes sure i was also a gymnast when i was very small in a Czechoslovakian Turner Society and and yeah and had the opportunity of uh competing nationally and   oh thats wonderful   they had things that were similar to the Olympics uh the Czechoslovakian Turner Society did so it was it was exciting we competed on the rings and balance beam
