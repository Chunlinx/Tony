                                 Shooting Pool With Joe Camel            Mr Joseph Camel thecartoon tobacco mascot is currently facing charges by the feds that he hasknowingly and with profit aforethought enticed children to smoke cigarettes Heis not accused of hooking kids in the manner of a playground pusherhoweverhes never directly addressed children or been seen in their companyRather Mr Camel himself a habitual user of nicotine has been accused ofbeing way too cool in much the way that Joseph K was once accused by theauthorities of being way too guilty The very president of the United Stateshas put the case in these termsJoe Camel declares Bill Clinton tells minorsthat smoking is cool            Now thisis a charge of considerable interest For it to stick cool must be perceivedto be good or else associating it with smoking wouldnt be so dangerous thatthe ads have to be banned And Joe Camel must make smoking seem cool because ofthe life he leads as suggested in the ads that feature him So what does he doin these ads Among other things he plays in a blues band shoots pool withhis buddy camels rides a big hoggish motorcycle without a helmet drives aflashy convertible without fastening his seat belt and otherwise does awhole lot of hanging out in graphically interesting settings Mr Camel isnever seen doing any productive work of any kind is never portrayed wearingbourgeois clothing of even the Casual Friday variety he usually wears aleather jacket and is never seen in the company of middleclass camels whohave to work for a living            In short Joe Camel is not respectable He isto use thelanguage of cultural authoritariansan unproductive social parasite who livesfor his own pleasure He stays up all night in unwholesome places indulges inrisky behavior that threatens to make decent camels insurance premiums go upand surely hasnt phoned his aged mother in years And that isnt the worst ofit Joe is also a sexually charged throwback with predatory sensibilitiesnotorious for his lack of sensitivity to females It is obvious that he wouldbe unwilling to negotiate the stages of a sexual encounter as an equal Evenhis face has a phallic quality Indeed given the ubiquitous social messages ofwhat now constitutes enlightened masculinity a nurturing sensitivecholesterolfree character etc it would be interesting to know why JoeCamel is not perceived by youth as a criminal rather than as the Federal TradeCommissions wouldbe censors insist is the case as a model            Butadvertising being in large measure fantasy anyway lets you and I make Joeover Lets say we subject him to behavior modification of the ClockworkOrange sort putting him through some Pavlovian ordeal that takes the devilout of him Or is it Elvis were taking out of him Or Brandos The Wild OneOr Kerouac Or the dromedary version of Mailers beatera White Negro Letsgive Joe a job a sense of responsibility a life of achievement and acapacity for being a loving husband and a sacrificing father And oh yeahlets put a smoke in his mouth            You dont think a pitch like this will sellcigarettes Think again It sells more cigarettes than a lowlife like Joe Cameldoes including to juveniles An association with respectability has been thecentral image of alcohol and tobacco advertising for much of the century FromDewars Profiles to Miller Time a drink or a smoke has more often than notbeen portrayed as a reward for hard work an indulgence that the achievingbourgeoisie earns the right to allow itself            Foryears hundreds and maybe thousands of smokers in cigarette ads have beenlighting up at picnics on hiking trails or on horseback Yet the firstcommercial smoker to get hauled into court is the first one to have steppedinto a pool hall to have shrugged off respectability While the FTC is notconsciously playing the prude here there is a logic to cultural control towhich regulators are heir            Joe Camels character probably doesnt appeal tochildren but it may well appeal to adolescents by exploiting their sexualand social insecurities The campaign allows teenagers to appropriate someinexpensive American Cool an emotional style that developed in the wake ofWorld War I along with mass cigarette smoking In fact in the nine years thatthe campaign has been running Camels share of the underage smoking market hasgone up            But themajority of underage smokers dont smoke Camelsthey reportedly smokeMarlboros And if the only issue involved in attempting to ban acigaretteadvertising symbol were its effect on kids then the obvious culpritto focus on would be the Marlboro cowboy But hes not sitting in court hesout riding the range perhaps roping in kids when they really are kidsPerhaps not What any ads have to do with the decision to start smoking is notknown            Of course Joe Camel is a cartoon figure andto a certain set of mind ipso facto directed at little kids In factthe campaigns graphic style characters and situations are directed at anolder audience whereas the appeal of cowboys to little kids is too well knownto argue about            Youcouldnt invent a more striking contrast of characters than exists betweenCamels downtown urban punk and Marlboros mythically respectable horsemanThis longrunning campaign which has helped the brand become the worlds mostpopular portrays a disciplined man of experience who seems to embody a cowboycode of honor a traditional regard for women and the offer of aselfsacrificing friendship with other males who can meet his standards of whatit is to be a man Want his respect Buy a pack Perhaps hes next on theFTCs hit list That hed be in line behind Joe Camel is a lesson in culturalacceptability            Anyway if Joe Camel hasnt much in common with MarlborosJohn Wayne West he has plenty in common with a literary creation who isbecoming more relevant every day That figure is the protagonist of theoncefamous play The Bedbug by Vladimir Mayakovsky Russias greatfuturist poet and Bolshevik propagandist In  disillusioned by therevolution Mayakovsky wrote a protest play about the growing repressiveness ofthe regime He imagined himself frozen through  years of authoritarianismawakening in  into a riskfree world where people of his temperament wereno longer allowed to exist            What heemphasized about himself were his bad habits his desire to carouse the nightaway to run around with women to sing loudly and drunkenly and to smoke hishead off The sum of these unholy things Mayakovsky suggests is the feedingof his soul the making of his poetry Why did we shed our blood he asks anuncomprehending scientific Puritan if I cant dance to my heartscontent            In the end Mayakovsky is stuck in a kind ofzoo where curious people come to watch him do unhealthy things Look saysthe zoos director its now going to have what they called a smoke  Comesa voice from the crowd Oh How horrible And another cry The childrenRemove the children            It would be culturallyblasphemous to draw too close a parallel between an advertising symbol like JoeCamel and a tragic figure like Mayakovsky who shot himself the year after hewrote his drama about the interplay of freedom pleasure and risk On theother hand the horrified cries of Mayakovskys authoritarians will be ringingin Joe Camels ears as he roars out of town for the last time on his bigmotorcycle Because he still wont be wearing a helmet
