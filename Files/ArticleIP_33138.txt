Mailblamed his Soviet past The paper said that Yeltsin is essentially a partyhack schooled in the arts of personal survival through manipulation of rulesarbitrary acts and unpredictable alliances In this he is in the dark companyof most members of the Russian Duma and provincial legislatures a generationof former Soviet officials thrown into democratic forums for which they have noinstinct and little respect It will take more than one generation before theways of a bureaucratic dictatorship give way to those of a liberal democracywhatever Russias legal framework says The Independent of Londonconcluded that the episode only shows how abnormal a state Russia remainsutterly unschooled in the orderly democratic transfer of constitutionalpower            Somepapers pointed out the essential contradiction between Yeltsins repeatedprotestations about his commitment to democracy and his selection of asuccessor with little chance of legitimately winning a presidential electionThe

Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan who is under a death sentenceannounced that his Kurdistan Workers Party has renounced violence and iswilling to surrender its arms in exchange for Kurdish rights The South China Morning Post saidthat the offer gives Turkey another chance to deal with its largest and mostfractious minority in a reasonable way With luck and wisdom Ankara could nowend a bloody insurgency that has cost some  lives slowed economicdevelopment and given Turkey one of the worlds worst records in the humanrights field But doing so will demand more tolerance and flexibility than anyTurkish government has shown to date Ankaras preferred attitude towards its million Kurds is to deny they exist in an ethnic sense by contending theyare really something called Mountain Turks  The

sold from them in Julybut conservationists complain thatautomated bug sales are a step too far and teach children that livingcreatures are of no more value than tamagotchi electronic pets A clerk in thebeetle department of a Tokyo department store who has a pair of okuwagata stagbeetles captured from the wild on sale right now for just  told thepaper that the bugs might actually like it in a machine because they seem tobe comfortable in dark narrow spaces
