                                 A Modern Woman            Hermione Lees biography ofVirginia Woolf is a revelation Not that Lee offers any startling new gossipOn the contrary The facts that she juggles have sat in the public domain foryears and the story has been worn to threads by frequent telling Woolf wasborn Virginia Stephen in  the freakishly talented spectacularlycheekboned youngest daughter of Leslie Stephen a successful but depressiveLondon intellectual and Julia Duckworth a stoic beauty who brought to themarriage children of her own Virginias early years were drenched in bookchat but otherwise not so different from other crowded stifling Victorianyouths The children had a swarm of spinster aunts curious animalinspirednicknames like Ape and Marmot and not a moment of privacy            Then disaster struckstruck and struck again First Virginias mysterious and saintly mother brokeunder the strain of Victorian womens worknursing invalids running a staffof servantsthough the immediate cause of death was rheumatic fever Then herfather in his grief selfishly leaned on Virginias halfsister Stella forsupport and after a period of exhausted servitude she died too Virginiaspent her teens getting over a nervous breakdown the recovery was delayed byher halfbrother George who chased her around the house and fondled herWhen her father followed Julia and Stella to the grave Virginia and hersister Vanessa and their brothers Thoby and Adrian left their posh familyhome for the decrepit neighborhood of Bloomsbury They invited Thobys smartambitious Cambridge cronies Lytton Strachey Clive Bell and John MaynardKeynes over for unchaperoned partying Soon they began to talk about andexperiment with sex straight and otherwise except perhaps Virginia whoselibido at this stage was according to Lee dribbled away on childish crusheson maternal women Most of all Virginia wrote supporting herself with abrutal workload of reviews dreaming of delicate but radical new ways to tell astory            This isWoolfs back story as it were the preface to her bohemian celebrity duringthe s Even in the barebones narration its fertile Almost too fertilein factas open to selective interpretation as a Rorschach test Depending onwhom you consult following her apprenticeship in suffering Woolf became thewoman who wrote To The Lighthouse and The Waves  astreamofconsciousness pioneer and a cool ethereal priestess of highmodernism Or the ragefilled victim of abuse and feminist crusader of ARoom of Ones Own  Or to her detractors a frivolous gossip Luckily forus Lee isnt especially invested in any of these eyecatching slants Sheaccepts that all these versions of Woolf are more or less fair And shebelieves that Woolfs writing reflects a lifetime spent contemplating herstrange tangle of traits            For lack of a better word this is the most lifelikebiography Ive ever read Lee counts on our basic familiarity with Woolfsstory and this frees her up to tease it into all kinds of subtle themes inmuch the same way you or I might retrospectively organize our lives under suchmotley headings as Life Under Reagan or The Period When I Was EspeciallyClose to Jim A visceral early chapter on the houses of Woolfs childhoodtells us what sensory data the little girl would have absorbed the constantsmell of cigars the pale yellow shade covering the window that overlooked thesea Later chapters calmly walk us through some of the more hotly debatedWoolfian themes matching each exactly to its place in Woolfs life Femalefriendships supplied critical nurturing Lee says and the famous affair withVita SackvilleWest was a thrill but Woolf never saw herself as a strictSapphist As for her husband Leonard he earned Virginias complete loyaltyby stoically caring for her during her breakdowns but he comes across asstiff humorless and inclined to unconsciously pull male rank            Maybe itsthe unusual nonmustiness of Lees approach but I was struck by the number ofcurrent concerns that Woolfs life anticipates Living at the mercy of herquixotic brain chemistry she took notes on her moods observing when her headfelt cool and quiet or sizzling She was precociously attuned to theinterplay of mind and body far more so than her peers One also wonderswhether if Woolf were alive today she would join the hordes of writersabandoning fiction for the memoir Probably not Her ambition love ofmakebelieve and need to experiment would have driven her back to the novelYet she felt the impulse to tell her story directly Lee guesses that it wasbecause Woolf predicted in advance the ridicule of her male friends andliterary competitors that she kept herself from doing so Here is herdespairing diary entry after she visited a memoir club and read a chapteraloud I couldnt help figuring a kind of uncomfortable boredom on the part ofthe males to whose genial cheerful sense my revelations were at once mawkishand distasteful What ever possessed me to lay bare my soul            Lee demonstrates brilliantly the centrality ofthis issue of male censorship real and perceived to Woolfs writing Growingup in her fathers shadow Woolf felt perfectly comfortable writing like a smugVictorian patriarch But she understood that a tone of cool authoritativenessleft no room for her childhood catastrophes her anger at getting a girlspaltry education her palpable delight in reading To discuss such experiencesshe needed a less omniscient voice a new styleone that in its fragmentationwould become a hallmark of modernism But she was afraid to go too far toalienate all the genial cheerful men whose standards she continued tointernalize As a result Woolf constantly seesaws in her writing betweenrevealing and concealing To be perfectly honest I think the tension hurt herfiction Ive always admired her novels but found the experience of readingthem frustratingly indirect circular dissociative Now I begin to understandwhy            On theother hand Woolfs backandforth led to insights that escaped the malemodernists Lee argues that Woolfs essays are badly undervalued today andshes right Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown the defense of modernism shedelivered before a puzzled Cambridge audience in  seems in retrospectwiser and more realistic than just about everything else on the subject Inthat essay Woolf explained that she and Joyce and Eliot and the rest had nochoice but to abandon baggy old Victorianism Why Because as she famouslyproposed on or about December  human character changed and it was thewriters duty to explain this change to readers Note the humble attention tohuman character and readers not just to high art and artists Woolf stood upfor her peers but she also understood if people found her overweeninglyconcerned with style or found Eliot obscure or Joyce obscene a pimplyundergraduate She knew that modernism was a work in progress not a newsystem to be defended to the death            In Lees hands Woolfs feminism becomes more radical andmore flexible than one might think She was no dogmatist She even thoughtfeminist was a dead and corrupt word now that women had the right to earn aliving But later in life she argued that it was not enough for women to getrooms of their own in which to become towering dominant writers like men Shechallenged the ugly human desire to be towering and dominant She went asalways to the question of human character wondering if there might be a moraladvantage in the centuries women had spent as anonymous people of no statusShe played with the notion of a Society of Outsiders without office meetingsleaders or any hierarchy without so much as a form to be filled up or asecretary to be paid            Woolfs supple outsiderismmight seem to have worn pretty well But in the partisan s it wasdismissed as dotty and vague She sank into depression It didnt help thatfiction writing was becoming harder and that war was approaching Given thatWoolfs mind was beginning to cloud over again Lee thinks that her decision tokill herself by walking into the Ouse one day in the s was in its way abrave one But it cast a shadow over her life It made her story too readilyavailable to people who wanted to see her as a victim or a crusader or amartyr to art What Lees biography reveals is much more interesting Woolfdevoted herself to literature and believed in the rights of women but boththese passions were part of a humblerand therefore granderpursuit Gettingdown to the essential thing is how she put it when talking about literatureFreedom from unreal loyalties is the striking phrase in her late feministessay Three Guineas  In either case the goal was to see life a littlemore clearly
