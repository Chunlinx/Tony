        okay Scott lets uh talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university and     uhhuh do you have any do you have any kids or   i have some yes some children i have three boys and theyre all quite young and so we want to plan for their education were were saving right now and were getting   uhhuh umhum   bonds and and uh and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to how about yourself do you have any kids   right no im in graduate im in graduate school right now   so so i imagine youve gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college   yeah yeah definitely in fact im even going uh  selecting again for for my PhD its its a closed subject right now   very good what uh what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to   um well  i use uh uh uh i have used uh several techniques depending on what for undergraduate i i you know my my criteria were much different than than like for graduate school   umhum   um when i when i wanted to go to an undergraduates institution i was looking for something that was you know rather small and easy to get around you know   umhum   and what i would what i thought would be easy to get through   yeah what what you thought huh   yeah and and uh yeah my choice of graduate schools was uh you know it changed a whole lot i i got to where i i wanted to uh uh graduate with a little you know with a name behind me rather than uh   just the degree itself   yeah yeah so   well thats a thats thats good because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didnt have a lecture with uh hall with about   umhum umhum   fifteen other students competing for the professors attention   yeah   and uh but you i felt that i got a a pretty good uh undergraduate um   where where did you go   i went to Utah State University which is in Logan Utah   okay uhhuh   and the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their business College of Business was accredited and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth   uhhuh uhhuh   and so i i felt like number one you need you also need to see what kind of name the like you mentioned before the name the college and university can can give you   yeah   and another thing that uh another reason why i chose that was the the finances i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it that i wouldnt get through four three years of of the undergraduate work and and have to leave   uhhuh   and uh so i did a lot of talking with friends with family with uh counselors at high school and also read some   uhhuh   some books on on the subject at the at the library   uhhuh   and uh it was kind of unusual because my my two older brothers and i all went to three three different universities depending upon what our choice was so   right           hopefully we we chose the one that was best for us and i i felt very comfortable and good about that so i   umhum do you do you worry do you worry any about uh uh you being able i mean do you uh obviously youve taken precautions you know or or measures to uh try and pay for your childrens education but do you think that thats gonna be enough   i dont think so  i dont know the the way that tuition is increasing um   no   exponentially its its  its kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow  same pace that the college tuition is increasing i uh   yeah   yeah yeah i all i all i can hope for is that i land a professorship at a at a nice heavy university and   and that the your children can use the benefits of that university well that thats an excellent idea thats an excellent idea   yeah yeah   one thing that uh that we did uh and my parents and our family is that we werent able to afford um the kind of education that we all desired so my parents stressed that we get excellent grades and that we apply and try for scholarships   umhum   and uh scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldnt   umhum   and what these scholarship could not supply i was able to to work for and and save and and and get also my my brother um   yeah umhum   hes a hes a medical doctor right now he had to you know once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans and hes hes working to pay those off   umhum     so i i think that the uh you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that theres different options you can use and and uh the student loans are are a good option and   yeah yeah thats what thats  my biggest option right now   yeah yes and and as youre well aware that tuitions not cheap
