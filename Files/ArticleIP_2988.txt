                                 The Prosecution Never Rests            There is no such thing aseternal life in politicsunless that is one is lucky enough to secureappointment as an independent counsel In that case a lawyer is free toinvestigate more or less whatever catches his fancy for as long as he likesspending as much of the publics money as he deems necessary The passing of apetty scandal the resignation of a target even a change in administrations isno obstacle as we know from the many barnacleencrusted investigators stillhanging on Kenneth Starr who has been poking into Whitewater for three yearsis the least of them One special prosecutor is still deciding whether toprosecute Henry Cisneros the former housing secretary for understatingpayments to an exmistress Another has spent four years trying to naillongdeparted Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy for accepting free footballtickets from a poultry company Theres even a counsel holed up somewhere inWashington who is still on the verge of cracking the Department of Housing andUrban Development scandal which dates from two administrations and more than years ago            Independent counsels go on forever because they canno one has the power tofire themand because they have strong incentives to do so An ordinaryprosecutor may decide to forgo charges so that he can devote his energies to acase that is more important and easier to win But for the independentcounsel there is no other case Were he to announce that his scandal didntjustify criminal proceedings after all he would be declaring himself a failurewho had wasted the publics time and money After he returned to his lawpractice in the sticks no one would ever hear from him again Much better tokeep digging declare that indictments are just around the corner and hold offon releasing that final report just a few months longer            In retrospect it seems obvious that combining thesestructural pressures with the lugubrious personality of Lawrence Walsh was arecipe for zombification Coming out of semiretirement in Oklahoma City JudgeWalsh was  years old when he was handed responsibility for bringing tojustice the perpetrators in the IranContra scandal For an ambitious man whohad been frustrated in his career the appointment was a heavensent extrachance and it appeared at first to be a bit of brilliant casting In histhreepiece suits and high starched collars Walsh looked like a th century Presbyterian minister radiating an unflinchinghumorless rectitude He was the perfect foil for Marine cowboy Oliver NorthThe problem is that the image was too close to reality Walsh was a maddeningplodder and a stickler for detail with no ability to play politics or work themedia Faced with a publicrelations challenge that might have daunted the mostseasoned Washington operator he responded the only way he knew how bytrudging onward Like a pit bull on Prozac he clung to the trousers long afterthe leg was gone            The leadenaccount Walsh has produced more than a decade later reflects in microcosm mostof the foibles that afflicted his investigation As a piece of writing it isrepetitive unfocused and confusing It feels like it goes on for seven yearsThere are no surprises and no original ideas Walshs theory of the IranContrascandalthat some members of the Reagan administration tried to do an end runaround the Constitutionis not very novel But rather than presenting his caseto the reader Walsh remains obsessed with the minutiae of what went wrong whenhe tried to make his case in court Matters of subdoctoral interest such ashis offices battle for Iranian arms dealer Albert Hakims Swissbankaccountrecords fill chapter upon chapter In his litigious thickets Walsh losessight of the question of why anyone should still care            Walsh quite rightly points out that hisinvestigation was undermined at the outset by the congressional IranContracommittees decision to grant immunity to Oliver North and White House NationalSecurity Adviser John Poindexter who along with the conveniently deceased CIADirector William Casey appear to have been the chief conspirators in the plotDespite the extraordinary efforts of Walsh and his staff to insulate themselvesfrom the immunized testimony the unavoidable tainting of the prosecutionscase provided a basis for the US Court of Appeals to throw out Norths andPoindexters convictions Walshs first mistake which he acknowledges was notpitching a fit to try to prevent Congress from granting immunity to the chiefprotagonists His second mistake which he does not acknowledge was failing toadmit defeat after the grants of immunity predictably ruined his case Once theNorth and Poindexter convictions were thrown out there was little point in histrying to lock up other officials whose behavior while far from exemplary wasneither venal nor as outrageous as that of the ringleaders going free            It is atthe point when the initial convictions were reversed around  that Walshseems to lose touch with his judiciousness if not his deliberateness Insteadof conceding he redoubles his efforts As he keeps missing his targets hetakes aim at less and less compelling ones desperate to convict someoneanyone of something In five years after the scandal brokehecontemplates charging former Secretary of State George Shultz with lying toCongress This was simply foolish Shultz who opposed the originalarmsforhostages deal was the closest thing to a conscience inside the Reaganadministrations foreignpolicy team Belatedly persuaded that he cant convictShultz Walsh decides to go after former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinbergerinstead for concealing the existence of some of his personal notes ButWeinberger like Shultz was far from a black hat in the affair he too hadopposed the armsforhostages deal Indicting him was an exercise inprosecutorial pique doomed to fail After the  election when thelameduck George Bush pardons Weinberger Walsh is truly overtaken by rage andconsiders going after the expresident himself for obstructing justice By theend of his book Walsh has unwittingly painted himself as Ahab without a whaleflailing after targets large and small in his attempt to vindicate hiseffort            Of course Walsh never went after the biggest fish ofallRonald Reagan Though he was still thinking about indicting Reagan in late Walsh never found effective proof that Reagan was lying when he testifiedthat he hadnt known about the diversion of profits to the Contras Walshstheoryagain not a novel oneis that the presidents aides successfullyconstructed a firewall to prevent Reagan from being implicated in thescandal If this conspiracy worked the way that Walsh thinks it did it has yetto crack Walsh contends that Reagan must have known about the diversionbecause he chose to persist with the policy of arms for hostages even thoughmost of the American hostages in Lebanon were not released in exchange for themissiles that were shipped to Iran This is a pretty slim reed to hang Reaganon he was clearly obsessed with the hostages and clung to any hope of settingthem free And indeed three of seven were released in apparent conjunctionwith the arms sales which does not constitute an overwhelming failure howeverwrongheaded the armsforhostages policy may have been            With hindsight the wholeissue of what Reagan knew seems more a metaphysical question than a legalone Though Reagan may well have been informed of the diversion at some pointhe was probably sufficiently gaga by  and  that he did not really holdthe information in his head in any meaningful way Interviewed on videotape asa defense witness in the  Poindexter trial Reagan presented a sorryspectacle unable to recall his own foreign policy beyond generalities Walshdoesnt seem to grasp that Reagan is losing it He clings to the maddeninginconsistencies in the former presidents answers as if they actually meantsomething In  Walsh flies to Los Angeles to grill him one more timeReagan points at sights outside the window and tries to remember irrelevantanecdotes about Mikhail Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher This is the onlypoignant moment in the book Reagan has evidently let go Perhaps now that hesset his frustrations down in a book Lawrence Walsh will be able to do thesame
