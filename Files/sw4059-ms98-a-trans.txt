            think about what nursing home   well  my parents were both in them   uhhuh   and my fatherinlaw and its a tough decision to make   yeah   because boy it really confines the uh the people   umhum   and uh usually they dont care for it  and kind of put you on a guilt trip   yeah   but uh have you had any experience with them   well uh this my grandmother in fact uh has a personal care home and she keeps a couple of elderly ladies in her home   yeah   and uh i live i live with her and so uh its its uh my mother also does the same thing and uh its uh i think the quality of care they get is a a lot better uh   yeah   and a lot more personal but uh   but its still still not like home     no but uh i think its uh quite a bit better than than a nursing home i ive just seen   right   people just go down hill when they uh go into a nursing home   yeah   that seems to be uh   but uh you know and its hard to really know what kind of a home is run   yeah   unless you really know someone thats in there   yeah   and   you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too   yeah   that uh  yeah they may say its real bad uh just because they dont like it in there   yeah   whereas its you know usually pretty good uh  uh the one my fatherinlaw was in had uh oh God  entertainment every afternoon of some you know bingo or cards or whatever   uhhuh well thats good   yeah and uh and its easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during uh meal time if you can stand it   yeah   because they dont eat that too well   yeah   and uh go uh always you always have to check it for cleanliness too     im sorry what was that   well you have to make sure theyre clean   oh yeah   and they just had a incident in uh Dallas here   umhum   where the guys suing the nursing home he came in at ten in the morning check on his mom   umhum   and she was sick and uh went up to the front desk and said whats wrong with my mom and they said what is she sick we didnt know that       and here she died two hours later   uh oh   yeah so you know and  well theres an awful lot of variables in them   yeah yeah ive seen some good ones and uh ive seen some uh my other grandmother was in one and it was i guess they it wasnt too bad but she uh she was a good way away from her family and uh kind of by herself there and it was it i didnt really like going there at all it was it was not a pleasant experience but uh i think therere some good ones out theres some here in Atlanta that are closing down  its   oh   apparently a shaky business right now   well i think Medicare and Medicaid payments are uh kind of tightening up on it   yeah   but uh you know in some of them some of them try so darn hard but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful   yeah   is ever ending   yeah it is uh one of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently       showing some signs of Alzheimers and uh shell my grandmotherll put her to bed and uh shell get up you know anywhere from five to ten times and wonder where the bedroom is and you know that kind of thing so   well its around the clock care   yeah it uh it takes a lot of patience   yeah an awful lot   but   and and gentleness too   yeah she  shes shes pretty good with them though she does a real good job and uh oh i you know i would i would probably throw up my hands and quit but she just you know turn around put her put her back to bed   yeah   you know which is good so i i hope i can provide that kind of care for my grandmother you know shes still going pretty strong but uh uh i i dont think i would wanna turn her over to a nursing home i id like to be in and  i think thats the position of a lot of people but they cant afford it you know   costs a bunch my motherinlaw is uh eighty two and wed probably put her in the same home that
