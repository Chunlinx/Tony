                                 Soccer Mom Nonsense            Soccer when I was growingup in the s was a still an esoteric sport To find matches we of theMenomenee Boys Club had to travel a long way from the genteel precincts of theNorth Side of Chicago Generally our opponents came from ethnic enclaves inthe distant suburbs On almost a weekly basis we were humiliated by teams ofPolish Ukrainian and Lithuanian extraction whose members had been playingsince just after birth Their mothers who surrounded the field terrified ourmothers by abusing the referees in thick Slavic accents We believed theylocked their boys in the sausage shed as punishment for missing shots            Thesocial complexion of the game has changed No longer a mere bridge betweenlimousine liberals and the oncecaptive nations soccer has become asmainstream as Little League baseball Indeed the sport is now so populist thatin the opinion of all the experts it is soccer moms who will determine theoutcome of next months election According to a lead story in the New YorkTimes  published the day of the first presidential debate soccer moms havebecome the most soughtafter voters of the campaign season Following thedebate the buzz on NBC was all about this emergent group and how thecandidates had tried to woo it The idea is that while most other demographicsegments are largely committed soccer moms make up a volatile and hencecrucial constituency            Who exactly we must ask are these soccer moms who holdthe nations fate in their hands They can be found a CNN correspondentinforms us shuttling the kids to practice in minivans nervously pacing thesidelines juggling the demands of family and career Well naturally but whatsort of women take their kids to soccer practice According to one SouthCarolina paper soccer mom is a wellheeled superparent whose primary missionin life is to do too much for her children She got on a waiting list early forthe right daycare center sent junior to Montessori started violin lessons at private school the same year and the next yearsoccer According to theRocky                Mountain                News  however soccer mom is financiallystressed Opinion is similarly divided on her employment status In the viewof the Cleveland                Plain                Dealer  soccer mom is a careerwoman who has temporarily taken up child rearing According to theBuffalo                News  however she is balancing the demands of work andfamily The consensus seems to be that soccer moms are some subset ofmiddleclass white suburban women They care about their kids as opposedpresumably to urban rap moms who do not and they are incredibly busy Ifyou cant find a soccer mom for your story dont worry Part of the shtick isthat she hasnt got time to talk to reporters            Nexis thejournalists friend allows us to trace the historical evolution of the termThe first reference to a soccer mom that turns up is from  and involvesthe tawdry tale of a Ludlow Mass man who absconded with  raised forthe benefit of a local soccer league Theres very little more until a SusanSmithtype tragedy in  when a soccer mom in California got so stressed outthat she shot her two daughters and then tried unsuccessfully to killherself The application of the term to politics goes back only to last yearwhen a Democratic candidate for the Denver City Council last year describedherself as a soccer momand won Credit for this years coinage apparentlygoes to Republican consultant Alex Castellanos who made ads for Phil Grammduring the primaries and now works for Bob Dole See a sample of his work inthis weeks VarnishRemover The working soccer mom is the swing voter of this electionCastellanos told the Wall                Street                Journal  back before theDole campaign signed him up full time And she is not going to trust a guy whoargues for the need to own an assault weapon Shell trust a guy who can feelher pain            If the phrase soccer moms has rapidly becomepart of the political lexicon it may be because it is cleverly positioned atthe intersection of several different trendsthe rise of soccer as amiddleclass pastime the demanding lives of working women the diversificationof the suburbs the popularity of the Dodge Caravan and so on Yet there issomething intrinsically misleading about the category and indeed about allsuch categories The outcome of the  congressional election was supposedlydetermined by the medias ideal voter of that year the Angry White Male wholoved guns and beer while hating government and liberals What one wondershappened to Angry White Male Did he die in a hunting accident Did he go onProzac What about the Perot voters of  who are by definition thelargest swingvoting block in the country Why arent they deciding theelection The notion that there is a single demographic group that determineseach election then recedes back into the anonymity of the general populace isuseful for political consultants and reporters But as the impermanence of suchcategories suggests they are usually clichs that obscure as much as theyreveal            Thesoccer mom is this years hula hoop says Harrison Hickman a Democraticpollster Hickman points out that married women in general tend to be veryproincumbent which somewhat undermines the argument that voting for Bush in and Clinton in  represents some sort of tectonic shift But even in married women split  for Clinton Bush and Perot respectivelyIn Hickmans view the soccer mom segment is either a group thats so small asto be meaningless or so large that differences between them are more importantthan similarities among them Narrowly defined as married collegeeducatedsuburban women with schoolage children soccer moms constitute only  percentor  percent of the electorate Broadly defined as suburban white women withschoolage kids they add up to  percent or  percent But then as Hickmanpoints out that  percent covers both workingclass women who live intwobedroom ramblers and professionals in Westchester County with inheritedwealth As voters these women have little in common from election toelection            Of course both these groupsthe Roseannes and the MurphyBrowns you might sayare currently leaning heavily for Clinton The gendergap has turned into a gorge this year with women in all categories favoringthe president by a point margin according to the most recentNBC Wall                Street                Journal poll Among soccer momsthis isactually a category in the pollClinton is ahead by  percentage points Ifthe election were very close such a bulge might make a difference But as GuyMolineaux of Hart Research points out This year the gender gap has gotten tothe point where all groups are trending Democraticsoccer moms bowling momsyou name it Molineaux also points out that in polling it is a truism thathigher up the socioeconomic ladder women tend to vote more differently fromtheir husbands So its hardly a surprise that soccer moms are somewhat moreproClinton than bowling moms            Another pollster MarkMellman points out that the big swing between Clintons victory in  andthe Republican triumph of  was among men not women And the same seems tobe true of the swing back toward the Democrats this year Soccer moms whoeverand however many they are are less flightyand thus less crucial to theelectionthan their husbands            This years conception of thecrucial swing voter in other words seems especially muddled and misleadingBut it doesnt matter much By the next election season some other clich willhave emerged and we wont have soccer moms to kick around anymore
