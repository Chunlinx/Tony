                    Background        NFAT Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells is a family        of transcriptional activators that stimulate the expression        of genes including those encoding immunomodulatory        cytokines       The transcriptional effects of        individual NFAT family members including NFATp NFATc        NFAT NFATx and NFAT are beginning to emerge For        example NFATp NFATc and NFAT participate in the        activation of T and B cells    NFATc appears to be        critical for proper cardiac musclecell differentiation          and NFAT functions in cardiac hypertrophy          NFATx has been implicated in development of immature        thymocytes   NFAT is involved in the transcriptional        regulation of osmotic stress response genes           All NFAT proteins except NFAT exist as phosphoproteins        and are maintained in the cytoplasm of resting cells             NFAT nuclear localization is regulated by the        action of a specific phosphatase and a number of kinases                    In the case of        T cells antigen stimulation elicits a calciumdependent        signaling pathway that results in the activation of        calcineurin which directly dephosphorylates NFATp in        preparation for nuclear import    Once in the        nucleus NFAT can bind DNA elements in target promoters        often in association with other resident and coinduced        nuclear proteins          Sequence comparison of NFAT proteins revealed that the        DNAbinding domain and a region referred to as the NFAT        homology region NHR share sequence similarity while        other regions of the NFAT proteins share little or no        sequence similarity a schematic of NFATp is shown in        Figure A   The DNAbinding domains are similar among        all NFAT members       and allow NFAT        proteins to bind DNA with sequence specificity as monomers          NFAT proteins except NFAT contain NHRs located        Nterminal to the DNA binding domain that function to        regulate nuclear localization in cells     NFAT        proteins are highly phosphorylated in the NHR and the        phosphatase calcineurin binds directly to sequences in the        NHR          Regions outside of        the NHR and DNA binding domain are thought to contain        transcriptional activation domains For example the N and        Cterminal regions amino acids  and         respectively of murine NFATp function as activation        domains when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain in        transient transfection assays in Jurkat cells   The        Cterminal regions of NFAT proteins are unique in sequence        and may be responsible for functional differences among        NFAT family members        A number of activators can interact with NFAT to        potentiate synergistic activation of transcription on        NFATresponsive promoters that characteristically consist        of multiple NFATspecific sites One example is the        interleukin IL promoter which contains five NFAT        binding sites in a region spanning  bp upstream of the        TATA box    Four of the IL NFAT sites are part of        composite elements consisting of NFAT and AP sites that        direct the cooperative binding of NFAT proteins and AP        components   In biochemical experiments the        DNAbinding domains of NFAT proteins with the exception of        NFAT are sufficient for cooperative DNAbinding in        association with FosJun heterodimers     As        supported by structural analysis of the NFATcJuncFosDNA        complex physical interactions between the DNA binding        domain of NFAT and the basic leucine zipper regions of cJun        and cFos enhance their interaction with DNA          To date biochemical analysis of NFATp and other NFAT        members has been conducted using only portions and not the        fulllength versions of these proteins Recovery of        smaller soluble truncated forms of NFAT proteins is        feasible relative to the more difficult task of isolating        active forms of fulllength NFAT proteins Although such        domainbased investigations have been constructive in        studying the activity and the properties of the NFAT        DNAbinding domains a biochemical analysis of        transcriptional activation and regulated nuclear        association of NFAT necessitated the characterization of        fulllength proteins This is mainly because the domains        exhibiting the transactivation properties and those        controlling nuclear association are located in regions        flanking the central DNA binding domain We therefore        established protocols for expressing and purifying        fulllength recombinant human NFATp Utilizing a        reconstituted transcription system we found that NFATp is        a bona fide transcriptional activator and that activation        requires regions of NFATp outside the DNA binding domain        In addition we discovered that human NFATp produced in        insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus is a        phosphoprotein that demonstrates calcineurinregulated        association with nuclei in vitro                    Results and Discussion                  Expression and purification of Nterminally tagged          NFATp          We chose to begin our analysis of NFAT proteins in          vitro by working with human NFATp B isoform amino acids           Figure A A recombinant baculovirus was created          for the expression of full length human NFATp with an          Nterminal HA tag HANFATp was purified from          baculovirusinfected Hifive cell extracts using antiHA          affinity chromatography followed by elution with an          HAepitope peptide Figure B The expressed HANFATp          protein was visible above background in infected Hifive          cell extracts and was efficiently depleted by the antiHA          resin Figure B This purification resulted in protein          that was nearly homogeneous We also found that HANFATp          could be purified from cell extracts by DNA affinity          chromatography using an immobilized double stranded          oligonucleotide containing two high affinity NFAT binding          sites followed by elution with NaCl Figure C                          HANFATp binds DNA alone and cooperatively with          cJuncFos          To test the DNA binding activity of recombinant          HANFATp and the ability to bind DNA cooperatively with          cJuncFos we performed DNase I footprinting We used a          DNA fragment from the human IL promoter that contains a          high affinity NFAT site  NFAT site and a composite          element consisting of a low affinity NFAT site and a low          affinity AP site to which the DNA binding domain of          NFAT has been shown to bind cooperatively with AP          proteins    When increasing amounts of HANFATp          were added to IL DNA in the absence of cJuncFos the           NFAT site was protected from DNase I digestion but          as expected DNase I digestion of the composite element          was unaffected Figure  lanes  In other studies we          found the observed equilibrium dissociation constant            obs K           D  of recombinant HANFATp for a high          affinity NFAT site mouse IL promoter to be  nM data          not shown cJuncFos alone protected the AP site of          the composite element Figure  lane  When increasing          amounts of HANFATp were added to IL DNA in the          presence of cJuncFos clear protection of the entire          composite site was observed Figure  lanes  From          DNase I footprinting studies Figure and data not shown          we conclude that recombinant HANFATp binds DNA both on          its own and in cooperation with AP proteins cJuncFos          and cJuncJun                          HANFATp activates transcription in a reconstituted          in vitro system          We tested purified HANFATp for the ability to          activate transcription in vitro In designing an          NFATpresponsive DNA template we positioned three          highaffinity NFATbinding sites upstream of the          adenovirus Eb TATA box and the CAT gene RNA transcripts          produced from the NFAT            EbCAT plasmid in vitro can be          detected by primer extension Initial in vitro          transcription studies were performed using a nuclear          extract from unstimulated Jurkat T cells As shown in          Figure A HANFATp activated transcription under these          conditions Activation was dependent on the NFAT sites in          the DNA template since a template lacking NFAT sites did          not respond to HANFATp Figure B          Although synergistic transcriptional activation          presumably resulting from the cooperativity between NFATp          and AP has been well established NFATp transactivation          in the absence of AP has not been demonstrated          directly For example even though the NFAT sites in the          DNA template used in the transcription experiments in          Figures Aand Bwere high affinity NFAT binding sites          that were not part of a composite element it remained          possible that AP proteins in the nuclear extract          contributed to the activation observed An analysis of          the transcriptional properties unique to NFATp required          the use of a reconstituted transcription system that is          responsive to human NFATp independent of AP activity          To this end we used an in vitro human RNA polymerase II          transcription system reconstituted from highly purified          native n and recombinant r proteins including          rTFIIA rTFIIB nTFIID rTFIIE rTFIIF          nTFIIH and nRNA polymerase II Using a promoter          containing five high affinity AP sites we found that          this transcription system responds well to recombinant          cJuncFos but does not respond to cFos alone Figure          C This experiment demonstrates that the purified          transcription system is largely if not entirely devoid          of AP proteins When NFATp was added to the          reconstituted transcription system it activated          transcription to high levels from the DNA template          containing three high affinity NFAT sites Figure D          This demonstrates that NFATp is a bona fide          transcriptional activator                          Activation domains of NFATp are required for          transcriptional activation in vitro          Functional analysis of regions of murine NFATp fused          to the yeast GAL DNA binding domain using transient          transfection assays detected two distinct transactivation          domains within the N and Cterminal regions of NFATp            In this study however transcriptional activation          by NFATp was not dependent on the identified          transactivation domains The minimal DNAbinding domain          of NFATp was sufficient to stimulate reporter gene          activation presumably by recruitment of endogenous AP          components through cooperative DNA binding It is not          possible to assess the true transactivation function of          NFAT proteins in reporter assays that use a promoter          comprised of NFATAP composite elements in cells with          high levels of endogenous AP proteins Our finding that          recombinant HANFATp activates transcription in a          reconstituted transcription system provided compelling          evidence that NFATp is a bona fide activator If NFATp          acted alone to stimulate transcription in the          reconstituted transcription system then the activation we          observed would be dependent on the activation domains of          NFATp We therefore applied in vitro biochemical methods          for the characterization of NFATp functional domains          Recombinant baculoviruses were created for the          expression of fulllength NFATp amino acids  and          the minimal DNA binding domain of NFATp amino acids           fused to GST GSTNFATp and          GSTNFATp were expressed in insect cells          purified on glutathione sepharose beads and eluted with          glutathione Figure Ashows the purity of these two          proteins as assessed by SDSPAGE and staining with          coomassie brilliant blue Both proteins were competent          for binding a high affinity NFAT site when tested in          electrophoretic mobility shift assays Figure B The          transactivation properties of the two proteins were          tested by in vitro transcription using the reconstituted          transcription system and a DNA template consisting of          three high affinity NFAT sites upstream of the adenovirus          major late core promoter and a  bp Gless cassette As          shown in Figure C GSTNFATp activated          transcription while GSTNFATp did not activate          transcription Thus regions outside of the minimal DNA          binding domain were required for transcriptional          activation in a reconstituted transcription system Taken          together our results directly demonstrate that NFATp is          a transcriptional activator                          Recombinant HANFATp is phosphorylated and exhibits          regulated association with nuclei in vitro          In unstimulated T cells NFATp exists in a highly          phosphorylated form that when analyzed by SDSPAGE has an          apparent molecular weight that is significantly larger          than its predicted molecular weight     When T          cells are stimulated NFATp is dephosphorylated by          calcineurin and it migrates farther on SDS gels than its          phosphorylated counterpart Similarly when NFATp is          purified from unstimulated T cells and subsequently          dephosphorylated by calcineurin in vitro its migration          on SDS gels increases ie its apparent molecular weight          decreases     Most of the many phosphorylation          sites in NFATp are in the Nterminal region of the          protein    Upon purifying recombinant HANFATp          we noticed that the protein migrated at an apparent          molecular weight similar to the native NFATp in          unstimulated T cells approximately  kD when compared          to size standards This led us to hypothesize that the          recombinant HANFATp purified from baculovirus infected          insect cells was phosphorylated To test this hypothesis          and to determine if phosphorylation of a distinct region          of HANFATp was responsible for aberrant migration in SDS          gels we expressed and purified fulllength HANFATp and          three deletions HANFATp HANFATp and          HANFATp All four proteins were expressed in          insect cells from recombinant baculoviruses purified by          antiHA affinity chromatography and eluted with          HAepitope peptide After purification we treated the          four proteins with a combination of calcineurin and          calmodulin to remove phosphates attached to serines and          threonines on the recombinant proteins The phosphatase          treated proteins as well as mock treated controls were          resolved by SDSPAGE and visualized by silver staining          As shown in Figure A the apparent molecular weight of          fulllength HANFATp was significantly decreased by the          phosphatase treatment demonstrating that recombinant          HANFATp purified from insect cells is phosphorylated          The shift in migration of HANFATp was dependent on both          calcineurin and calmodulin and was not efficiently          produced with other phosphatases data not shown Of the          three deletion proteins only HANFATp showed a          change in migration upon phosphatase treatment the          positions at which both HANFATp and          HANFATp migrated on SDS gels were not affected          by phosphatase treatment Thus the Nterminal region of          NFATp amino acids  was required to observe a          phosphorylationdependent decrease in migration of the          recombinant HANFATp This suggested that the major          phosphorylation sites on insect cell produced NFATp were          in the Nterminal region as is the case for native NFATp          in mammalian T cells   This was confirmed by          performing mass spectrometry on peptides recovered from a          tryptic digest of recombinant NFATp W Clements and J          Goodrich unpublished data          The phosphorylation state of NFATp controls its          nuclear localization in cells Specifically          phosphorylated NFATp is cytoplasmic and upon          dephosphorylation NFATp accumulates in the nucleus            Upon discovering that recombinant HANFATp was          phosphorylated in its Nterminal region we asked if the          phosphorylation state of HANFATp would influence its          ability to associate with nuclei in an in vitro assay          Nuclei were prepared from HeLa cells HANFATp was either          treated with calcineurin and calmodulin or mock treated          and the two proteins were then mixed with the nuclei          After incubation nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation          and thereby separated from unbound protein which          remained in the supernatant The nuclei were washed and          protein associated with the nuclei as well as protein in          the supernatants was solubilized in SDS sample buffer          resolved by SDSPAGE and analyzed by protein          immunoblotting with antiHA antibody As shown in Figure          B the majority of phosphorylated HANFATp was found in          the supernatant and not in the pellet while          approximately  of the dephosphorylated NFATp was found          associated with nuclei Moreover when HANFATp          which was not highly phosphorylated was tested in the          nucleiassociation assay it was primarily found in the          pellet with the nuclei regardless of whether it was          treated with calcineurin or not data not shown Taken          together these data lead us to conclude that the          phosphorylation state of recombinant HANFATp can control          its association with nuclei in vitro in a manner that is          very similar to the regulation of nuclear association          observed for NFAT proteins in cells                            Conclusions        We have found that human NFATp is a bona fide        transcriptional activator and that regions outside of the        central DNA binding domain are required for NFATp to        activate transcription Our experiments in a reconstituted        transcription system lacking contaminating AP proteins        and using DNA templates with high affinity NFAT sites        demonstrate that NFATp can function as a transcriptional        activator on its own We have also shown that recombinant        NFATp purified from insect cells is a phosphoprotein that        exhibits association with nuclei in vitro only after        dephosphorylation by calcineurin The recombinant full        length and deletion mutants of human NFATp used in the        studies described here as well as the methods that we have        developed will be valuable for future biochemical studies        of the function of NFATp in DNA binding transcriptional        activation phosphorylationdephosphorylation and nuclear        association                    Materials and Methods                  Plasmids and baculoviruses          A plasmid pREPNFATp was provided by Tim Hoey          Tularik Inc   pBSKS NFATp was generated by          digesting pREPNFATp with BssH II and Dra I filling in          the ends with Klenow and ligating the resulting fragment          into the Sma I site of pBSKS  pVLHAXNFATp was          generated by subcloning a fragment excised from

NFATp translational start site ATG was generated in          two steps A region of NFATp spanning the translational          start site ATG and an internal Mro I restriction site was          amplified by PCR creating a product with an Nde I site          at the translational start site ATG as well as an          upstream Xba I site The PCR product was digested with          Xba I and Mro

EcoR          I the NFAT DNA fragment was isolated and ligated into          the Sma I and EcoR I sites of pVLHAX A          pVLHAXNFATp was made by subcloning a Nde I           Sma I fragment from pGEXNFATp J Goodrich          unpublished into the Nde I and Sma I sites of          pVLHAX          pVLGSTNFATp was created by subcloning a Nde I  EcoR          I fragment containing the NFATp cDNA

singlestranded          pBSKS NFATpNdeI for sitedirected mutagenesis with          two oligonucleotides a unique inframe ATG codon          contained in an Nde I site was created in place of the          codon for amino acid  using an oligonucleotide of          sequence CATCTGCAGCATCCATATGACTGCATCCCTC and a stop          codon was created in the NFATp cDNA after amino acid           using an oligonucleotide of sequence          GTTGAAAGACAATAAACAGAATTCTGCCTGGTCTATG In the          second step the Nde I EcoR I fragment from          pBSNFATp was ligated into the Nde I and EcoR I          sites of pVLGST          pNFAT            EbCAT used as template DNA in          the in vitro transcription assays was created by          inserting three direct copies of the murine IL high

a DNA fragment          containing the three NFAT sites was recovered from the          digestion of the pNFAT            EbCAT with Xba I and ligated into          the Xba I of pML gift of J Parvin

preparation of HANFATp Hifive cells were          infected with the HANFATp virus for  hr at C Cell          were harvested by lowspeed centrifugation and          resuspended in lysis buffer  mM Tris
