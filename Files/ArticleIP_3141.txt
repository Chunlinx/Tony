                                 The Luck of the Irish            Typically setting off bombsin crowded places doesnt make you a hero in Hollywood although it might wellwin you a supporting role as a villain But the rules are different for theIrish Republican Army which has been bombing civilian targets in Great Britainfor  years While the movies routinely turn other terrorists into gun fodderfor the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger IRA crusaders almost always play therole of the tragic troubled and ultimately noble Good Guy            Take somerecent cinematic excursions into the Troubles Novembers The Jackalfeatured Richard Gere as a former IRA sharpshooternot bomberlet out ofprison to stop a mercenary terrorist played by Bruce Willis Gere is avirtuous hero throughout so much so that at the films end the authoritiesblithely grant him his freedom Similarly last years The Devils Owngave us Brad Pitt confronting corrupt gangsters and dying a romantic death forthe Ireland he loved And Neil Jordans Michael Collins sympathetically portrayed Collins and his comrades in the  Irish warfor independence from Britaina war won in part by Collins strategy ofbombings and latenight assassinations            The latest of the freeIreland films Jim Sheridans TheBoxer  features Daniel DayLewis as a former IRA member weary of violenceafter  years in prison This film is more sophisticated than the others andit explicitly condemns violence in a way most IRA films dont But it toodraws careful distinctions between bad terrorists represented by a rogue IRAagent who tries to murder DayLewis and good terrorists represented by theIRA leadership which tries to protect him            We are talking aboutHollywood of course which means that violenceparticularly politicalviolencemust be repudiated in the end So nearly every IRA film concludeswith the heros death as both Michael Collins and The DevilsOwn do Most also pay lip service to the idea that murder is not thesolution to political problems generally by making the hero a regretful killerwho wishes he could just put down the gun Yet all these films are suffusedwith a sense of the basic justice of the Irish nationalist cause and more thanthat of the purity of the motives that drive the IRA Members are portrayed asascetic and hardnosed men you can respect even if you dont agree with themIn another SheridanDayLewis collaboration In the Name of the Father in which DayLewis plays a man framed for an IRA bombing the oneperson in prison who stands for authority and justice is an IRA leader InThe Jackal  characters refer to Geres passion and fire in explicitcontrast to the chill cynicism of Willis whose only cause is money            Even whenIrish terrorists do seem indiscriminately violent or crazy it turns out theIRA isnt to blame In Patriot Games  militants try to killHarrison Ford and his family in Blown Away  a lunatic IRA mansets off bombs all over Boston and in The Boxer  the rogue agent killsan old man beats women and bombs pubs Yet in every case the villains arenot true IRA members but loose cannons who have broken away from theorganization The IRA doesnt favor random terrorist activity splinter groupsdo            This is a distortion of course Since at least the IRA has supported plenty of random terrorist activity in its quest toreunify Britishcontrolled Northern Ireland with independent Ireland NorthernIreland was split off from the rest of the country in  as part of thepeace agreement that ended the Irish war for independence an agreementnegotiated by Michael Collins For nearly five decades after that the IRAexisted only as a shadowy fringe group But the turmoil of the s duringwhich a movement for Catholic civil rights led to sectarian violence broughtthe IRA back into the limelight When British paratroopers gunned down  peacemarchers in Derry in  the IRA inaugurated a new campaign of violence            Since theProtestant majority in Northern Ireland wants to remain a part of GreatBritain and since Ireland itself has shown little interest in reunificationthe IRAs prospects for success through political channels have always beenlimited Instead it has pursued a strategy designed to make the Britishpresence in Northern Ireland too costly for the British public to endureBombing the Grand Hotel in Brighton mortaring Heathrow Airport and settingoff bombs on the London docks were actions meant to remind the British of whatwas happening in Belfast In recent years the IRA has shown a greater interestin solutions short of reunification It obeyed a ceasefire between August and February  and agreed to another last July But the organization hasnever repudiated the use of terrorism or the targeting of civilians            So why does Hollywood give the IRA this special treatmentFirst theres the appeal to Americans of the Irishor at least of ouridea of Irishness Americans imagine the striving suffering Irishwomen and theharddrinking hardfighting workingclass Irishmen to be the sort of peoplewho founded and now form the backbone of our own country IRA heroes look andsound enough like Americansthat is like white Americansto make visceralidentification a snap Aside from race after all its hard to imagine why IRAmembers make more sympathetic heroes than members of the African NationalCongress IRA members arent living in camps in the desert either Insteadtheyre hiding in familiarlooking homes and running down familiarlookingstreets And theyre speaking a dialect of English thats distinctly similaraprecursor in factto ours            The filmsalso build upon the long history of popular American support for Irishindependence As far back as the mid th century the Fenianmovement for Irish independence was funded mainly through Americancontributions IrishAmericans provided crucial financial support for the war against Britain that created the Free State In MichaelCollins  Collins steals his best friends girlfriend when the friend goesto America to raise money Since  IrishAmericans have been probably evenmore fervent in their support for the IRA than have the Irish themselves            The IRAs tactics also happen to be well suitedto the conventions of Hollywood cinema Because its campaigns tend to involvethe planning and execution of individual acts rather than allout warfare IRAmembers look and act more like professional criminals than likerevolutionaries For plot construction this is a big plussomething Hollywoodhas recognized in proIRA films dating back to John Fords The Informer and Carol Reeds Odd Man Out  The scenes of planningterrorist operations in Odd Man Out  The Devils Own  andJordans The Crying Game  are almost identical to the scenes ingangster films like The Killing  and The Asphalt Jungle where the hoodlums carefully put together their capers Moviegoers lovethe intricacies of a crime all the more when its for a good cause            Finally the simplistic viewof politics that animates the IRA fits neatly with the conventional narrativestructures that Hollywood adores Real politics is messy and morally ambiguousand doesnt make for a compelling thriller But the blackandwhite world ofthe true believer does especially when its festooned with the trappings ofIrish romanticism The IRA you might say already lives in a Hollywood moviewith its noble heroes amoral enemies and glorious deaths Its no surprisethat moviemakers figured that out
