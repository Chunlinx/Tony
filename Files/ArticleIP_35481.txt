                                 The Perils of EFund Raising            Thepitch arrived by email and it was a direct appeal for money            Itappeared to come from Tim Draper the Silicon Valley venture capitalist whoseemail would be eagerly read by anyone interested in the financing oftechnology businesses But this message wasnt about funding technology It wasabout funding the next president of the United States            DearFriend it began Please send  and call five friends to join us insupport of George W Bush for president The esolicitation dated Sept gave out Drapers office phone number at the firm of Draper Fisher Jurvetsonhis email address and a place for checks to be sent            Contributors who raised  the email said could be listed as a cohostand be invited to the VIP photo reception at an event in Redwood City CalifSept  The final line said PS Forward this email on to your addresslist and get some viral marketing going            Manyrecipients did but at least a few questioned whether this was an authorizedrequest for money or a hoax Obviously someone is out to get him said DaveAlexander executive vice president of VirtualFundcom shortly after receivingthe email Alexander predicted that Draper would be flooded by angrycomplaints from people who dont know who he is and who think he really didspam them            Infact Draper did spam them The email was real Draper later confirmed Imhappy about it because I happen to think George Bush is the best man for thejob            Welcome to the murky world of email fund raising            Asmore Americans and more political campaigns get on the Internet email isreplacing many of the campaign tasks traditionally handled through telephoneand direct mail About  billion will be spent on all political direct mail inthe current fouryear electoral cycle according to Ron Faucheaux editor inchief of Campaigns  Elections magazine In many cases direct mailrepresents a campaigns single largest expenditure although presidentialcampaigns have a different spending mix because of their lopsided use of TVadvertising            As afundraising device email has powerful advantages over direct mail Forstarters its essentially free Its also selfreplicating One enthusiasticrecipient can easily send email along to dozens of others without thecampaign having to rent an additional donor list            But asthe Draper incident shows the process can also create some unexpectedheadaches A traditional direct mail solicitation usually contains legalreassurances that the solicitation is authorized and the cost of postage makesan unauthorized mailing an expensive proposition which some emailsolicitations currently lack Also most individuals do not screen their emailaddress books politically meaning that a solicitation sent out to all apersons contacts may well end up in the hands of someone who doesnt wantitwhich could turn into a public relations problem            Thatswhat happened when Anthony Perkins editor in chief of Red Herringmagazine sent out an invitation to the same Bush luncheon as Draper He used alist from Red Eye one of the email newsletters that Red Herringpublishes Using a pun on Red Herring s name Perkins note appeared toimply that a Bush donation would enhance readers relationship to thepublication If you want to be a really big Fish you can become a cohost ofthis event by committing to raise  which will get you into a special VIPreception with the governor the email said            Themessage confused some of Red Eyes subscribers and Red Herring rapidlybegan a damage control campaign Perkins did not respond to several requestsfor an interview First the publication took the position that the emailpitch mistakenly went out under the guise of a Red Eye editorial product whenin fact it was a paid political advertisement            A fewdays later Perkins sent out a letter to Red Eye subscribers apologizing forthe blurring of journalistic and political lines As you know I have strongpolitical ties to presidential candidate George W Bush however these are notthe opinions of Red Herring Communications nor do they influence thejournalistic ethics of any of the editorial properties of Red HerringCommunications Perkins wrote I apologize for the miscommunication and hopeit did not cause any irritation or confusion            Perkins has said that he will personally pay the  cost of the list rentalto Red Herring Communications which to some degree is the same as payinghimself since he is the companys largest shareholder Moreover Perkins toldthe New York Observer that he would record the expense as an inkindcontribution to the Bush campaign His apology email however did not mentionthis contribution and as of Sept  it had yet to show up on the Bushcampaigns online daily roster of campaign donations The Bush campaign did notrespond to a request for comment            Perhaps to avoid such sticky situations some of Bushs presidential rivals aresteering clear of the efundraising pathat least for now Steve Forbescampaign accepts donations through its Web site and sends out thank you notes via email to thosewho contribute onlinebut thats all We havent done any email fund raisingat all says Ben Gettler a spokesman for the Forbes campaign and we donthave any plans to do so We believe our Internet presence is good enough Ofcourse Forbes is spending significant sums of his own money on thepresidential campaign making his fundraising urgency arguably lower than thatof other candidates            Ultimately saysCampaigns  Elections  Faucheaux the electorate will becomeaccustomed to unwanted email solicitations just as it is to political junkmail As long as donors are comfortable with it being there I dont see thatemail solicitations have any particular problems Faucheaux saidRemember Its really in an experimental stage right now
