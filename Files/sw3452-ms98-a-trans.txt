                 all right Sandra uh what we are supposed to talk about this morning are and i i can tell that youre must be an expert child care services   yes yes   and my my first question is what criteria is normally applied by parents when they are selecting child care       what are they looking for in other words   well well in my experience um ive never ive been fortunate enough to be able to stay home with my children but um i have given day care to other children and those that have come asking me to give you know to tend their children um i guess it depends on the parent whether theyre looking for a preschool type situation where they want the children to learn you know different skills and um school type things or whether theyre the children are younger and they just want somebody to be there loving and nurturing   umhum what age would you say uh a child should be before you could start applying this business of teaching them a little bit preschool information we talking what six or seven or four or five   hm um  in my opinion i would im would feel that four at the very earliest i i think that children need to learn how to get along with one another and to play and to be creative and and to   uhhuh they do seem to have a very much improved uh intellectual sort of a spirit theyre bright they look around and and they they know whats going thats that i guess thats as important to say   yeah i agree yes i agree in fact a lot of the kindergarten teachers that ive spoken with said that they would prefer that preschools   yeah   per se would be done away with and that the children just had a chance to you know develop the social skills that they say the the kids that come to school that have been to the preschool type settings   umhum   um are are almost far enough ahead that theyre bored with school   yeah   and they need to learn to get along but um have you ever had children in day care   im trying to think uh yes weve had uh our children in day care a little bit but not much i  the interesting comment i was going to make was that when my children grew up i felt very normal and uh   umhum umhum   with them and i didnt consider a lot of these little details that were talking about   umhum   but now that my grandchildren are growing up i look at them in a totally different style style   oh oh   i i watch very closely their activities when i see them and like and i can tell when theyre speaking more clearly the next day and and when they are understanding situations more carefully     uhhuh oh   and i i dont remember doing it maybe i did automatically with my own children but im im just looking with a much higher technical detail at at the grandchildren   oh oh uhhuh maybe you have more time as a grandfather oh oh   well i wish i did im still working but ill be retiring soon it its its just that uh with grandchildren they are for a short period of time and you just look at them and you absorb anything you can from them and uh   yeah   you start reviewing comparing when you get from them with what you got from your own children   huhuh oh   but it was really a different environment   oh yes how many ooh thats been what probably twenty twenty years ago     something like that   yes   well let me ask you this is it difficult to find a day care when you have a a specific criteria of your own is that is that hard to find   umhum umhum i think it is in fact i know that um around here one of the major problems that the working mothers have said they have is they will find a day care provider and then she will stick with it for oh you know five six months and then have something else come up and so then they are looking again for another one unless they go to the commercial day care providers and i know in the community i live in a lot of the mothers prefer just to have their children go to someones home and i know that thats um theres a risk with that with the insurance and and different things like that but i know most of them prefer to have their children just in a a mother and child home type environment   i see uhhuh umhum   so um i guess it just depends on what youre looking for and whether you mind if it was myself i would rather have my children in that type of environment rather than the the big commercial day cares just simply for the fact that theres so much illness that the little ones pass around and and you you know that type of a thing and the um   thats true yes   and i dont know what the one to one or you know what the ratio is for the adult providers and the children but i would think that if you had a small group it would be   sure   that would be my preference anyway so   well my my daughter my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam Holland   oh   and they have over there what they call a creche   uhhuh   and so her two children go to this creche which is a an all day well about a six hour
