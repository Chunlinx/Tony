neighbor The problem is that my neighbor knows about mygirlfriend and I dont know what to do Whats worse I think Im falling inlove with my neighbor Can you help                                       MD                        Dear M            Help you what Move Getunattached Prudie is fascinated that the problem youre concerned with is yourneighbors knowing about your girlfriend  Usually a man is spooked ifhis significant other knows about the neighbor Prudie must tell you that anumber of things seem less than optimal here You have barely reached yourmajority yet you have already fathered two offspringwhile unmarriedand arebeing unfaithful to the woman to whom youve presumably made a commitment Itwould really be lovely for all concerned if you were having a goof withPrudie On the off chance that your letter is on the level it could be thatthe purpose of your life is to serve as a warning to others If you docall it a day with the mother of your children you will be spared a divorce but will remain financially responsible for child support If you do makean alliance with the neighbor Prudie hopes you will move And do try to stopbeing so horizontally accessible Given your age you could very well populatethe whole neighborhood            Prudie alarmedly                                             Prudie                                                      I have a problem Ihate my brothers wife She has been cheating on him for the past year Theyhave only been married a year She treats him terribly and she tells me shehates my family I have been trying to ignore her comments but itsimpossible Do I tell my brother how I feel or continue to hold mytongue                                       Seething in Texas                        Dear Seethe            What do you think the chances are that yoursisterinlaw lives near the fellow who wrote the previous letter Only kidding though all these loose people are really no laughing matter            From your report of thetimetable your brothers wife started the marriage with no intention of beingfaithful Chances are that if you know shes running around its likelyyour brother does too The fact that she treats him terribly however isdefinitely known to him and it is for this reason that Prudie suggests you saynothing He is either masochistically neurotic or is figuring out how toextricate himself The only mechanistic thing you can do is make yourselfscarce And should your brother ask your opinion give it to him            Prudie pragmatically                                             DearPrudence                                                      Im a yearoldgay guy My problem is that Ive fallen for this guy Ive been chatting with onthe Internet for the past six months Seth thinks of me as someone he canconfide in not as a potential boyfriend Hes a serious bodybuilder and sayshes looking for muscular guys only While I do have a toned bod I amdefinitely not of the bodybuilder ilk My question How can I convince Seththat we would be perfect together even though Im not a bodybuilder Hedoesnt seem interested in meeting The only thing he does seem interested inis pouring his heart out to me about how difficult it is to find a muscularmate Please advise                                       Looking for Love                        Dear Look            Take a deep breath andface the facts You are interested in a partner this chap is interested inpecs and lats Your cybercrush sounds like a musclebound moron and you wouldnot be perfect together Where is the commonality of interests Youmight try to figure out why you are attracted even electronically to someonewho is whining to you about his inability to find another bodybuilder Forwhatever reason you want what you cant have Prudie hopes you will refocusconsider yourself lucky and move on to another chat room Or better yet startgoing out             Prudie sociably                                             DearPrudie                                                      I accepted a new job a couple of months ago andrelocated to another city which is away from my grown children The new jobhas been fantastic and I felt I made the right decision in moving Until a fewweeks ago anyway My manager was moved laterally within the department andthe person they hired is an exmanager of mine and the cause of my leaving myold company He totally disrespects women and anyone not in his field Themanagement knows that I cannot and will not work for him I have requested anintercompany transfer so I would not be his subordinate I have another joboffer in yet another state which I rejected to accept this positionbut theystill want me to work for them                                       I am getting readyto sign a lease for my housing but am unsure if I want to stay here if Imforced to keep this position What do you think I should do                                       Haunted                        Dear Haunt            Move quickly That is get a commitment from asuperior that you will be given a different job where youre not reporting tothe chauvinist pig er former manager Dont be shy about mentioning the otheroffer You say that your current management understands your aversion to thisman If you can get an ironclad guarantee of another position sign the leaseand get on with your life            If you feel there is anydillydallying on the part of your new employer having already left the areawhere your children live would make one more move merely a temporaryinconvenience If you do not get a firm promise of an intercompany transferby all means go to the company that still wants you If that happens and ifwhatshisname winds up working for them it should be Ripley you writeto not Prudie            Prudie hopefully
