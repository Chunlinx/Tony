        okay   great um currently im not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program   uhhuh   im mainly do a lot of walking um i have a son thats a little bit overweight and um the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around so my wife and i kind of take turns um at one time i had a a fairly regular exercise program but in the last couple of months ive changed to a a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned upside down all this space that uh normally would be dedicated towards the exercise area is uh covered in boxes   yeah um what did you do when you exercised when you did exercise regularly   well i had a a a little routine that i i did for uh warm ups and then i did some uh very   uhhuh   mild mild say light weight lifting nothing and im not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try stay as firm as i can stay in my old age   uhhuh yeah       um well right now um i try to when its nice out its been raining a lot this spring but i try to i have a bicycle and i like to cycle a lot and uh my husband and i we have entered a few rallies thats pretty popular in Texas i dont know if its up north but   umhum   like every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and uh thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles which thats a lot of fun um so we try to ride ride during the week to stay in shape for that   umhum   and um TI where i work has uh a fitness center so a lot of times after work or maybe on the weekend wed go over there and lift weights and do the treadmill and um they have stair masters and all kinds of new machines that are fun to ride and and workout on so i try to im trying to stay in shape on a regular basis i used to get into it and then get out of it based on my schedule so im trying to stay in in shape on a regular basis now but its a big commitment we dont have any kids yet so thats a lot of the part of it     yeah thats thats thats a plus uh i have a total of five children i have three left living at home   uhhuh   and they do take up a big part of my uh my evening and weekend   yeah   and its tough being a parent and trying to do all the things that you should do for yourself too   yeah   its uh something they dont tell you about when youre growing up yes when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children   uhhuh       thats why uh they they uh really stress um at TI they really stress staying in shape but like in staying fit overall fitness you know no smoking and all that but its its hard to find uh a actual exercise regimen that works for you you know because like i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes and i dont know if that would work for me because   umhum   i dont know i wouldnt want to pull a kid over hilly terrain but you know its really hard to find something that works and it you know to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever i think maybe walking or running would probably work because you it doesnt take much time and much money or whatever   yeah   yeah   well theres you you have to uh what i found from my experiences you have to budget time for yourself   uhhuh   and then uh the you you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer youll live   right   and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then ill be around a lot longer       those people that im taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i hadnt taken it   uhhuh   so if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine   yeah um ive been learning a lot lately about um ive been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper i dont know if youre familiar are familiar with him   um   he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really hes kind of redid um uh just pretty much the  innovator of the whole exercise thing um and he was talking about the three things you could that cause aging are smoking inactivity and what was the other one i think it was yeah obesity so if you can control those three areas then you are going to live longer you know because those are risk factors so anyway its kind of a tip   yeah oh ive done a lot of study over the years and i found that uh probably one of the worst things that uh anybody can ingest is chlorinated water   really   yeah um the research ive done and uh ive actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty three and   umhum   its its amazing that uh you know like prior to like nineteen twenty there were not very few heart attacks   umhum   there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen oh three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water and then after that we started having the hearts attacks   man   and uh Dr Price wrote a book Coronarys Cholesterol and Chlorine you can usually find it at a health food store   umhum   i know they had it in health food stores in Plano i used to live in Plano   Dr Price   thats uh Dr Price yeah and its amazing he makes the in you know its a very small book and the guys very opinionated um but he makes a very good case against chlorine there were no heart attacks before we started using it and he says points out that people in uh England and uh or eating diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that were ingesting now   umhum   and they werent dropping dead of heart attacks and   thats really interesting   yeah he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours   uhhuh   and uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries and uh   yeah   you know hes uh theres been a lot of reports since then and this whole thing about you know first it was stress then they went to cholesterol and now theyre saying whats cholesterol well theres good cholesterol and theres bad cholesterol and   umhum   you know its its its amazing what he points out in that book and that um in fact he even uh there was a uh toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency who did work back in nineteen eighty six who wrote a letter to Dr Price in nineteen eighty seven and in this letter he praised Dr Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this   hm   and said that the EPA had been doing experiments on non human primates and proving that ingestation of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis and EPA never published that report   and whats the name of this book again   uh Coronaries Cholesterol and Chlorine   ill have to remember that thatd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a neurosurgeon so hes really interested in the heart   yeah yeah   and hes in fact hes a well heart too i mean hes uh hes done a lot of research on like how your heart re reacts reacts to exercise sorry he just made me laugh um   uhhuh     so anyway i have to remember that   yeah theres theres a theres a lot of good information out there uh about health and a lot of the uh a lot of the myths theyve been passing around people are are starting to realize arent true i mean im all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because thats thats good for you   yeah umhum   uh but to to believe some of the things that they you know and i dont think anybody should be going out there and eating a high high fat diet but to think that that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is   humum   its just hard to believe   if you get a chance read Dr Coopers book on controlling cholesterol   umhum   thats a real good um he talks about that talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that   yeah i actually eat pretty much anything that i want   thats right uhhuh   and ive had my cholesterol checked and uh you know a few times and ive never been above uh like a hundred and fifty never   uhhuh   and uh uh i mean i   you have a good ratio of good to bad cholesterol   um you you well what they tell me but i mean you know everythings like within uh five to ten percent and all that kind of thing you know they leave themselves wide open so they cant be sued     yeah huh   but uh weve uh i work at the TI site in Hunt Valley Maryland   oh really   yeah and weve had a few of the health fairs up here and you know ive always come out aces   thats good   and im you know im not really that big on on watching what i eat i i do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber and   yeah   low in fat and all that kind of stuff but i mean as far as being really concerned about ingesting too much uh chlorine im not or cholesterol im not worried about
