personnote the papers was the first one in the proceedings that didnt follow partylines  Republicans voted on the winning side against the Republican Housemanagers USAToday sees impeachment fatigue in the days debate and the New York Timessays there was little ardor or urgency in the speeches comparing the wholething to a cooling souffl But the Times captures a flash of emotionhere and there noting
