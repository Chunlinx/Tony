                    Background        Clozapine is a widely used atypical neuroleptic with        affinity for multiple receptors including dopamine        serotonin alpha adrenergic muscarinic and histaminergic        receptors      Although clozapine is effective in the        treatment of schizophrenia refractory to traditional        antipsychotic medication it also has a number of        significant side effects ranging from the potentially fatal        but rare agranulocytosis to weight gain constipation        seizures and urinary incontinence     Urinary problems        have been reported in the clinical literature with        incontinence present in up to  of patients    and        enuresis in  of patients     Since clozapine has        potent antimuscarinic and antialpha adrenergic effects            it has been proposed that peripheral effects on the        lower urinary tract might be responsible for the        micturition disturbances     Incontinence has also been        reported following therapy with other atypical neuroleptics        such as risperidone      and recently olanzapine                   We have previously shown that intravenous administration        of clozapine to anesthetized rats     altered several        micturition parameters including a decreased amount of        volume voided per micturition and a concomitant increase in        the residual volume In addition clozapine also inhibits        the external urethral sphincter Other newer atypical        neuroleptics eg olanzapine and risperidone            were also found to have similar effects but with differing        potency compared to clozapine Since risperidone has little        or no antimuscarinic activity a primary antimuscarinic        peripheral effect may be ruled out as the cause of        micturition disturbances following risperidone        administration and suggest a possible central role for        atypical neuroleptics in regulating micturition        The purpose of the present study was to determine the        effects of clozapine administered centrally at two        different sites spinal LS spinal segments vs        supraspinal lateral ventricle on micturition and the        external urethral sphincter during cystometry in the        anesthetized rat By limiting the application site to a        specific area of the central nervous system and comparing        the results with our previous findings after systemic        administration    it might be possible to determine        whether the effects of clozapine are mediated at a central        or peripheral level Moreover a comparison of the two        central routes might indicate whether the central effect        involves spinal or supraspinal structures We report in        this study that most of the effects of clozapine on        micturition are mediated by its central effects        Furthermore there are differences in spinal versus        supraspinal effects                    Results                  Effects of central administration of clozapine on          urodynamic parameters during single cystometry Table          and           Figures and show representative examples of the          effects of clozapine on single cystometry in anesthetized          rats after intrathecal it LS spinal segment and          intracerebroventricular icv lateral ventricle          administration respectively          Bladder capacity was increased by clozapine given it          or icv only at the highest dose tested Fig G G          After  nmoles of clozapine it the bladder capacity          was    ml compared to    ml after          vehicle administration Fig A Similarly after           nmoles of clozapine icv the bladder capacity was             ml compared to    ml after vehicle          administration Fig A          Micturition volume was significantly decreased after           and  nmoles of clozapine it Fig B to             and    ml respectively compared to             ml after vehicle In the case of          intracerebroventricular administration  nmoles of          clozapine decreased the micturition volume to             ml compared to    ml after vehicle Fig B          The effect of  nmoles of clozapine icv on          micturition volume was significantly different from the          effect of the same dose given it Further reductions in          micturition volume were observed after  nmoles of          clozapine icv          Residual volume was significantly increased after           and  nmoles of clozapine it to    and             compared to    after vehicle administration          Fig C Clozapine icv resulted in a significant          increase in the residual volume at all doses including           nmoles After  nmoles icv the residual volume          was    compared to    after vehicle This          residual volume was not significantly different from the          one observed after the same dose it Larger doses of          clozapine icv resulted in further increases in the          residual volume to    and    after  and           nmoles respectively          Clozapine it or icv caused an increase in the          pressure threshold only at the highest doses tested Fig          G G A After  nmoles it the pressure threshold          was    compared to    mm Hg after          vehicle whereas after icv administration the same          dose increased the pressure threshold to    mm Hg          compared to    mm Hg after vehicle          Clozapine it or icv had no effect on either peak          pressure or contraction time in the range of doses tested          Fig B A in this study          Expulsion time was significantly decreased by          clozapine at  and  nmoles either it or icv Fig          B After vehicle it the expulsion time was             sec which decreased to    and    sec          after  and  nmoles it Similarly after vehicle icv          the expulsion time was    sec and  and           nmoles of clozapine icv decreased it to    and             sec respectively The effect of  nmoles of          clozapine it on the expulsion time was significantly          different from the effect observed after icv          administration of this dose Fig B          Clozapine also decreased the amplitude of and in some          animals even abolished the high frequency oscillations          HFO after it administration Fig  C After           nmoles of clozapine the HFO were    compared to             mm Hg after administration of vehicle In  of          the  animals in this group  nmoles of clozapine it          abolished the HFO The reduction in amplitude observed at          this dose after it administration of significantly          different from the effects observed after the same dose          icv Fig C A greater dose of clozapine did not          cause a larger effect although the amplitude of the HFO          after  nmoles of clozapine it was still significantly          reduced    mm Hg when compared to vehicle          administration Clozapine icv decreased the amplitude          of the HFO only at  nmoles    mm Hg compared to             mm Hg after vehicle administration Fig           and the HFO were abolished in only  of the animals in          this group                          Effects of central administration of clozapine on          the activity of the external urethral sphincter during          single cystometry Table and           Clozapine it did not have an effect on the activity          of the EUS during Phase  the rising phase during a          contraction and only the highest dose of clozapine          icv  nmoles was found to decrease the activity of          the EUS Fig A to    of that seen during          administration of vehicle          Phase  of the EUS EMG occurring during the time of          HFO was decreased by clozapine either it or icv           and  nmoles of clozapine it decreased the EMG to             and    of that observed during administration of          vehicle respectively Fig B In fact in  animals           nmoles of clozapine it abolished the bursting          pattern of the EMG observed during phase  Fig F          Clozapine administered icv at a dose of  nmoles          decreased the EUS EMG to    of the activity          observed after vehicle administration Fig B Larger          doses  and  nmoles of clozapine icv further          reduced the EUS activity during this phase to             and    Clozapine icv however was not observed          to abolish the bursting pattern during this phase Fig           except in  animals          Phase  of the EUS EMG recorded during the falling          phase of a bladder contraction was not affected by          clozapine administered intrathecally Fig C However          the largest dose of clozapine given icv  nmoles          decreased the activity to    of the activity          observed during vehicle administration          Finally the amplitude of the bursts observed during          phase  in the EUS EMG were decreased to    by           nmoles of clozapine it Fig D A similar dose of          clozapine icv had no effect However  nmoles of          clozapine icv decreased the amplitude of the bursts to             of that observed during vehicle          administration                            Discussion        In the present experiments central application of        clozapine intrathecally over the LS spinal segments or        intracerebroventricularly into the lateral ventricle        resulted in a number of changes in the urodynamic        parameters of anesthetized rats The major effect of        clozapine was to decrease the voiding efficiency of the        bladder by inhibiting expulsion parameters such as        micturition volume residual volume and expulsion time In        addition the activity of the EUS also decreased upon        central application of clozapine One problem in delivering        substances centrally is the possibility that peripheral        spread may confound the results Since clozapine crosses        the bloodbrain barrier readily     the maximum dose        selected in the present experiment was restricted to the        first appearance of a decrease in blood pressure as an        indication of possible peripheral alpha  antagonism due to        peripheral leakage We compared the effects obtained in the        present study against those observed previously after        intravenous administration    expecting that central        effects would require significantly less application of        clozapine than systemic administration We considered a        minimum difference of  magnitude in the central vs        peripheral dose that elicited a significant effect as an        indication of possible central action Our doses of          and  nmoles of clozapine correspond to serum levels of          and  ngml assuming a blood volume of  of body        weight and are in the range of therapeutic levels         ngml             A second problem in administering a substance at a        particular central location is that of redistribution to        other parts of the central nervous system Since        application of a substance at the lumbosacral spinal level        may travel to the brain after some time and vice versa we        established two criteria to help determine a possible        central site of action  the first dose to elicit a        significant effect by either it or icv administration         significant differences at the same dose but different        routes it vs icv        Figure is a summary of our findings when interpreted in        light of the criteria stated above for determining a        central vs peripheral effects and b spinal vs supraspinal        site of action The effects are presented as percent change        over the control vehicle dose for each of the central        routes in the present experiment and our previously        reported findings for systemic administration            Theses changes are plotted at the dose mgkg that first        yielded significant results The route that we consider        most likely to be the site of action for clozapine is        italicized        Bladder capacity was increased to a similar degree by an        equivalent dose of clozapine regardless of route Fig A        A making a determination of most likely site of action        difficult Given that the peripheral effects at low doses        were similar to the effects after the highest central dose        of clozapine by either route it appears likely that this        effect is due to peripheral actions of clozapine Bladder        capacity was reported to increase following icv        administration of muscarinic antagonist atropine            or it alpha antagonists yohimbine     atipemazole            Given clozapines strong affinity for muscarinic        and alpha receptors    it is possible that central        effects are also contributing to the increase in bladder        capacity        Micturition volume on the other hand showed a        reduction after smaller doses of clozapine icv or it        when compared to the iv dose Fig B B Therefore        central effects of clozapine in controlling micturition        volume are likely Furthermore when comparing the effects        of it vs icv administration a  nmoles dose of        clozapine icv elicited a reduction in micturition volume        that was significantly greater from the effects observed        after the same dose it Fig B Therefore supraspinal        effects of clozapine in regulating micturition volume are        likely with spinal effects perhaps contributing Clozapine        it also decreased the micturition volume however the        dose that first showed a significant effect was higher than        the icv but smaller than the iv dose Spinal        antagonism of either alpha or alpha adrenergic receptors        was reported to increase micturition volume    in        anesthetized rats However intrathecal atipamezole alpha        antagonist increased residual volume in awake rats            Therefore it is difficult to interpret clozapines        effects on micturition volume in terms of spinal alpha        adrenoceptor antagonism and possibly the supraspinal        effects predominate        Clozapine given it or icv also increased the        residual volume Fig C C Since the effects were        observed at doses that were lower than those after iv        administration a peripheral effect of clozapine to        increase residual volume appears unlikely The smallest        dose of clozapine given icv  nmoles increased        residual volume to  Fig C suggesting that        supraspinal effects predominate with possible contributing        effects from spinal sites Ishiura et al    reported a        decrease in voiding efficiency comparable to an increase        in residual volume following atropine icv or it        suggesting that muscarinic receptors at supraspinal and        spinal sites are involved and may account for our effects        after clozapine it or icv A decrease in residual        volume has been reported following spinal antagonism of        alpha receptors with yohimbine    but atipamezole        produced an increase in the residual volume            similar to our findings with clozapine it        Clozapine increased pressure threshold after icv or        it administration only after  nmoles Fig D A It        should be noted that both central doses were at the range        observed to result in cardiovascular changes and therefore        the possibility of peripheral leakage of clozapine must be        considered Still the effective central doses are        approximately  less than the first dose observed to        produce significant results intravenously and suggests a        possible central site of action        Peak pressure was not changed by clozapine after either        route in the present study after central administration        consistent with our findings afer intravenous        administration     Ishiura et al    reported a        decrease in maximal voiding pressure equivalent to our        peak pressure after atropine iv icv or it in awake        rats undergoing continuous cystometry Given that clozapine        has a relatively high affinity for muscarinic receptors            it is surprising that we have not seen an effect on        peak pressure Clozapine and also olanzapine            were able to decrease the contraction amplitude after        electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve Since the        contraction pressures observed during cystometry were        smaller than those observed after electrical stimulation of        the pelvic nerve and against a closed urethra it is        possible that the antimuscarinic effects of clozapine on        bladder contraction pressure are not detected because        during cystometry maximal bladder pressures are not        necessary for emptying        Contraction time was not affected by clozapine icv or        it Table and  Fig A however it was clearly        decreased after intravenous administration            Therefore we suspect that solely peripheral effects may        explain the effects of clozapine on contraction time        Antimuscarinic agents have been show to decrease        contraction time eg atropine     and since        clozapine has high affinity for muscarinic receptors it is        likely that peripheral antimuscarinic effects of clozapine        are responsible for the reduction in contraction time after        systemic administration        Expulsion time was reduced by clozapine after it or        icv administration at much smaller doses than were        observed to produce similar results iv Fig E B        Therefore central effects of clozapine are likely        responsible for the reduction in expulsion time Since the        intrathecal effects were greater than those observed after        icv administration it is possible that a spinal action        predominates with possible contribution from supraspinal        sites        The amplitude of the high frequency oscillations        observed during the expulsion time in the rat micturition        cycle     was reduced by clozapine it at a dose of         nmoles Fig F This dose was  smaller than the first        icv dose observed to have a significant effect and        approximately  smaller than the first iv dose to show        a significant effect Therefore a spinal site mediating        the effects of clozapine on the amplitude of high frequency        oscillations appears likely Previous results           suggest that D receptors modulate the amplitude of the        HFO since raclopride selective D antagonist decreased        the amplitude of the HFO by         In addition to clozapines effects on urodynamic        parameters the EMG recorded from the external urethral        sphincter also showed changes after clozapine it or        icv The EMG during phase  of the contraction only        showed a reduction after the largest dose of clozapine        icv This dose is equivalent to our lowest dose iv and        in fact all doses iv previously showed a significant        reduction     Intrathecal administration had no effect        on the EMG at phase         The EMG during phase  corresponding to the period of        high frequency oscillations was decreased by clozapine        after it or icv administration at doses that were much        lower than those necessary to produce an effect after iv        Therefore the effects of clozapine in reducing the EMG        during this phase appear to be central in origin Since the        first significant effect was obtained after icv        administration Fig H it is possible that supraspinal        effects predominate with spinal sites contributing        The EMG during phase  closing phase of the        contraction was decreased only after the highest dose of        clozapine  nmoles icv Fig C This dose was still         smaller than the first significant dose iv and        therefore a central effect of clozapine is probable        Finally the amplitude of the individual bursts of EMG        recorded from the external urethral sphincter during phase         of the contraction also decreased after clozapine it or        icv Fig D Since the doses that yielded significant        reductions were smaller than those observed after iv        admnistration a central effect is likely Moreover since         nmoles of clozapine it produced a significant reduction        when compared to the same dose icv a spinal effect of        clozapine in mediating the reduction of the burst amplitude        of the EMG is possible        In the anesthetized rat the external urethral sphincter        contracts and relaxes during the expulsion phase in a        manner that is complimentary to the high frequency        oscillations observed in the bladder pressure record           whereas in humans the external sphincter not active during        voiding Pharmacological blockade of the external urethral        sphincter in the rat resulted in decreased micturition        volume and increased residual volume              suggesting that the activity of the external urethral        sphincter contributes to efficient voiding in the rat        Therefore central administration of clozapine by reducing        the activity of the EUS contributes to the decrease in        voiding efficiency by reducing micturition volume and        increasing residual volume        Alpha adrenergic antagonists have been shown to inhibit        pudendal reflexes in anesthetized cats              However a systemic dose of prazosin alpha antagonist        did not inhibit the EUS EMG activity during high frequency        oscillations in the rat     Thus although alpha        antagonism has been shown to modulate pudendal reflexes in        the cat their role in modulating the activity of the EUS        during micturition in the rat appears unclear        In summary our results in the present experiments        suggest that most of the effects of clozapine on urodynamic        parameters can be ascribed to central effects Expulsion        parameters such as micturition volume residual volume        expulsion time and amplitude of the highfrequency        oscillations appear to be mediated by the central action        spinal or supraspinal of clozapine The activity of the        EUS also appears to decrease after central application of        clozapine Therefore central effects of clozapine appear        to decrease the voiding efficiency of the bladder in the        rat Contraction time clearly showed a peripheral effect        only whereas changes in bladder capacity were difficult to        explain from central effects and probably reflect        peripheral effects of clozapine        Clozapine is metabolized mainly at the liver resulting        in several metabolites      One of the major        metabolites Ndesmethylclozapine has been shown to have        pharmacological activity both in vitro    and in vivo        in rats     In addition Ndesmethylclozapine is found        in large concentrations in the serum of schizophrenic        patients     and in rats     The contribution of        Ndesmethylclozapine to clozapines central effects has        been questioned recently since the levels of        Ndesmethylclozapine in the brain were much lower than        those of clozapine    suggesting that        Ndesmethylclozapine does not cross the bloodbrain barrier        as readily as clozapine Since we observed effects from        central application of clozapine we consider it unlikely        that the effects of metabolites contributed significantly        However whether any of the major clozapine metabolites        also have a role in regulating micturition remains to be        determined                    Conclusions        Atypical neuroleptics are useful in treating patients        that are refractory to traditional antipsychotic        medication and produce fewer extrapyramidal side effects        However other side effects still occur with varying        severity and frequency    and continue to pose a        challenge to effective treatment Urinary disturbances as a        result of clozapine therapy have been well documented and        include incontinence enuresis and urgency              Other atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone           and olanzapine    have been reported to produce urinary        incontinence        We have previously shown      that systemic        administration of clozapine olanzapine and risperidone to        anesthetized rats reduced voiding efficiency Risperidone        had smaller maximal effects than olanzapine and clozapine        and had no direct peripheral inhibitory effects on the        amplitude of bladder contractions In the present study we        show that clozapine acts at supraspinal and spinal sites to        inhibit certain urodynamic parameters and the external        urethral sphincter of the rat resulting in decreased        voiding efficiency        If these effects also occur in patients they may        contribute to the urinary disturbances reported following        clozapine therapy The exact receptor types or combination        of receptor types responsible for clozapines central        effects on micturition were not investigated in the present        study However isolating particular receptors that        contribute to the effects of clozapine might be useful in        designing neuroleptics that may avoid these side effects or        in providing an adjunct therapy to relieve some of the side        effects                    Materials and Methods                  Surgical procedures          The experiments were conducted in compliance with the          USDA Animal Welfare Act and amendments thereto and the          revised Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals          DHEW NIH and were approved by the Animal Studies          Subcommittee of the Bay Pines Veterans Administration          Medical Center          Surgical procedures have been described in detail          elsewhere     Rats female SpragueDawley n             g Harlan IN were anesthetized with halothane          and placed on a heating pad A catheter PE was          introduced into the jugular vein to administer urethane           gkg over a period of  minutes while decreasing          the level of halothane to prevent respiratory depression          Rats were instrumented with either an intrathecal cannula          placed over the LS spinal segment or a cannula into          the right lateral ventricle          An incision was made over the dorsal aspect of the          neck and the overlying muscles were retracted to expose          the atlantooccipital membrane An intrathecal catheter          PE  was introduced through a small slit in the          atlantooccipital membrane and positioned over the LS          spinal cord segments     Saline soaked gelfoam was          placed around the catheter and the neck muscles and skin          were sutured Spinal segmental location of the catheter          was verified postmortem by performing a laminectomy          Following a small craniectomy a stainlesssteel          cannula  ga was placed in the lateral ventricle at          the following coordinates AP   ML   V  mm              The cannula was held in place with skull screws          and dental acrylic At the end of the experiment  l of          fastgreen  was infused through the cannula while          observing the CSF though a small slit in the          atlantooccipital membrane Almost immediate          visualization of the fastgreen in the fourth ventricle          was taken to indicate appropriate placement of the          cannula into the lateral ventricle          After an abdominal incision both ureters were tied          distally and cut centrally and allowed to drain onto          cotton gauzes that were directed outside the animal A          catheter PE was introduced into the bladder dome and          tied in place with a purse string suture A catheter          PE was introduced into the right femoral artery for          blood pressure recording Stainlesssteel wires           in AM Systems WA insulated except at the tip were          introduced into the external urethral sphincter for EMG          recording DAM  WPI bandwidth  to  kHz gain                                    Urodynamic studies          In pilot animals the dose and duration of effects was          determined by administering clozapine saline           nmoles at  min intervals either          intrathecally n   or intracerebroventricularly n            during continuous cystometry infusion rate            mlmin while recording bladder pressure external          urethral sphincter EMG and blood pressure Fifty           nmoles of clozapine administered by either route resulted          in a decrease in arterial pressure mean decrease in MAP          was    and    mm Hg for intrathecal and          intracerebroventricular administration respectively The          onset time ranged from  min from the start of the          infusion Since clozapine has alpha antagonist effects             it is possible that the blood pressure decreases          were due to spread of clozapine into the periphery          following central administration Doses smaller than           nmoles did not elicit a drop in arterial pressure In          addition  nmoles represents a dose close to the          smallest intravenous dose used previously  mgkg              Therefore during single cystometry the dose range          was limited to  to  nmoles in order to reduce          possible peripheral spread of clozapine          Single cystometry studies were conducted as follows          The bladder was emptied and allowed to equilibrate to air          pressure for  minutes before beginning each          cystometrogram Room temperature saline was infused into          the bladder  mlmin while recording bladder          pressure and the infusion was stopped when a contraction          occurred Volume expelled was determined by placing          cotton gauze at the urinary meatus and weighing before          and after micturition External urethral sphincter EMG          EUSEMG was recorded throughout the cystometrogram and          for some time after the filling had stopped Increasing          doses of clozapine Sigma vehicle    nmoles in          a volume of  l followed by a  l saline wash were          administered through the intrathecal catheter n            Mean weight   gm or through the          intracerebroventricular cannula n   Mean weight            gm at approximately minute intervals Clozapine was          dissolved in a minimal amount of  N hydrochloric acid          and brought up to volume with saline final pH            Cystometrograms were started approximately  minutes          after each drug administration At the end of the          experiment the rat was euthanized with an overdose of          urethane  mgkg iv                          Data analysis          Bladder
