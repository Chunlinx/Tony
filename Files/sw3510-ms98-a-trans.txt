              okay but you said you saw Robin Hood   yes i did this summer did you see it also   yeah i sure did of course im a Kevin Costner fan  as are a lot of women   well i i saw i guess ive seen all of Kevins movies so far   yeah have you are you planning to see the his new one the JFK      well probably i want to see what the reviews look like   yeah i usually wait for the reviews too although sometimes ive gone and i disagree you know with them not usually the paper as much as the ones on radio and TV i dont always agree with them   well sometimes its a matter of what the movie is about   umhum   even if it doesnt get a good review if its something im interested in ill probably go see it anyway   oh like the man on the uh i think its KRLD that reviews movies gave uh Star Trek the new movie uh like a four or five and i was surprised because everyone thats a Star Trek fan that i know that has seen it just loved it   well ive ive read some reviews  on Star Trek and was planning to see it Wall Street Journal has a review today and it says basically that uh that this is probably just about the best one that theyve ever done   umhum so dont you think again its a matter of opinion   sure it finishes by if this is indeed the final voyage of the original crew Star Trek six is a worthy valediction   uh i dont like always to listen to what someone else says uh because i think sometimes they just dont happen to or if you know if youre real tired sometimes something doesnt appeal to you   well that that can be the case or it can get a great review and be something that im not interested in then im not going to see it   thats right ive seen a couple like that uh you havent seen Cape Fear yet   no ive been reading all the reviews about it but ive never seen it     oh it is very very frightening i mean i think its more so than Silence of the Lambs its a little bit like that did you see Silence of the Lambs   no but i read all about it too   yeah well it was pretty gory and so was Cape Fear real kind of gruesome but you know thats kind of like when is he going to die and probably never   well this movie Hook is getting interesting reviews some are saying that it too sweet uh  just because they spent so much money on it and its got such wellknown stars im thinking about seeing it   which one is that   its called Hook its   Hook yes again ive heard mixed reviews on that you know i think this morning KRLD had a gave it a a six or something which for him is probably pretty good   well the newspaper suggested that its perhaps too sweet a movie and and that the action sequences might not be as good as other Spielbergs movies but it might not be bad overall     i guess therell never be another ET   no   i know that was a classic and im glad they didnt try to follow up with a sequel sometimes it ruins it   well no ET ET ET is going is is to stood as an instant classic   well i think so uh it was on what Thanksgiving i was in Florida and i watched it again have you seen The Butchers Wife   no thats the one with Demi Moore   uhhuh   yeah ive ive been reading about it but i wasnt all that interested Jeff well Jeff Daniels is in that too isnt he but i i wasnt interested   umhum he does put in a real good the its a real lighthearted movie if youre uh in the mood to see something just kind of lighthearted you would like it isnt a real thoughtful picture just kind of fun fun you know once in a while its nice to just go see something thats just lighthearted and fun   well sometimes there two kind of movies i like to see the ones on the big screen like Star Trek where you really have to see them on big screen and then the others like say The Butchers Wife that are interesting but you can rent them later and watch them on TV without any harm       by watching on video   thats true you know and you have to start thinking about is it is it worth spending the money to go see it or shall i just wait   well you know Star Wars Star Trek those kind of movies youve got to see them on big screen or else they lose their effect   umhum they really do and ive never been a Star Trek fan but i have friends and relatives that wouldnt miss a Star Trek movie   well i ive enjoyed Star Trek but i got people who are friends who are fanatics i have a friend who took off work last Friday just to be sure to be in the first group to see it well ill see ill see it eventually but im not going take the rush   um yeah well and sometimes you know you miss all the crowds if you dont have to go the very first day it opens   no i i i think itll still be playing next month   yeah yeah i think so i dont think you need to be one of the first uh do you belong to any of the fan clubs uh you know the   oh no no im im just its just interesting to watch   umhum   although theres a big story in the paper today a debate between two of the writers one saying the original crew was best and one saying that the new crew was best but uh you know the debate goes on i suppose   yes well itd be interesting to hear why people think that
