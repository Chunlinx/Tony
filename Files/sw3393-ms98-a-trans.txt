        okay   so what do you guys having up there i havent been up there since oh Lord forty eight i guess  well no no it wasnt forty eight it was it was uh   forty eight thats a long time  um   lets see yeah it was forty eight i was in the Air Force we did an we did an air show out at uh out at uh   uhhuh   Bowling Green no out at um Andrews yeah   Andrews   so whats it been like up there   well for the past week or two its been cold and wet   uhhuh   but before that for  most of the year its been hot and dry   yeah uh like September was hot and drier October   um Septembers really was im not sure about October i think for about twelve months through September the the average temperature had been higher than normal each month   really huh   um lots of ninety degree days during the summer   it really has been strange here this year i mean this whole year course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one but uh       we had uh you you know all these we have all these uh uh somebody said you know youre either a stranger or a fool if you try to predict Texas weather but       we had all these people saying it was gonna be the hottest summer ever you know and we had all this rain and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool but all of a sudden in in um in October   good   um September October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time then uh then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down you know and flash floods everywhere and that kind of deal       and then uh uh end of November the first like the second week um you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze     yep   and the average you know the average uh first frost is like the fifteenth of November here but usually its not until later its really strange   oh if you had it early yeah i think we usually have a frost in October   yeah   um but you know we really need the rain that weve been getting and it has not today but the last few days its been been pouring most of the day   is it is it is it flooding anywhere   is it flooding anywhere i have not heard of it any problems of it flooding anywhere i mean thats occurred certainly at times in the past but uh no ive not heard of any particular problems this time   it just kind of uh cloud were supposed to to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here uh which will be you know a little bit more typical uh autumn weather but really its strange we havent really had an autumn its like we went into winter without you know the the poor trees said what  whats that   yes yeah yeah yeah we had we had uh summer lasting long and then it then it then it became winter like   yeah uh uh and   uh today its today its its sort of change its warmer to sort of more typical autumn day   yeah there you you know usually theres uh i have a a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas   hm   and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine you know its that same trees pines and and hard woods you know hickories and oaks and stuff and um       i was up there last weekend and there are trees that that still have their leaves on and theyre green but theyre dead you know the freeze the freeze just got them they they werent ready for it at all apparently and and we havent had a typical fall at all no not much color and you know changes have a color at all   guess not   really weird this year im not sure what that what that means   i dont know yeah our leaves are are all on the on the ground now i think it was a especially good winter for fall colors     so you you all actually had some color huh  it kind of crept in and   the oh yeah yeah oh yeah we we did for a time   yeah its usually beautiful up there isnt it   umhum   oh gorgeous thats yeah id id say you could drive along in Maryland and and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the and the pines and what not and and you could you know you could be driving along East Texas and it looks just the same its almost you know identical identical kind of country   umhum but not this year for the trees for the leaves   beautiful yeah oh really yeah i was up i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend  yeah pull little oak tree that was dead and   hm   cut it up and split it  it was kind of fun   yeah this is because it it cant tolerate a freeze this early is that right   well   if it would came later itd be all right   uh it it theres some trees like the oaks like a white oak seem to be pretty hearty that nothing bothers them their leaves are still green and some of the other oaks there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves um what i notice mostly is the red maples the the leaves are just dead the dogwoods look still look you know they got uh bit on the ends of leaf a little bit but they still look pretty good   hm   it just depends on the on the uh on the tree
