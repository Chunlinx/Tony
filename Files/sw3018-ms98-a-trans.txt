            okay what are your favorite things to watch   oh um lets see i uh i have enjoyed uh Thirtysomething   umhum   in the past uh now now that it has gone off         uh some comedy shows uh i cant cant think of off hand of   yeah   what what are your what is   we do not watch a lot of TV we try to watch it on Thursday nights we usually watch LA Law i like that real well   yeah   and Cheers we like to watch that   yeah   ah we like to watch that uh we sort of got hooked on LA Law um do you ever watch that   yeah uh yeah yeah we we we try to catch that most most nights   yeah yeah i i have watched Thirtysomething some in the last couple seasons i was sort of sorry to see it go   yeah   too   it it was kind of interesting uh some people complained about uh uh the kind of whining or whatever on it i i did i really did not think it was it was that way i think it had some some good uh   yeah   good situations that it uh presented   yeah i thought a lot of the like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff  i can relate to some of those things and   yeah   just the dynamics of it and everything   well i think i think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way but they had a lot of uh uh uh counseling groups that used some of the episodes as as examples of of things that were going on and uh   oh really   you you you know that the effect of interaction between people and sort of to use as uh as a way of getting people to talk about their problems that sort of thing uh   yeah   we  kind of uh uh our TV viewing has uh slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along so uh that that tends to put a cramp in your viewing because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything uh its uh very little TV time left   yeah you are too tired  do anything yeah its better to spend time with your kids i think though than glued in front of the TV anyway   yeah yeah thats right   probably more worthwhile i just dont i dont think theres as many good things to watch as there used to be really   no i i i cant uh i dont think there were uh i i havent i havent uh uh there are not as many good shows that i that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to i uh you know there uh i used to could be able to name ten shows or so you know that i felt were worth my time to watch but uh i i i very seldom like to watch there theres theres a theres a couple now that i tend to want to watch i like uh home improvement shows like Bob Velas uh Home Home Again on Saturday morning its enough its like its like This Old House but its uh its on instead of being on public PBS its on regular TV but uh its kind of interesting because i   right yeah oh   they renovate an old house and   uhhuh yeah ive seen parts of that before it is interesting   yeah so uh i i like to watch that uh some some things on PBS i like to watch but uh   do you watch sports much on TV   yeah if its somebody if its a team or something that i am really interested in i i am not one to just watch a football game just to be just to be watching it or i am not a big basketball or baseball fan if it unless its baseball if its some if its a team i really like i may watch but uh   yeah   its uh baseball to me is a little hard to watch on TV for an extended period yeah its so slow that you just get bored ill ill switch between   yeah its slow   something else and and and a baseball game going back and forth you know watching it but i usually if if if its a football team i really like a college team or or pro team that im fond of i usually will will sit and watch that but uh thats the   yeah we are like that and occasionally well like on if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something well watch a little bit of a golf tournament but uh you can not take a whole lot of that either its pretty slow   yeah yeah its kind of like football like baseball     uh do you watch we rent movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home because theres just nothing on Friday and Saturday nights theres nothing good on   right i think that that thats um what more people are doing and i think thats you know as as TV i think that less good shows being on TV has caused a lot of people to do to do that uh you know to get more movies and watch i know weve weve done that too in the past uh we dont do it quite as much now because huh our baby wont let us watch them but uh   yeah   uh you know we usually will we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and and and try to watch   uhhuh do you have cable TV   no uh we live in   we dont either i thought we were the only ones  who didnt have it   no no we uh the uh development we moved into was they have it on on side like right across the street from us but when they built our section they didnt didnt put it in and   uhhuh   weve been there about two years now and theyre still still do not have it so im hoping that   gosh yeah   that soon theyll theyll theyll i have contacted them about this and they say that well its its they look  they every year they look at different areas and try to determine where where uh the most houses will be and so they   uhhuh   they look and they when they when we reach a certain number of people in that area theyll put one in put some in or theyll at least consider it so   huh yeah yeah well we had it for awhile and it just seemed like we never watched any it we didnt have the movie channels we just had all the normal ones that come and we just never watched any of them we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it and it seemed like we didnt watch even half an hour so we decided to just cancel it it does improve the reception a little bit though thats the only thing   yeah um yeah yeah ive uh ive ive uh i have i put some put in some uh an antenna a really good antenna and uh its really helped you know ours and its not been too bad i have not really missed it that much there are certain things that ive that i want to see you know occasionally like like a football football game a college game or something that happens to be on cable or some old movie you know i i havent been bothered by it by it too much   yeah   so   well i cant  uh think of too much else to say  since we are not big watchers  well it was nice talking to you um bye     right okay all right bye
