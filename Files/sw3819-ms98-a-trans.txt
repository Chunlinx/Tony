                 what do you think have been the most significant changes   uh mainly the fact that they let women in law now i think that had a lot to do with the way people thought about women   so lawyers   not just lawyers but police officers and judges and the whole legal profession in general   yeah   because it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be strictly male   yeah   and now theres women in it and i think that affected a lot of things   well i think thats a big contributor i think women have uh really um begun to penetrate a lot of fields that were dominated by men for centuries   oh i can i can definitely agree with that im im in a field that most people say is strictly male   oh yeah   yeah mechanics   uhhuh well i think um one of the best things that has happened in the twentieth century has been the uh penetration of a lot of these fields by women and  i think its gonna continue uh and even though its pretty difficult now for some men and and a lot of women i think uh its gonna bring very good things and uh were going to be a lot better off as a society as it continues but its a painful transition   oh yeah very painful especially when you have certain women that take very dim views on mothers that actually work   yeah   im a mother of two and i still hold down a job and a lot of people say well youre not home with your kids all the time your kids are gonna turn out bad i dont think so   yeah well i think there are a lot of attitudes that have to change and i guess thats the big thing you know as people change their attitudes thats gonna make the biggest difference women uh participating as equal partners in our society is one of the best things that will ever happen and history will record that but a lot of people really dont like that idea and uh   some men but youd believe you wouldnt believe how many women are against it   no i im not look at what happened with the Anita Hill testimony before the Senate subcommittee and   yeah   uh now im not surprised by that at all we have uh we have a two year old my wife uh works out of the home um and uh       uh i think just looking at how uh her uh views differ from those of her mother a generation before   umhum   so its it its really changing attitudes and um the economic necessity and the political changes as you pointed out are going to make a big difference i think um its a painful transition but a really important one and   oh yeah and i think its one of the biggest steps we or any other country in general could take   yeah i think its a big step for humankind and i think uh its its real progress but there are a lot of people with attitudes that have to change and i i guess in answering the question thats what i would say id say   yeah   that overall its just the attitude of men and women toward equal participation and equal pay and equal political influence and all sorts of other things for women because   yep   thats really gonna be better for everybody but a lot of people are threatened by that as is reflected in what goes on   yeah thats for sure and you know a lot of people think that the men are the ones that are fighting this but youd be surprised the majority of the people that are against women going into the work force doing you know even jobs you know on an even keel with men a good percentage of them are the women that are fighting it and most people say well men try and keep women locked up thats not necessarily true   yeah i   i mean the women have these ideas that they got to be the little home makers and they have to stay at home or theyre not doing good you know a good job and thats not necessarily so but everybodys blaming it on the guys saying well the guys dont let the women out thats not necessarily so its just the women have to realize they can do both   well i think i think both yeah both attitudes have to change and i think uh       um its its evident evident to me as i look at all the television shows that now focus on the relationship between men and women uh watching Roseanne last night watching uh the show that preceded it Home Improvements all these television shows which reach the American people are beginning to reflect new attitudes and those   yep and the fact that women are actually getting out and working and also keeping the home together   well and not only i mean  the the fact of the matter is that women have have carried more than their weight and are still doing that and um i see i think this is part of the problem for men as well as a guy i recognize that its uh its men whove suffered from this too because men need to learn to learn
