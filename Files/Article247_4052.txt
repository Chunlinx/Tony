                                 Campaign Book Report George W Bush                           A Charge To KeepBy George W BushWilliam Morrow and Co  pages Click here to buy the book            There was a bit of fuss a few months back about who was going to write thisbook Mickey Herskowitz a sports columnist for the Houston Chronicleoriginally hired for the job was fired in July following a dispute about whatthe book should contain At that point Karen Hughes the Bush campaignscommunications director stepped in as pinchghostwriter reportedly working upthe text in less than a month There hasnt been any pretense as there oftenis with these kinds of books that the nominal author actually wielded the penBut lets be realistic With George W Bush the question isnt whether hewrites his own book Its whether he reads it            Though there is probably not much danger that Bush will claim as CharlesBarkley did to have been misquoted in his autobiography he might convincinglydo so Hughes is supposedly as close to Bush as any of his advisers yet thebook reads as if it were written by someone who barely knows him Much of it isboilerplate that could appear under the byline of any of the candidates in thepresidential raceor any person walking down the street for that matter Hereare some passages I found especially insightful                           I always want to know about peoples backgrounds and families I like peopleand I am interested in learning more about them plus I believe peoples valuesand priorities are rooted in their upbringing               I enjoy meeting people and shaking their hands and listening to theirstories about their lives               Politics like life is a strange endeavor Things are sometimes not whatthey seem I try to get facts and weigh both sides And I remain confident thatmost people most of the time can see beyond the sound bites to appreciateleaders who try to do the right things for the right reasons               We are a close family I love my brothers and sister and count them amongthe most important people in my life               No discussion of our family would be complete without mentioning ourpets                        If Bush wrote any of this it must have been as part of his application toAndover Moms dog Millie came across as a more complex characterand a betterprose stylist            I suppose its an accomplishment in a way to have achieved a tone soutterly insipid Hughes has accomplished this in part by the unusual techniqueof double ghosting She quotes long mattressstuffing extracts from Bushspeeches ghostwritten by others In other places she describes events byreprinting reports from Texas newspapers In the biographical sections whichoccur at random she repeats the familiar stories though in a highly sanitizedform Here for instance is Bush on his college career                           I took my classes seriously and worked hard  And I made friends andplayed hard The students at Yale came from all different backgrounds and allparts of the country Within months I knew many of them                        Bush himself couldnt utter these words with a straight face It is wellknown that he hated Yale which he thought was full of intellectual snobs andalso that he did poorly there in academic terms But rather than explore any ofthis interesting territory Hughes opts for the Soviet encyclopedia approachremoving any possible blemish from the face of the leader            In the very few places where the book goes into any detail about anythingthe political purpose is transparent In describing his time in the Texas AirNational Guard Bush says he wanted to go to Vietnam to relieve activedutypilots but hadnt logged enough flying time to qualify for the program Bushspends a full chapter attempting to defuse a potential Democratic issue byexplaining why he vetoed an HMO reform bill in Texas He tries to disarm theaccusation that he was callous aboutexecuting Karla Fay Tucker by portraying his decision as an anguishedcrisis of conscience But by quoting Tuckers eloquent letter to him heactually makes himself seem even more heartless Bush believed that Tucker wassincerely penitent and that she wanted to escape execution in order to help setother prisoners straight Then he killed her anyway            Autobiography cant help revealing something about a person and even thisworthless placeholder of a book is telling in its way What it indicates isthat Dubya is not only the lightest of intellectual lightweights but afundamentally cavalier and unserious person He has no policy views only vagueaspirations for a better country He believes that reading is important butfails to mention anything he has ever read other than the Bible Personalquirks Im a stickler for being on time he writes because late is rudeHis faith is sincere but shallow Bush describes his surrender to forcesgreater than himself as something that makes it possible for him to do his jobas governor            Compare this with the books written by the three other serious contendersfor the presidency John McCainsbook the best of the bunch is not only personally revealing andinsightful but an affecting story superbly told Bradleys andGores books are dull but commendable efforts to explain themselves andtheir views Its clear that McCain Gore and Bradley all put huge amounts ofpersonal effort into their respective books being the type of people who couldnot really do otherwise They are politicians who take themselves seriouslyThey have respect for people who might take the trouble to read what theywrite Bush by contrast sees a book as a campaign poster with words Histells you a lot about him even as it tells you nothing at all
