                    Background        Sequencing studies of human transcriptomes and genomes        have identified hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide        polymorphisms SNPs the most common type of human genetic        variation     Human SNPs are being assembled into        extremely highdensity genetic maps that are anticipated to        considerably expand the remit of genetic analyses            Broad availability of SNPs for candidate genes will enhance        pharmacogenomic and complex trait association studies        Furthermore extremely dense SNP maps have the potential to        make possible genomewide association studies for complex        traits that bypass shortcomings of current genetic linkage        analyses             The emerging era of multiplexed SNPbased genetic        analysis has underscored a need for simple and accurate        genotyping methods that can accommodate thousands of loci        with economy of cost and consumption of sample DNA In        general current methods require preamplification of        genomic DNA typically by Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR        followed by SNP genotyping with an allele discrimination        method such as DNA cleavage ligation single base        extension or hybridization     Current methods are        limited either by expense inaccuracy consumption of        sample DNA or lack of scalability        Recently a new method for SNP detection from genomic DNA        based on DNA ligasemediated single nucleotide        discrimination and signal amplification by Rolling Circle        Amplification RCA has been described         An        oligonucleotide Open Circle Probe OCP anneals to the        target SNP such that the  and  ends of the OCP can be        ligated together forming a circle topologically linked to        the target A basepair match between the  end of the OCP        and the SNP allows DNA ligase to circularize the OCP A        mismatch between the OCP and the SNP prevents ligation and        circularization In this manner single base selectivity is        achieved not only by the specific hybridization of the OCP        ends to target sequences adjacent to the SNP but also by        the highly discriminative nick closure activity of the        thermostable DNA ligase toward a perfectly matched        substrate Upon OCP circularization an isothermal        exponential RCA ERCA reaction involving an exonuclease         DNA polymerase with stranddisplacement activity and        two primers rapidly amplifies the signal by as much as         fold allowing for direct SNP genotyping from small        quantities of DNA target              We describe here a simple scalable assay for SNP        genotyping directly from human genomic DNA that uses a        well plate format and fluorescent primers called        Amplifluors         Ten different SNPs have        been characterized each for DNA samples from  different        individuals using this reporter assay system We also        report that the ERCA allows genotyping with as few as          copies of the target sequence                    Results                  Experimental strategy          Two OCPs were designed for each SNP screened one          complementary to each of the two possible bases of a          biallelic SNP If the OCP is complementary to the SNP          it can be circularized by DNA ligase Fig  The OCPs          were   nucleotides in length and are designed such          that regions at both the  and  ends annealed to          contiguous segments of the SNPcontaining target          sequence The OCP backbone sequence connecting the target          complementary  and  regions is unique for the two          allelespecific OCPs The  targetspecific region of          the OCP is  bp in length while the           targetspecific region is  bp     The Tm of the           target specific region is  C above the ligation          temperature while that of the  target specific region          is  C below the ligation temperature Allele          specificity of circularization is dependent upon two          factors  favorable hybridization of the matching OCP          because of the correct base pair formed at the  end and          also because of base stacking between the  and           annealed ends and  specificity of the ligase for          correctly base paired ends          Upon ligation the DNA circle creates an effective          template for an exponential or hyperbranching RCA          reaction      The region of the OCP between the          targetspecific ends which we have designated the OCP          backbone provides a binding site for a complementary          primer P In addition to P a reverse primer P is          also present to achieve amplification with exponential          kinetics Fig  P is an Amplifluorprimer with a           hairpin and loop structure with a fluorophore and          quencher at the base of the hairpin arms                The two allelespecific OCPs have different backbone          sequences complementary either to a FAM or TET labeled          P allowing discrimination of the polymorphic base Both          Ps have an internal DABCYL quencher Amplifluor primers          are designed such that at the ambient temperature of the          assay the fluorophore and the quencher are in close          proximity preventing fluorescence Incorporation of          Amplifluor into a doublestranded ERCA product opens the          hairpin separating the fluorophore and quencher          resulting in increased fluorescence Two different          allelespecific Ps are also used in the assay They are          partly target and partly backbonespecific          corresponding to the  targetspecific region of the          OCP and  nucleotides of the adjacent backbone          sequence The backbonespecific  region of the          allelespecific Ps not only increases the Tm of the          primer to that desired for the assay but also confers          OCP specificity Ps have two abasic residues at the           end to reduce primerdimer formation unpublished          data                          Analysis of allele discrimination during the OCP          ligation step of the assay          The first step in the genotyping assay involves SNP          interrogation by ligation of the OCP using the          thermostable ligase Ampligase which is reported to          have excellent discrimination between a matched and          mismatched  terminal nucleotide     In order to          directly investigate the efficiency and specificity of          the ligation step allele discrimination of OCP ligation          was analyzed using  Plabeled OCP The          oligonucleotide target contained the sequence for the          MK locus of the CFTR gene a diseasecausing          mutation An electrophoretic mobility shift for          circularized OCP allowed quantification of ligation          kinetics Use of  nM OCP and  nM oligonucleotide          target allowed sufficient signal for detection without          the ERCA step that is required for genomic DNA target           of the OCP matching the SNP were ligated in  sec          Fig a For mismatched OCP less than  was ligated          after  hours Fig b The ability of Ampligase to          discriminate against a mismatch was measured by          comparison of initial ligation rates Allele          Discrimination  percent match ligationpercent mismatch          ligation time           mismatch time           match  Ligation of matched OCP          occurred at a fold greater rate than for          mismatched OCP Greater temperature and shorter  OCP          arm length both tended to give increased allele          discrimination Fig  The T           m of the  OCP arm is greater than          the reaction temperature and so the OCP tightly anneals          to the target However the shorter  arm having a T           m below the reaction temperature is          in equilibrium between the annealed and melted state A          component of the allele discrimination is apparently          derived from differential hybridization of the matched          and mismatched  arms Presumably increasing reaction          temperature has the same effect as shortening the  OCP          arm                          Analysis of the ERCA signal amplification step of          the assay          In reactions where the OCP matches the SNP an          estimated  OCPs are circularized by ligation          depending on the amount of input DNA target Detection of          this small number of circles depends on ERCA in the          second stage of the assay ERCA is capable of  fold          signal amplification     In order to investigate the          efficiency of the ERCA step OCP was circularized by          ligation on a synthetic oligonucleotide target and          gelpurified to remove any linear DNA A known number of          the purified circles were added to reactions allowing          direct analysis of ERCA signal amplification The circles          were formed using OCPT for the SNP GA using an          oligonucleotide target Table I A fold serial          dilution of the circles ranging from  to approximately          one circle was used in the ERCA reactions An Amplifluor          primer was used to measure the kinetics of the reaction          in a realtime instrument The results confirmed that the          assay is capable of detecting   molecules of          circular template Fig a The time at which          fluorescent signal is first detected C           T  is proportional to the number of          starting templates over the six orders of magnitude          tested Fig b This demonstrates the quantitative          potential of ERCA and that it is capable of detecting and          amplifying the small number of circles formed by ligation          on genomic DNA                          SNP genotyping on human genomic DNA          The GA SNP on chromosome q was used for          genotyping with OCPs using the SNP assay B Grimwade          unpublished Human genomic DNA was digested with the          restriction endonuclease Alu I and assayed in two          different tubes each containing one of the two allele          specific OCP Reactions contained  pM OCP and  ng          of the genomic DNA corresponding to a gene copy number          of approximately  OCP ligation was performed with          Ampligase for  min at C approximately C above          the Tm for the OCP  arm in order to maximize          specificity of ligation Since the  arm of the OCP has          a Tm above that of the ligation temperature the  arm          hybridizes to its target in a stable manner and SNP          specificity is achieved via the  arm          The isothermal ERCA reactions were performed at C          using Bst DNA polymerase The reactions contained the          appropriate OCPspecific P Amplifluor primer and the          corresponding allelespecific P  uM each When the          genomic DNA was homozygous for the G allele Fig a top          panel a fluorescent signal was detected only for the OCP          with a matching C at the  end and the corresponding          primer pair PinFAM and PinC Similarly when the          reaction contained genomic DNA homozygous for the A          allele Fig a center panel a fluorescence signal was          detected only with the OCP containing a matching T at the           end and the corresponding primer pair PocTET and          PocT Only background fluorescence was detected for the          mismatched OCPs As expected when the target DNA was          heterozygous a fluorescence signal was observed with          both OCPprimer combinations Fig a lower panel When          the reaction endpoint products were analyzed on an          agarose gel an ERCA product ladder was observed only for          reactions where the OCP correctly matched the SNP base          Fig b ERCA reactions produce a characteristic ladder          of discrete bands because the product consists of double          stranded tandemly linked multiples of the circle          sequence      As expected the ladder band spacing          was consistent with the length of the OCP                          Validation of the assay for ten SNPs for           individuals          The accuracy of the SNP genotyping assay was          demonstrated on two sets of human genomic DNA samples          each containing DNA from  different individuals Ten          different SNPs representing five of the six possible          types of single nucleotide substitutions were assayed          Table II Results were compared to the known genotypes          determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism or          DNA sequencing of both strands by the single base          extension method The SNP assay gave correct genotypes an          average of   of the time Table II When misscored          samples were repeated in triplicate the genotyping          accuracy was above  data not shown A scatter plot          of the data for SNP GA shows the clear distinction          between each of the three possible genotypes Fig c          The protocol uses a microtiter plate format providing a          high throughput method of genotyping                          Singletube assay for SNP genotyping using a low          copy number of targets          The above experiments involved a twotube assay with           ng of genomic DNA and one OCPP combination per          tube Therefore a total of  ng genomic DNA was used          per DNA sample to be investigated One of the objectives          for highthroughput screening of SNPs is the ability to          accurately detect a SNP from a small amount of genomic          DNA Previously it was shown that  ng of genomic DNA          equivalent to   copies of the gene was sufficient          to detect a CT polymorphism using the serial invasive          signal amplification reaction SISAR     In order          to investigate the sensitivity of ERCA for detecting          SNPs  ng of genomic DNA equivalent to   copies of          the gene was used as target for circle formation with          OCPs for the SNP GA          The method was also simplified so that instead of one          tube each for the two allelespecific OCPs a singletube          for both OCPs was used Both OCP systems could be          combined in the same tube because the seven  bases of          P are complementary to the unique backbone region of the          OCP The P for one allele could only effectively prime          one OCP and the P for the other allele could only prime          the other OCP at the ERCA reaction temperature The P          primer was the same for the two OCPs and detection and          specificity was achieved by two allelespecific          Amplifluor Ps carrying either a FAM or a TET          fluorophore The annealing ligation reaction therefore          included both of the allelespecific OCPs OCPC and          OCPT Table I and the ERCA reaction was performed          in the presence of both of the allelespecific P          Amplifluor primers PCTET and PTFAM This          assay detected and differentiated all three possible          genotypes for the GA SNP Fig  The background          signal observed was slightly higher than that obtained          with  ng genomic DNA in a twotube system with a          signalnoise ratio of  However correct SNP          genotyping was observed with  different human genomic          DNA samples data not shown                            Discussion        We have demonstrated a solutionbased efficient        homogeneous and robust assay for genotyping SNPs directly        from human genomic DNA utilizing ligation of open circle        probes and rolling circle amplification The design of the        assay is fairly straightforward and the assay can be        carried out in three hours  min for the denaturation         annealing  ligation reaction and   h for the        amplification reaction in a well format Specificity of        the OCP to its target sequence is achieved by the        complementarity of the two ends of the OCP to the target        and the requirement of these ends to be adjacent for        ligation Single nucleotide discrimination is achieved at        the ligation step by the use of the thermostable DNA        ligase Ampligase which has a high affinity for a        perfectly matched substrate at the  end of a DNA molecule            We were able to enhance allele discrimination at        the ligation step by designing the OCP such that the         complementary region is firmly hybridized to the target        sequence whereas the  region is in equilibrium with its        target at the ligation temperature     This would        result in increased specificity since the correctly matched        OCP will have a greater chance to act as substrate for the        ligase It has been previously reported that TG and         GT mismatches are not good substrates for single        nucleotide discrimination     However we found that        the GA SNP which would result in a TG mismatch        was efficient for allele discrimination The ability of        this assay to genotype any SNP regardless of the base pair        involved is an important advantage over assays based on        primer extension such as PCR        Allele discrimination achieved at the ligation step        results in small circular DNA molecules topologically        linked to the target DNA strand These DNA circles are        amplified in the powerful homogeneous ERCA reaction capable        of  fold signal amplification     similar to that        achieved with PCR technology the current gold standard in        genetic analysis and quantitation However PCR involves        exponential target amplification thereby increasing the        risk of amplicon crosscontamination Even though this        shortcoming can be overcome it increases the cost and        complexity of the assay making it less attractive for        highthroughput analysis Since ERCA is a signal circle        amplification method it does not have the problems        associated with PCR In addition ERCA is an isothermal        reaction and the reaction endpoint can be used as the assay        readout Even though the present study was conducted on a        realtime ABI  Sequence Detector instrument the        strategy can be easily adapted for a simple fluorescence        plate reader coupled to an adjustable heating block These        properties make it an ideal system for highthroughput        analysis        The assay was tested for  SNPS on two sets of         different DNA samples Table II Results were compared to        the known genotypes that we determined by RFLP or single        nucleotide sequencing reactions The assay had an average        genotyping accuracy of  when samples were screened        initially When the misscored samples were repeated in        triplicate the genotyping accuracy jumped to over  The        majority of the misscoring involved a homozygous sample        being called heterozygous ie an amplification signal        was observed with both sets of OCPprimer combinations A        DNA sample homozygous for one allele was never genotyped as        homozygous for the other allele This implied that there is        a low frequency of DNA synthesis artifacts resulting in a        fluorescence signal        Indeed when these reactions were analyzed on an agarose        gel the size of the characteristic ERCA DNA ladder was        different from that obtained with amplification of the OCP        data not shown We have used abasic residues at the         ends of P primers in order to reduce these artifacts        Other nucleotide modifications that have been reported to        reduce primerdimer formation will be tested to improve the        accuracy of SNP genotyping In addition reagents that have        been shown to reduce primerdimer formation in PCR will be        tested in the ERCA reaction        Background signal is sometimes related to the amount of        OCP used in the assay For each SNP the optimal OCP        concentration needs to be determined before screening        Excess OCP concentrations result in an increase in        nonspecific fluorescence signal therefore lowering the        accuracy rate of genotyping Potentially unligated OCP        can act as template or primer giving rise to a low level of        nonspecific DNA synthesis and subsequent fluorescent        signal We are currently developing a modified OCP design        to overcome the need for concentration optimization In        this design the  region of the OCP forms a stable        hairpinloop structure and opens up only to anneal to it        target sequence O Alsmadi unpublished As with        molecular beacons this may also improve target specificity             Any unused OCP is self primed and extended to        form an inert double stranded molecule thus eliminating        OCP as a source for nonspecific amplification Initial        experiments with this design have been encouraging                    Conclusions        We have described a solutionbased SNP genotyping assay        that is simple sensitive and robust and can be easily        formatted to highthroughput analysis of single nucleotide        polymorphisms and mutation detection directly from human        genomic DNA The SNP genotyping assay uses a simple        homogeneous fluorescence readout and can be carried out on        inexpensive instruments already available in many academic        and industrial laboratories        Amplifluor is a trademark
