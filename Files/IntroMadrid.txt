                      Madrid and its People the Madrileos        For a half millennium or more Madrid idled as a provincial        backwater rarely noticed on the arid central plains of Castile until        Felipe II plucked it from his royal cap in  and proclaimed it the        capital of Spain Manmade Madrid which quickly assumed the reigns of        Spains Golden Age hasnt stopped growing and asserting itself since        Though one of Europes youngest capitals its had plenty of time to        catch up to Spains more historic cities including Seville Toledo and        Granada and today it is their political administrative and economic        superior Only Barcelona rivals it in economic importance        Felipe IIs royal decree was based entirely on geography        the idea being that Madrid smack in the center of Iberia would        promote centralized authority over regional power bases in a newly        unified Spain Today Madrid is that cohesive center and more It is a        city to which people migrate from all over Spain in search of new        opportunities a place where few people can claim any deep roots        Madrid is a bustling sprawling mostly modern metropolis        This capital city of four million is constantly rattled by noise and        stifled by dense traffic As Spain has solidified its place in the        European Union Madrid has become larger more important and yes        somewhat less characteristically Iberian Once its immigrants were        from the surrounding regions of Spain today its newcomers are from        across Europe and beyond bringing with them new languages and        customs        Among other parts of Spain Andaluca is more folkloric        Catalonia and the Basque country more proudly independent Barcelona        and Granada possess greater architecture and many Spanish cities have        finer natural attributes But Madrileos dont begrudge those places        anything Madrid may be a planned bureaucrats town like Brasilia or        Washington but its far richer in color and tone Madrid is the next        rung down from heaven so the boastful local saying goes and the        citys residents claim their superiority in other terms        Madrid reigns in cultural life and vida        nocturnanightlife Few cities have so perfected the art of        socializingeating and drinkingin public A collective and        gregarious lot who seem to carry on much of their lives in the streets        Madrileos are stars when night falls hopping in and out of tabernas        and tascas cavelike taverns and bars for repeated rituals of tapas        bar fingerfoods jugs of Spanish wine and hyperanimated        conversation The night goes latevery latein Madrid and theres        not a day of the week that the streets arent flooded by hordes of        afterhours diners and barhoppers A lack of sleep can always be        remedied later a Madrileo might tell you as he tops off a late night        with earlymorning chocolate con curros a frieddough and chocolate        snack ideal for absorbing alcohol on the way home for a shower and        then continues on to work        The nights rowdy revelers get most of the        attentionsurely Madrid must pack in more bars discos and livemusic        venues per capita than any other sizeable European city Yet the city        also makes plenty of room for more elevated pursuits including Spains        most sophisticated cultural life opera theater zarzuela an        indigenous form of light comic opera and dance These entertainments        flourish as does flamenco a popular art form with spiritual callings        for both the purist and the tourist        Madrids cultural output reaches its apogee though in its        superb concentration of art museums On one grand boulevard the Paseo        del Prado are three of Europes finest museums the worldclass Prado        museum the ThyssenBornemisza collection and the Centro de Arte Reina        Sofa Queen Sofa Art Center whose claim to fame is the th        centurys most famous painting Pablo Picassos Guernica Madrids        collection of Spanish Old MastersVelzquez El Greco Goya        Zurbarn and moreis unrivalled in the world        Though a city of immigrants the city clings to castizo        workingclass Madrileo traditions Madrid is the focus of that        fiercest of Spanish customs the bullfight and local ferias and        fiestas like San Isidro a celebration of the citys patron saint are        prepared and attended with the same zeal that they are in small Spanish        towns In fact in the relatively small area that most visitors are        likely to cover Madrid doesnt really feel like an overgrown        Europeanized capital With its friendly taverns street booksellers        and momandpop shops it frequently seems like a smallalbeit        densely populatedSpanish town and it is easily covered on foot        The heart of the city is Viejo Madrid Old Madrid a        largely thcentury city built upon the layout of narrow winding        streets of an old Moorish settlement  Madrid de los Asturias is        named for the Hapsburgs instrumental in the citys rapid growth during        the s Old Madrids centerpiece is its splendid porticoed and        sunglazed Plaza Mayor Little remains of medieval Madrid but there        are glimpses of the oldest parts of the city in the Arab walls and        several attractive small plazas as well as many other discoveries to        be made in this area that extends from the River Manzanares and Palacio        Real Royal Palace actually the legacy of the later Bourbon rulers to        the lively congested Puerta del Sol still the nerve center of        Madrid        The Bourbon monarchs of the th century fostered Madrids        expansion east They built monumental Madrid a city of grand avenues        and boulevards fountains gateways and parks Bourbon Madrid is best        symbolized by the handsome Paseo del Prado and Parque del Buen Retiro        once the royal familys private park and hunting grounds        Modern Madrid grew unrelentingly in all directions        beginning in the th century Its most attractive nucleus is the        neighborhood of Salamanca an elite barrio of tony apartment buildings        and sophisticated designer shops La Castellana and Paseo de Recoletos        are continuations north of the Prado boulevard of the Bourbons Both        are lined with sidewalk cafes and strollers on sunny days and summer        nights Madrid spilled outward from there and especially in the last        two decades has pushed farther and farther out leaving little        distinction between city and suburb        Madrids diverse architecture while not the equal of a        Paris or London traces the citys stages of expansion and prevailing        styles of the different eras Moving outward from the center one        passes from stately ornamental thcentury apartment buildings with        shuttered windows wroughtiron balconies and brick facades to the        Baroque palaces of the Bourbons and later Neoclassical buildings        meant to convey authority The elegant and today trafficchoked Gran        Va Madrids central shopping artery is a turnofthe century        showcase of Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles        Madrid is at the forefront of a new dynamic Spain After        tossing off the shackles of Francos long dictatorship that isolated        Spain from the rest of Europe Madrid erupted from the closet        embracing a frenetic arts and nightlife scene called la movida in the        early s Homosexuality drugs allnight partying and living life        on the edge the credo of films by Pedro Almodvar the boy wonder of        la movida were the shocking symbols of the new Spain Once        unshakingly traditional conservative and Catholic a country where        official awards used to be given for fecundity Spain today has the        fewest children in Europe Its population is actually dwindling as        women assert themselves in careers and couples contemplate the economic        challenges of raising a family in a congested and competitive city like        Madrid        Still the Spain of yesteryear flourishes in many corners        of the city At the hour of the paseo stroll when offices empty        Madrileos spill onto promenades and swamp outdoor cafs plunging into        conversation Conservatively dressed businessmen escort impeccably        coiffed women while retired gentlemen in cardigans jackets and ties        play chess or petanca a game resembling marbles but played with heavy        shotputs in the park Locals of all ages from senior citizens to        highschool kids donning Metallica Tshirts crowd into thcentury        taverns to sip sherry or vino tinto drawn from old wooden barrels and        to munch on morsels of tortilla espaola        Madrids easy embrace of extremesit is both the capital        of a technologydependent country that exploded since becoming part of        the European Union just  years ago and at heart a small town that        revels in its castizo traditionsis part of life here Even nature        imposes extremes At an altitude of more than  meters  feet        this city on the Castilian plateau Europes highest capital is        scorching in summer when wilting residents flee for the coast or        cooler northern climes and freezing in winter when many Madrileos        bolt for the Sierra Nevada just a couple hours south to ski        Escaping after a few days in the capital is the plan of        most visitors as well for most a trip to Madrid is as much about what        the plains of Castile just beyond the city contain as what the capital        itself offers Madrid is the perfect base for explorations into the        heart and soul of Spain with a wealth of fascinating day trips and a        trio of UNESCOhonored cities just an hour or so from the city Toledo        Spains former capital set on a crag above a river moat is a living        museum of El Greco and the legacy of a great capital city of        Christians Jews and Muslims Segovia is a picture postcard of central        Spain a royal stronghold with a fairytale castle and astounding        yearold Roman aqueduct The walled city of vila is the        birthplace of the mystic St Theresa who still commands intense        devotion among her followers        Closer to Madrid are other sights that reveal pivotal        periods of Spanish history El Escorial is a dramatic monastery        mausoleum and palace built by Felipe II and one of the mostvisited        places in Spain and nearby is El Valle de los Cados Valley of the        Fallen
