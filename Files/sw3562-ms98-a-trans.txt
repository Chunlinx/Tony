              okay well you you start it   well i feel that women have in the roles that theyve played theyve uh they used to be at home all the time with the children and now most of them work out of the home because it takes two incomes to make it   uhhuh   these days and um they just uh they theres more women than men now and theyve learned that they have to take care of themselves that they cant depend on a man to support them now      sure unfortunately what thats done is its put everybody in a terrible position because it used to be that one person could work whether it a man or a woman   thats right   okay now were in a situation where uh it or at least it seems that maybe its the economy or maybe its just uh you know employers taking advantage of the fact that women want to work and now that theyve made it or at least seems that like two people have to work in order to uh in order to afford to live you know but uh i think its its great i mean my wife works uh   makes end meet uhhuh well its really too bad they and because the women are so underpaid and therere so many sole supporters that are women now   yeah its true its true what they say like women get sixty seven cents to the dollar   uhhuh   that men make doing the same job thats thats terrible but i i think thatll change too   well see in my days when i was a teenager my i wanted to go to school my mother said well she didnt want to send me to school i was going to get married anyway she said     yeah   so that meant that i was going to get married and a man was going to work and take care of me but you dont think that way now   no thats why now every every woman i know works uh even my mother who didnt work for a while is back working now   uhhuh umhum   um except with the few exceptions of people that are unemployed which is unfortunate lately um every woman i know works my wife took some time off after we had our uh child our first child   umhum   but even that shes planned on getting work which good for her is she works in a  profession that she could get work at home so shes going to   oh well thats good thats really good   so we dont have to do the yeah shes an editor so she gets to do that and my sister   shes a what   an editor   oh an editor   like in publishing yeah   oh thats really good she can do that at home     she could do that at home so thats good   yeah i wish they could come up with more jobs for women to stay home with their younger children   yeah i think thats the dilemma unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately my wife is in a profession that is uh relatively high amount of women in in publishing   umhum   uh and it just so happens or maybe doesnt so happen that its not a very high paying field now maybe thats because theres a lot of women in it like youre saying women are underpaid uh the amount of money that she was making didnt didnt make it worth her while to uh you know   yeah well pay a babysitter and   not be home pay for a babysitter or day care   uhhuh umhum   uh you know say that and and on top of the fact that   umhum plus the clothing she has to have to wear   sure sure that on top of the fact that that uh uh she can do some work at home that that it makes it makes it a perfect fit but   well that may be a thing for the future the computers now that theyre trying to stress that for women to   yeah or to have   so women can stay home and work on computers   or or have day care at the work place one or the other   umhum   uh but unfortunate its like thats not doing too well i know a lot of lot of lot of times its the opposite though a lot of times um men stay home and the women women go to work which i think is good if youre not breast feeding   thats not i havent found anybody like that ive heard of that but i havent met anyone like that     yeah no i i ive known a few people and ive read uh about others you know just like articles and stuff about other people doing it i certainly would do it uh i have no problem with that unfortunately im paid a lot more than my wife so it wouldnt be worth it   yeah   um for our family but i   well how do you think womens roles are going to change in the future   um well i think as as time as time goes on women will um definitely have a better better better role in the work place i think that you know the first wave of women in the work place in any substantial degree was in you know like in the seventies and eighties   uhhuh   and i think as women take on um roles of uh more importance in in jobs and and also again not to sounds i dont want to sound like you know like i like i think its hard but i mean a lot of times women were given jobs because they were women you know and i think once once it evens out so that women get the jobs that they deserve and get the pay that they deserve which will often be     uhhuh   powerful positions where there will be less discrimination in hiring when they hopefully when they hire   well see i in the past i could understand why men got paid more than women because they were the they called them the bread winners and theyd support the whole family   you know yeah but thats   but thats not the case now   thats why not the case   so i thats why i dont think that they should get paid more than the woman if theyre   sudden   doing the same job   why would it be fair earlier i mean you know
