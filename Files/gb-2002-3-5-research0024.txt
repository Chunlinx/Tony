                    Background        Gene fusion leading to the formation of multidomain        proteins is one of the major routes of protein evolution        Gene fusions characteristically bring together proteins        that function in a concerted manner such as successive        enzymes in metabolic pathways enzymes and the domains        involved in their regulation or DNAbinding domains and        ligandbinding domains in prokaryotic transcriptional        regulators     The selective advantage of domain        fusion lies in the increased efficiency of coupling of the        corresponding biochemical reaction or signal transduction        step   and in the tight coregulation of expression of        the fused domains In signal transduction systems such as        prokaryotic twocomponent regulators and sugar        phosphotransferase PTS systems or eukaryotic receptor        kinases domain fusion is the main principle of functional        design     Furthermore accretion of multiple        domains appears to be one of the important routes for        increasing functional complexity in the evolution of        multicellular eukaryotes            Pairs of distinct genes that are fused in at least one        genome have been termed fusionlinked   A gene fusion        is presumably fixed during evolution only when the partners        cooperate functionally and by inference a functional link        can be predicted to exist between fusionlinked genes        Recently this simple concept has been used by several        groups as a means of systematic prediction of the functions        of uncharacterized genes              In addition to their utility for functional prediction        analysis of gene fusions may help in addressing fundamental        evolutionary issues Gene fusions often show scattered        phyletic patterns appearing in several species from        different lineages By investigating the phylogenies of        each of the two fusionlinked genes it may be possible to        determine the evolutionary scenario for the fusion itself        A recent study provided evidence that the fission of fused        genes occurred during evolution at a rate comparable to        that of fusion   Here we address another central        aspect of the evolution of gene fusions namely do fusions        of the same domains in different phylogenetic lineages        reflect vertical descent possibly accompanied by multiple        lineagespecific fission events or independent fusion        events or horizontal transfer of the fused gene In other        words is a fusion of a given pair of genes extremely rare        and once formed is it spread by horizontal gene transfer        HGT perhaps also followed by fissions in some lineages        Alternatively are independent fusions of the same gene        pair in distinct lineages relatively common during        evolution Among fusions that are found in at least two of        the three primary kingdoms of life Bacteria Archaea and        Eukaryota we detected both modes of evolution but        horizontal transfer of a fused gene appeared to be more        common than independent fusion events or vertical        inheritance with multiple fissions                    Results and discussion        To distinguish between a single fusion event followed by        HGT andor fission of the fused gene and multiple        independent fusion events in distinct organisms we        analyzed phylogenetic trees that were constructed        separately for each of the fusionlinked domains        proteins The fusion was split into the individual        component domains and phylogenetic trees were built for        each of the corresponding orthologous sets from  complete        microbial genomes Figure  and see Materials and        methods including both fusion components and products of        standalone genes The topologies of the resulting trees        were compared to each other and to the topology of a        phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of a        concatenated alignment of ribosomal proteins which was        chosen as the hypothetical species tree of the organisms        involved   If the fusion events either occurred        independently of each other or were vertically inherited        perhaps followed by fission in some lineages the        distribution of the fusion components in the phylogenetic        trees for the orthologous clusters to which they belong is        expected to mimic the distribution of the species carrying        the fusion in the species tree In contrast if the fusion        gene has been disseminated by HGT fusion components will        form odd clusters different from those in the species        tree        This could be a straightforward approach to        reconstructing the evolutionary history of gene fusions if        only the topology of the species trees was well resolved        However this is not necessarily the case for bacteria or        archaea where relationships between major lineages remain        uncertain    although a recent detailed analysis        suggested some higherlevel evolutionary affinities          Because the distinction between the three primary kingdoms        is widely recognized    and is clear in the trees        for most protein families           trans kingdom horizontal transfers        of fused genes can be more reliably detected with the        proposed approach Therefore we concentrated on the        evolutionary histories of gene fusions that are shared by        at least two of the three primary kingdoms        As the framework for this analysis we used the database        of clusters of orthologous groups COGs of proteins           which contains sets of orthologous proteins and        domains from complete microbial genomes  genomes at the        time of this analysis see Materials and methods Domain        fusions represented in some genomes by standalone versions        of the fusion components are split in the COG database so        that each fusion component can be assigned to a different        COG Whenever distinct domains of a fusion protein belong        to separate COGs the corresponding COGs are said to be        fusionlinked   A search of the COGs database revealed         pairs of fusionlinked COGs The vast majority  of        fusion links include fusion present in only one primary        kingdom Table  Only  pairs of fusionlinked COGs        included fusions represented in two or three kingdoms        Table  and for reasons discussed above we chose these        pairs of COGs for an evolutionary analysis of gene        fusions        Figure shows a genomeCOG matrix that reveals the        phyletic phylogenetic patterns of the presence or absence        of the orthologs across the spectrum of the sequenced        genomes   for each of the  pairs of fusionlinked        COGs containing crosskingdom fusions When assessed        against the topology of the tentative species tree based on        the concatenated alignments of ribosomal proteins          fusions showed a scattered distribution in phyletic        patterns depicted by columns in Figure  For example        the fusion between COG and COG  and  subunits of        acylCoA acetate CoA transferase is seen in the bacteria         Escherichia coli Deinococcus        radiodurans and         Bacillus halodurans  and in the        archaea         Aeropyrum pernix Thermophilus        acidophilum and         Halobacterium sp Similarly the        fusion between COG and COG uncharacterized        conserved domains was found in the bacteria         Pseudomonas aeruginosa and         Vibrio cholerae  and in the archaeon                Methanobacterium        thermoautotrophicum  In each of these cases with the        species tree used as a reference the bacteria involved are        phylogenetically distant from each other and more so from        the archaea and nonfused versions of the two domains        exist within the same bacterial lineages and in archaea        Figure  These observations emphasize the central        question of this work are the fusions between the same        pair of domains in different species independent or are        they best explained by HGT        Figure shows the pair of phylogenetic trees for the        fusionlinked COGs  and  In both trees the fusion        components from         E coli and         B halodurans YdiF and BH        respectively confidently group with the archaeal fusion        components to the exclusion of the nonfused orthologs        This position of the         E coli and         B halodurans fusion components is        unexpected and is in contrast to the placement of the        orthologs from other gammaproteobacteria and Grampositive        bacteria as well as nonfused paralogs from the same        species AtoAD and BH respectively within the        bacterial cluster These observations strongly suggest that        the gene for fused subunits of acylCoA acetate CoA        transferase was disseminated horizontally between         E coli B halodurans  and archaea        The presence of nonfused paralogs in both these bacterial        species appears to be best compatible with gene transfer        from archaea to bacteria In contrast the fusion of the        pair of domains from the same COGs seen in         D radiodurans seems to be an        independent event because in both trees the         D radiodurans branch is in the        middle of the bacterial cluster Figure ab Thus the        history of this pair of fusionlinked COGs appears to        involve horizontal transfer of the fused gene between        bacteria and archaea and possibly also within kingdoms        as well as at least one additional independent fusion        event in bacteria        Figure shows the phylogenetic trees for the two domains        of phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine FGAM synthase a        purine biosynthesis enzyme The components of this fusion        which is found in proteobacteria and eukaryotes form a        tight cluster separated by a long internal branch from the        nonfused bacterial and archaeal orthologs This tree        topology suggests HGT between bacteria and eukaryotes        possibly a relocation of the fused gene from the        promitochondrion to the eukaryotic nuclear genome or        alternatively gene transfer from eukaryotes to        proteobacteria An additional aspect of the evolution of        this gene is the apparent acceleration of evolution upon        gene fusion which is manifest in the long branch that        separates the proteobacterialeukaryotic cluster from the        rest of the bacterial and archaeal species Figure        ab        The fusionlinked COGs  and  chorismate mutase        and prephenate dehydratase respectively show a more        complicated history with distinct fusion events resulting        in different domain architectures see legend to Figure         The presence in both trees of two distinct clusters of        fusion components and the isolated fusion in         Campylobacter jejuni suggest at least        three independent fusion events two of which apparently        were followed by horizontal dissemination of the fused gene        Figure ab The single archaeal fusion the         Arachaeoglobus fulgidus protein        AF belongs to one of these clusters and shows a        strongly supported affinity with the ortholog from the        hyperthermophilic bacterium         Thermotoga maritima  Figure ab        Given the broad distribution of this fusion in bacteria        horizontal transfer of the bacterial fused gene to archaea        is the most likely scenario        The pair of fusionlinked COGs  and   and         subunits of acetylCoA carboxylase respectively shows        unequivocal clustering of the fusion components from        numerous archaeal and bacterial species which indicates a        prevalent role for HGT in the evolution of this fusion        Figure ab Moreover archaea are scattered among        bacteria suggesting multiple HGT events However an        apparent independent fusion is seen in         Mycobacterium tuberculosis Figure        ab It could be argued that in cases like those in        Figure  where there is a sharp separation a long        strongly supported internal branch in each of the trees        between the fusion components and standalone proteins the        COGs involved needed to be reorganized to form one COG        consisting of fusion proteins only and two separate COGs        consisting of standalone proteins Formally this would        eliminate the need for HGT as an explanation of the tree        topology for any of these new COGs However this solution        even if attractive from the point of view of        classification does not seem to be correct in light of the        principle of orthology that underlies the COG system it        appears that in both of the COGs involved the fusion        components and standalone proteins are         bona fide orthologs as judged by the        high level of sequence conservation and by the fact that        in the majority of species involved they are the only        versions of this key enzyme        The results of phylogenetic analyses of the         crosskingdom fusion links are summarized in Tables and        and the Additional data In  of the  links an        interkingdom horizontal transfer of the fused gene        appeared to be the evolutionary mechanism by which the        fusion entered one of the kingdoms In contrast only         fusionlinked pairs of COGs show evidence of independent        fusion in two kingdoms and in just two cases the fusion        seems to have been inherited from the last universal common        ancestor The latter two scenarios were distinguished on        the basis of the parsimony principle that is by counting        the number of evolutionary events fusions or fissions        that were required to produce the observed distribution of        fusion components and standalone versions of the domains        involved across the tree branches Accordingly it needs to        be emphasized that we can only infer the most likely        scenario under the assumption that the probabilities of        fusion and fission are comparable It cannot be ruled out        that some of the scenarios we classify as independent        fusions in reality reflect the existence of an ancestral        fused gene and subsequent multiple independent fissions        The detection of ancestral domain fusions may call for the        unification of the respective COG pairs in a single COG        with the species in which fission occurred represented by        two distinct proteins        Examination of the genomic context of the genes that        encode standalone counterparts of the fusion components        showed that in  of the  cases these genes were        juxtaposed in some and in certain cases many prokaryotic        genomes Table  This suggests that evolution of gene        fusions often if not always passes through an        intermediate stage of juxtaposed and coregulated but        still distinct genes within known or predicted operons In        addition some of the juxtaposed gene pairs might have        evolved by fission of a fused gene        The results of the present analysis point to HGT as a        major route of crosskingdom dissemination of fused genes        Horizontal transfer might be even more prominent in the        evolution of fused genes within the bacterial and archaeal        kingdoms This notion is supported by the topologies of        some of the phylogenetic trees analyzed which show        unexpected clustering of bacterial species from different        lineages note for example the grouping of         D radiodurans with         P aeruginosa in Figure  Massive        HGT between archaea and bacteria particularly        hyperthermophiles has been suggested by genome comparisons              However proving HGT in each        individual case is difficult and the significance of        crosskingdom HGT has been disputed    With gene        fusions the existence of a derived shared character        fusion supporting the clades formed by fusion components        and the concordance of the independently built trees for        each of the fusion components make a solid case for        HGT        The apparent independent fusion of the same pair of        genes or more precisely members of the same two COGs on        multiple occasions during evolution might seem unlikely        However we found that onefourth to onethird of the gene        fusions shared by at least two kingdoms might have evolved        through such independent events and probable additional        independent fusions were noted among bacteria This could        be due to the extensive genome rearrangement characteristic        of the evolution of prokaryotes    and to the        selective value of these particular fusions which tend to        get fixed once they emerge                    Materials and methods        The
