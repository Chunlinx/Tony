                    Background        Resources and personnel often limit comprehensive health        services in rural areas Yet rural hospitals fueled by        community expectations and the need for expanded revenue        sources have expanded their scope of specialized services        which has led to the development of rural intensive care        units ICUs Despite the growth in number and use of        intensive care services   there is little information        about the breadth or quality of these services in the rural        setting   This is particularly true for specialized ICU        services such as mechanical ventilation where no        information exists specifically for rural hospitals A        Medline search performed using the key words ICU rural        hospital and mechanical ventilation produced no similar        literature        Moscovice and Rosenblatt   suggest that the ability        of rural hospitals to provide specialized services depends        on a number of factors including the training and        interests of local personnel the ability to maintain        performance standards despite a small patient volume the        extent of support resources and financial stability In        previous studies involving rural hospitals there have been        quality concerns surrounding the threshold effect namely        that sufficient patient volume may not be available to        maintain requisite skills    There is evidence that        low volumes of specialized services as frequently occurs        in rural hospitals may result in poorer outcomes                   The main objectives of our study were therefore to         determine the quality of care provided for a specific        lowvolume patient population and  improve the quality        of care if deficiencies were found        This report provides a description of the baseline data        collected for the year study including differences found        in both institutional and patient variables between rural        referral hospitals and rural hospitals with more limited        resources The data reported here form a snapshot of rural        ICUs the patients institutional characteristics and        practice patterns These baseline data constitute a        necessary starting point for evaluating and improving the        care given in these settings        On the basis of practice variations found during the        pilot study the study design included an educational        intervention that would be implemented to assist the rural        ICU staff in their efforts to provide quality care The        intervention followed medical record audits and included        facetoface provider feedback written recommendations        reference articles seminars and telephone consultations        Specific data describing the impact of patient        characteristics and process performance on mortality rates        have recently been published   Data describing the        specific effects of the outreach educational program on        patient care processes and outcomes in the treatment group        versus control group have also been published                      Methods        Funded by a grant from the Agency for Health Care Policy        and Research AHCPR a multidisciplinary study team from a        major Midwest academic medical center conducted a        systematic evaluation of care provided to mechanically        ventilated patients in rural ICUs The study team consisted        of a pulmonologist research nurse ICU nurse respiratory        therapist dietician and pharmacist all with critical care        experience        Seventyeight hospitals met eligibility criteria        shortstay hospitals located in a Health Care Financing        Administration HCFAdesignated rural county with a        critical care unit Twenty of the  eligible rural Iowa        hospitals were randomly selected and contacted All        hospitals contacted agreed to participate in the study and        share patient and cost information Enrollment was limited        to  hospitals because of the extensive burden of data        collection and multiple visits required to each        participating facility during the year study The        statistical power of the sample size was approved by the        AHCPR        On the basis of HCFA definitions two major categories        of rural hospitals were identified A hospital qualified as        a rural referral hospital RRH if it was in a rural area        and met specific criteria concerning bed size referral        patterns or case mix intensity Seven of the         participating hospitals qualified as RRH and represented        all the rural referral facilities in the state The        remaining  facilities enrolled were termed rural        hospitals RH which had more limited bed capacities and        resources        Hospital demographic characteristics were supplied by        each participating hospital These included ICU size        average daily census equipment availability ICU staff        physician mix and the availability of specialists and        support personnel including respiratory pharmacy and        dietary professionals        The data collection tool was based on objective        indicators established by the Task Force on Guidelines        Society of Critical Care Medicine   Using these        indicators as a guide the university team of ICU        specialists developed more specific standards based on        current practice Table  Standards were made more        specific by establishing strict criteria defining the dose        frequency and time frame within which initiation of        treatment was expected for example task force guidelines        recommended measures such as nutritional support stress        ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis The        team clarified these measures and included additional        criteria Team standards required that a complete        nutritional assessment including the patients protein and        calorie requirements be documented within  h of admission        to the ICU Stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis        prophylaxis was required to be initiated by day  in the        ICU and minimum therapeutic levels of treatment were        established The tool reflects basic processes of ICU care        that should be delivered regardless of available        technological resources The tool allowed evaluation of        processes of care in seven major categories laboratory        assessments nursing care stomach ulcer protection        thrombosis protection dietary management ventilator        management and ventilator weaning        Patient records were selected for team review by        International Classification of Diseases ICD procedure        codes that reflected the presence of mechanical ventilation         ventilated for longer than  h  ventilated        for less than  h  period of ventilation        unspecified The patients most desired for this assessment        were those ventilated for longer than  h This longer        ventilation period allowed sufficient time to evaluate        overall patient care management techniques and practice        patterns and assured a more homogeneous group of patients        between facilities and across time In rural hospitals with        under  beds few patients met the criteria of        ventilation for longer than  h Consequently in these        facilities the medical records of all patients with        ventilation codes were reviewed        Three categories of patients that would be likely to        provide limited evidence of ventilator management        techniques were excluded from the study  patients on a        home ventilator admitted for pulmonary exacerbation or        respite care  postoperative patients requiring fewer        than h of ventilation while anesthetic agents were        reversed and  patients shown to be brain dead shortly        after admission but ventilated while treatment and organ        donation discussions could be conducted with the family        For patients requiring readmission to the ICU for        ventilator support within the same hospital stay only the        first ventilated period was reviewed        Data were collected from medical records of  patients        requiring mechanical ventilation while treated in  rural        Iowa ICUs between  and  One hundred and eleven        patients were managed at RRHs whereas  were managed at        RHs Patient variables included age sex primary and        secondary ICD diagnoses severity of illness as measured        by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE        II medical conditions resulting in difficult or        complicated ventilation admission source home emergency        room nursing home hospital ward or acute care facility

and tertiary facility For those patients        transferred to the tertiary setting the discharge        disposition was also evaluated A list of  medical        conditions resulting in difficult or complicated        ventilation was developed through consensus of a team of        critical care specialists This variable was monitored        because the decision to select appropriate patients for        tertiary transfer was considered a process of care The        conditions and related definitions are as follows         Adult respiratory distress syndrome ARDS required        diffuse bilateral infiltrates PO          divided by FiO            both required and if        pulmonary artery catheter was in use a wedge pressure                  Status asthmaticus with hypercapnea despite

syndrome with disseminated intravascular        coagulopathy DIC or coagulopathy required sepsis as        defined in Appendix A in nosocomial events and        DICcoagulopathy defined as a drop in platelet count by         from baseline and an increase in prothrombin time PT or        presence of fibrin degradation products         Ventilation with peak pressures   and positive        endexpiratory pressure PEEP  was defined by these        parameters         Complex chest trauma involved documentation of flail        chest or multiple rib fractures and cardiac or pulmonary        contusions or extensive subcutaneous emphysemaor        hemothorax         Failure to wean required diagnosis by the contact        physician         Complex overdose was defined as overdose requiring        treatment by dialysis        Outcome variables included length of stay ventilation        days nosocomial events discharge disposition and        survival Patients with acute respiratory failure are at        risk for a number of nosocomial events Eighteen of these        events were described by Pingleton   in her work on        complications occurring in patients with acute respiratory        failure and were incorporated into the data collection        tool A nosocomial event was defined as an event that        occurred in the ICU that was not present or incubating at        the time of admission Definitions for each nosocomial        event were developed from several sources and established        by the review team Definitions for infectious events were        based on the Center for Disease Control CDC criteria        Definitions for mechanical events were based on Pingletons        publication supporting references criteria utilized by        the risk management division at our institution or criteria        developed through consensus of the critical care team        Events and associated definitions are provided in Appendix        A        The

  admitted from the emergency room   from general          wards and   from either an intermediate or skilled          nursing facility or other hospital Patients admitted to          the ICU from a

managed at the  participating rural          hospitals had a  higher mortality rate than patients          without these conditions            P  Mortality rates within          each group are shown in Table  Of the  HRC patients          not transferred   were designated DNR either          before or at the time they met criteria for the HRC          which made tertiary transfer less appropriate          Patients with acute respiratory failure are at risk          for a host of nosocomial events   The events and          associated definitions are provided in Appendix A The          frequency of those observed are listed in Table  One          hundred and fortytwo patients  developed one or          more such events during their ICU stay Patients who          developed nosocomial events had significantly longer mean          ventilator and ICU days The mean length of ICU stay was           days with  ventilated days for patients with          nosocomial events compared with  ICU days and           ventilator days in the group with no events            P   Patients in both          groups had similar age and admission APACHE II          scores                          Comparison of RRHs with RHs          The study found several differences between RRH and RH          institutions Although the number of physicians          participating in the care of these severely ill patients          was similar per number of ICU beds for RRH and RH          hospitals the make up of the physician team was very          different With the exception of one RH pulmonary          specialists were found exclusively in the RRHs Family          physicians general internists and general surgeons          managed most patients in the RH ICUs A single RH          physician typically managed nine or fewer ventilator          patients per year and more commonly as few as one to          four ventilator patients per year Table shows the          highly significant differences found between RRH and RH          facilities Regardless of facility size very few rural          or rural referral facilities provided such technical          services as renal dialysis or pulmonary artery          catheterization          RRH patients had longer hospital stays ICU days and          ventilation days as well as a greater number of          nosocomial events Table  In all probability the          selection preference patients ventilated   h          contributes to these length of stay differences in          patient variables between RRH and RH facilities In the          RRH facilities  of the   patients evaluated          were ventilated for at least  h In contrast only           of the   patients evaluated in the RH facilities          were ventilated for at least  h despite this          difference the mortality rates and tertiary transfer          rates are similar in both groups                          Practice variations          Our data collection tool allowed indepth evaluation          of specific patient management techniques Several          practices varied from the guidelines recommended by the          task force describing minimum standards of care of          critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure on          mechanical ventilation   These variations provided          an opportunity for recommendations by the research team          Four examples follow First physicians selected an          initial ventilator mode that may not have provided          adequate support during the period of critical illness          Second physicians selected minute ventilation too low to          allow for adequate rest of the respiratory muscles          Third mismatches between the set respiratory rate and          the patients respiratory rate were not recognized          potentially prolonging the need for ventilatory support          secondary to fatigue of the respiratory muscles Fourth          the study found delayed responses to abnormal blood gas          results placing the patient at risk for developing          arrhythmias or other undesirable physiologic events          Treatment variations were found in both the rural and          rural referral setting Specific data on baseline          compliance within each process of care category have been          previously discussed by Hendryx           et al                              Discussion        Development of specialized areas of care for the        critically ill has occurred in most hospitals in the USA            leading to the growth in number and utilization        of ICUs Despite this growth there is little information        available related to the demographics and quality of rural        ICUs   Without specific data on outcomes of rural ICU        patient care it is difficult to evaluate quality of care        issues This lack of data is of particular interest when        committees have tried to rationalize and justify        regionalization of critical care in rural areas                  In the rural centers the emergency room ER was the        source of admission for  of the ICU patients Escarce        and Kelley   have suggested that patients admitted to        the ICU from the ER often have improved survival rates when        compared with patients being admitted to the ICU from other        areas We might anticipate therefore that the high        percentage of admissions from ERs into rural ICUs could        have a favorable impact on survival rates in those ICUs        Undoubtedly the rural ER has a critical role in providing        triage and stabilization of acutely ill patients        The mean ICU bed occupancy rate of  found in all        rural hospitals indicates that there was generally an ICU        bed available to admit a critically ill patient ICU bed        availability might be an advantage to the rural hospitals        by allowing prompt implementation and management of        lifesustaining interventions        Higher mortality rates were found for rural patients        with conditions which required complicated ventilation        Mortality rates in rural patients with conditions such as        ARDS MODS and sepsis with DIC were   and         respectively These rates are higher than the overall rural        mortality rate of  This suggests there are certain        highrisk patients who may benefit from transfer to a        tertiary care center with greater resources and technology        The significantly higher mortality rates for persons with        highrisk conditions suggests that these conditions might        serve as primary indicators for evaluating the        appropriateness of transferring patients to tertiary care        centers        There are many similarities in demographics and patient        characteristics between the small RHs and the RRHs        including mean age sex APACHE II score mortality and the        rate of transfer The most striking differences occur in        the variation for lengths of stay in total hospital days        ICU days and ventilator days This longer length of stay        for RRHs cannot be explained by patient record selection        alone In looking for patients ventilated for significant        time periods few were found in the small rural centers        This may indicate that patients with complex medical        illnesses living in counties supported by a small RH may        seek acute care and admission from physicians providing        services in association with referral centers This        selection process may contribute to the favorable mortality        rates for these smaller units The longer length of stay in        the RRHs is likely to have contributed to the higher        nosocomial event rate        Certain limitations of this study need to be        acknowledged First since the study enrollment was limited        to just  hospitals it is not possible to know how        representative these were when compared with RHs in other        geographic areas Second our exclusion criteria eliminated        patients requiring only brief periods of ventilation Had        rapidly extubated patients with a good prognosis been        included survival rates might have been higher Also        exclusion of patients who were ventilated briefly before        transfer to another facility may have affected survival        rates Despite these limitations this study for the first        time to our knowledge provides information on rural        hospital demographics and patient characteristics These        baseline data constitute the starting point for evaluating        the quality issues associated with low patient volume        Similar data collection from other rural hospitals in        geographically distinct areas may provide the data set        required to reevaluate the opportunities for        regionalization of critical care in rural areas The        concept of regionalization for specific diagnoses has been        supported by other studies    On the basis of the        higher mortality rates seen in rural patients with medical        conditions resulting in difficult or complicated        ventilation our data seem to support the suggestion by        Moscovice and Rosenblatt   that success in rural        hospitals is best actualized through compartmentalization        or the ability to provide only that care which can be        performed safely efficiently and effectively Early triage        and appropriate identification of those highrisk patients        who might benefit from transfer to a facility with        specialized technology and greater resources may further        reduce the mortality currently seen in patients admitted to        rural ICUs                    Appendix A Nosocomial events                  A Pulmonary complications                     Pulmonary emboli  clinical          diagnosis supported by
