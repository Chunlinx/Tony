                                 Z            For honestys sake anyearly criticism of Thomas Pynchons new novel Mason  Dixon  oughtto be labeled provisional or tentative The text of the book was releasedtwo weeks ago as of this writing And because it will take any normal humanbeing at least that long to read the galleys  pages let alone reflectupon their contents its a fair bet that anyone who reviews the novel has merely skimmed it meaning his impressions are superficial  actually readevery page but only by foregoing food and rest meaning his impressions arewarped by stress or  not read the book at all meaning his impressions arejust as worthy as those of the thousands of other literate folk who will buyPynchons novel on reputation read the jacket copy put it down and pronounceit either another masterpiece or a disappointing falling off though somewhatbetter than Vineland  his previous book Indeed I have already heardthe latter view bandied about at New York cocktail parties            Here ismy own preliminary view based on  pages read  skimmed and foregone Maybe just maybe minimalist fiction wasnt such a bad thing afterall            As I said it should take any normal human being at leasttwo weeks to get through Mason  Dixon but that begs the questionof whether Pynchons writings are intended for normal human beings I dontthink they are They partake of what the Elizabethans called euphuismthepursuit of linguistic complexity for its own sake As such theyre intendedfor literary monastics for the tenured priesthood of paid interpreters thatsprang up in colleges after World War II with the help of massive publicfunding from schemes such as the GI Bill and Pell grants This professionalaudience for difficult texts created the demand that Pynchon first filledwith V and Gravitys Rainbow  the semiotic monoliths whose mixof scientific imagery Cold War absurdity and Joycean allusion provided a kindof fullemployment program for a generation of rising postdocs In academiaPynchon found his patrons In Pynchon academia found its paychecks            Theproblem is that Pynchon is performing for a court that no longer exists Theboom in subsidized deconstruction is over Whats Mason  Dixon               about  Ill get to that Think about whats happened to the novel sincethe fat fecund days of Gravitys Rainbow  Its grown thin and literaland modest so much so that the typical first novel isnt called a first novelanymore its called a memoir just one step from journalism and itsimmunized from conventional criticism by its traumatized sincerity Even thebright young men who imitate Pynchon by fortifying their fashionably fracturedstories with math and science myth and metafiction cant really hold a candleto the master They write Italian compared with Pynchons Latinperhapsbecause they no longer have a church behind them merely chains of secularsuperstores            Which brings me to the new novel itselfWritten in  th century English magical is spelled magickalfor example and the predominant punctuation marks are the dash and theapostrophe it tells the picaresque tale of two astronomers best known forsurveying the MasonDixon line which separates Pennsylvania from Maryland andthe American cultural North from the cultural South We meet the pair astheyre setting off from England for southern Africa where they hope toobserve the transit of Venus for purposes of mapping the Earths longitudeYoull learn a lot about shipping in this novel and the main thing youlllearn is how important it was to find a reliable way of measuring longitudeNational fortunes depended on the feat making it the Age of Reasonsequivalent to finding the Holy Grail            As Masonand Dixon travel they have adventures Rollicking bawdy

and doughnuts Thecomedy of anachronism is Pynchons favorite kind and here as elsewhere in hiswork it isnt very funny Pynchon the verbal technician is genius but Pynchonthe humorist is lame indeed and reminds one of a brainy college sophomore whostudies joke books to make himself amusing Worse hes very big on languagehumor on purposely mismatching tone and topic and veering abruptly

frontier diehard Pynchon fanswill lick their chops Playful ingenious revisions of orthodox history basedon complex covert affiliations and strange secret weapons are the masterstrademark At bottom Pynchon writes mystery novelssymphonic polymathicdetective stories that resolve themselves not in simple sums but in hip newintellectual logarithms And he pays his readers the ultimate compliment ofwriting as though he knows theyre capable of getting his erudite cosmicjokes            Thats the rub and thatswhy Im not a fan Pynchon is a writer you have to get and I find noactivity less inspiring than Rubiks Cubeing through a cluestrewn supertextin search of a paradoxical Eureka The low part of the higher mind thatPynchon so pyrotechnically appeals to the same part that responds to Escherdrawings PDQ Bach and perspectiveswitching holograms is not a part ofmyself Im in touch with nor do I particularly long to be I admirePynchon Im wowed by him at times but the truth is Im happy
