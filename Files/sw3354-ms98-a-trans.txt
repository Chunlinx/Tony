        okay well what do you do on your yard     well ah typical lawn stuff Saint Augustine ah with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas uh   umhum uhhuh   and really all i do to it is uh in fact i didnt even fertilize it this year i just mowed it and i i mow it uh you know with a mulch mower so the the particles fall down yeah   comes back in the yard so you dont have anyone do your yard you do it yourself yeah we do too   i do it myself  have a lot of people trying to do it for me but  hey i need the exercise so what the heck   isnt that the truth all flyers on every door everyday thats right well we um we my husband does the same thing he does the yard and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower but i keep putting off learning   hey youve got the right idea   thats right but i had recently gone out and planted mums so we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloways   umhum   and put out yellow and bronze and they just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town and she says well those are gonna die just the first frost       she said you should have done pansies and i went well now you tell me  so that first night that on Halloween we went out and covered them with a sheet and they did okay that first night but the second night we were at the movies and didnt do it so i guess ive lost them   yeah   i havent gone out to check yet   yeah i wouldnt dont blame you i wouldnt wanna look at them   oh listen but um the worst problem weve had here with this grass was about the third year we were here i guess it was about four years ago and we did not know in August to put down the uh whatever it is for grub worms   uhhuh   and the next spring i guess in that March every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed wed have big whole patches come up have you ever seen it   yeah yeah   what grub worms do and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off everything it took a lot of money and a lot of time so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazanon   yeah you you you think thats what it was uh mulch mulch mulch okay well   oh yeah we found them yeah we found them we dug under there about an inch and you could see them theyre real fat old white things and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring   yeah yeah those kind of brown uh June what we call June bugs and some people call them May beetles and yeah yeah   yeah but in but in the whole umhum yeah June bugs is what id heard them called so anyhow occasionally i find them in the flower beds they said that every yard has some but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem   oh yeah   so thats the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before   yeah well i had some of that problem but mine was freeze it   oh yeah that too you know two years ago or last Christmas is that what youre talking about  yeah umhum   yeah yeah and im still replacing im still replacing that in the back especially under the trees um you know kind of slow and and as you say very expensive   umhum yeah   i caught Wolfe with ah ah one ah one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents and i i bought about twenty of them and   oh yeah i bet you did too and put those down in the spring   uh well i put that you know that was laid that was like   or the fall yeah because i started to say you can theres different times they say its okay to do it   yeah that was like September i think and i had to water it you know gosh   yeah yeah keep it damp well my out here you know we dont have as many trees in Plano at least the area where were over by Collin Creek Mall and but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died and all those variegated uh things died so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly and they just live yeah you can you can stand those   yeah theyre pretty tough uh pittosporum is kind of borderline here and usually itll do pretty well but uh you know every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals and it it zaps it   umhum yeah well its kind of like one of these its   oh wax leaf wax leaf ligustrum is the same way   same way umhum that they warned me of that one finally and i said you know you need to either read Neil Sperrys book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because a lot of places that would are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there and we didnt know the difference and every year we learn one more thing we didnt know before like about these mums its like okay next year  ill do pansies   yeah your list is growing   yes and my backyard we had it really nice and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy and so it was about i guess hes three now so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my   oh yeah oh gee   bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio so its like our backyard is just kind of like as long as he wont damage it fine and if hell if theres anything hell hurt we just dont put it out there anymore   um yeah kind of cuts your possibilities for flower beds down   umhum very much very much   i had a i had a small vegetable garden that uh it did pretty well its its like on the side the apron of the of the parkway out behind the garage and uh theres our our garages come in from the back you know from the alley   you did huh uhhuh so do ours yeah   and uh its its that little piece of land over there well i had uh tomatoes and and uh uh peppers   what did you grow   and i had had okra and cucumbers by the fence i had cucumbers   that is amazing   which which didnt do real well uh they kind of came out looking like gourds   yeah well put them in a salad though you say well i made it though at least its mine      yeah but i had squash i had zucchini and and yellow crook neck squash
