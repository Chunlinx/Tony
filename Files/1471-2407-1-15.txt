                    Background        Human breast tumorigenesis is a multistage process        encompassing complex cellular transformation from normalcy        to malignancy     It has been proposed that multiple        different cellular events dictate the biochemical changes        that allow normal cells to become highly malignant These        key events require alterations in the expression of many        genes translation of RNA transcripts and cellular        activation by growth factors hormones and proteins in the        evolving tumor cell population                Steroid hormones play a vital role in the growth of        normal mammary gland tissue as well as the development        and progression of breast tumors Human estrogen receptor        alpha hER is detected in  of all breast tumors            and is utilized as a prognostic marker to identify        patients who may have a favorable response to hormonal or        endocrine manipulations Thus hER provides a useful        prognostic index in patients with metastatic disease and is        associated with diseasefree survival               However  of all patients with hER positive ER        tumors do not respond to hormonal interventions suggesting        cellular and molecular alterations              This lack of response may be attributed at least in        part to the presence of nonfunctional hER as determined        by the inability of hER to bind hormone to recognize and        bind to specific DNAresponsive elements andor its        inability to recruit other transcriptional activation        factors       It may also be attributed to tumor        heterogeneity in which some tumor cells may continue to        express functional hER while other cells may express        either dysfunctional hER or do not express hER at all        This may permit the tumor to become autonomous with respect        to hormone sensitivity allowing tumor progression        Currently human breast tumor hER content is determined by        ligandbinding assays or immunohistochemistry While these        techniques measure either hER content or its cellular        distribution they do not provide the means for assessing        hER functionality        In our search for new tumor markers we identified and        characterized a novel  kDa nuclear protein termed nmt            The amino acid sequence of nmt was highly        homologous but not identical to that reported for the        nuclear protein p nrbidentified in HeLa cells     A        more recent report by Peters et al    noted        differences in the sequence of the reported HeLa cell p        nrb    and placental p nrb When we compared the        sequences of nmt and placental p nrbU Muller        Personal Communication we determined that the sequences        were identical The differences in the sequence for nmt        placental p nrband HeLa p nrbare most likely due to        HeLa p nrbsequencing error Chromosomal location and        sequence identity data confirm that p nrbhas the same        sequence as nmt and are the same gene We refer to this        protein as nmtp nrb        Our studies on nmt and those of p nrbhave        characterized this protein as an RNA binding protein with        the ability to associate with Topoisomerase I and the        polypyrimidine tractbinding protein associated splicing        factor PSF         Further we observed the        association of nmtp nrbwith several splicing factors        known to be essential for spliceosome formation suggesting        a role for nmtp nrbin premRNA splicing unpublished        results        Our previous studies investigated the protein expression        of nmtp nrbin human breast tumors using a monoclonal        antibody with an epitope localized to the carboxyl terminal        domain of this protein These studies demonstrated a        statistically significant association between nmtp        nrbprotein expression tumor hormonal phenotype and mean        tumor size     Specifically in tumors large in size        or those tumors which were determined to be ER the        expression of nmtp nrbprotein was absent or greatly        reduced     These results suggested that loss of        nmtp nrbprotein expression may be related to hormone        insensitivity tumor differentiation state unregulated        tumor growth and metastases        The absence or reduced expression of nmtp nrbmay be        attributed to the regulation of mRNA expression protein        processing of a specific functional domain or the presence        of a heterogeneous population of nmtp nrbisoforms        which may not be immunodetected by monoclonal antibody        NMT In this study we compared mRNA levels in ER and        ER human breast tumors using Northern blot analysis and        ribonuclease protection assay to assess if nmtp nrbis        regulated at the transcription level We further developed        nmtp nrbspecific sitedirected polyclonal antibodies        to the amino terminal region and to a midregion to assess        the potential presence of multiple nmtp nrbisoforms or        processed nmtp

was determined by          ligand binding analyses as described previously                  Briefly cytosols were incubated with  nM           H E            in the absence total binding or

         We have previously used sequence specific peptides to          generate sitedirected monoclonal and polyclonal          antibodies          Two peptides NMT          and NMT were synthesized purified by gel filtration          and analyzed by HPLC Analyses of the amino acid          composition correlated well with the primary sequence          The sequences of these peptides is given in

probe used for nmtp nrbanalysis was a  bp          SacIBglII fragment representing the unique carboxyl          terminus of nmtp nrb     This probe was          utilized to prevent crosshybridization

tumors          We have previously shown that nmtp nrbprotein was          expressed in most ERPR human breast tumors but was          undetectable in ERPR human breast tumors              Since loss of hER expression is associated with poor          prognosis and continued expression of hER is associated          with diseasefree survival and correlates well with tumor          differentiation state we wanted to investigate the          regulation of nmtp nrbexpression To test the          possibility that nmtp nrbmay be transcriptionally          downregulated in ER tumors we analyzed mRNA levels from          a series of human breast tumors utilizing Northern blot          analyses and ribonuclease protection assays          Figure shows Northern blot analysis of nmtp          nrbmRNA expression in  human breast tumors MCF cells          Lane M used as a control express an abundant  kb          mRNA transcript for nmtp nrb nmtp          nrbtranscripts were detected at varying levels in both          ER and ER tumors mRNA transcript was expressed at high          levels lanes      and  moderate levels          lanes   and  or low levels lanes   and  The          tumor sample in lane  was degraded and was not analyzed          further These different nmtp nrbmRNA levels were          not due to differential RNA loading as GAPDH levels were          similar in all tumor samples These results suggest that          nmtp nrbmRNA transcripts are expressed at various          levels It also suggested that nmtp nrbprotein          expression in some breast tumors does not correlate with          nmtp nrbmRNA expression Specifically the decreased          nmtp nrbprotein expression observed in ER human          breast tumors may not be attributed to transcriptional          regulation of nmtp nrbmRNA since mRNA expression in          ER tumors is not universally decreased          To confirm these observations ribonuclease protection          assay was utilized to analyze a set of different human          breast tumors As shown in Figure  all human tumor          samples expressed nmtp nrbmRNA transcript nmtp          nrbmRNA was not detected in calf uterine tissue This was          expected since the nmtp nrbprobe utilized for          detection is of human origin and calf uterus tissue          expresses a different transcript for nmtp nrb This          prevents high fidelity hybridization between the probe          and the mRNA allowing complete mRNA probe digestion          Based on the data presented in Figures and  it appears          that nmtp nrbmRNA is expressed independent of tumor          hormonal status suggesting that nmtp nrbmRNA is not          regulated by hER These results together with those          reported previously     further suggest that          decreased expression of nmtp nrbprotein in ER human          breast tumors is likely a posttranscriptional event                          Immunochemical detection of multiple nmtp          nrbprotein isoforms in human breast tumors          Since there was no apparent nmtp nrbmRNA          regulation in ER or ER human breast tumors it was          possible that monoclonal antibody NMT may not detect          the presence of potential multiple isoforms of nmtp          nrbprotein especially in ER tumors This necessitated          the development of domain specific antibodies To this          end two peptides were synthesized and purified based on          selected sequences in the subdomains of human nmtp          nrbFigure A These selected peptides were referred to          as NMT and NMT and represent sequences  and           of human nmtp nrb respectively Figure A          Polyclonal antibodies were developed against these          peptides polyclonal antibody NMT recognized a sequence          in the amino terminal region of nmtp nrband          polyclonal antibody NMT recognized a sequence in a          midregion of nmtp nrbFigure B          Figure shows the binding of polyclonal antibodies          NMT and NMT to a protein with an estimated molecular          weight of  kDa lanes  and  respectively Preimmune          sera detected no specific protein in the  kDa range          lanes  and  Specificity of the polyclonal antibodies          was assessed by preincubation with the appropriate          immunogenic free peptides As shown in Figure lanes           and  the antigenic peptides competed effectively for          the binding of the antibodies to the protein indicating          that these antibodies are specific Complete displacement          was not seen in Lane  which was due to high titer of the          antibody Incubation of NMT antibody with a higher          concentration of free immunogenic NMT peptide resulted          in complete displacement results not shown These          results indicate that the antipeptide polyclonal          antibodies NMT and NMT detect this  kDa protein          with high specificity and high affinity          Since nmtp nrbbelongs to a family of RNA binding          proteins with conserved domains it was possible that the          polyclonal antibodies NMT and NMT were detecting a          protein with a similar molecular weight To investigate          this possibility we carried out immunoprecipitation          assays of MCF nuclear extract with a series of          antibodies and immunoblotted with the same series of          antibodies          Figure shows MCF nuclear extract immunoprecipitated          with monoclonal antibody NMT polyclonal antibody          NMT polyclonal antibody NMT or monoclonal antibody          EVG F The immunoprecipitate samples were then separated          by SDSPAGE and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody          NMT top panel polyclonal antibody NMT middle          panel or polyclonal antibody NMT bottom panel The          results show that this  kDa protein is detected          regardless of which antibody is used for          immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting Since monoclonal          antibody NMT is specific for nmtp nrbprotein              the results suggest that polyclonal antibodies NMT          and NMT are specific to nmtp nrband do not detect          related RNA binding proteins nmtp nrbprotein was          not detected in the antihER monoclonal antibody EVG F          immunoprecipitation sample negative control Monoclonal          antibody NMT and polyclonal antibodies NMT and NMT          also detect bacterially expressed partially purified          nmtp nrbprotein results not shown These results          indicate that monoclonal antibody NMT carboxyl          terminal and the polyclonal antibodies NMT amino          terminal and NMT midregion detect nmtp          nrbprotein with high affinity and high specificity          Figure shows Western blot analysis of nuclear          extracts from  human breast tumor immunoblotted with          polyclonal antibodies NMT top panel NMT middle          panel and monoclonal antibody NMT bottom panel No          antibodies detected nmtp nrbprotein in ER human          breast tumors lanes  confirming previous          observations     Monoclonal antibody NMT and          polyclonal antibody NMT detect nmtp nrbprotein in          all ER tumor samples lanes  albeit at varying          levels Interestingly however polyclonal antibody NMT           detected nmtp nrbin only  out of  ER tumors          These results have been reproduced in the nuclear          extracts of approximately forty human breast tumors          suggesting that there is an alteration or modification in          the amino terminal domain of nmtp nrbthat prevents          polyclonal antibody NMT from binding to nmtp          nrbprotein The observations made here further suggest          the presence of nmtp nrbvariants in a subset of ER          human breast tumors          Detection of nmtp nrbby Western blot analyses          requires tumor pulverization homogenization          fractionation and the preparation of cellular extracts          These manipulations may result in biochemical alterations          of nmtp nrbduring processing To insure that this          observation was not the result of experimental          manipulation and indeed the nmtp nrbvariants          detected with polyclonal antibody NMT and monoclonal          antibody NMT but not polyclonal antibody NMT were          also expressed in intact cells we utilized          immunohistochemical analyses in human breast tumor tissue          sections Further immunohistochemistry permits the          assessment of nmtp nrbsubcellular localization and          distribution within human breast tumors          Figure shows immunohistochemical analyses of a human          breast tumor using hER hPR and nmtp nrbspecific          antibodies Tissue sections stained positively with          monoclonal antibodies EVG F Panel

did not stain positive for nmtp          nrbwhen polyclonal antibody NMT was utilized Panel C          Similar results have been observed in sixteen different          human breast tumor tissue sections The          immunohistochemistry data confirm the results obtained by          Western blot analyses suggesting that nmtp          nrbprotein is expressed in various isoforms in a subset          of ER human breast tumors The nature of the alteration          or modification in the aminoterminal region of nmtp          nrb which prevents the detection of nmtp nrbby          polyclonal antibody NMT by Western blot and          immunohistochemical analyses remains to be          determined                            Discussion        We have previously investigated nmtp nrbprotein        expression in human breast tumors and observed a        statistically significant association between decreased        nmtp nrbexpression loss of hER and hPR and increased        tumor size     It is possible that decreased nmtp        nrbexpression represents poor tumor differentiation        increased tumor growth and metastases since reduced or        absent hER expression and function correlates with poor        tumor differentiation     and tumor size is a strong        indicator of tumor progression     Here we        investigated nmtp nrbmRNA expression using Northern        blot analyses and ribonuclease protection assays to        determine if the reduction of nmtp nrbprotein        expression was the result of transcriptional regulation        mRNA transcripts for nmtp nrbshowed similar expression        in human breast tumors and were not related to hER        expression These results suggest that the regulation of        nmtp nrbprotein expression observed in human breast        tumors is likely a posttranscriptional event        Results from Western blot analyses with polyclonal        antibodies NMT and NMT showed that nmtp        nrbexpression was absent or greatly reduced in most of        ER tumors This confirmed the previous observations        obtained with monoclonal antibody NMT     Data also        showed that a subset of ER tumors expressed nmtp        nrbprotein detectable with polyclonal antibody NMT and        monoclonal antibody NMT but not polyclonal antibody        NMT These results suggested the presence of nmtp        nrbvariants in a subset of ER human breast tumors The        inability of polyclonal antibody NMT to detect nmtp        nrbin some ER tumors may be attributed to proteolysis        during nuclear extraction and analyses or biochemical        modification of functionally distinct isoform While the        altered molecular weight of the protein sample shown in        Figure  lane  may be attributed to proteolysis most of        the protein samples in Figure displayed a similar        estimated molecular weight of  kDa Thus the lack of        nmtpnrb protein detection in this study is most likely        not due to proteolysis We also wanted to determine if        nmtp nrbvariants detected with polyclonal antibody        NMT and monoclonal antibody NMT but not polyclonal        antibody NMT using nuclear extracts and Western blot        analyses were also detectable in intact cells To test this        premise we utilized immunohistochemistry to detect        nmtp nrbprotein in human breast tumor tissue sections        The data from immunohistochemistry confirmed the results        obtained by Western blot analyses which suggested that        nmtp nrbprotein was expressed in various isoforms in a        subset of ER human breast tumors These potential isoforms        may have altered biological function due to the loss of        domain specific interactions We have attempted to        ascertain the presence and nature of these isoforms by        utilizing mixing experiments however these experiments        have proved inconclusive The expression and role of this        isoform in human breast cancer remains to be        determined        A plausible explanation for the lack of nmtp        nrbprotein detection with polyclonal antibody NMT is a        point mutation in the epitope for polyclonal antibody        NMT a posttranslational modification such as        phosphorylation in or near this epitope or an alternative        splice variant affecting this epitope Another possibility        is the methylation of arginine residues although this        would not alter the overall charge of the protein it could        sterically hinder the proteinantibody interaction The        methylation of arginine residues has been shown to take        place in other premRNA splicing proteins though the role        of this modification is unknown     One approach to        determine the presence of a point mutation or a splice        variant is to perform PCR coupled with sequencing        techniques Another approach to resolve this issue is to        analyze this protein isoform by Mass Spectroscopy These        studies are currently under investigation        In this report we show that nmtp nrbprotein is        expressed in a variant isoform in a subset of ER tumors        These data along with our previous observations suggest        that the association of nmtp nrband hER expression        represents three separate human breast tumor phenotypes        The first phenotype represents tumors that express wild        type nmtp nrband are ER These tumors may be        classified as low grade or early stage tumors and respond        well to endocrine manipulations The second phenotype is        identified as ER using Western blot or immunohistochemical        analyses and would express the amino terminal        alteredmodified nmtp nrbisoform This may represent        midgrade and midstage tumors which are very        heterogeneous It would be of interest to determine if        these tumors express nonfunctional hER and as a result        do not respond to hormonal therapy Finally the third        phenotype represents tumors that do not express hER and        nmtp nrb These tumors would most likely be highly        proliferative classified as high grade and late stage        hormone insensitive and potentially metastatic While the        focus of this study has been the biochemical relationship        between nmtp nrband tumor hormonal status a more        expansive study correlating nmtp nrbprotein expression        with various breast tumor clinicopathological        characteristics may provide additional key information        These studies are under investigation        Our data suggests that nmtp nrbmay be critical to        cell growth and function such that decreased nmtp        nrbexpression in ER human breast tumors or the expression        of nmtp nrbvariants in ER tumors may indicate loss of        normal growth nmtp nrbhas been shown in several        studies to bind RNA and interact with PSF and Topoisomerase        I           Those results along with our        observations that nmtp nrbassociates with several        splicing factors essential for spliceosome formation        unpublished and relates to tumor hormonal status           suggest that nmtp nrbmay be involved in premRNA        processing Thus loss of nmtp nrbprotein or the        expression of nmtp nrbprotein variants in tumor cells        may result in the loss of hER expression the expression        of nonfunctional hER or the altered expression other        critical cell growth factors due to lack of proper premRNA        splicing        Specifically the role of nmtp nrbas a splicing        factor may affect hER structure and function The        progression of breast cancer may be associated with changes        in RNA processing and the production of aberrantly spliced        mRNAs which may result in nonfunctional gene products or        the loss of specific gene expression It has been proposed        that loss of hER expression in breast tumors is the result        of aberrant RNA processing        These        aberrantly spliced mRNAs if translated could lead to        truncated receptors with hormone binding but not DNA        binding function     Further there is evidence for        the role of RNA processing in oncogenesis      Many        studies including those on human hnRNP AB and the CD        gene suggest that high fidelity premRNA splicing is        critical to normal cellular function and may play a key        role in oncogenesis and breast cancer progression             The strong association between nmtp nrband hER        expression indicates that nmtp nrbmay be an important        marker for breast cancer progression The decreased or        altered expression of nmtp nrbmay be related to tumor        differentiation unregulated tumor cell growth and        metastases and may explain tumor heterogeneity especially        with respect to hormonal interventions in the course of        treatment Although an RNA splicing protein hnRNP AB        has been used as a tumor marker in lung cancer progression            this is the first time that a protein involved in        premRNA splicing has been implicated in breast cancer        progression and may represent an important breast tumor        marker Further studies are necessary to determine a        functional link between this RNA binding protein and hER        in human breast cancer                    Competing interests        None declared
