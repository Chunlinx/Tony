                                 Death Rays from Outer Space            Heres an article that reads like an XFiles episode Invisiblepulsing rays Airplanes that fall from the sky Government coverups The pointTo solve the unsolved mystery of TWA Flight  The claim That the plane mayhave been accidentally downed by electromagnetic rays emanating from militaryaircraft and destroyers travelling nearby The author A Harvard professor of aesthetics The real mystery though is why the story was emblazoned lastApril on the cover of that newsletter for highminded literary Brahmins TheNew York Review of Books and why last week in the same publicationspages the head of the National Transportation Safety Board stepped forth todebate the author            The theory is so elegantly paranoid Culturebox longs to believe it It goeslike this  The skies are alive with powerful surges of electromagneticenergy radiating from the hightech war planes that crisscross the heavensrehearsing their maneuvers  The military having lost planes and helicoptersto these waveswhich wreak havoc with a plane or ships electrical systemhascreated shields to protect its vessels against them  Civilian planes havenot been similarly protected  The spark that ignited TWA s fuel tankcould have been caused by one of these misdirected power surges since therewere several military planes helicopters and even a naval destroyertravelling nearby at the time  The NTSB has negligently failed to considerthis possibility            What really charms Culturebox though is the storysintellectualasunderdog angle The author Elaine Scarry is a scholar ofliterature and moral philosophy She was writing a study of the social contractthat exists between the military and the civilian population in a democracywhen she came across on article on electromagnetic interference EMI anddecided to follow up  words and many long footnotes later here she isdemanding that the NTSB investigateand there they are paying lip service toher seemingly crankish request by saying that yes yes they have and thatfurther tests are being conducted            One wee problem with Scarrys scenario is that few of the experts she citesactually think its likely Physicist and electrical engineer DV Giripeerreviewed the piece for the NYROB and recommended publicationNonetheless he tells Culturebox It is not likely  It takes an extremelypowerful signal to come that far and result in this sequence of events Thesource has to be so powerful and the signal has to find some coupling path tothe fuel sensors and thats not easy because there are many obstacles inbetween            On the other hand as another of Scarrys experts Martin Shoomantheauthor of a NASA study on EMI and a specialist on risk assessmentputs itMost accidents are a sequence of rare circumstances If you asked people abouta lot of accidents if you said Could this happen Theyd say This isimplausible            At the very least Culturebox whose summer vacation begins tomorrow on aflight that follows the route of TWA  is alarmed at the prospect of being apassenger on an unshielded aircraft Shooman says American commercial airplanemanufacturers are aware of the problem but consider the cost of correcting itprohibitiveespecially if their European competitors arent required to followsuit Culturebox is not comforted It shouldnt take a moral philosopher topoint out that that attitude doesnt exactly conform to the social contractwhether between her and the military or between her and the militarycontracters who also build civilian aircraft that are supposed to get her toParis safely                           Puppeteering   As an exercise in spin analysis Culturebox putsthis question to you dear reader Who looks more like a buffoon in the wake ofJames Fallowss leaving US News  Mortimer Zuckerman who pretends hedidnt fire him or Harry Evans who doth protest too much that he did            Culturebox votes for Evans According to Cultureboxs sources inside USNews  Evans did not think it was time for a change as he told the NewYork Times  In fact ever since he went to work for Zuckerman Evans madenothing but gestures of support toward Fallows Zuckerman on the other handwas openly going around Washington offering Fallows job to other editors            So how did a spinmeister like Evans get stuck in the humiliating position ofjumping up and down to claim responsibility for something he didnt have theauthority or possibly even the inclination to do For one thing Fallows gaveEvans and Zuckerman no time to get their story straight Fallows and his bosswere negotiating the terms of his departurespecifically the severancepackageand when Zuckerman refused to give Fallows one Fallows announced thathed been fired before Zuckerman or Evans could            Culturebox discerns a tragic poetic justice in all this Evans was inFallowss shoes when he was being pushed out as head of Random House six monthsago which raises the question Why didnt he see Fallows move coming Theanswer says everything about what Evans has become Fallows is a writer whostrayed into the snakepit of mediaexecutivedom for a brief unhappy stint Hedoesnt need a cover story or another job as a highpowered media executive sohe has no incentive to lie about his departure Evans once a writer and thekind of editor whod stand up to Rupert Murdoch and get fired for his troubleis now a man for whom announcing to the world that you were fired isunthinkable             Judith Shulevitz
