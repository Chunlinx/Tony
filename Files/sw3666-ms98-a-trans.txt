he wont cut them is what he wont do because he said with the rocks that its too dangerous for him to take the   umhum yeah   the trimmer over the rocks and hes right thats true but he just says to keep spraying them so   uhhuh yeah well so   anyway Gene sprayed them once or twice for me so   yeah so you havent you havent pulled any weeds lately   that was free no no there are two out front i thought id grab one of these days but i havent bothered as i walk on by     yeah   i start to pull the weeds in the rocks out front and   uhhuh   all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds and there was dog dirt in it   oh oh goody   and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there and i left the whole thing and that was about a month ago   i thought you were going to say there i thought you gonna say there was a snake in the weeds   i would rather a snake   oh God oh   no i just left the whole thing the bag is still out there because i havent touched it i havent gone back over there it really made me mad   yeah oh God   so anyway but   but uh how are your your flowers your little things you planted did they die or what   oh yeah now they died   oh theyre all so
