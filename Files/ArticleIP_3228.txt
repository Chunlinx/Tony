                                 In the Company of Men            In  while writing areview of Sylvester Stallones grotesque rabblerouser Rocky IV  I wentback and watched the original Rocky to see ifto borrow the controllingmetaphor of Ingmar Bergmans The Serpents Egg through the thinmembranes you could clearly discern the already perfect reptile In otherwords was the mans egotism always this monstrous Maybe not In Rocky which is basically a comedy Stallone is treated as a lumbering sad sack Moststriking is the camera placement The director John Avildsen keeps Stallonesmall in the frame as dwarfed by his desolate environment as Chaplins LittleTramp After Sly became a superstar he seized creative control of his filmsand moved the camera way up close so that his heavylidded nobility and hismusculature loomed large In interviews he said that his father remarked onthe puniness of his Rocky physique a dig that clearly goaded Stalloneinto pumping himself up in all senses Stallone has certainly had hisblockbusters over the years but he has also turned himself into a Goliath ofcamp            In CopLand  Stallone plays Freddy Heflin the loser sheriff of Garrison NJjust across the George Washington Bridge from Manhattan I use the word loserso casually because the film virtually brands it on his forehead He isdiscovered in a bar playing a desultory game of pinball beside half a dozenempty beer bottles Running short of quarters the soft flabby Freddy staggersoutside unlocks a parking meter and spills the coins all over the sidewalkDriving home loaded he glances longingly across the Hudson at the big citywhere he once dreamed of being a cop and then swerving to avoid a deerplunges off the road into a tree totaling his car and putting a huge gash onthe bridge of his nose The hardened policemen who live in Garrisona NewYorkcop enclavetreat him like a pet Hes there to give speeding tickets Inhis shabby house he listens to the bluecollar wail of Bruce Springsteen Theman is Jersey through and through            Stallone whom a former associate of his once described tome as the most frightened man in Hollywood had to hold a press conference toannounce that he was going to gain weight for the part of a notsosuper heroin a small movie From his vantage I guess Miramax makes small moviesWhere normally Stallone would overproject his potency in Cop Land hetelegraphs his impotence It isnt just the paunch Its the bleary hangdogdemeanor the watery eyes the shambling gait the passiveness that borders onthe stereotypically feminine Hes like a white Stepin Fetchit And yet asobvious as this performance is its more deeply felt than anything Stallonehas done since Rocky and is close I suspect to how the actor reallysees himself Hes never more winning than when he projects loserdom                           CopLand shares its leading mans slowwittedness but also his likability Ittries hard Its formulaic but it sticks to a classic Western formula insteadof a cartoonish blockbuster one Think High Noon by way of Scorsesewith a touch of Peyton Place  I could also cite Carl Franklins OneFalse Move and Tony Richardsons The Border but the list ofinfluences would run as long as this review The writerdirector JamesMangold  Heavy  labors mightily to establish a sense of placehe neverstops setting the scene At the start the camera glides over Manhattan intoNew Jersey while a narrator Robert De Niro who turns out to be an InternalAffairs cop named Mo Tilden informs us that New York City policemen havealways dreamed of living outside the metropolis itself where the shitcouldnt touch em and that Garrison was such a refugea city on a hillwith a large population of cops no minorities and almost no crime            Of course the hill the city sits on is a heapof corruption a pile of lies as high as the Palisades Everything emanatesfrom Ray Donlan Harvey Keitel a superconnected New York cop who presidesover Garrison like the oldstyle movie bossmen of Akim Tamiroff or Edward GRobinson But Ray has a problem While driving drunk back to Jersey hisnephew a cop named Babitch Michael Rapaport gets sideswiped on the bridgeby a couple of stoned rastas Thinking they fired on him he blows them awayI thought they fired on him too but the point is murkyno gun is found inthe car For some reason Ray fears that his nephew will spill his guts toInternal Affairs so he takes radical and quite frankly moronic measures tokeep Babitch from seeing the inside of an interrogation room            Mangoldand his cinematographer Eric Alan Edwards cant get enough of Garrisonsterraced cliffs above the Hudson and they rarely lose sight of the imposingManhattan skyline Its a constant reminder to Freddy of the time when as ateenager he saved the town beauty Annabella Sciorra from drowning when hercar went off the bridge in the process mangling one ear and leaving himselfunfit for the NYPD We learn all this from flashbacks and from a strange oraclecalled Gary Figgs Figgis Ray Liotta who when drunk cant seem to stophimself from spewing exposition You saved the town beauty from drowning andmade yourself deaf in one ear so that you couldnt be a New York cop and thenshe married some other guyyou have a right to be jealous Or words to thateffect            In the labyrinthine plot everyone has something to hideRays wife Cathy Moriarty is having an affair with another cop Peter Bergwhos married to Freddys old heartthrob Sciorra Assorted policegoonsamong them the dependable heavy Frank Vincent and the blueeyed blanklymalevolent Robert Patrick the lethal shapeshifter of Terminator Judgment Day let the sheriff know hed better turn his deaf ear on Rayschicanery For most of Cop Land  we watch Stallone get bullied andstared down by everyone in the large cast while we wait for him to awaken fromhis stupor and start blowing bad guys awaywhich you know he has to do or hewould never have accepted the role Of course the formula dictates that allhis allies must abandon him so he can march down the street wielding ashotgun bleeding but with the iron back in his spine to prove to those citycops what hes really made of Everybody in this town he says is gonnatell the truth            Since thefilm moves in such a leisurely fashion with lots of talk theres plenty oftime to be distracted by the overfamiliar cast Oh theres Cathy Moriartymarried to Harvey Keitelhmmm Werent they in Raging Bull togetherNo that was Joe Pesci Wheres Joe Pesci Will Moriarty have any scenes withDe Niro her Raging Bull costar Will Keitel have more scenes with DeNiro Have they acted together since Taxi Driver  Liotta he and De Nirowere both in GoodFellas was Keitel in that No that was Pesci butLorraine Bracco Keitels ex played Liottas wife Will Liotta have any sceneswith De Niro Wasnt Frank Vincent in Raging Bull  AndGoodFellas  And Casino  Wheres Joe Pesci            All these Scorsese types are in there pitchingdoing their damnedest to legitimize the movie and its wayward star Under acurly black thatch De Niro coasts along giving an offhand but confidentlyweird performance I look at you sheriff he says and I see a man whoswaiting for something to do The overdeliberate diction lets you know that heknows the line is a clich but that he thinks its entertaining anyway Thecharacter is playing with Freddy and De Niro is playing with Stallone Icould take you blindfolded both hands tied behind my back he seems to saythe heavyweight towering over the bantamweight And Stallone bless himendures it like a man
