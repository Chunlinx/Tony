              family reunions no you just just talk   does this give us the signal i guess not okay um we have family reunions about every year with my husbands family   uhhuh   and generally its held in the summer and we have it in the state park which has worked out pretty well uh over by Clifton Forge   huh which state park huh   uh Delford have you ever heard of that   no but its in Virginia oh well its bound to be beautiful   right uhhuh well its pretty good yeah  uh there quite a few children in the family so we have to   yeah yeah yeah   try to find a time when everybody can be there and weve   right   been pretty lucky so far   yes that that sounds wonderful i we uh we have family reunions not on a regular basis and theres mostly in my wifes family uh my familys very small   uhhuh   um its essentially the four of us makes up my family but um       when we do get together and and the two families do get together its usually a wedding or or uh or a uh anniversary uh my wifes uh grandparents are still living and on one side both both are living and on the other side the grandmother is still living so um we do uh occasional get together usually in New Hampshire   uhhuh oh   at my uh my uh motherinlaws house and uh   where in New Hampshire   uh at North Hampton right   North Hampton uhhuh im from Maine originally      im sorry   i said im from Maine originally im not im a maniac in other words   oh really  yeah oh we lived in uh we lived in uh New Hampshire for ten years we lived in Dover uh until we moved out here   oh uhhuh   so uh yeah and i dont know do you do anything special to make it interesting   well uh well uh were were some of the older ones in the family so the ones with small kids usually have ball games and kick ball things like that     oh right yeah   uh one of them has made big banners to put on the oh we have one of those isnt that awful shelter a covered shelter and theyve had big banners to display across the front of that   oh yeah uhhuh right right   and its always a potluck everybody brings food   yeah yeah seems to me well the the the uh main event of course is the meal  at the end uh   right   everybody has a specialty and so uh its sort of its its sort of a high class potluck i guess you could say and uh its wonderful its uh uh i mean   ah get all those good family favorites   right i mean and and if somebody didnt make the usually thing theyd be you know everybody else would get all upset you know so if you try something new right and try something new its not its not acceptable   drum them out of the family uhhuh   and uh and then afterwards uh usually uh theres a gathering in the family room to watch a football game or something   oh i see   so uh and uh and the kids are usually uh playing out in the back shes got uh ten acres of property that go with uh with her house so theres plenty of room for the kids to go crazy and and the parents can   oh thats great oh yeah thats great what time of year do you you have it in the fall like after yeah at football games it is its wonderful uh my next family reunion with my family will be   it tends to be in the fall yeah thats thats a beautiful time in New Hampshire yeah   a wedding in Atlanta this month so were looking forward to that   yeah oh that will be nice yeah do you have a feel for how many people there are when you get together   uh it

Mexico its pretty its up in the mountains yeah its beautiful   oh yeah up in the mountains yeah thats thats what we miss we miss mountains and trees   uhhuh   of course you have plenty of uh plenty of uh mountains in Virginia and then in northern and you know up in New Hampshire and Maine too we had uh one of the um   right right yeah   times that we had sort of a family reunion was when uh was this i think it was last last winter we uh we went up to New Hampshire to go skiing   oh great   and uh a bunch of us got together it wasnt the whole family it wasnt all the all the uh cousins usually when when we make a trip   uhhuh   out there somebody else flies in or something because uh my wifes family all have well they have a lot of connections with the airlines my   oh   i have a brotherinlaw who is a pilot my fatherinlaw is a pilot um and so     that makes it great doesnt it   yeah a lot of mobile people so the so the uh sisterinlaw who lives in North Carolina can usually get up and uh      uhhuh   but uh and then so were when were in New Hampshire everybody else is in that area anyway and usually somebody will drive in from New York so uh its usually some kind of uh semi reunion   right well we go to Maine every fall i have a brother who lives there still and i have a sisterinlaw and nieces and nephews so we always have a family family reunion up in Farmington   oh yeah   and its usually out on a farm one of the girls has a farm and   oh oh gee  homesick um have you heard about these uh these businesses these companies that uh i mean their business is planning family reunions for people oh yeah thats i i thought about this and uh it seems like a pretty neat   no i havent huhuh   thing they do uh family reunions and they do um oh what do you call it um oh class reunions   oh   and they make all the plans they contact everybody and they make sure everybodys got travel arrangements and uh   uhhuh      and uh i guess its in fact i think it was started by somebody who was a travel agent and they got this brainstorm that you know they could make a living   oh   by arranging for different family reunions and class reunions all over the country yeah i always thought that would be kind of might be kind of fun you know especially with a class reunion where   uhhuh thats pretty interesting yeah   you have to do a little research try to find everybody  i guess its a little easier with a family reunion and they you know and they theyre really organized you know they setup they they get the hall and they and they uh   right uhhuh yeah uhhuh   uh arrange for the catering and they have name tags
