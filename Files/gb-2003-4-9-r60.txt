                    Rationale        The postgenomic era has introduced highthroughput        methodologies that generate experimental data at rates that        exceed knowledge growth In particular highdensity        biochips including complementary deoxyribonucleic acid        cDNA microarrays oligonucleotide microarrays and        rapidly evolving proteomics platforms represent modern        tools able to interrogate biology on a genomewide scale        and generate tens of thousands of data points        simultaneously     While researchers are beginning to        appreciate the statistical rigors required for the analysis        of genomescale datasets a ratelimiting step in knowledge        growth occurs at the transition from statistical        significance to biological discovery        A number of public efforts are currently focusing on the        annotation and curation of genespecific functional data        including LocusLink Protein Information Resource PIR        GeneCards Proteome Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and        Genomes KEGG Ensembl and SwissProt to name but a few                  These resources provide exceptional depth        and coverage of the functional data available for a given        gene but are not designed to effectively explore the        biological knowledge associated with hundreds or thousands        of genes in parallel In order to facilitate the functional        annotation and analysis of large lists of genes we have        developed a Database for Annotation Visualization and        Integrated Discovery DAVID which provides a set of        datamining tools that systematically combine functionally        descriptive data with intuitive graphical displays            DAVID provides exploratory visualization tools that promote        discovery through functional classification biochemical        pathway maps and conserved protein domain architectures        while simultaneously remaining linked to rich sources of        biological annotation DAVID expedites the functional        annotation and analysis of any list of genes encoded by        human mouse rat or fly genomes DAVIDs functionality is        demonstrated using the Affymetrix GeneChip data of Cicala         et al                         System architecture and maintenance                  Analysis modules          DAVID is composed of four main modules Annotation          Tool GoCharts KeggCharts and DomainCharts The          Annotation Tool is an automated method for the functional          annotation of gene lists Any combination of annotation          data can be chosen from  options by selecting the          appropriate checkboxes Table  The annotations are          added to the submitted gene list by selecting the upload          button which returns an HTML table containing the users          original list of identifiers appended with the chosen          functional annotations Unannotated genes are included in          the output with no appended data for tracking          purposes          The GoCharts module graphically displays the          distribution of differentially expressed genes among          functional categories using the controlled vocabulary of          the Gene Ontology Consortium GO which provides a          structured language that can be applied to the functions          of genes and proteins in all organisms even as knowledge          continues to accumulate and change     The language          is structured in a directed acyclic graph DAG wherein          term specificity increases and genome coverage decreases          as one moves down the hierarchy In contrast with a true          hierarchy child terms in a DAG may have more than one          parent term and may have a different class of          relationship with its different parents The structure of          GO starts with three main categories Biological Process          Molecular Function and Cellular Component Biological          Process includes broad biological goals such as mitosis          or purine metabolism that are accomplished by ordered          assemblies of molecular functions Molecular Function          describes the tasks performed by individual gene          products examples are transcription factor and DNA          helicase The Cellular Component classification type          involves subcellular structures locations and          macromolecular complexes examples include nucleus          telomere and origin recognition complex After choosing          a classification type levels that determine list          coverage and specificity are chosen by selecting the          appropriate radio button Level  provides the highest          list coverage with the least amount of term specificity          With each increasing level coverage decreases while          specificity increases so that level  provides the least          amount of coverage with the highest term specificity          Classification data is displayed as a bar chart where          the length of the bar represents the number of gene          identifiers in each category The user can set          visualization parameters for sorting output data and          displaying categories that contain at least a minimum          number of genes Selecting an individual bar opens a new          HTML table displaying the gene identifier LocusLink          number gene name the current classification and other          classifications for each gene in that category A Show          All button opens a new HTML table displaying all          classification data and a Show Chart Data button opens          an HTML table containing the underlying chart data thus          allowing users to recreate customized chart graphics in a          spreadsheet program A new chart can be displayed for any          subset of genes by selecting the classification type and          level using the checkboxes and radio buttons available          within the users current page that allow for drilldown          capabilities A count of the number of genes annotated is          included in the output and unannotated genes are binned          into the unclassified category thus providing users          with an automated tracking system for genes not          annotated          KeggCharts graphically display the distribution of          differentially expressed genes among KEGG biochemical          pathways Each pathway is linked to the KEGG pathway map          wherein differentially expressed genes from the original          list are highlighted in red In this view genes are          further linked to additional annotations available          through KEGGs DBGET retrieval system     As with          GoCharts the user can set visualization parameters for          sorting output data and displaying categories that          contain at least a minimum number of genes and the          KeggCharts visualization inherits all of the dynamic          features of GoCharts          DomainCharts display the distribution of          differentially expressed genes among PFAM protein domains              Each domain designation is linked to the          Conserved Domain Database CDD of the National Center          for Biotechnology Information NCBI where details          regarding domain function structure and sequence are          readily available As with GoCharts and KeggCharts the          user can set visualization parameters for sorting output          data and displaying categories that contain at least a          minimum number of genes and the DomainCharts          visualization inherits all of the dynamic features of          GoCharts and KeggCharts For further information          regarding the functionality of DAVID visit the FAQ          section at                              Using DAVID to mine functional annotation          To demonstrate the functionality of DAVID we analyzed          a list of genes differentially expressed in human          peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs after          incubation with HIV envelope proteins Details of the          experimental RNA preparation and GeneChip hybridization          procedures along with details of the chiptochip          normalizations and statistical analysis of differential          gene expression are provided in Cicala           et al      Briefly primary          human PBMCs and monocytederived macrophages were          incubated for  hours with HIV envelope protein          gp Highdensity oligonucleotide microarrays          Affymetrix HUA GeneChip were used to monitor          gpinduced transcriptional events This analysis          resulted in the identification of  differentially          expressed genes          Whereas  genes modulated by HIV gp have          previously been associated with HIV replication andor          envelope signaling the remaining genes are of unknown          function or have never been associated with HIV or          gp Converting this list of genes into biological          meaning requires the gathering of pertinent information          from several data repositories For many researchers this          process consists of iterative browsing through several          databases for each gene manually gathering genespecific          information regarding sequence function pathway and          disease association In contrast the systematic approach          of DAVID simultaneously adds biologically rich          information derived from several public data sources to          lists of genes in parallel Selecting DAVIDs Annotation          Tool and uploading the list of  differentially          expressed genes initiates the functional annotation and          analysis of the entire dataset Once submitted the gene          list is stored for the entire analysis session allowing          users to switch between modules without having to          resubmit data                          Annotation Tool          The Annotation Tool provides several annotation          options and builds a tabular view of the users gene list          and the available annotations Table  Choosing the          annotation fields Gene Symbol LocusLink OMIM Unigene          Reference Sequence and Gene Name followed by selecting          the Upload button produces an HTML table in the web          browser containing all genes and their available          annotations where gene identifiers descriptive and          classification data are pulled from the database and          appended to the gene list Figure  Gene identifiers          such as Gene Symbol and LocusLink are hyperlinked to          additional genespecific data available at their original          sources thus providing indepth genespecific details          and annotation pedigrees Classification data and          functional summaries can be used to quickly scan for          information relevant to the researchers experimental          system The server time required for execution of this          module correlates linearly with the size of the gene list          and takes less than  seconds for lists of up to           genes Figure  numbers in parentheses represent r          values These results demonstrate the power and          efficiency of an integrated approach to the functional          annotation of large datasets                          GoCharts          Choosing the GoCharts module opens a new window with a          variety options Users choose between three general types          of classification biological process molecular          function and cellular component and five levels of          annotation that represent term coverage and specificity          see Analysis Modules section Any combination of          classification and coverage level can be specified Also          included are options to annotate gene lists with all GO          terms available or only the most specific terms which          are referred to as terminal nodes The option to choose          different levels of term specificity provides needed          flexibility and thus allows researchers to determine          dynamically which level of coverage and specificity best          suits their data and stage of analysis For instance          earlystage analyses may consist of annotating gene lists          with very general terms in order to gain a broad          understanding of the data In this case selecting          biological process and level  classifies genes using          general terms such as death and cell communication          Using increased term specificity facilitates the          extraction of more detailed functional information In          this case selecting biological process and level           classifies genes using terms such as apoptotic          mitochondrial changes and chemosensory perception          However increased term specificity comes a cost in          that as it increases list coverage decreases Figure           In our studies we find that level  typically maintains          good coverage while also providing meaningful term          specificity Figure aillustrates how the GoCharts          visualization quickly reveals that  differentially          expressed genes are involved in stress responses Each          GO term can be viewed in the tree or DAG views by          hyperlinks to QuickGO              Because HIV has a major impact on the function of          cells of the immune system and their ability to carry out          stress responses we selected the histogram bar          representing the number of genes involved in stress          response which opens an HTML table containing the          Affymetrix identifier LocusLink number gene name the          current classification and other classifications for all           genes Figure b Now that we have reduced our gene          list to those genes involved in stress responses we          further characterized this subset by repeating the          GoCharts procedure available at the top of the          stressresponse HTML table Choosing molecular function          level  produces a new histogram that quickly reveals          that nearly half  of the stressresponse genes          possess cytokine activity Figure c Indeed cytokines          have been shown to play an important part in the HIV          life cycle and the results obtained here suggest that          treatment of PBMCs with HIV envelope proteins          significantly modulates the transcription of numerous          cytokine genes The efficiency with which GoCharts          systematically summarized this large dataset with graphic          visualizations while remaining linked to primary data          and external resources drastically improved the discovery          process                          KeggCharts          Figure adepicts the output of KeggCharts with a          histogram displaying the distribution of differentially          expressed genes among biochemical pathways The chart          shows that a KEGG pathway of apoptosis includes five          genes induced by HIV gp Selecting the pathway name          opens the corresponding KEGG biochemical pathway map and          highlights in red outline the differentially expressed          genes functioning in that pathway Figure b In this          view genes are further linked to additional annotations          available through KEGGs DBGET retrieval system              Note that only four genes in the KEGG apoptosis pathway          are highlighted in red while the KeggCharts tool mapped          five Affymetrix probe sets to the apoptosis pathway This          difference is due to the fact that two of the Affymetrix          probesets are targeting the same TNFalpha gene                          DomainCharts          DomainCharts are operationally akin to both KeggCharts          and GoCharts except that the results visually depicting          the distribution of genes among PFAM protein domains          Figure a The DomainCharts histogram identifies           genes with kinase domains pkinase probably reflecting          the effects of HIV gp on the signal transduction          machinery The chart also identifies six genes with          interleukin domains IL a domain that represents a          highly conserved motif among stressresponse cytokines          Selecting the domain name IL opens the Conserved          Domain Database CDD page corresponding to that PFAM          domain Figure b This page provides detailed sequence          structure and functional information about the IL          domain and the proteins that contain it                            Comparison of DAVID with related programs                  Exploratory tools          FatiGO is a webaccessible application that functions          in much the same way as DAVIDs GoCharts including the          ability to specify termspecificity level Unlike DAVID          FatiGO does not allow the setting of a minimum hit          threshold for simplified viewing of only the most highly          represented functional categories Likewise FatiGO          limits the graphical output to only one toplevel GO          category at a time whereas DAVID allows the combined          viewing of biological process molecular function and          cellular component annotations simultaneously FatiGOs          static barchart output looks very similar to DAVIDs          GoChart an important distinction is that DAVIDs          GoCharts are dynamic allowing users to drilldown and          traverse the GO hierarchy for any subset of genes view          the underlying chart data and associated annotations and          link out to external data repositories including          LocusLink and QuickGO As shown in Table the majority of          accession types accepted and functional annotations          offered by DAVID are not available from FatiGO          GoMiner is a standalone Java application that requires          downloading of the program itself along with at least two          auxiliary files one for DAG visualization and another          for protein structural visualization The remote database          queried by GoMiner is reported to be updated every six          months It has been our experience that to accurately          reflect the current knowledge associated with a given          gene functional annotation data must be updated far more          frequently If users wish to use GoMiner with a local          copy of its annotation database they must also download          and install a local copy of the MySQL database and the          required drivers a process that may be difficult for          inexperienced users of MySQL In contrast DAVID is          webaccessible and updated weekly The functionality of          GoMiner is most similar to DAVIDs GoCharts module An          enhanced feature of GoMiner is that it provides intuitive          tree and DAG views of genes embedded within the GO          hierarchy DAVID has the ability to display such views          through hyperlinks of GO terms to QuickGOs tree and DAG          views A unique function provided by DAVID is the ability          to drilldown and traverse the GO hierarchy for any          subset of genes sharing a common classification as          demonstrated by the identification of stress response          genes with cytokine activity Neither the tree nor DAG          view of GoMiner provides this functionality          The body of biological knowledge associated with any          list of genes extends far beyond the structured          vocabulary of GO DAVID provides in addition to          GoCharts two additional analysis modules that utilize          PFAM protein domain designations and KEGG biochemical          pathways to graphically summarize the distribution of          genes among functional domains and pathways Moreover          DAVID highlights pathway members within the biochemical          pathways provided by KEGG Whereas GoMiner provides          hyperlinks to pathway databases such as BioCarta and KEGG          for individual genes lists of genes can only be batch          processed in the context of GO In addition to providing          hyperlinks to external data repositories for each gene          DAVID provides links to primary sequence information          available at NCBI and humancurated functional summaries          parsed from LocusLink These features are not available          in GoMiner DAVID can be used to collect analyze and          explore functional annotation associated with human          mouse rat and           Drosophila gene lists whereas          GoMiner is restricted to analyzing human data Another          restrictive feature of GoMiner is that it only takes HUGO          gene symbols as input This is problematic in that many          genes and expressed sequence tags ESTs do not have HUGO          symbols Moreover this restriction requires the          translation of every gene list into HUGO symbols          Like GoMiner MAPPFinder is a standalone exploratory          tool for the analysis of lists of genes within the          context of GO The downloadable program comes with a copy          of the supporting relational database of gene to GOterm          associations However as with GoMiner there are          important considerations regarding the installation          support and updating of the software and underlying          database as indicated by the documentation and bug          reports listed on their website Importantly in addition          to the batch processing of gene lists within the context          of GO MAPPFinder provides functionality similar to that          of DAVIDs KeggCharts providing the ability to view          lists of genes within the context of biochemical          pathways However in order to use this functionality          through MAPPFinder users must download additional          programs and files including the GenMAPP program and its          associated MAPP files whereas the KeggCharts module of          DAVID is easily accessible at the click of a button                          Annotation tools          ENSMART is a webaccessible application that          integrates an enormous amount of functional annotation          for numerous species ENSMART takes as input lists of          several accession types including Affymetrix probe sets          making it quite flexible Database crossreferences          provided by ENSMART cover a broad spectrum of functional          annotations pertaining to gene and proteinspecific          attributes as well as disease and crossspecies          attributes However users are limited to a maximum of          three crossreferences for a given gene list Unlike          DAVID ENSMART does not provide graphic summaries of GO          categories protein domains or biochemical pathway          membership nor does ENSMART provide the ability to          drilldown within groups of genes sharing common          functional features          GeneLynx and Source are highly similar webaccessible          annotation tools that provide a wealth of genespecific          information for individual genes and both are flexible in          that they take as input several different accession          types However the rich information and available          hyperlinks provided in singlegene mode is lost when          either GeneLynx or Source are used to batch process lists          of genes The output of batch processing with Source is a          textstyle table that is feasible for download and          automated processing but provides little utility for          interactive exploration Although GeneLynx can perform          batch searching for a list of genes functional          annotations must be viewed one gene at a time          MatchMiner is a companion program of GoMiner that          performs the translations of gene accession types into          the HUGO symbols required by GoMiner MatchMiner is          simply a webaccessible resource for translating          accession types It takes several accession types but          does not take LocusLink numbers and although it was          reported to accept identifiers from Affymetrix chip sets          MatchMiner returned no data for several gene lists          composed of HuFL probe sets Notably MatchMiner does          not provide any functional annotation and is restricted          to human data Thus within the context of the other          exploratory and annotation tools discussed here          MatchMiners utility is limited or supportive at          best          Resourcerer is a webaccessible application for          comparing and annotating human mouse and rat GeneChip          and microarray platforms A major feature of Resourcerer          is its broad coverage of microarray platforms and its          ability to identify overlapping gene targets between          chips even across technology platforms and species          barriers Resourcerers output is in tabular form and          provides hyperlinks to accession crossreferences such as          GenBank and UniGene Resourcerer does not provide graphic          summaries or annotations from GO PFAM KEGG or any          other resource thus limiting its utility as a tool for          functional annotation                            Conclusions        In conclusion the development of any complete         insilico discovery system requires        full querybased access to an integrated uptodate view        of all relevant information regardless of its physical        location and content structure Still in its infancy DAVID        represents the foundation of our continued development        efforts that aim to integrate informationrich data sources        and provide quantitative summaries and analysis methods In        addition to the functionality reported here the methods of        Hosack         et al     have been incorporated        into a DAVID analysis module called         EASEonline  which allows users to        identify statistically overrepresented functional        categories within a given list of genes Committed to        maintaining a system able to coevolve with technological        advances and the new forms of data that are sure to follow        DAVIDs current design elements provide automated solutions        that enable researchers to rapidly discover biological        themes in large datasets consisting of lists of genes
