                                 Not Without a Hitch            Everybody leads with the wrapup of yesterdays impeachment trial closingarguments and the setup of todays deliberations The Los AngelesTimes headline suggests the drama associated with a criminal trialPresidents Fate is Now in Hands of Senate Jurors Down below in the bodytype though the stories get more real The LAT says there is virtuallyno chance President Clinton will be removed The New York Timessays his acquittal is all but assured And the Washington Post says the House Republican prosecutors facenearcertain defeat Perhaps USA Today is the realest Its also unclear whetherthe Senate will formally reprimand Clinton once hes acquitted            And USAT s headline isnt even about the what of the verdictitsabout the how Closed Senate Debate Likely Thats because there dont appearto be the  votes required to suspend the rules a point that the WPand NYT also cover in additional frontpage stories The NYT leadeditorial finds the prospect of closing the doors on the impeachmentdeliberations inconceivable For the LAT  the main unanswered questionis whether enough Republicans would join the Democrats to keep either of thetwo impeachment articles from winning a simple majority            In light of the presumed outcome the WP sees the rhetoric comingyesterday from both sideseach of the  House prosecutors and PresidentClintons lawyer Charles Ruffaimed not so much at the Senate jurors as at thehistory books The NYT notes that Ruff worked in references to peace inthe Middle East and that Henry Hyde dipped into Henry Vs Agincourt speech aswell as quotations from de Gaulle Septimius Severus Horace Mann EdwardGibbon and Saul Bellow The WP notices the cumulative effect of this hotair front moving through One senator after another getting up from his desk tostretch and wander to the rear of the chamber            The only thing resembling impeachment news is the HitchensBlumenthal sagaThe LAT and WP leads report that Henry Hyde wrote a letter to theSenate asking for a postponement in the start of deliberations to allow the newquestions about Sidney Blumenthals truthfulness to be addressed He was turneddown Christopher Hitchens himself makes an appearance on the WP opedpage What a fuss What a load of phony differences without distinctionsBlumenthal has already told the grand jury that Clinton concocted this foulstory with its equally foul implications He has now admitted to telling somesuch version to friends of his as well as journalists and I still considermyself to be both That story got into the press a lot The message wastherefore delivered to Ms Lewinsky QED Hitchens goes on to say that hedevoutly wishes hed written an intended column on the matter a week earlierso that he could have been a truer friend by warning Blumenthal off makingany unguarded statement But that having not happened he sees Blumenthal asbeing readied to be used as yet another human sacrifice by his employer Onequestion about all this Was it fair for the Post to give Hitchens theroom to defend himself when the legal constraints Blumenthal is under no doubtkept him from being able to write a column of his own about the matter            Last summer when the US destroyed a purported pharmaceutical plant in theSudan with cruise missiles saying that it was in fact making nerve gas forOsama bin Laden the NYT quickly raised doubts about the governmentsaccount of the facility Today it raises more with an inside piece stating that chemists hired bythe plants owners examined soil samples from the plant and found no traces ofchemical weapons compounds One problem though although the piece makes itclear that these chemists have the same monetary tie to an interested party asany expert witness the headline does not It simply says Experts Find NoArms Chemicals at Bombed Sudan Plant Not a false headline to be sure but amisleadingly unnuanced one            A NYT frontpager warns that the social ill effects of fearing theYK problemsuch as bank runs hoarding of food and gas fires caused by newlyacquired wood stoves and a rise in gun violence accompanying the upsurge in gunsales to those fearing postmillennialbug civil unrestcould end up beingmuch worse than any pure outcome of the problem itself especially since theactual problem is being attacked with billions of dollars of remediationAccording to a story flagged on the Wall Street Journal front not all of the hoarding will bedone by cammoed guys in Montana cabins either It turns out that inanticipation of possible YKdriven supply interrupts companies like Xerox areplanning to take on more inventory than usual in the last part of  Whichis driving a search for extra warehouse space and could even effect the GNPAnd wait that doesnt include the K problem For that check out theWSJ s Work Week It seems that certain older software systems use to signal an error or the end of the program Which means September  may be a bit of a glitchfest There are says the paper nine suchproblematic dates this year
