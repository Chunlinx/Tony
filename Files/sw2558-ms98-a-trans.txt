        what do you think about the uh Peace Corps or public service commitment   uh thats the first ive ever heard of it i havent heard of it anything too much about it um   well i think it was uh thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said well they uh young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from um some sort of public service like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or   uhhuh   uh various other things of that sort and it seems to me that its its not a totally bad idea but i dont quite see how theyd make it work   uhhuh   how would they decide who goes into uh building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia   right yeah i the my first impression was um it would be very very good i think it would be good for people to serve but i dont know if it should be an option it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids and i think there are some available now where they are able to work but making it a mandatory thing   yeah the the difficulty would be in whether its voluntary or involuntary and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft   kind of right uhhuh   and some people would get military service and some people would get civilian uh service like working in hospitals this i assume its the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do   uhhuh uhhuh   when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army they were allowed to do hospital service or uh things like that and if they refuse or farm work in World War One i remember   uhhuh   uh reading about and and i suppose that there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody   uhhuh   but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them uh sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable   uhhuh it seems like youd have a lot more conscientious conscientious objectors if they had that choice   yeah       well  its a possibility   yeah you know id id much rather work in a hospital than than to go to war and im sure most young men and women would and so uh   well i think that in the in the cases that like that uh they had to be uh pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasnt something new just to keep out of going to war it was   uhhuh   uh something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life   uhhuh well that makes sense and then you run into again to um the bureaucracy in running it you know how you going to cover that many people because weve got a lot more people now than we did then   oh yeah sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something   so right   for their room and board and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend uh even if its like the Peace Corps where they dont get most of it until they come home you have to have to pay them something   uhhuh uhhuh plus the training involved yeah that would be expensive in most cases   oh yeah yeah now i had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps uh back in the mid sixties   because uhhuh   and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand im not sure what the permanent value of it was i dont know what we got for all the money   uhhuh   we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to uh what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh and to uh Algeria and to   uhhuh   uh Southeast Asia and lots of uh out of the way places but i dont know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better     uhhuh well i know in i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan   uhhuh   and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me it taught me not to be so selfcentered and it you know to think of others   uhhuh   but i dont know if i was doing it in different situation you know not a really religious background if if i would get a lot out of it you know i think i did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing you know a lot of   sure   self   and it was definitely voluntary too they were not drafting you and sending you against your will   evaluation but right right and that im sure that would make a big difference too   yeah well what about a voluntary program do you think that would be a good idea   you know weve got um well like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth like teenagers to go and do um work in the national parks and work in uh neighborhoods to do um clean up and that sort of thing but i dont know what organization its under i dont know if its a government run or if its a private   i dont either   charity thats put it together but i know that that helps a lot with training and um   yeah out here in California theres a program like that for uh juvenile delinquents the the ones that are not dangerous and they dont have to be locked up go to these uh camps   a lot of uhhuh   and they do forestry work they maintain trails and they uh put up signs and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort   uhhuh   and that i know is run by the State but there may be other things im not so sure what kind of uh training that is for the future for those kids   yeah how much benefit itll do them in the long run   its probably a a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble but whether its something that they can put to to economic use later on is a different subject     right especially in you know if you take a a child thats from the inner city and then put them in the a middle of a park if they go back to the inner city they may not see trees for a while much less be able to take care of them   thats true  good point     so thats yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run   oh yeah yeah im sorry im going to have to go but my other line is blinking but it was good to talk to you   but okay well thank you you too byebye   bye
