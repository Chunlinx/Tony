                    Background        Endothelial cell adhesion molecules ECAMs play        essential roles in the development of chronic inflammation        by recruiting leukocytes especially lymphocytes to        tissues ECAMs support several forms of leukocyte adhesion        including rolling firm adhesion and extravasation            Infiltration of tissues by leukocytes is a common hallmark        of many chronic inflammatory states that include the        inflammatory bowel diseases IBD ulcerative colitis UC        and Crohns disease CD In the setting of IBD the        expression of ECAMs like ICAM VCAM and MAdCAM        mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule is observed in        experimental models of colitis       and also within        the inflamed human colon in Crohns disease and ulcerative        colitis             Among the adhesion molecules upregulated in IBD        MAdCAM the mucosal cell adhesion molecule is thought to        be preeminent in the development of chronic gut        inflammation MAdCAM is normally expressed in the gut        and its expression is dramatically amplified during        inflammation      The functional significance of        increased appearance of MAdCAM in IBD is supported by        several reports which show that immunoneutralization of        either MAdCAM or its ligand the  integrin attenuate        inflammation and mucosal damage in animal models of colitis              However since monoclonal antibodies directed        against other ECAMs particularly VCAM can as well        reduce disease activity in colitis models               the literature suggests that MAdCAM is probably        necessary but insufficient for the maximal penetrance of        experimental and probably also clinical IBD        Based on these findings it is apparent that a better        understanding of the mechanisms regulating ECAM expression        especially that of MAdCAM might help to devise improved        therapies for colitis        It has been suggested that pathologic activation of the        mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key        factor in the pathogenesis of IBD Furthermore changes in        leukocyte migration and cytokine production appear to        contribute the perpetuation of IBD     Based on modern        advances recombinant antiinflammatory cytokines ie        IL treatment is now being developed for experimental        colitis and human IBD IL produced by macrophages and        monocytes appears to limit chronic inflammation              through a decreased release of inflammatory factors        IL IL IL TNF GMCSF GCSF suppression of        adhesive determinants MHC class II molecule  and by        blocking ICAM induction                 Conversely IL geneknockout mice develop a chronic        colitis that is extremely similar to IBD     IL        treatment can reduce inflammation in several models of        colitis        and human IBD                However the clinical efficacy of systemically        administered IL for patients mild to moderately active        Crohns disease has not been as effective as hoped              Furthermore the efficacy of IL administration in        mouse colitis models is contentious            We have described in vitro that exogenous IL can        block the expression of MAdCAM in response to TNF and        attenuates lymphocyte adhesion to lymphatic node derived        endothelium under cytokine stimulating conditions via NFkB        inhibition     The purpose of the current study was to        show that induction of endothelial expression of IL        through an IL expression vector attenuates MAdCAM        expression in response to TNF and optimistically suggests        the possibility of targeted Thcytokine gene therapy in        IBD                    Methods                  Reagents          Recombinant mouse TNF was purchased from ENDOGEN          Stoughton MA amd plasmid

basal level of lymphocyte          adhesion to the endothelium without TNF treatment                            Discussion        MAdCAM is a  kDa endothelial cell surface molecule        that is strongly expressed by mucosal endothelial cells        particularly following exposure of these cells to        proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF Expression of        MAdCAM has also been reported in the brain and in the        heart      based on these findings it is now been        suggested that MAdCAM might play roles in chronic        inflammation of these organs as well        With respect to inflammatory bowel disease MAdCAM        appears to be essential to the lymphocyte homing to the        mucosa associated lymphoid tissue MALT               Since MAdCAM is normally expressed mainly within the gut        microvasculature and is dramatically amplified during IBD        it has been suggested that increased MAdCAM expression        contributes to the etiology of IBD through its ability to        direct homing of lymphocytes to the gut This notion is        well supported by several reports that show that antibodies        directed against either MAdCAM or its lymphocyte ligand        the  integrin will significantly attenuate several        indices of gut damage in experimental models of colitis                    Several studies have indicated that T helper Th        immune response has important roles in the development of        IBD       Moreover dysregulation of cytokine        networks is involved in Thdominant immune responses in        IBD       Among the Th cytokines TNF is        thought to be perhaps the most important cytokine        responsible for driving the onset and evolution of IBD        Because of this prime role of TNF in IBD antiTNF        antibody therapy has been very successfully used in IBD to        reduce both colonic injury and expression of ECAMs in IBD                   IL a cytokine produced by activated macrophages and        Thtype T cells has crucial inhibitory effect against        several Th type immune responses such as the        antigenpresenting functions of monocytes and macrophages             IL may play an important role in preventing        the induction of IBD since animals deficient in IL will        develop colitis spontaneously and low levels of IL are        positively correlated with recurrences of Crohns disease             However unlike TNF based therapies the        administration of recombinant IL rIL shows poor        clinical efficacy This may reflect the fact that TNF        therapies for IBD are aimed at efficiently clearing TNF        while IL therapies must         increase IL and recombinant IL        is likely too rapidly cleared from the circulation after         in vivo administration to provide a        uniform protection     On the other hand IL         gene transfer technology has been        used with some success in models of colitis however its        effectiveness is also variable One reason for this        variability may be that the final serum IL concentration        of genetransfected mice might be below the critical        threshold needed for gut protection      Therefore        targeting of the IL gene to the inflamed colon should        ideally exploit tissue ie gut specific promoters to        control selective organ gene transfer technology        endothelial specific promoters and also organ specific        intraarterial injection of vector to activate some genes        in specific locations            Administration of IL         in vitro prevents TNF stimulated        expression of MAdCAM and also blocks lymphocyte adhesion        to endothelial cells to the same extent as dexamethasone        treatment currently a key therapy in IBD            Interestingly the low basal levels of MAdCAM expressed        by control cytokine unstimulated cells were not affected        by IL transfection This suggests that basal expression        of MAdCAM is IL independent while cytokine        stimulated MAdCAM         is modulated by IL While we        previously showed that delivery of IL to the endothelium                in vitro is protective against TNF                    in vivo IL has not been as        effective There are at least two regulating pathways in        ECAM expression one is a cytokinedependent pathway which        is widely studied and the other is cytokineindependent            IL apparently prevents cytokineinduced NFkB        binding activity to the ECAM promoter    and blocks the        excessive expression of ECAMs in cytokinemediated        inflammatory conditions In this regard IL has been        used as a treatment in inflammatory diseases like IBD for        precisely this reason because it has few effects at sites        remote from inflammation Similarly we found that IL        transfection did not affect cell morphology total protein        level or the expression of actin and vimentin in these        cells measured by Ponceau red S staining density on        immunoblots Therefore methods like endothelial gene        transfectiontransfer         in vivo may effectively maintain        adequate IL concentrations near the endothelial cells        that finally achieve the protection against cytokines that        is not uniformly produced by systemic IL        administration        The most important index for how well gene mediated        recombinant IL delivery might work in IBD appears to be        measurement of the inhibition of lymphocyteendothelium        binding mediated by TNF induced MAdCAM expression In        this experiment IL induction in the endothelium        efficiently blocked TNF induced MAdCAM expression and        dependent lymphocyte adhesion on SVEC endothelial        cells IL deficiency in colitis increases expression of        several ECAMs including ICAM VCAM and MAdCAM            We performed an experiment where under nonstimulated        conditions only    as many of the TK lymphocytes        bound to SVEC compared to TNF stimulation  or        maximal binding TK were seen to interact with SVEC        through ICAM as well MAdCAM but not VCAM since an        antibody against MAdCAM reduced adhesion to    of        maximum and an antiICAM reduced adhesion to            of maximum antiVCAM reduced adhesion to  of maximum        blocks lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells          data not shown  Therefore we feel        that adhesion in this system is mostly MAdCAM        dependent        IL transfection of endothelial cells reduced MAdCAM        expression by  following TNF stimulation and reduced        TK adhesion by  Therefore these data suggest that        the reduction of TK adhesion is approximately          MAdCAM dependent and that the remaining  of        adhesion depends on other ECAMs such as ICAM        Although tissue specific promoters might further        increase the organ specificity and transgene delivery of        this approach they have not been evaluated in this report        Our findings suggest that lymphatic or gut endothelial        transfection with Th cytokines like IL may be an        effective method to reduce important clinical symptoms        associated with IBD which are mediated by MAdCAM        dependent lymphocyte
