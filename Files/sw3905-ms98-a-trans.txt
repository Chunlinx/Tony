                um   what product did you have returned   i had to uh i had to return a that recently ive had to return uh uh a cassette recorder um my feelings about products made in the United States uh recently is they are getting worse uh in fact i am kind of disappointed in American made things uh how about yourself   well im kind of confused about American made products because Ford and Chevy have Isuzu Mazda engines and theyre considered American products so i dont understand if we are supposed to not buy Volvos and Volkswagons and Mazdas because they are foreign or if we are supposed to buy American because theyre foreign but they are American cars you know what i am saying   umhum   and i just dont understand that   umhum   and it seems that whenever you do have a product parts of it are both American and overseas that it creates a problem   umhum   both in uh the product and in the overall warranty or lasting   have have you recently bought a car   yes i did   what what did you buy   i bought a Chrysler New Yorker and my daughter bought a Plymouth Sundance   they are pretty much a hundred percent American made arent they   no uh i was surprised yes Chrysler has some of their parts built overseas also   or you know is that right   and i thought that was totally American   hum   and uh thats why i stayed away from General Motors and find out that the same thing happened to me anyway   i am really surprised to hear about uh i i havent studied cars probably as closely as you have um i was really surprised that you mentioned uh Chrysler no it was GM and Ford that are um using Japanese motors and   and engines thats true   hum huh   it seems that theyre quote unquote American made where was your VCR   um it   what was it and what went wrong with it   yeah let me see it was a Lloyd and um it it continually i dont know if i think it is Japanese i think Lloyd is made in Japan and uh it it was eating my tapes and uh i dont know i am totally uh totally confounded about uh uh American made and Japanese and im not sure which is the best       i use the Consumer Digest a lot to decide what i want to buy   yeah i do too i dont read it but sometimes i  did you know that Fitzhugh is a Japanese computer company and they deliberately make boards and parts wrong so you will have to buy them   hum   and it cannot be repaired and that upset me when i found that out   huh do you own a computer   no i dont but my daughter does and she worked with a computer company that uh serviced them and she is the one that told me about that because uh we were we are thinking about buying a computer we havent done it yet and uh since she works for this computer computer company i asked her what she thought was best cause if TI was using Macs and IBM clones and this type of thing and uh she was saying that she didnt know which one was the best because of the way theyre put together and then she was telling me about this uh uh computer boards just put in X number of uh computers and then they last for eighteen months to no longer than two years and then instead of repairing them you have to buy a whole new board   i didnt realize that i work for a CPA firm and we have a lot of computers in our office and uh the computers we use mostly are Dell computers and they are manufactured down in Texas   by whom   uh Dell Computers Dell Corporation   Dell Corporation where do they get their parts from Fitzhugh   uh uh uh i i dont know maam uh i wouldnt be surprised if most of them arent Japanese parts but uh weve had the Dell computers for four years now and we were really happy with them     are you   and we use them every day we use them probably eight hours a day on the average every day so they get a lot of use   well maybe youre well youre probably fortunate youve probably got one of the better ones   yep   so you work part time with an accountant also   i im full timing with the accountants office   oh
