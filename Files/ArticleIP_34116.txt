                                 High Fidelity            It has been heartening tosee some of my fellow survivors of mids adolescence postVietnampostWatergate prepunk preReagan finally clear their heads of all thedrugs and bad music and put those lost years into perspective But how canany filmmaker nowadays convey the nihilistic embrace of dope and booze andpills and do justice both to the way it felt at the timeblissfully gonzoliberatingand the way it came to feel after everyone did too muchlikequicksand The comedy Outside Providence treats those dark years afterNixon got flushed away with just the right amount of gleeful nostalgia andhorrified incredulity The film is so free of cant that its positivelycleansing It leaves you both cleareyed and high            The movie is based on aterse bleakly funny  novel by Peter Farrelly who with his brother Bobbywrote and directed Dumb and Dumber  and Theres Something AboutMary  It tells the story of a poor Irish kid named Tim Dunphy wholives in Pawtucket RI a rotting city bleeding off an anemic river justnorth of Providence That description is more bitter than anything in thefilm but it does suggest how Farrelly kept life among the urban unwashed fromcrushing his soul He cultivated a caustic sense of humor The movie directedby Michael Corrente from a script he wrote with the Farrellys is not in thewhacking grossout school of the brothers other projects but it shares withthem a tender regard for the scruffy outsider the yearning misfit In thenovel a headmaster actually refers to the hero and his friend as Dumb andDumber More important it has the Farrellys characteristic mix of miseryand brightness Whenever the view of the working poor threatens to becomeoppressively selfpitying the filmmakers pull something nutty out of theirhata scam a bit of stoner dialogue a jolt of rock n rollto prove thatthis particular end only looks dead OK maybe it is dead butsometimes you can plow through a brick wall and come out the other side            The other side in this case is a fancy Connecticut prepschool where Dunph Shawn Hatosy gets sent when he rearends a policecruiser after an evening with his buddies and their bong Its thanks to themurky intervention of one of his dads poker pals a gangster that he ends upthere and not in juvenile detention At Cornwall a k a Cornhole Dunphsstoner lifestyle proves more of a challenge to maintain Its not that the richkids dont party as determinedly as the poor ones its that the dorms areprowled by sadistic faculty watchdogs such as Mr Funderburk Tim Crowe aswell as by students happy to rat out their peers if it means getting into anIvy League school Its also that Dunph falls for the blond WASP Jane WestonAmy Smart who if not a goodytwoshoes is determined not to let drugsoverwhelm her course of selfimprovement As his Pawtucket buddies die in carcrashes or face the prospect of lives scrambling for a dwindling number offactory jobs Dunph has a vague inkling that his level of consumption is not adesign for living                           Outside               Providence is hardly an antidrug picture That would be hypocriticalsince its most meaningful and hilarious connections happen over and with alarge assist from booze and pot Its impulses are dividedwhich is just Ithink as they should be The movie says that getting high all the time can rotyour brain and even kill you but its not above going for Cheech Chongstyle laughs or blithely wallowing in the sense of community that drugscan instill In Pawtucket the kids get stoned and hang out at the water towerOver bong hits they talk of moving to a West Coast utopia where they gotbabes they got weed they got cars that dont rust When Dunph tells them helikes the girl hes seeing so much he doesnt think about banging her they sayshe sounds like a cool mule I wish that the Pawtucket scenes hadnt beenshot on a special film stocktheyre bleached a toilet bowl bluebut theystill have a powerful comic hum Even Jackie Tommy Bone Dunphswheelchairbound brother He had a freak accident at touch football and felloff a roof explains Dunph in a voiceover gets to be in on the jokesinstead of the object of them In one scene he feigns extreme cerebral palsyso that he and his brother can have great seats at a football game            The charm of Correntes direction comes as a shock TheRhode Island native made his debut in  with a mannered MeanStreets style Italianguysfromtheneighborhood picture called FederalHill and followed that with a strenuously boring adaptation of DavidMamets American                Buffalo  In Outside Providence  hestops trying to wow us with indieauteur smarts The details are right Songsthat I hoped never to hear againHold Your Head Up Take It Easy Band onthe Run Free Birdsound in context startlingly fresh and Dunphs browncorduroy jacket looks like the one I persisted in wearing into the late swhen a girlfriend finally took the initiative to drop it down a garbage chuteBetter Corrente brings out the natural radiance in his young actors Thesnaggletoothed Hatosy has a soft agreeable presence Early on he makes Dunphseem a tad stupid but when hes picked up hitchhiking by Jane and her richparents you glimpse the sneaky undercurrents of his rube act He passes her aCoke which turns out to be spiked with rum and the two have a magicalcollusion Amy Smart must be the nicest most downtoearth Southern WASPgoddess in historyif F Scott Fitzgerald had met her hed have lived intohis s            Like its titleOutside Providence hints at a godless universeas well as a motherlessone Dunphs mom shot herself when he was much younger You learn from yourpeersfor better or worseand not your elders The movie might have beenunbearably depressing if Old Man Dunphy had been the thug of Farrellys novelIn one of the books first scenes he kills his sons mutt by crushing it in adoor after it tears apart a neighbors cat But Alec Baldwin brings an outsizecomic spiritand outsize vulnerabilityto the film He drops his voice anoctave and bellows lines like Drag your pimply ass in here and say hello tothe guysshow some class fr chrissakes in a way that transcends caricatureHes so frightened of communicating with his children that he has to caricaturehimself  The source of his comedy is also what makes him tragic            In The Very Thought of You  three shallowLondonbased mates coincidentally meet and fall in love with the same prettyblond American flake Monica Potter thus filling the one she likes bestJoseph Fiennes with guilt and shame If watching the bugeyed and irritableFiennes wrestle with this nonissue for  minutes sounds like fun to you thendont hold back on my account The movie isnt awful It pulls a couple ofamusing tricks with its narrative the second act doesnt come until after thefourth whereupon everything starts tosort ofmake sense but this kind offlimsy romantic confection is either utterly charming or it collapses into aheavy slab of obviousness It doesnt help that Potter looks and sounds as ifshe has just stepped out of a lab where someone was laboring to clone JuliaRoberts She has the same wide eyes turnedup nose and vaguely glassyhysteria but everything is smallerscale Honey I shrunk Julia Roberts                           The                Astronauts Wife is one of theclassiest terrible scifi movies youre likely to see The tale of an astronautJohnny Depp with a drawl who comes back from a space accident somehowdifferent is cut from the same paranoid cloth as Invasion of the BodySnatchers  I Married a                Monster From Outer Space and midway Rosemarys Baby  But someone forgot to tell thewriterdirector Rand Ravich that a genre movie cant survive on fancyhightoned portent aloneespecially when the audience knows whats beingportended before they even buy their tickets Its a testament to the lovelyCharlize Theron that she can hold our attention even when were  steps aheadof her character and only waiting around to see the big slimy outerspacemonsterwhich never comes Even Samuel Beckett would be yelling Get to thedamn point
