advantageous to go to Harvard just as it would bewonderful and advantageous to have an internship with a Nobel Prizewinningwriter or for that matter your own private plane Does that mean students whodo not get such internships or their own planes are disadvantaged enough toneed them given out by governmental or university administrative decree Ofcourse not Yes if your parents are best friends with Nobel Prize winners orrich enough to give you a plane you will have an advantage in procuring thesethings Thats life For the most part those who really want these things mustearn them Giving them to some by decree is worse than unfair it is ultimatelycorrupting to the whole ethic of achievement It subjects those who get thesethings unfairly to widespread suspicion of their own abilities and spreads adamaging cynicism throughout the culture In place of a flawed value system ofachievement it puts an inherently damaging system of victimhood The pointabout the successful minority members who go to lesser universities is thatlike the rest of us who dont get the chance to attend Harvard they have theopportunity to earn success honestly They are not shut out             MichaelLadenson Philadelphia                           JudithShulevitz replies                                       Michael Ladenson makestwo classic antiaffirmativeaction arguments in his letter  Its unfair tochange the rules so that blacks can go to Harvard and  affirmative actionproduces a sense of inferiority and insecurity in those it causes to beadmitted                                       Point  Ladenson wouldhave a much stronger case if Americas universities and colleges used a singleannounced criterion for admission and never varied from it the way New YorkCitys two true meritocracies Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant HighSchool dothey only admit students who score well on Bronx Sciences orStuyvesants own tests Then sure it would be a flagrant violation of therules to let in some group of kids who didnt meet that standard But I havenever heard of a single college or university judging its candidates on thebasis of one simple straightforward and publicly stated criterion Insteadcollege admissions procedures are made up of dozens of subjective judgments AtHarvard for instance there are probably  applicants every year who areso outstanding theres no question theyll get in But there are another who are all good but not quite as great How will the admissions office selectfrom that group to fill its remaining  places On the basis of any numberof things SAT scores and grades of coursebut also how well an essay waswritten how much and what kind of volunteer work was done notable athletic orartistic ability a concern for geographic diversity recommendations or themost entrenched affirmative action program around whether an applicantsparents went to Harvard Ladenson assumes that theres one standard appliedacross the board to everybody except for black kids and that just isnttrue                                       Point As Ive argued above unless youve written a symphony that was performed bythe New York Philharmonic by the time youre  getting into Harvard issomething of a crapshoot Everyone there knows it and they dont let it makethem insecure They accept their luck and get on with their lives Do the sonsand daughters of alumni feel insecure because the standards used to evaluatetheir applications were significantly different and lower than those used fornonalumnae candidates Ask Michael Kinsley the editor of this magazine Beingthe son of a Harvard alumnus and then getting into Harvard himself does notseem to have made a shrinking violet out of him                                       Feminisms Fetishes                        I commendJudith Shulevitz on an excellent column Dont Take It SoPersonally Her recognition of the grave personal injustice done by theleft to Clarence Thomas is especially appreciated It took intellectual courageto arrive at this conclusion I hope others will follow you             David Horowitz LosAngeles                           ArtSalesmanship                        Your measurement in JacobWeisbergs The                   Slate                Arts Index appears tobe a wellintended method for annual comparisons However I am just a littledisappointed that there is no representation in your measurement for popularmusic Call me oldfashioned for caring but increased popular musicsales typically lead to increased classical or jazz music salesdue mainly to the effect of people feeling compelled to enter a music store andlook around to see whats new since they were there to buy Thriller  orthe Titanic soundtrack or whatever got them in the door the lasttime            This is no secret to musicretailers In the online biz we compete for eyeballs but retailers needfootheels or toetouches And importantly we can easily determine how muchrecorded music is sold at retail from readily available sources            Assigninga couple of index points to compare higher or lower music sales at retailmight be deserved and appropriate to measuring the state of the arts

letter to the editor Trapped in Monicagatesuggested that people who say enough with Monica already but then readFlytrap coverage may be canny rather than hypocritical The potential outcomeof Flytrap is the impeachment and removal of the president of the UnitedStates Do I think the media have overcovered Flytrap helping to create thecrisis they report Yes Do I think Id be happy pretending this crisis isnthappening allowing people whose views differ from mine to have moreinformation than I have Not a chance Remember Cardinal Newman saidKnowledge is power While I disagreed with the House Judiciary Committeesdecision to release the presidents videotaped testimony before even asking thequestions Will there be hearings and Whats an impeachable offense Iwatched the tape so that I could understand the spin from both sides and makeup my own mind I dont think thats hypocritical I think thats goodcitizenship             JenShelton Huntington WVa                           SomeFeature

directorcomes from Senegal So much for objectivity             GerryEllis London                           ScottShuger replies                                       Myquestion Where would you rather be arrestedin the US or Senegal wasraised not as an ad hominem assessment of the Amnesty International report butin response to the Amnesty honcho from Senegals comment that the US criminaljustice system lagged in fairness behind someplace he called the worldcommunity Yes there are problems with our system and yes there are somecountries that could teach us a thing or two about them But my point was Idont believe people who say most countries couldbecause they wouldnt preferto be arrested imprisoned tried or sentenced in most countries                                       Addressyour
