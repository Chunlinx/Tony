                    PRESENTATION of CASE        A yold woman presented with pulmonary embolism She had been taking without        apparent complication norgestimateethynil estradiol Ortho TriCyclen   and         mg norgestimate cycles and  g ethinyl estradiol for  y followed by the same        drug combination but with a lower dose of ethinyl estradiol Ortho TriCyclen Lo  g        ethinyl estradiol for  mo A nonsmoker she lacked a relevant family history and was        vigorously athletic        One month prior to presentation she developed neck pain disc protrusion at CC was        detected by magnetic resonance imaging The patient was prescribed valdecoxib  mg twice        a day bid for  wk Her neck pain resolved However towards the end of this        treatment period she developed leftsided pleuritic chest and shoulder pain after a h        car ride She was started on cyclobenzaprine  mg bid and continued on valdecoxib        Her leftsided pain abated gradually However  d later she developed rightsided chest        and shoulder pain A diagnosis of left iliac vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary emboli        was based on a computed tomography scan She was heparinized and continued on therapy with        warfarin  mg bid and enoxaparin  mg bid Despite this a ventilationperfusion        scan performed  d later showed multiple pulmonary emboli Figure         Currently the patient is on warfarin  mg daily while completing a mo warfarin        regimen Her warfarin is well tolerated and otherwise the patient is in good health                    DISCUSSION        Coxibs selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase COX increase the risk of        myocardial infarction and stroke  prompting concern for patients with established        cardiovascular disease Caution may also extend to individuals predisposed to thrombosis by        genetic or environmental factors        Risk factors for spontaneous thrombosis include oral contraceptives genetic        predisposition to a hypercoaguable state and prolonged periods of stasis  At least        two risk factors pertained to this patient        The patient had been taking oral contraceptives for  y prior to the index event albeit        without recognized thrombotic complication It is possible that despite this extended        period of apparent tolerance the embolic events were solely related to use of the oral        contraceptives         The relatively small risk of venous thromboembolism attributable to oral contraceptive        use may interact geometrically with the similarly small absolute risk of a procoagulant        mutation such as Factor V Leiden  However documented genetic risk factors such as        abnormalities in lupus anticoagulant antithrombin III proteins C and S plasma        homocysteine anticardiolipin  glycoprotein antibody and prothrombotic mutations in        Factor V and prothrombin were excluded It remains possible that the patient was        genetically predisposed to thrombosis by a mutation in an undetermined factor        Finally prolonged stasis such as that which occurred during the h car trip may        account for the clinical event  However the absolute risk is small and the patient        had made this trip on multiple occasions devoid of apparent clinical complications during        the prior  y        The risk of thrombosis from valdecoxib has now been established  and this        together with its propensity rarely to cause StevensJohnson syndrome without a mitigating        benefit over traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs has led to its withdrawal        from the market         The cardiovascular hazard of coxibs appears likely to be attributable        to the suppression of COXderived prostacyclin  Deletion of the prostacyclin        receptor in mice does not cause spontaneous thrombosis but rather enhances the response to        thrombotic stimuli  This is consistent with the fact that a cardiovascular signal from        a coxib is most easily detected in patients with hemostatic activation such as was        observed under placebocontrolled conditions in two trials in patients undergoing        cardiopulmonary bypass grafting  and anecdotally in patients with connective tissue        disease         Although this case does not establish a causative linkage with valdecoxib the clinical        event was not manifest until three potential risk factors were combined oral        contraceptives prolonged stasis and coxib treatment Given the multiplicative        interactions of risk factors for thromboembolic disease and the apparently untoward        concurrence of two of themthe contraceptive pill and frequent road trips for the preceding         ythe rapid occurrence of the clinical event following initiation of the coxib suggests a        causative link to the COX inhibitor However it also remains formally possible that this        temporal relationship was a coincidence        This case report has been reported to the regulatory authorities and to the manufacturer        of valdecoxib        Just as the small absolute risks of thrombosis attributable to oral contraceptives and        prothrombotic mutations may interact dramatically  selective inhibitors of COX may        also interact with genetic and environmental factors that predispose to the risk of        thrombosis
