                okay um what kind of hobbies do you have Lori   um i guess uh i like to play golf   uhhuh   and um  i also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts     uhhuh where do you play golf or in this area   well we live uh pretty close to the Mesquite Golf Course     uhhuh   so well play either out there or at Firewheel thats usually where we play but ive played you know different courses in in the Dallas area   do you uh do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf   uh both  not at the same time     i was gonna say that could be difficult   now sometimes we ride and sometimes um we pull we like to to a lot of times just walk for the exercise   uhhuh   but i find that when i ride in a cart i play better and i think its because i dont get as tired   i think that might be true   yeah   i dont like pulling a cart on Firewheel golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path   i know and that makes me so mad i you know its like its not gonna do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently     thats the reason i dont play over there   yeah   i like the course but i dont play over there because you they dont uh you know dont allow you to pull a cart   right   and i dont think a cart damages the turf   right well the reason why we play over there is because since were a Garland resident they give us a special deal where you can get um ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollar yeah a hundred dollars because its half price what the normal green fees are   uhhuh   so thats why we you know play over there because weve got our card   well i guess i could use a car too i live uh very near very close to the Firewheel Golf Course   oh do you so you live in Garland then     yes i live in northwest Garland right up there near the golf course   okay well were in south Garland but yeah next time you go um you know check into it theyve uh its just like uh a bus card and they just punch it you know its got one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you   well in the last two years i havent played very much golf because im involved in Boy Scouts   oh okay   so i have uh i have children i have children Boy Scout age i have two boys that are Boy Scout age and so   you must have a a son oh okay   im very active in Boy Scouts so id have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby   yeah oh well that sounds like fun too   but i like but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and its gonna probably be six to eight years before they go to college   uhhuh well you need to teach them how to play take them out on the course with you   so thats right lessons are expensive though   oh yeah well you can teach them   well they probably would never make it then because i dont think i only took lessons for golf when i was in college   uhhuh   ah as a course for P E you know  so i could graduate   right right uhhuh   but uh thats the only time i think ive ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual   uhhuh right right   i took one lesson one other time besides that um i just uh try to make the club hit the ball   right yeah i know what you mean   i dont wanna play strike out you know   uhhuh   but i have fun doing it some you know have some good shots and some bad shots   oh yeah its its just nice to get outdoors and do something   so you said you work uh in the gardens too do you have ah special flowers   well flower gardens i like to have matter fact this past weekend i i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs so those ought to be coming up around spring time   my wife had uh just put in a bunch of i wanna say theyre pansies   uhhuh   she put them in like two months ago because theyre winter plants   right   and they just bloom with all even with all the cold weather weather weve had theyve been blooming just fine   oh they do great i put mine in probably in November   thats when she did i think   yeah i think was November and i dont do anything to mine i dont water mine or anything and they just they do really good and i even had i guess it was last year the year before i had some out and it froze and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later i didnt do anything to them so theyre um theyre theyre good to plant in the winter time because they last for a long time then so if you start putting them you know you can put them out in the spring too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them because they cant stand the hot weather   umhum do they survive longer if you put them in the winter time will they make it through the summer some   no they wont make it through the summer because it gets too hot but theyd make it through probably winter and spring   umhum   so yeah ive got some of those too i love flowers   well oh thats good   yeah and i do some i try to do some arts and crafts and i love to go the to
