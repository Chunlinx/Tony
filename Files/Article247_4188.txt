                                 Bill Clinton Wants IYouI on Welfare            President Clinton ended the welfare program called Aid to Families withDependent Children AFDC in  Since then caseloads in the main federalwelfare program now known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families TANFhave fallen to less than half their previous levels Clinton reminds us of thisat every opportunity as well he should His major political achievement hasbeen cleansing the Democrats of their previous notunjustified image as theprodole party            So could Clinton now really be pushing people back onto the dole In a smallbut significant way the answer is yes The announcement was buried in thepresidents weekly radio address of Dec  After boasting Weve changed theculture of welfare from one that fostered dependence to one that honors andrewards work Clinton unveiled three new highperformance bonusesextramoney that will be used as a carrot to induce states to do certain things Onewill reward states that get more poor children into twoparent families Noproblem there One will reward states that enroll more poor children inMedicaid Good idea But a third will reward states that show the biggestimprovement in the percentage of low income families eligible for Food Stampswho get them            That one seems like a really bad idea            Why Clintons Department of Health and Human Services HHS which proposedthe regulations implementing the new foodstamp bonuses saysthey will promote the goal of ending the dependence of needy parents ongovernment benefits But wait a minute The proposed bonus tries to get statesto go out and sign more people up for government benefitsnamely foodstamps            And food stamps are a peculiar benefit in that if you have children youcan get them whether or not you work Indeed you can make no attempt to evenfind a job or support your family and youll still qualify for  a month infood stamps for a twoperson family or  for a threeperson family or for four In southern states this foodstamp benefit typically exceedsthe regular monthly TANF benefit Food stamps are also fungiblealthough thestamps can be used only to buy food they work just like cash You buy foodwith them as if they were cash they are traded informally as if they werecash            There is a word for cashlike benefits you can get whether you work or notThe word is welfare Pushing food stamps on poor people is unlikely to movepeople off of welfare because food stamps are welfare As a veteranliberal welfare expert told me upon hearing of the new bonus its perverseto say we want you to move people to selfsufficiency and then say we want youto sign them up for more welfare            Because food stamps are a form of welfare theylike AFDC and TANFbenefitshave traditionally been stigmatized even among those who areeligible to get them This stigma is the natural flip side of the work ethicIf you honor and support work in Clintons phrase then you are at leastslightly dishonored and ashamed to get a handout that goes to people who dontwork a lick Lowincome workers especially have been reluctant to sign up forthe benefits to which they are legally entitled As noted by HHS only percent of individuals with earnings who are eligible for food stamps benefitsparticipate in the Food Stamp Program compared to a participation rate of percent overall Some of those who dont claim their benefits may be lesspoorworkers whose small foodstamp allotment isnt worth the hassle of applyingBut many are undoubtedly people who are simply proud that they dont depend ona handout Its hard to deny that this pride is in some sense a goodthing            Clintons new plan in effect dismisses the foodstamp stigma as an archaicrelic This represents a small but telling victory for those DemocratsI callthem Money Liberalsfor whom getting cash to the poor not upholding the workethic is the most important thing Since the  reform their centralstrategypromoted most importantly by Wendell Primus and Robert Greensteinof the Center on Budget and Policy Prioritieshas been to destigmatize oldwelfare programs such as food stamps by repackaging them as work supportsthat can boost the incomes of the millions leaving welfare for lowpayingjobs            Sure enough Clinton declared food stamps critical supports and vowed tohold states accountable and make sure families get the benefits they need Toqualify for a bonus under his new regulations states would be required notjust to make it easy for families who leave welfare TANF to keep getting foodstamps but to actively encourage food stamp applications even if the TANFapplication halts In effect states would be saying Sign up Its good toget food stamps Stigma schmigma            Maybe Im overreacting but I think Clinton is courting disaster here Whilefood stamps might help support some welfare mothers during a transitionalperiod between TANF and pure selfsufficiency removing the foodstamp stigmarisks encouraging a far greater number to become dependent in the first placeSuppose youre a single mom working at the Gap Youre proud not to be onwelfare You dont even know where the welfare office is Then you hear apublicservice announcement of the sort the new HHS regulations encourage Ittells you that food stamps are respectable that youre a fool not to go downand claim what youre entitled to So you find out where the welfare office isand there you also learn that if you quit your job you can qualify for twoyears of TANF welfare If you go on TANF and then later go back to work at theGap you get to keep not only food stamps but a bit of your welfare check tooHmmm Sounds appealing            Or worse youre a young girl whos just graduated from high school Youvenever had a job Why not have a kid out of wedlock collect your  a monthin stamps live with your mom and worry about going to work later Food stampsare OK Theyre good The government says so            True the Clinton administration is trying to say that food stampsare really good only if youre also working at least parttime but thats kindof a complicated message to get across One deterrent to foodstamp useremember is the CheckoutLine Factorpeople tend to look at you funny whenyou whip out your foodstamp card to buy your groceries If food stamps aredestigmatized though nobody will look at you funnyeven if you really arentworking at all The sales pitch designed to support workers will also protectshirkers In practice how could the government hope to destigmatize foodstamps for the former group but not for the latter group who are under lawalso entitled to them            How did the welfare culture grow in the first place It happened in the lates when state and local officials embarked on a campaign to encouragewelfare and foodstamp useto remove stigma and boost participation ratesThe result A tripling of the welfare rolls This welfare explosion wasntundone until the  reform sent the opposite message Now Clinton risksreversing at least partially the actual practical process that brought himthe caseload declines hes crowing about today Will he be happy when the rollsfor food stamps and TANF start to rise again            The arguments the administration now makes about food stamps of course caneasily be made about basic welfareTANFtoo Cant it too provide acritical support for those whove just gone to work but dont earn enough tomake it all the way out of poverty Shouldnt we encourage those people to stayon welfare albeit at a lower benefit level rather than make a harsh cleanbreak Dont they need an ongoing TANF check to complete the transition toselfsufficiency as HHS puts it You say food stamps are different becausethey are nutritional Dont babies need clothes as well as food            In fact these arguments are already being made by Money Liberals around thecountry The next campaign once TANF and food stamps have been redefined asrespectable work supports will be to make those benefits more generous Butin a welfare program the same benefit levels apply to workers and nonworkersalike If benefits are raised it will be increasingly possible for at leastsome part of the population to piece together enough work supports to live onthe supports without the work Not to live well of course but theproblem of dependency has never been about people living well            Clinton seems to be ignoring one of the hardwon lessons of liberalismscollapse which is that programs to help poor workers should actually berestricted to workers These worktested programs make societys valuesie the work ethic unmistakably clear Not coincidentally theseprogramsincluding unemployment compensation Social Security and the EarnedIncome Tax Credit EITC all of which you have to work to gethave beenpolitically unassailable while welfare programs are either unpopular oractively despised And when a benefit is restricted to workers Congress canmake it more generous without the risk of creating a culture of dependency            If the administration wants to get more money to the working pooras itshouldwhy not do it through measures restricted to the working poor like anexpanded EITC and a higher minimum wage rather than through food stamps Untilthen if workingpoor people think they need food stamps and want to claimthem finethe states shouldnt make that difficult as some allegedly havedone But if a workingpoor American sees food stamps as an undignifiedhandout that judgment too deserves respect The government shouldnt make ita goal to push benefits onto people who think food stamps are welfare byanother name Theyre right after all                            If you read the fine print the bonus which amounts to  millionis to go to the states that show the greatest improvement in the percent oflowincome working families receiving food stamps Thatrestriction doesnt save the plan however The working poor are the group ofeligible recipients who are most likely to stigmatize the receipt of welfareThey are a key group we dont want to slip into dependence And removing thestigma for them is likely to remove it for everyone including the nonworkerswho remain eligible for food stamps                        To read the HHS regulations on the new food stamp bonus click here
