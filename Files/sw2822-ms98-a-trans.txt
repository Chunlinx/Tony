              okay   you know its uh im a CPA so i use computer quite a bit uh im not sure why they call them sometimes call them personal computers uh   i guess they mean just one thats in your home   yeah right well yeah actual i think they mean one thats that is uh designed or designated dedicated for one person to use primarily as opposed to uh large mainframe computer   uhhuh     which you know several people maybe use uh terminals tied to it i guess thats thats my definition anyway   okay i guess thats like the ones in TI   right um i have an IBM its uh one they call the XT which is one of the earlier models Prior to that i had uh one that was a Heath Kit computer which is one that i basically built myself   oh in your home   uh yeah and uh so ive had uh ive had a computer for uh oh about ten years little over ten years i guess now   oh uhhuh how do you know about building you own computer   well you uh Heath Kit which is uh you know one of these uh electronic stores its a hobby store place   uhhuh   and you can go there and buy a kit or at least you use to be able to im not sure that you can still buy those from them now but you could buy a kit and build a computer it like have a would have a manual stepbystep manual to go through and put all the parts together   was that a little less expensive   uh yeah it uh it then it was and of course the computer are so cheap now im not even sure how it would how it would compare uh     oh   back then the computer that i built was uh one you know was a old pretty low level technology wise and uh it cost me oh fifteen hundred dollars i guess to build it   huh   and it would have cost eighteen hundred or so to buy i think so it was you know it was not a great saving but it was a learning experience any way   oh seems like it would be more fun any way my husband gets a kick out of building stuff for his self rather than buying it   yeah yeah if uh if hes if hes aware of building you know building electronic stuff hes he knows about Heath Kit probably   no hes not into electronics im just saying per se he just likes to build stuff but uh   not into electronic right but uh you know i had to had to learn a little bit about uh using a solder iron and and that kind of stuff well i i say uh i said basically i built it myself when i got to a certain point i took it to a TI engineer that uh was a friend of my wifes and   uhhuh   he uh you know he worked with help me finished putting it together you know and make it work right it uh so you know if you dont know much electronics you can you know you have to have somebody with a little electronic background to make it work but uh you know the basic stuff i i did all the basics any way   somebody to help do you use your computer for home uh   no well i use mine at work i dont i dont even have one at the house any more its uh ive got it in my office and uh matter fact im market for another one   uhhuh is that for your house or for your office oh okay   no for my home you know so i mean for my for my office so im im not sure eventually ill have to ill probably have one at home too but uh   well couldnt you like um im pretty sure you can do this have it one in your home that has the same stuff in it as your office does or have it kind of connect it   oh yeah oh well you can have them connected by a by a modem if you want to which is a telephone line   uhhuh   but but you can can have the same software you know the same programs   just contains a   so that you take your data files from one to the other so that you can use same computer you know for the for the   okay right   a a different computers for the same project   right okay   so you know its and thats thats one thing that i would like to have uh occasionally i need to work at home you know and now i dont have a computer there so   you could just bring your disk home and do it   you know thats i could if i you know if i if i had a computer there so   yeah that was my problem in school i could not write programs   umhum   i loved messing with the computer though but i just could not   yeah   to a certain point id just get messed up and i would be totally lost   yeah so but uh you know its uh you know the computer its uh the you know growing thing in uh you know both home and business i i think eventually   yeah i want im wanting to go back to school and this time ill try a lot harder   yeah thats but eventually  i think uh most homes will have a computer you know for some reason uh either   uhhuh well a lot of them more or less close the computers the uh microwaves all have these new little buttons and   right yeah   just about every thing is getting computerized   yeah new cars have computer in them and   yeah have you seen that uh thing that shows the maps   uh no i havent seen that but i have heard about it but i havent seen it   i think thats neat   yeah but uh i dont know i guess the uh the personal computer is its really uh going to be a necessity that you know children should learn to use it i was just commenting i teach uh a couple accounting classes and uh i was just commenting the other night that its uh going to reach the point where um accounting classing in college have to have computer for the students to use you know in every class uh right now i teach over at Brookhaven College and theres only one class that i happen to teach that that teaches the accounting students anything about using the computer if they want to use want to learn the computer they have to take classes outside of the accounting area   uhhuh okay now a friend of mine is trying is going for CPA and she is having to take   uhhuh   or she maybe maybe its just a preference that shes taking it on herself but she is taking a computer class   yeah and uh but yeah its thats something thats going to be uh a necessity for accountants because you you know its you can do so much for more work with a computer then you can do you know doing it manually   yeah   and uh and a lot more accurately also i use the computer to do you know all of my accounting work and of course i write letters on the computer and i do income tax on the computer  so its i use it a lot   i do our income taxes too and youre right it probably would be a lot easier if i the use a computer   yeah you know its just it would be if you have a computer you can buy you know some little cheap software that uh that uh you can buy like at Software House here in Richard in uh Dallas at uh over in Addison   uhhuh   you can go over there and buy an income tax package that will run on a personal computer and do your income tax and its one of those where you can change things y ou know to see what happens you know you say well lets see ive got some many uh so much of my charitable contributions on my itemized deductions and then you discover that you had more then you thought you did you can go in and change it   uhhuh   and it changes everything on the return and you dont have to go back and you know change every line with you know the eraser or the   and redo everything   the uh liquid paper or whatever   right huh   so its its really convenient to have that plus you know youve got it on the computer and it does all the calculations and the math and you know makes for a lot of your errors on the return   yeah well  so far ive had been able to use the easy form   yeah so uhhuh   just me and my husband   right but uh   so now im wanting for my little boys birthday is coming up and i was thinking about getting him just one of those little i know i theyve got toy computers more or less just for kids who just starting and hell be four   uhhuh yeah   but ive seen it on uh like twenty twenty and stuff whatever where they do have little third graders and stuff working on   yeah they uh start are starting real early on the computers when he gets to school he will probably be using a computer   uhhuh   you know yeah second or third grade probably and uh   uhhuh   hell hell know more about computer then you will and youll be having to go back to school just too keep up with him           probably but i think thats the way it goes with most parents   yeah that seems to have to learn have to learn a little bit as they go along you you suddenly discover that your educated when the students are   uhhuh   a lot   well   go ahead   well its been a its been interesting taking uh about computers its uh thats one of my favorite subjects and uh i really i get into talking about them so   dont know much about them   yeah so   the main thing i didnt i dont even remember them having computers on uh that little sheet   um yeah yeah i dont remember i ive checked off a bunch of stuff you know on there i dont remember what all was on there but ive talked about two or three things that i wasnt you know wasnt expecting to talk about so   but uh uhhuh well its been pretty interesting so far   yeah yeah so its been been nice talking to you and uh i guess uh maybe theyll ring us up again sometime   yes all righty all right byebye   okay thanks byebye
