          well how about you are you an exercise fanatic   no im definitely  now i do like to walk   no me either do you   yes since TI has uh uh instituted that um uh walkabout i have gone out and started walking even more bought me the you know the proper proper shoes and everything to get started and uh park out there you know way out there in the boondocks   yeah wonderful uhhuh   and it was so funny the other day i took some guys to to lunch and when we came back they said oh theres a parking space real close and i parked way out in the boonies and i said you can walk off your lunch   way       thats the way to do it   yeah   im kind of like you ive never really gotten into it its just a its just a chore you know and i finally decided one semester im in college and im taking night classes and   um um   i still dont have any of my PE classes and so one semester i thought okay thats what im going to do and that will get me where ill have to do it you know   oh uhhuh   and they were offering a a walking class where you you know you have to walk you know that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes you get you get points you know and then you have to go in once a week and log your points so its not like you can do the class like anytime you want you know   um um um um   and at the end of the semester you go back in and your like your final exam is a three mile walk and if you walk it in this many minutes you get an A this many minutes you get a B   oh uhhuh   and i thought oh this will be an easy class and you know and i did it and i did it for a long time like about the middle of the semester i ended up having to have surgery on my foot and this has been a couple of years ago     well oh no uhhuh   and you know i had i did that and i just ended up having to drop the class you know by the time the final came around i wasnt even where i could wear a shoe yet let alone walk three miles you know   oh oh no yeah   but that was the only time i have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it   um um   because then i had to i had to go every week and log in what i had walked and my teacher looked at it every week and it was you know   right uhhuh   but other than that i just you know i kind of get in the mood every once in awhile say okay im going to start going to aerobics now you know and and ill go for like two weeks and go this is for the   uhhuh there you go     birds you know this is too much work   well you know i have noticed too that uh uh when i started the exercise uh not the exercise but the walking program uh that i did tone up you know like all over but it didnt get the upper part of my body and uh so   uhhuh uhhuh   what i do is i bowl i am a fanatic when it comes to bowling and i used to bowl five times a week so i really loved it and i still bowl at least once a week now on a league on on a and im bowling on the TI league   wow yeah uh uhhuh   um but ive noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor so that every time i get up to bowl i have to bend over to pick up my towel and that way i get the little extra exercise   uhhuh   im always explaining to people i do little things like that like you know take the stairs instead of the um the elevator and   yeah   and i do silly things like that versus a a regular program that you would have   but thats youre amazed at how much that adds up i was on uh Nutri Systems for a while and that is one of the things that they really stressed doing you know   it sure does uhhuh   when you come to your Nutri System meeting dont park in the parking place outside the front door park at the other end you know i mean and they stretched stressed things like that too you know during when youre sitting in sitting watching TV at night   yeah right uhhuh   during every commercial get up off the couch   there you go   go to the living room and get a glass of water go to the bedroom and make the bed go do something   uhhuh umhum umhum   but get up during every commercial and things like that and youd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up you know just gives you a little more activity so   uhhuh thats true thats true yeah   especially when youre like us and dont really want to do it anyway you know   humum no i used to i really did uh years ago and uh i was thinking about that not too long ago that   really   i used to walk and not only did i walk but i used to watch all those exercise programs on TV and i would tape them   yeah   and then i would do them like two times a day but i dont do any of that kind of stuff anymore i think having children everything just kind of everything goes by the wayside   well i cant use that as an excuse because i didnt do it before i had mine either so         ive never been i just im more into you know sitting than i am   yeah yeah me too   so but you know i have found that with i have a two year old and i have found really though im kind of the opposite im more active now with him than i was before   uhhuh yeah   because now you know hell i want to go outside and ill go outside with him and well walk up and down the street and well go to the park and ill run around with him and stuff like that that so im getting more you know more exercise that way than i ever did before i had him you know so   umhum umhum   i think i think that has helped a little bit i dont know   yeah yeah running   just chasing him around the house you know  will be plenty for you   oh yeah thats thats enough   well mine are older now doing uh their own things so   right right youve kind of gotten out of that little stage there     oh yes yes i have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old so yeah yes   oh lucky you youre getting into even more interesting stages hm   yeah yeah see were actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager   uhhuh yeah       yeah  same thing huh it repeats repeats   yeah you watch itll be exactly the same   the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen     it does it does it it absolutely does so   how interesting i can hardly wait   yeah i i i know i just know you cant but no i dont get as much exercise as i used to but i at least since TI has implemented that program i do im more aware of it     yeah   and you know that im need to do this that and the other and uh so i try to do combinations of things but not like go down to the Presidents Health Club like i see all these people do   right that that walkabouts a good program it really is you know when they first started it i i got all the information of course   it is it is   but just like everything else i was real gung ho with a friend of mine oh were going to do this were going to do this and we did do it for a long time   yeah   and then i started school you know and like two nights a week i was going to school and then the other two nights a week my husband worked so i had to pick Ryan up you know theres always an excuse you know to to not do it so   um um oh yeah oh yeah and it gets worse it doesnt get any better   yeah oh and im sure im sure     yeah because im constantly running my children around someplace and thats where i actually get my exercise   yeah   is running them from here to there in the car   here to there and here to yeah       yeah to the mall to the movies to the friends to the   there you go thats it thats it   sounds like fun well it was really good to talk to you     well it was nice talking to you yeah well okay well talk to you later um um byebye   take care okay bye bye
