            As Gerhard Schrder arrivedin London Monday for his first foreign trip as German chancellor Britain andFrance were vying for the affection of the new leader of Europes largest andmost powerful nation Sunday in Germanys Welt am Sonntag British Prime Minister Tony Blair claimed thathe wasnt in any way threatening the relationship between Germany and Francewhich has always been the cornerstone of the European Union but henevertheless made proposals that were in direct opposition to Frances statednational interests Calling for a more dynamic AngloGerman partnership totackle Europes problems Blair wrote that he and Schrder wanted to discussthe pace of enlarging Europe eastward how to reform and restore confidence infinancial institutions how to combat overregulation in Europe develop aEuropean defense identity reform the common agricultural policy and correctEuropean budget imbalances            Meanwhile Le Monde ofParis carried a frontpage article by Luc Rosenzweig lamenting Schrdersapparently excessive AngloSaxon leanings While welcoming the fact that hepaid his first postelection foreign visit but before he took over aschancellor to France the article noted that Schrders French wasnt anybetter than that of his predecessor Helmut Kohl An article titled TheDifficult Profession of Francophile said that in contrast to other countriesFrance

it goes without saying in Germany is hisconfidence that Mr Blair will soon come down firmly on the side of Britishentry into economic and monetary union The Times  which is stronglyagainst European monetary integration said that the new German governmentsprogramme is too heavily stamped with the trademarks of traditionaltaxandspend socialism to bear scrutiny as a modernising agenda  HerrSchroeder may have won over Germanys inherently conservative voters with histalk of a new centre but his election swings Europe firmly leftward Itadded Far from strengthening the case for British entry into the EuropeanMonetary Union it strongly reinforces the many good arguments for stayingout            In Israel the conservative Jerusalem Post expressed thehope Monday that the decision made at the Wye Plantation talks to establish astrategic planning committee between Israel and the United States mightstrengthen the American commitment to protect Israels security against itsMiddle East neighbors with nuclear capabilities But it said that if SaddamHusseins recent announcement that he is suspending US inspectionsentirelycoupled with new evidence that he lied about not arming warheads withthe chemical weapon VXis not enough to spur US action it is hard to imaginethat closer consultations with Israel will do so either            InLondon the conservative Daily Telegraph called for a tough line against Saddam Saying inan editorial Monday that Saddam means terror confrontationand war that he is bent on building Iraq into a dominant regional powerwith the assistance of weapons of mass destruction and that the authority ofthe United Nations would be in tatters if he is allowed to terminate Unscomoperations The paper said that giving money to the Iraqi resistance islittle more
