                                 We Are Pragmatic            Let us pause during theNew York Times yearlong celebration of its year march tojournalistic dominance to glance at the newspaper that may dominate the nextcentury of print journalism if there is one USA Today  a newspaperthat scarcely needs a Web site though of course it has one because itsfront is a home page in print            For allits obvious yearning for marketability and userfriendliness USA Todaybuilt its circulation without resorting to tabloid sensationalism From the lawcourts to the tennis courts it covers the news straightforwardly But whatdoes McPaper stand for What is the philosophy of USA Today             Largecirculation American newspapers to be sure dontmarket philosophy except sideways A major newspaper is supposed to be a teameffort a nonideological pursuit of the objective truth Asking for itsofficial philosophy is like demanding the creed of the Chicago Bulls Thelikeliest payoff is a slogan on the order of Get it Over With a newspaperGet it Out is about the best you can hope for But USA Today is thelengthened byline of one man former Gannett CEO Al Neuharthand theflamboyant South Dakotan spent years preaching the philosophy of his paperboth before and after its September  launch            Neuharth it turns out is a more important thcentury philosopher thananyone expected We Find Al Philosophical the inhouse headline mightread His struggle through the startup and red ink of USA Todaysucceeded in bending daily journalism to the principles of classical Americanpragmatism            For years media critics pounded USA Today  Anexplosion in a paint factory the flashdance of editing the junk food ofjournalism Asked early on if USA Today could qualify as a topnewspaper the Washington Post s Ben Bradlee replied If it can thenIm in the wrong business Post literary critic Jonathan Yardleycondemned USA Today for giving its readers only what they want Nospinach no bran no liver Critics cast Neuharth as the disreputable heir ofWilliam Randolph Hearst But try a different succession William James JohnDewey Al Neuharth            NoWilliam James didnt take off on Buscapades And John Dewey didnt festoonthe Columbia philosophy department with the white onyx and black marble ofUSA Today s Rosslyn Va headquarters But what after all were thebeliefs of the pragmatists those American heroes whose comeback in theintellectual world through presentday scions like Richard Rorty and DonaldDavidson now makes them founts of wisdom to philosophers around the worldJames urged us to think of true beliefs as those that point to successfulactions most of which result in the sense of pragmatisms coiner CharlesSander Peirce from a convergence of belief among our community of inquirersJames didnt mind if our beliefs occasionally took us a bit ahead of theevidence see his Will to Believe particularly if that passionateoptimistic confidence stirred us to make the world better than it is            Such sentiments are practically the anthem of USAToday  which brings together the USAs community of inquirers faster thanJerry Springer unites addled families Some may see a latent liberalism intodays sense in USA Today s editorial line its espousal of guncontrol or publicly financed elections to name to editorial positions taken bythe paper in recent weeks But the argument on these topics is no lesspractical in tone and substance than its more conservative recent stands infavor of public shaming as judicial punishment or its endorsement of huntingPolicies are to be preferred if in proven practice they save livesordollars On the contentious issue of gerrymandering racial or otherwise Thepractice is to be deplored not on grounds of high principle but because bycreating safe seats for one or another party or interest group it makeselections meaningless Moreover in pursuing racial fairness there arebetter alternatives available            James declared There canbe no difference anywhere that doesnt make a differenceelsewhere What paper better embodies that belief than USA Today  whichrecently ran a graph on Rain and Drizzle The Difference The difference isthe size of the drops with drizzle drops less than  inches in diameterfalling close together and rains drops larger than  inches in diameterwidely separated            As for Dewey he threw outthe false distinction between theoretical inquiry and practicaldecisionmaking proclaiming that all thinking amounts to problemsolving Forthe author of Experience and Nature and A Common Faith thesmartest way to educate people was to give them the information and skillsnecessary to solve their problemsnot to point them to an authority whod tellthem what to think or solve their problems for them Which would be the paperof choice for a man with such a mindset the New York Times or USAToday             Deweyhimself liked Peirces definition of truth as the opinion on which allinvestigators are fated to be agreed More than most papers USA Todaysteps aside and delivers the experience that Dewey considered necessary to thatconvergence on solutions statistics direct lengthy quotations complete boxscores Why it even runs pages entitled Solutions Trucks What Needs toBe Done Mindful of the fragility of truth and trustful of how a bettertruth might emerge from experimentation and debate Dewey thought we mightwell drop the whole concept of truth and speak more usefully of warrantedassertibility Does any editorial page so clearly reflect that belief asUSA

York Asrecalled by Peter Prichard in his book The Making of McPaper  Neuharthcondemned the old journalism of despair a derisive technique of leavingreaders discouraged or mad or indignant In its place Neuharth declaredUSA Today delivered a journalism of hopean enterprise one canimagine James franchising under his Will to Believe It offered reportagethat chronicles the good the bad and the otherwise
