            um what is your experience been with like do you have elderly relatives that live with you or have lived with your parents or something like that   no um my husband has a grandmother in a nursing home and that has been a real mess to say the least   uhhuh   but uh they keep seem to keep moving her in and out of different ones that they had just got done moving her uh into another one because the one she was in they gave her some medication she was definitely allergic to and almost killed her   oh gosh   and and and it was posted you know above her bed not to give her penicillin   and they gave gave it to her anyway   but but they gave it to her anyway and just she just about died   we had my grandfather had Alzheimers Alzheimers disease and  my grandmother kept him at home as long as she could   hm yeah   actually my parents and my uncle and aunt who tried to convince them to go into like an old age community where he could have gotten care   yeah   and she couldve had help with somebody cleaning and things like that and she refused she she just didnt want to do it she felt i i dont know maybe too much guilt or something   yeah yeah yeah i i i dont i dont feel he uh my husbands grandmother is that bad off and they they offered you know to get to hire you know an a roommate or uh or a part time nurse and she just wouldnt have it at all   uhhuh and so eventually they were forced to put her   they they were forced to put her in a nursing home   yes well my grandfather he eventually completely lost   yeah umhum   control type of things i i mean i dont know if he ever really got violent but they put him in a nursing home and actually the problem that they had with him was more with the hospital the the nursing home you know some day he had a fever or something so they sent him to a hospital which is what they think to routinely do which i think is ridiculous too   yeah yeah   you know because they might not be really be sick and at the hospital they um did an electrocardiogram   uhhuh   and decided that he had a heart problem and you know here he was   oh my   very old he had Alzheimers hed been like a vegetable for a year and the hospital said oh we have to put in a pacemaker and you know wanted to prove approval for it and all this sort of stuff and eventually   yeah oh oh boy   you know the whole family is in an uproar discussing it and some of the kids said well they yeah they should do it and others you know said its ridiculous this man whose body finally wants to die just let him die and um   oh yes   eventually the at the hospital they said no to the doctor and they found out it wasnt even his electrocardiogram that there was some other patient you know by the time hed been sent back to the nursing home and   yeah oh my gosh   under care there   it tears apart families it really it it it just the biggest fights   but oh   just it it its because of that i mean that that will divide you divide brothers and sisters quicker than anything its   its horrible sometimes you just cant keep the person at home theyre just  know   oh thats true but but the the nursing home situation is such a is such a pitiful situation i mean if you just if you go every time we go visit her its just its just gut wrenching to me   oh i felt went to visit my grandfather one time in the nursing home and i said never again i said i just cant go   i i cant i i i cant hardly handle it myself   uhhuh   and uh its its   but i had a cousin of mine that was in a different nursing home which was sort of nicer you know and until really close to the end she was able to go out and take walks and things and they took her outside and in some ways i think it might have even   umhum   been better or i i say say cousins like my grandmothers cousin  but i had been really close to her and in some ways i think for her might have even been better because she used to live in   uhhuh yeah   an area that when she moved down there was mostly elderly people  well not   oh really   you know it was like a community of apartments that were mostly elderly when she moved there she might have been like sixty it wasnt you know ancient but you know older and then that community for some reason started getting the apartments were fairly low income i guess   yeah yeah   and started being bought out by families and things and she started having fewer and fewer friends   uhhuh   and people just she she she she used to say to me when at when she was ninety two or something at the time say   oh my   um you know i just i all my friends have died off i have nothing to do im bored you know i walk over to the store i walk back someone comes and picks me up and brings me to the community and so when she went to a nursing home   yeah   in the beginning i think she kind of liked it she did art work there she did it was almost a progressive type nursing home   yeah well if youre not in real bad shape its its you know a retirement a retirement home is is is a good idea for somebody like that but uh if youve got a lot of health problems   uhhuh yeah then you just cant get better   it it its just its a mess its just a big huge mess because because my husbands grandmother has a lot of health problems   uhhuh   and uh and his like his other parents grandparents on his other side both were in a nursing home and his grandmother his other grandmother his dads mother finally went into a coma and she was in a coma for almost two years in a nursing before before she passed away and that that was awful   uhhuh well im sure   and and um   does the medical care in nursing homes is typically less than   pitiful it it its its   in but are they supposed to give as much     well well well what what they do is is theyre supposed to monitor them but they dont monitor them very well at all   home care you know   i mean that thats the problem uh his grandmother thats in it now she had a stroke and they didnt catch it for three days if you can imagine such a thing   jeez   so that so then that she that was when she got moved from the first one to the second one  where she was given penicillin   uhhuh of the second one   at the second one an d now shes at the third one  so its it it it its been a really bad situation but i have but thats all i hear about nursing homes is bad situations   oh gosh thats horrible had they checked into these nursing homes much before they put her in it or they just sort of i mean i its something thats hard to even get places in there youre lucky if you get a spot   well that yes that thats true but um theyre in a smaller small area and our and in fact theyre over up in Missouri and and and and what i would you would really consider a rural area and where theres like one nursing home per town   uhhuh no so you probably dont have too much choice   yes oh no no no theres there is not a whole lot of choice so theyve theyve moved through three different towns now   uhhuh   so um   but really its pitiful   it is and it the regulations i dont think the government the government regulations are the place i i dont think are are adequate either because they just dont the ones ive been in just dont arent real real clean uh you know they do they do a halfway decent job but i it seems like theyre theyre they tend to be kind of slack   often times ive gone into nursing homes where you know they have like a central area where they take the people to and all you do is to just sort of sit there like   leave them yes   you know almost like theyre mentally retarded patients or something and some of them you know theyre just sitting in the wheelchair and sleeping or whatever and its just its heart breaking you know and and i i feel like you know what have i moved into and and theyre   vegetables uhhum i know i know its   some of them i think just needs stimulation   yeah i mean its almost like a mental hospital atmosphere instead of a nursing home   yeah well ive never been to a mental hospital  but we   well me neither but but it just seems like thats what it would be like   right like you expect expect from the movies of mental hospitals   like uh  one time Rick went and uh i went i didnt go with him and his grandmother was sitting there and she said that man across the hall is naked and he was he was sitting in his wheelchair stark naked         oh gosh   he had hed got himself undressed and and he just he just like to sit in his wheelchair naked  thats not funny but it was funny at the time   yeah yeah but the the i mean the poor man too  he could get really cold he could   yeah yeah It was in the it was in the summer at at at at the time but you think they would pay more attention to what was going on that theyd see this guy had taken off his clothes   thats crazy but i think theyre under stress i mean i cant imagine working in a nursing home like that either because it must be so depressing   oh oh no oh i couldnt do it i just absolutely couldnt do it   but you know when i see them i dont know that i could  when i think of my parents who fortunately shouldnt be close to getting there yet but i dont  think of   i know   having to make the decision as to put them into a place like that or not   me too that that is what scares me to death having to be in a  in the position like that but you think you think there could be something better than that   horrible i guess i would try and have somebody at the house as long as they were healthy enough but sometimes theyre   yeah yeah   not i i dont know  where have the old days gone where people just sort of died of something in their family houses and theyre you know   yeah yeah     people are stabbed but its not this torture   yeah yeah ive been ive been real fortunate my familys never had anybody anybody anybody like in in in a nursing home but Ricks family my husbands family really has has has   uhhuh thats its its interesting because its my mothers parents well actually my fathers parents both of them sort of you know they just died of something um but the my grandmother my grandmothers case which is very sad she fell she came into New York to visit and she fell at the airport going down some steps and spent you know six months in the hospital but it is was still it it was it wasnt   yeah so yeah oh how awful oh   you know the same as a nursing home type of thing   right but still thats six months in a hospital   yeah no that was that that that was horrible it was  and she she never even got to see her family that she came in to visit   oh how aweful       they they never come to see they never came to see her   no they came to the hospital but i mean she came in   yeah but then she didnt get to go there oh i see   you you know she came in for a pleasurable visit and   oh how awful   fell and cracked cracked her skull open and that was sort of it but just terrible   oh oh how awful   but um my it was really just my grandfather i guess and this one elderly cousin of mine that went into nursing homes   yeah   but its just a scary thought every time i certainly dont want to be like that someday   science medical science has prolonged life but they have they havent really prolonged the quality of it that thats i think thats really the problem they can bring you back bring bring you out of death but they cant   yes
