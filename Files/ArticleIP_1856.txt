                                 Joe Eszterhas            No profession embraces thebrash and talentless more warmly than the movie industry and no one is betterevidence of this than Joe Eszterhas Eszterhas is Americas most famousorrather notoriousscreenwriter His career is dedicated to the principle thatthe yearold boy has something to say Eszterhas is the Shakespeare of theJerry Springer crowd the eminence greasy of Hollywood            Most filmtypes get the chance to create only one disastrous flop in a lifetime Afterlast week Eszterhas has two to his credit Eszterhas you may remember is thegenius behind Showgirls  The  lapdancing epic is arguably the worstmovie of the decade and inarguably the worst written movie of thedecade Eszterhas dialogue delivered by bimbos painted and injected to afaretheewell is an unintentionally hilarious parody of porn            Eszterhas latest movie a muchanticipated muchhypedHollywood satire called An Alan Smithee Film Burn Hollywood Burn openedand closedlast week The films conceit always a good word to usearound Eszterhas is that a director steals his own terrible movie to preventits release If only the same fate had befallen Burn Hollywood Burn Critics have called it bilious hamhanded a hapless display  ofgroundless vanity a wretched fiasco Even Eric Idle the moviesstar  dismissed the film as not funny Burn Hollywood Burn cost million and grossed approximately  nothing            Apart from his twomegafailures Eszterhas has devoted his career to the artful composition ofsmut and violence Since the mids Eszterhas has been churning out more orless identical genre pictures Jagged Edge  Betrayed Basic Instinct  Sliver  Jade  Basic plot Heroheroine falls for weirdo Many sweaty breastsand bloody corpses later the weirdo turns out to besurprisea ravinghomicidal nut job Eszterhas not only recycles plot he recycles dialogue Heeven recycles his sex obsessions Sliver and Basic Instinct bothdevote inordinate amounts of attention to the fact that Sharon Stone is notwearing any underwear Eszterhas sex fixation is legendary and comical Hisoriginal draft of One Night Stand  opened with a pagedescription of a marathon sex session            Eszterhasis not a hitmaker at least not anymore Several of his s movies includingFlashdance  and Jagged Edge  were moneymakers But his lastreal success was Basic Instinct back in  Since then hes writtensix flops in a row Hollywood isnt deterred Hes now being paid  millionto script a movie about Russian mobsters            This raises a question Why Eszterhas isprobably not the worst screenwriter in Hollywood Jagged Edge andBasic Instinct are quite fun But Eszterhas is an object lesson in theperils of the Brand Name Economy By tradition Hollywood screenwriters areanonymous Theyre supposed to be heard but not seen Actors and directors arestars writerslike composers cinematographers editorssettle for a creditline and a chubby paycheck There have been only a handful of famousscreenwriters all of them authors of magnificent movies Eszterhas essentiallyinvented the celebrity screenwriter Hes a run of the mill screenwriter whocreated a myth that he was an idiosyncratic rebel says EntertainmentWeekly critic Owen Gleiberman            Eszterhashas always been a masterful selfpromoter The child of Hungarian World War IIrefugees he started his career as a reporter for the Cleveland PlainDealer  He won fame by obtaining photographs of the My Lai massacre thencaught the eye of Rolling Stone with his bold crime stories Themagazine was in its days of high gonzo but even by that standard Eszterhasstood out At editorial meetings he would brandish a knife            Hollywood beckoned in the late s Eszterhas first moviewas FIST  a labor drama starring Sylvester Stallone WhenStallone took credit for the script Eszterhas challenged him to a fistfightIt was a sign of things to come Ever since he has used belligerence bravadoand a gift for charming the media to make himself a star WhenFlashdance s director suggested rewriting the lead character Eszterhasbullied him out of the idea He did the same thing when the studio tried tochange the ending of Jagged Edge  Both incidents burnished his image In Eszterhas made headlines by challenging superagent Michael Ovitz thenHollywoods most powerful man Ovitz had threatened to destroy Eszterhascareer if he switched to another agency Eszterhas leaked this to the presshumiliating Ovitz He twice brought attention to himself by storming off theset of Basic Instinct  Burn Hollywood Burn had its pressgettingEszterhas stunt too He dumped his director and edited the film himself            Eszterhasstill presents himself as a radical tough He has long hair and amotorcyclegang beardthe sort of hair that looks bad enough at age  andpositively absurd at  He has been known to bring a wooden stick intomeetings then smash it on the table when hes angry He has turned his privatelife into fodder for his myth In  when Sharon Stone took up with aproducer named Bill McDonald McDonalds wife Naomi Baka took refuge withEszterhas and his wife of  years Eszterhas promptly left his wife and theirtwo kids for Baka Then according to press reports he signed a contract withVanity Fair to tell all about the sordid affair No piece ever ran            Eszterhas posturing worked He became thecelebrity hed always hoped to bebrash appealing larger than lifeMoviegoers knew his name and his legendary audacity Producers fell hard forthe schtick making him the most expensive writer in Hollywood He got million for Basic Instinct  then  million for a fourpageoutline  of Jade  then  million for One Night Stand  Andthanks to his bullheadedness he exerts more control over production thanalmost any other screenwriter Directors alter his scripts at their peril            There isa mysterious disconnect between Eszterhas selfimage and his work Eszterhasis a selfpromoter but not a cynic He honestly believes himself Hollywoodsbravest outsider and he has written passionately about the need forscreenwriters to stand up for artistic integrity He also honestly believes inhis scripts One of the most endearing qualities of Bmovie makers such asRoger Corman is their selfconsciousness their recognition that theyre makingcrass but fun junk Thats absent in Eszterhas Hes an Ed Wood for the sEszterhas is delusional in the sense that he believes that everything hetouches is serious says film critic and historian David Thomson In thepublicity leading up to the release of Showgirls  Eszterhas gaveinterview after interview about the importance of the movie of its deep moralmessage its serious purpose He even called itthis T  A sleazefestabout a Vegas strippera deeply religious experience            Eszterhas is reminiscent of Playboy s Hugh HefnerThey share the same exaggerated sense of importance the same pontificatinghumorlessness about their ridiculous jobs Hefner published pictures of nakedwomen and believed himself a radical Eszterhas writes movies about naked womenand believes himself an artist No surprise that Playboy s April issuepublishes a long interview with Eszterhas            Eszterhas career did nothave to be this way Hes capable of much more than he usually gives In he wrote The                Music Box  a movie about an American lawyer whodefends her Hungarian immigrant father when he is accused of Nazi war crimesIt is a beautiful sad little movie about betrayal It was glowingly reviewedBut the actors and the movie drew most of the publicity Eszterhas didnt            This is Eszterhas tragedyand the dark side of his celebrity When he writes sensationalist schlock hegets the attention he craves When he writes moving interesting drama hedoesnt So schlock it will be
