          all right uh i i would like to talk about just briefly  what happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context i think its uh refreshing to see the uh the support that the President got from the American people   yeah it we i i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh that uh seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like uh uh President Carter and his thing with the the hostage crisis and he always did it through rhetoric   right right   and this time President Bush did it through action and he he drove policy   umhum   by the course he took and almost forced public support or uh i mean he left almost no alternative   yes thats right   and and it was very interesting how he did it and uh i mean im im an Air Force officer so it uh it was interesting for me uh you know id certainly     really   uh i i mean i think its great that all the support i have uh friends of mine from the Air Force im im an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory but other engineers guys here on base this is a B fifty two base where i work so   right yeah   we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there and theyre getting a tremendous amount of support out of it     thats great um if if you remember the vote in the Congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close   yes it was   and if if my memory serves me right i believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it   yeah im i dont know the exact figure but i i would imagine that because of the   it it was   how close the the vote was im uh i mean almost certainly would have to be Just based on the sheer numbers of uh the disparity of  excuse me Democrats and Republicans in Congress hed think that it would have to have been   thats right   um and uh i i gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how theyre   yep   uh uh theyre in in a sad way for ninety two now in terms of the presidential election anyway   especially the ones that came out and said oh come on guys lets talk about this little while longer   but yeah yeah   i mean how many years are we going to wait and what what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time   right right i think that was all those factors played a part in you know uh the everyone was   no doubt   discussing whether we should uh wait longer but i i i know that theres a lot of reasons to wait longer but i think we were genuinely concerned about how their military capability and we uh i think we over estimated it but still we were really   i think so too   highly concerned about it and that we were worried that they were getting dug in and uh   well they were and in fact they were so well dug in that uh when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldnt get turned around in time   yeah right they couldnt yeah they couldnt yeah its true they Saddam thought he had the whole thing uh figured out to to which way we were coming and which what what our doctrine was that uh   well had had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor   thats right thats true thats interesting i think uh this political situation over there now is uh uh itll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the this opposition will uh uh today the Turks uh agreed to support the Kurds which is something theyve never done before and uh   hum interesting   and uh this and the Israelis uh and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are uh are cheering for Baker on his drive for to reconcile relations with the Israelis so its like   well Baker is is really not very much pro Israel   yeah i   and did you know John Sununu is uh half Arab   no uh i i think i did hear that at one time a long time ago because i used to live in uh Massachusetts but uh   yeah right in fact when he was Governor of New Hampshire i believe okay   yeah New Hampshire   i believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back   oh my gosh   and uh now he is a conservative but he is not a conservative that favors Israel and that that concerns me greatly   uh well i dont yeah id certainly uh support Israel in in their their policy that in defending themselves and in uh in their handling of their foreign policy i think i think the stand they have or or the way the command respect i i support that i think that is a a positive thing for them after um uh thousands of years they have to uh they had i think they in when they became became a country they more than or more or less decided they werent going to take it anymore and uh   well they didnt have much choice they could either fight or die   yeah exactly exactly and uh       um so gee i lost my train of thought here but uh um so okay so i cant say whether that that im pro Israel or anti Israel i mean id like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region and looks uh that the joining of forces for this uh uh Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing   it is a positive thing um however uh every time an organization such as the PLO says well well see if we can work with Israel then uh they get embarrassed some every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them   right   and so you you basically have       uh mutually exclusive interests either Israel is going to occupy the area or the Arabs are going to occupy the area and im just not sure that that theres going to be any easy permanent solution   yeah somebodys going to and i think thats the problem the P L O has is that when they whenever one group of them decides that theyre going to negotiate or theyre going to do something theyre going to try to make some peace but uh the end result is that they there so many factions of them and uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split they end up being becoming divisive themselves   exactly   uh i its interesting i im im looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months but uh thats   it is yeah i i commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks   yeah i know that that is almost i mean thats absolutely unprecedented that was an an incredible foreign policy   yep   coup on the part of the President and the State Departme nt and that i mean thats never happened before   exactly exactly no   and i dont know if it will e ver happen again but   may not well its been fun i enjoyed enjoyed talking with you   yeah okay uh i guess uh well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time   you never know   all right bye bye   bye bye
