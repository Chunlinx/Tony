                okay well some of the things i like to do are i like to knit i knit sometimes and i sew   umhum   and um i like to sew sometimes for my kids i i sew clothes for them every once in a while  and i make quilts so   umhum oh wow thats the next project that id like to learn to do i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery and im im beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch and was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt   after a while cross stitch i think i dont know i have to put it away and then i have to bring it back you know and and uh   it gets boring umhum umhum   i dont know why that is i dont know if its looking at the little things little things every time   well it just reaches a point where it doesnt seem to be very challenging i think   yeah that might be it that might and yet theres uh   but i do a a lot of it in the car we yeah we commute from  Plano to Dallas   oh do you oh   so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done and i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car   oh i bet yeah   i dont know that i could even think about quilting you have to have a pretty good frame dont you to do any kind of quilting work   yeah yeah   hm   um ive not really done any too much challenging um stuff i i can do it with a a needle and thread you know   umhum   but uh and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good but its very long   umhum   its very tedious if you dont have a whole group youre not finishing a quilt in a long time   oh i bet but its such a lost art   so uh so um i like to just mostly do the tie quilts thats so much easier   uhhuh yes   but uh the other ones are very pretty theyre uh we have a quilt on our bed thats uh instead of like yarn   umhum   they tied um ribbon into it   oh   and its real pretty thats real pretty   i bet theres so many things i wish i had learned to do with my mother she had crocheted a full bedspread its kind of a hobnail looking thing   oh wow   and when i look at it now shes been dead for a long time i think oh why didnt i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that arent in vogue right now that   uhhuh uhhuh   people just dont know how to do   now did you say you could knit   no umhum havent tried that either   oh well i was gonna say because   i wanna learn to crochet i   because if you could knit you could crochet its just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to   really   to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand   umhum   and then you just use your right hand with the hook   umhum   and thats not its really not too difficult you could learn that im sure and pick that up if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet its not too difficult   yeah yeah uhhuh its funny when you were talking about sewing i love to do anything by hand with a needle   yeah   but im totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine i never learned and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew   isnt that interesting i think thats really interesting   umhum   huh and yet you know i think about you know you said you do a lot of needlework and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns   umhum   that people do and i i just think that um thats one of one of the arts that i think are real pretty and a lot of people dont do that either   umhum   you know and so   well its hard to find the time i i wouldnt if i didnt have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down im doing something with the kids or   yeah yeah yeah   just not sitting down at all   yeah thats true you know and and i always think well i can do this while i watch TV or something you know   umhum   and um it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else and then it doesnt   well and im at the age where bifocers or trifocals would be necessary and so i find myself putting glasses on to   quite work or   to watch TV and then taking them off to do needlework and i get frustrated doing that so just give it up   yeah and you know i like to sketch i can i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that   ooh that does   and thats nice and everything but you know its funny i cant i cant draw it out of my own head kind of thing i wish i could and and yet i cant do you know like like uh craft uh on wood   umhum uhhuh   i cant do that painting thing and yet   yeah im the same way if i see something i can copy it but i certainly cant create i admire people that have that in their minds already   yeah me too me too i know a woman whos just wonderful at that and   umhum   and i look at it and you know you look at those things and you wish so badly that you could do them i guess if you wanted to you could take classes and learn i guess thats the only way i could do it   well sometimes even with that yeah i i think you have to have some
