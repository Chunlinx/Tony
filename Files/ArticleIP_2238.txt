                                 Fictional Journalism for Dummies                           Fictional Journalism for Dummies                        CNN and Time haveboth commissioned investigations into the question of whether they may havejointly put out a false story three weeks ago Its hard to know what there isto investigate The story reported and broadcast by CNN with a versionpublished in Time  contained two hot allegations that the United Statesused fatal nerve gas sarin on a village in Laos during the Vietnam War andthat the purpose was to kill a large number of American defectors Both werealmost instantly and pretty spectacularly discredited            As Cyrus Krohn of                  Slate                reported the day after Time s story appeared the storysmain cited source published a memoir  years ago that describes the Laos raidin detailbut mentions nothing about nerve gas or American defectors Thisformer soldier subsequently explained that he had blocked the memory until itsuddenly resurfaced during his interview with the reporter from CNN a littledetail both Time and CNN failed to note in their respective reportsOther alleged sources now claim to have specifically denied the allegationsMany other sources have come forward to say the story is false Variousimplausible elements of the story have been noted For example if Americansoldiers were exposed to fatal nerve gas why did none die            But youalmost dont have to go beyond the story itself to strongly suspect its falseThe signs of comic overreaching at the very least are right there In thesedays when making up stories is so fashionable among journalists many youngerreaders of                   Slate                may wish to try it themselves                  Slate               s Krohn of course is a trained professional equippedwith the advanced journalistic tools of cynicism suspicion and heartlessnessHe is equally adept as we all are in this profession though we dont like tobrag about it at making up stories and spotting those made up by others Evenamateurs though can learn how to make up a pretty convincing story in thecomfort of their own homes using nothing more than a mild sense of mischiefand a decent word processor We recommend Word  for Windows            Pending the results of all these investigations were notsaying the CNN report was fabricated But it is nevertheless a usefulillustration of a few techniques that need to be mastered by anyone wishing tofabricate a news story                           Bootstrap sourcing Near the top of the Time version the storysays that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs at the time Adm Thomas Moorerconfirmed the use of sarin in the Laotian operation Further downConfirming the use of sarin Moorer says the gas was by and large available And finally Concludes Moorer This is a much bigger operation than yourealize  Thus available is bootstrapped into used and used into usedin Laos while used in Laos in this particular operation sneaks through byimplication all buttressed by the empty assertion that thiswhatisbigger than you realize Moorers subsequent denial that he meant to endorsethe sarindefectors charge is not surprising though the factwhichCNN Time also failed to mentionthat he is  and not in top mentalcondition is suggestive                           Doublebootstrap sourcing sources of nothing The secretary of defense at thetime Melvin Laird is quoted as having no specific recollection of sarinbeing used but I do not dispute what Adm Moorer has to say on this matterIf he has no recollection of the matter he obviously is in no position todispute what anyone has to say about it His statement to that effect has noevidentiary value but it is cited as implicit confirmation Elsewhere an AirForce ratpack commandoan impressive but unexplained labelis quoted assaying I believed that these were American defectors No surprise that heturns out to have been far away and says he was only speculating                           Heavyhanded seasoning with overheated quotes This is a useful way todistract the readers attention from gaps in logic and evidence just as curryand spices were once used to make bad meat palatable I just went oh manand knew we were in for some really deep s Or It was a hairy situationfrom the time we got there As a bonus those quoted seem to be endorsing thethesis though that doesnt logically follow and several of those quoted havesubsequently denied it                           Pointless detail  There were more defectors than people realizesays an SOG veteran at Fort Bragg  SOG is the acronym for the group thatconducted the raid in question But how does an unnamed person whosequalifications to opine on the subject are not offered gain added credibilityby being at Fort Bragg three decades after the event in question                           Selfcontradiction fuzzy verb forms anonymous quotes No definitivenumber of Americans who went over to the enemy is available but Moorerindicated there were scores Another SOG veteran put the number at close to The Pentagon told Newsstand CNN  Time that there were onlytwo known military defectors during the Vietnam war                            In other wordsthere is a definitive number according to the Pentagon That number istwo Or two known defectors Does the Pentagon believe there are unknowndefectors We are not told But apparently no definitive number  isavailable only in the sense that the article doesnt accept the number that isavailablethus using its own doubts to lend validity to themselves                            Mooreindicated How By sign language Charades Semaphore Indicated is a wayof implying he said it while indicating he must not have actually said it Asit seems he didnt                            Another SOGveteran makes the highest bid of close to  Why would a veteran of thisone unit have any basis for knowing the total number of defectors in the entireVietnam war Who is he and why does he need to be anonymous Never mind Hesa veteran isnt he            Usingthese eight simple techniques you can fabricate a news story in the
