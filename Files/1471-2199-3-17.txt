                    Background        Group II introns are catalytic RNAs that are also mobile        genetic elements Although their primary sequences vary        considerably the intron RNAs fold into wellconserved        structures Figure  The generalized group II intron        secondary structure consists of six helical domains        emerging from a central wheel      Some group II        introns are capable of selfsplicing however for efficient        splicing         in vivo  the intronencoded ORF or        hostencoded splicing factors are required     Mobile        group II introns encode a reverse transcriptasematurase        with the coding region generally located in domain IV        Group II introns were first identified in fungal        mitochondria and grouped on the basis of their secondary        structures       They have been found in organelle        genomes of fungi and plants and also in a number of        bacteria     None have been found in animals although        it has been suggested that group II introns may be        progenitors of nuclear spliceosomal introns based on        similarities between nuclear premRNA splicing in        eukaryotes and the splicing mechanism used by group II        introns             In the first step of splicing there is a nucleophilic        attack by the branchpoint residue on the nucleotide at        position  of the intron resulting in a lariat structure        with the intron remaining attached to the  exon The        second transesterification results in exon ligation with        the release of lariat RNA complexed with the intronencoded        protein This ribonucleoprotein RNP complex is an        endonuclease which can initiate reverse splicing into an        intronless target site in a process known as retrohoming            After the intron RNA reverse splices into one strand        of the doublestranded DNA the intronencoded protein        cleaves the other strand at position  or  downstream        of the intron insertion site and the generated  end of        the second strand is used as a primer for reverse        transcription of the inserted intron RNA Integration of        the resultant cDNA occurs via the hosts recombination or        repair mechanisms        At this point however it is not clear what the exact        structural requirements for retrohoming are or which        tertiary interactions are dispensable for the reaction        This mutational study is an effort to understand what        structural features of the intron RNA are important for        mobility and to utilize that information to construct a        minimal intron capable of retrohoming The development of a        core functional intron would be interesting not only from        an evolutionary perspective but would also facilitate        manipulation in the laboratory                    Results and Discussion                  Domain I          Domain I possesses numerous intra and interdomain          interactions by which it serves as a scaffold for intron          folding It associates with domain V to form the          catalytic core It is also important for recognition of          the  exon in           cis splicing reactions and for          targeting DNA or RNA in reverse splicing     Not          surprisingly deletions in subdomain structures          particularly Ic greatly diminish mobility In this          report the ratio of           amp           R           tet           R to           amp           R colonies of each mutant          normalized to the wildtype ratio was used as a measure          of mobility frequency It is important to note that for          mutants with a very low mobility   this ratio          may not reflect mobility frequency due to background           tet           R colonies and it was necessary to          verify intron insertion by PCR analysis          Only two deletions in domain I retained some mobility          domain Ib  and the  helix nts            The Ib deletion mutant had a mobility frequency of           which may indicate that the  tertiary element is not          absolutely essential for mobility This result is          interesting in that only the  deletion mutant is mobile          while both the  deletion and the  double deletion          are not This is in contrast to the results of splicing          assays with the group IIB introns aI and PlLSU          where it has been shown that the  interaction is          essential for splicing       This discrepancy          could reflect the fact that the mobility assay is more          sensitive and can detect greatly diminished levels of          splicing and mobility It is also possible that other          structural features of LlLtrB or its interaction with          LtrA protein help it properly orient important regions          flanking the  element          Based on an earlier secondary structure of the          Idiiii region the  helix included positions           Figure a A deletion of this subdomain resulted in a          frequency of  However when the structure was          redrawn based on comparative analysis Figure b              and the new helix containing the  interacting element          was deleted nts  the frequency dropped over          fold These results imply that the  interaction          itself may not be essential for the activity of the          intron but the overall structure of this region is          critical This is further indicated by the deletion of          the helix just above it nts  for which          no mobility was detected The finding that  is not          essential is similar to a finding by Costa           et al   for the PlLSU          intron in which a deletion of the entire IDiia stem          loop containing the  element was still capable of          splicing     Additionally this element is absent          from the introns           Spcox I           Pacox I           Amcox I and           Pacox I along with Idii              The loss of the interaction might also be          compensated for by the intronencoded protein This is          supported by a strong protein enhanced crosslink between          U near  in domain I and C near  in domain V          Noah and Lambowitz unpublished data          None of the other  subdomain deletions in domain I          were mobile Even the double deletion mutants  and           which presumably affect local folding and hence          could be less deleterious overall did not restore          mobility The observed homing frequencies in the range of              are close to the background level of          appearance of           tet           R colonies            Surprisingly neither the single nor the double          deletions involved in the  interaction are mobile          This interaction is not well conserved and is missing          from some introns classified into the following          structural categories bacterial classes B Blike          intron structure C novel hybrid and D unusual          Blike     However this region may be involved in          protein interactions based on strong protein protections          observed in this region     Strong protein          protections are also observed in the Id terminal          purinerich loop In fact it is these two sites in DI          which exhibit the strongest LtrA protections                              Domain II          From the mobility analysis it is clear that deletions          in subdomains IIa and IIb are mobile to some extent          while a complete deletion of domain II is not functional           of the colonies picked from both deletions were true          homing events  This is consistent with previous          reports where Bachl and Schmelzer     showed          that a partial truncation of DII leaving a short hairpin          in the intron bI had no pronounced effect on splicing          efficiency whereas a complete deletion eliminated the          reaction This was also demonstrated in aI     The          IIiiab deletion of nucleotides  was mobile to a          small extent frequency  This region includes the           interacting element indicating that it may not be          essential for mobility          The  interaction has been primarily observed to          mediate a conformational change between the two steps of          splicing     It is also missing from some          mitochondrial class A and bacterial classes B C and D          intron structural groups which may indicate that it is          not absolutely essential for splicing                          Domain III          Many reports indicate that domain III is absolutely          required for splicing           in vivo and           in vitro  Although its exact          function is unknown it has been speculated to be          involved in the formation of the catalytic core              Besides this it was shown for the group IIB intron aI          that the phylogenetically conserved basal stem loop          contains one of the most internalized regions of the          molecule     Here it was found that neither deletion          in domain III could be tolerated Frequencies were at the          background level in both cases  to   and          no bona fide homing events were found                          Domain IV          Domain IV is the most variable domain and has not been          shown to have a large effect on either splicing or          mobility In fact the mobility frequency of the DIVb          deletion is almost  of the wildtype intron which is          the highest mobility observed for any deletion in this          report In this case  colonies tested were true          homing events          Surprisingly the deletion of DIVa which is the          primary binding site for LtrA exhibited a low level of          mobility     although the number of true homing          events was only    This is likely due to residual          binding whereby LtrA recognizes other features of the          intron to promote splicing and mobility       Cui          and Lambowitz in preparation                          Domain V          It had previously been reported that the invariant G          at position  of the catalytic AGC triad in domain V was          critical for self splicing           in vitro and           in vivo  Here point mutants of          this residue were made Although the mobility frequency               was greatly diminished GA was the          least affected presumably reflecting a requirement for a          purine andor base pair at that position whereas GC and          GU had frequencies almost fold lower Interestingly          it was observed upon sequencing the isolated homing          products that GC and GU were revertants back to G the          wildtype nucleotide By contrast the GA colonies were          verified to involve integraton of the GA intron For the          GC and GU revertants the donor plasmids from these           tet           R colonies were also isolated and          sequenced to verify that they had the original          mutations          In a mutational analysis of the same triad in the aI          intron it was found that mutations at G were some of          the more deleterious ones in DV     Revertants that          restored base pairing were also identified Further the          GU mutant could not be rescued but the GA mutant could          suggesting that a purine is required at this position as          seen in LlLtrB                          Domain VI          A deletion mutant of the branchpoint A A along          with the other three substitution mutants AG AC and          AU were tested Interestingly the A mutant gave a          frequency of  but upon sequencing the homing          products no true A mutation was found Instead a          variety of sequence changes surrounding the branchpoint          A were observed in the homing products although the          original deletion mutation remained the same in the donor          plasmids Figure  It appears that this mutation can be          rescued by many kinds of secondary mutations as          indicated It was reported that group II introns could go          through a hydrolytic splicing pathway to generate a          linear intron even without a bulged nucleotide              Our findings suggest that if a linear intron is generated          by hydrolytic splicing of A it is unable to carry out          mobility Hence the branchpoint nucleotide is          absolutely required for mobility          Recently the crystal structure of a  nucleotide RNA          containing domains V and VI of the aI intron was          determined     Surprisingly it revealed  bulged          nucleotide residues in DVI instead of one In aI it is          the branchpoint A and the following  nucleotide which          is a U that are both bulged out This appears          inconsistent with the revertant sequences here which          show selection for a WatsonCrick base pair at the          position  but not  to the branchpoint          nucleotide          Support for the observations in this report comes from          work by Chu           et al      on the aI          intron in which they propose that a  bp stem  of the          branchpoint is one of the determinants for branchpoint          activation Additionally they state that a GU wobble          pair above the branchpoint is also a determinant which          fits in with the observation that a noncanonical pair          AA or AC is found at this position in some of the          revertants More recent support for this upstream weak or          non pairing with simultaneous downstream pairing was          observed in all lariat forming group II introns in barley          chloroplasts     Here  introns lacked          WatsonCrick pairing above the branchpoint A and GC was          the downstream base pair whenever there was an upstream          AC AG or GG Additionally no barley intron was          found in which the upstream WatsonCrick pair coincided          with a downstream GU or other weak pair          All three branchpoint substitution mutants tested          were mobile to differing extents with relatively high          frequencies    indicating that any base at          the branchpoint position can function in mobility           of these products were true homing events          Although it is specifically the N amino group of the          branchpoint A that is recognized many lines of evidence          suggest that the actual base at the branch site is not          required to be an A Naturally occurring introns have U           times followed by G  occurrences and C           occurrence Comparative RNA Web Site database          httpwwwrnaicmbutexasedu In aI G and U at the          branchpoint were found to allow for some branching to          occur     Also it was observed that even if the          branchpoint residue was paired it did not have a large          effect on splicing efficiency and no effect on the choice          of the branch site              C was also found in the branchpoint position in           A homing products From previous reports it was noted          that if the branchpoint nucleotide was changed to a C          branching was reduced      In this case it is          likely that the sensitivity of our assay permits the          detection of homing products Surprisingly AG which          demonstrated the highest mobility among these three          substitution mutants was not found in the A homing          products It remains elusive how the sequences were          changed at positions surrounding the branchpoint and why          only C along with wildtype A were selected at the          branchpoint despite the fact that AG was slightly          better than AC in mobility Table           Two additional combinations of mutants were made One          containing deletions DIVb DIIiiab and the           helix  that resulted in an intron that was           nts in size and a second one containing an additional          deletion of domain Ib which resulted in a reduction to           nts However both constructs exhibited no          mobility                            Conclusions        The largest deletions that preserved LlLtrB intron        mobility were the  nt deletion in domain DIVb and        the  nt deletion in domain IIb The smallest derivative        of the LlLtrB intron that retained mobility was  nts        resulting from the DIVb and DIIiiab deletions         The tertiary elements whose deletion does not        completely abolish mobility are alpha kappa and eta Only        the GA substitution mutant in the catalytic triad of DV        was mobile while the other two mutants were revertants        back to G In DVI a branchpoint nucleotide was found to        be essential for mobility It was also observed that any        nucleotide at this position supported mobility to some        extent                    Methods                  Bacterial strains                    E coli HMS DE Novagen          Madison WI was used for the genetic mobility assay The          cloning strain was           E coli DH                          Construction of mutants          Intron deletions were made by overlapping PCR and          cloned into the donor plasmid pACD see    for          details This plasmid carries a ORFORF version of the          intron that contains the T promoter in DIV from which          the tetracycline resistance            tet           R gene is expressed after homing          takes place LtrA is also expressed from the donor          plasmid but at a downstream location outside the          intron In this study the donor plasmid has been further          modified to contain a  nucleotide deletion in          DIVb It must be noted here that part of the DIVb          helix substructure is maintained by the insertion of the          T promoter          Domain I deletions that were upstream of the           Bsr GI site intron position           were cloned using the           Hin dIII and           Bsr GI sites on the donor plasmid          Deletions downstream of the           Bsr GI site and the point mutants          were cloned using the           Bsr GI and           Pst I sites All mutants were          verified by sequencing                          Mobility assay          The genetic mobility assay was performed essentially          as described in Guo           et al   Figure               In brief the donor plasmids carrying the mutant or          wildtype introns were each cotransformed with a          recipient plasmid pBRR carrying a promoterless           tet           R gene downstream of the target          site which are the ligated exons positions           After IPTG induction  M  hour C and plating          on ampicillin  gml  tetracycline  gml          plates mobility events were identified as           amp           R           tet           R colonies It is important to note          that both the intron RNA and LtrA protein are          overproduced in this assay which might mask more subtle          effects of these mutations          At least  colonies were picked from each of the          selection plates and tested by PCR to confirm true homing          events The PCR primers used were Rsense recipient          plasmid primer ACAAATAGGGGTTCCGCGCACA and LtrBAs          intron primer TTCTCCTACAGATTGTACAAATGTGG In the          case of deletions Idi and Id the intron primer used          was LtrBAs GATTCTCGGCATCGCTTTCG          All positive homing products were isolated and          sequenced to verify the deletion In the case of DV and          DVI revertants donor plasmids from the PCR positive          homing events were also isolated and sequenced to verify          the mutation True homing events were identified based on          all of these three tests  selection on plates containing          ampicillin and tetracycline followed by PCR verification          and sequencing                            Note        This version of
