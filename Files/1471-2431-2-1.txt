                    Background        Extensive bone marrow infiltration with cancer cells and        anticancer therapy lead to immune incompetence in children        with cancer      Since the prognosis and overall        survival of children with cancer have dramatically improved        during past  years     problems remain related to        infections mainly during leukopenic periods              Causal pathogens of febrile neutropenia FN most        frequently bacterial or fungal are identified and        confirmed by culture in  of the cases      In        other  of patients with FN bacterial or fungal        pathogens are suspected clinically The remaining  of        cases are classified as a fever of unknown origin FUO and        may be caused by other pathogens namely viruses that are        more difficult to detect by conventional diagnostic methods                     Lymphotropic herpesviruses LH EpsteinBarr virus        EBV cytomegalovirus CMV and human herpesvirus        HHV establish a lifelong persistent infection in a        great majority of humans They usually produce inaparent        infection or transient immune compromise in otherwise        healthy hosts but are able to cause lifethreatening        primary or reactivated infections in individuals with        congenital or acquired Tcell immunodeficiencies                    The spectrum of diseases caused by        lymphotropic herpesviruses is well documented in patients        undergoing bone marrow transplantation BMT              or organ transplantation     and in individuals        infected with human immunodeficiency virus HIV             In patients undergoing conventional anticancer therapy        without BMT the data focusing on EBV CMV or HHV        infection are scarcely documented and mostly reported as        individual cases        With combined diagnostic        approach of serology and viral DNA detection we performed a        prospective study of children undergoing nonBMT therapy        for cancer to demostrate the incidence of LH        infections                    Methods                  Patients and controls          Two hundred and nine

patients during anticancer treatment The results          are shown in Figure  Primary infection with EBV and CMV          occurs in almost  of children less than  years of          age Primary HHV infection is less frequent In older          children EBV and HHV reactivation also occurs We were          able to distinguish primary infection from reactivation          in all cases of symptomatic EBV infection based on EBNA          IgG status In case of CMV and HHV there were  and           cases respectively where it was impossible to          distinguish that In addition two of that cases showed          CMV and HHV crossreactivity                          Analysis of LH DNA and comparison with LH          serology          We examined  blood samples from  patients Sixty          four healthy individuals served as controls Seventeen             and   patients were PCR EBV CMV          and HHV respectively  to  positive In          comparison     and   healthy controls          were PCR EBV CMV and HHV respectively  positive          none was  or  positive All cases of PCR  or           positive results obtained from   and           patients with EBV CMV and HHV active symptomatic          infection respectively corresponded with serological          findings of recent infection occurring  weeks          following the first PCR positive result In case of PCR          EBV CMV and HHV  positive result the serology          finding of recent infection corresponded in   and           patients respectively Four and  patients were PCR          CMV and HHV  positive respectively but lacking          serological evidence of recent infection Since they had          symptomatic infection we considered them being infected          with a particular virus and all of them showed          serological evidence of previous infection in          posttreatment samples Besides that there were           patients PCR EBV negative who demonstrated recent          infection by serology One patient had coinfection of EBV          and HHV during anticancer treatment detected by PCR          EBV  positive HHV  with serological evidence          of primary EBV infection and reactivation of HHV          Data summarized in Table provide the information          about the differences in diagnosis of EBV and CMV          infection By combination of serology and DNA analysis          we were able to detect symptomatic infection more          frequently in comparison to serology only p   for          EBV p   for CMV As expected the rates of          laboratory infection defined as the sum of the cases          with symptomatic infection and positive seroconversion          for each virus were not significantly different in these          two groups Laboratory EBV and CMV infection was present          in   and   of  patients          respectively Laboratory HHV infection was present in            of  patients                          The influence of blood products on LH          infection          One hundred fifty six children  were given at          least one blood product transfusion during treatment          Fifty four  and   children out of           transfused children were infected with EBV and CMV          respectively Eleven  and   children out          of  nontransfused children were infected with EBV and          CMV respectively In addition eighteen  out of           children transfused in the period from  through           were infected with HHV while   children          out of  nontransfused children were infected with          HHV There was no statistically significant difference          in the incidence of EBV p   CMV p   or          HHV p   infection in between transfused and          nontransfused patients                            Discussion        Frequent infection with herpesviruses has long been        recognized in patients undergoing allogeneic        transplantation     and in patients with acute leukemia             In patients with acute leukemia it has been        reported that as many as two thirds of seropositive        patients can develop reactivation of herpes simplex virus        infection during remission induction therapy     The        risk of CMV infection in acute leukemia patients was        recognized almost  years ago    but is of particular        concern in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation             EBV infection is frequently associated with        posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders in T        celldepleted grafts     As recently reported HHV        can also be associated with bone marrow supression            encephalitis and pneumonitis     after allogeneic        transplantation        Whether symptomatic LH infection occurs in chemotherapy        andor radiotherapytreated cancer patients has not been        reported This report demonstrates for the first time that        LH infection affects more than one third of children        treated for cancer EBV and CMV infection occurred in        almost  of children younger then  years during        anticancer treatment At the time of cancer diagnosis the        rate of EBV and CMV seropositivity was not different in        cancer patients and healthy controls On the other hand        children in all age groups reached similar EBV and CMV        seropositivity levels after anticancer treatment comparing        to healthy adult controls It suggests that children        immunosupressed by chemotherapy andor radiotherapy have        high incidence of LH infection As expected primary        infection was the most frequent in younger patients and        reactivation occurred in older patients In case of HHV        infection which affects most of humans by the age of         years we were surprised with low frequency of IgG        antibodies in pretreatment samples as compared with        agematched healthy controls There might be at least two        possible mechanisms involved First due to either lower        sensitivity to detect HHV IgG antibodies by IFA or due to        immune supression at the time of cancer diagnosis but        similar pattern was not seen for EBV or CMV Second due to        the possibility that prior infection with HHV might be        directly or indirectly protective against tumor        development This finding would be in agreement with        Greaves hypothesis     which predicted an increased        risk of Bcell precursor ALL for those of higher        socioeconomic level firstborn children and those with        delayed or diminished exposure to common infections in        infancy When we studied our patient population based on        cancer diagnosis the only statistically significant        difference between pre and posttreatment samples was        noticed in patients with leukemia p   but not in        patients with lymphoma or solid cancer Figure  To our        knowledge there are no other data in the literature        describing a protective effect of HHV infection in        infancy against leukemia Further studies would be needed        to test this association        As previously demonstrated the risk of        transfusionacquired CMV infection can be significantly        reduced by the use of CMVseronegative or filtered white        blood cell reduced blood products     In an effort to        illustrate the role of leukodepleted blood transfusions in        transmission of LH infection in pediatric oncology patients        we studied both populations a population of patients        treated with leukodepleted irradiated blood products and a        population of patients that did not required any blood        transfusion during anticancer treatment No statistically        significant difference for each LH virus was found in these        two groups Those data are in accordance with recently        published prospective study by Preiksaikis et al           where the risk of transfusionacquired CMV infection was        estimated to be less than  in  donor exposures in        children with cancer        In the literature describing LH detection by PCR the        results vary widely since different protocols have been        used in different biological materials                PCR method was used in patients undergoing BMT or organ        transplants but not in chemotherapyonly andor        radiotherapyonly treated patients To our knowledge this        report demonstrates for the first time a correlation of        serological results with viral load detected by PCR in        children with different types of cancer By using healthy        controls and setting the threshold of PCR positive versus        negative based on correlation with clinical symptoms and        serology acute LH infection could be identified in most of        the cases The highest incidence of LH infection occurred        among patients with leukemia It probably corresponds with        the length of neutropenia and severity of immunosupression        that is greater in patients treated for leukemia compared        to patients with lymphoma or solid tumor                    Conclusion        This paper demonstrates that EBV CMV and HHV        infection is frequent in children treated for cancer is        not transfusiondependant and is often associated with        clinical symptoms Combination of serology and PCR method        in detection of symptomatic disease is superior to serology        alone Further studies are needed to identify patients at        higher risk of severe LH infection to prevent        diseaseassociated morbidity and to test the hypothesis        that HHV infection early in the infancy may be protective        against leukemia in
