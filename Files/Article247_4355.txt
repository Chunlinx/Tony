                                 My Son the Mobster                        Dear Judith            Lets get down to brass tacksI wouldnt call what I gave you abuttkicking That was no buttkicking I dont knowmaybe at                  Slate                that was a buttkicking            Second thingwhats wrong with Little Herring for a nickname No way Imcalling you Da Man on account of the fact that youre a woman that was youin that wedding dress a couple of months ago right            Little Herring is a great nickname It recalls the halcyon days of Jewishgangsterdom I know Im on record in                   Slate                in fact condemning the gauzyromantic view of Jewish gangsters perpetrated by certain awful writers But tobe fair Jewish gangsters had excellent nicknamesKid Twist Pittsburgh PhilLittle Farvel Abbaddaba Better nicknames than the Italians ever had            Look youre my friend Would you rather be Big Herring Whatever makesyou feel goodtheres an associate of the Gotti crew named Steven the JewKaplan no kidding Would you like to be Judith the Jew Shulevitz Im surewe could talk to Kaplan about letting you share the name            Now let me tell you where youre wrong oh how I love writing those wordsI didnt say that mobsters arent taking their cues from The Sopranos What I said was that no selfrespecting mobster would want to be a member ofTony Sopranos sadsack crew Until you produce for me an actual mobster whosays otherwise Ill stand by this statement Anyway news reports are simplystating that reallife mobsters caught on tape are griping that the writers ofThe Sopranos are stealing their life stories in other words theyaccuse the writers of taking their cues from the mob not vice versa            Now about you and your Culturebox Listen TV criticism is fine I have noproblem with TV criticism Some of my best friends are TV critics You evenemployed me once as a TV critic talk about a mistake on your part All Imsaying is The Sopranos is being buried under a mudslide ofoverintellectualizing hype and its suffering for it            Which takes me right to the point where I actually agree with you onsomething            The first episode of the new Sopranos is a real drag flat sour andponderous I almost fell asleep watching it Tony just seems mean and crazyand a bit more bloated than usual dont you think And Livia Good GodEvil and not amusing at all It was a terrible mistake to keep her alive forthe second season apparently some of the writers wanted to kill her off buteverybody on the set loves Nancy Marchand so much they kept her alive andbitching Imagine how clean a break it would have been to open the secondseason at Livias funeral                                              modemT connectionDownload Windows Media Player                                                         The only thing I liked about the first episode is Steven Van Zandt as SilvioDante imitating Michael and Kay Corleone Alright Van Zandt is one ofmy heroes and I think his portrayal of a lowwattage Soprano soldier is a ripso Im prejudiced but there was a kind of joy in that one scene that ismissing from the rest of the episode            Oh by the way I think youre giving shortshrift to Christopher Tonysnephew and a wannabe mademan Yes hes an assholejunkie but in the capablehands of Michael Imperioli he is not only that He is a cursingbitchslapping metaphor for the entire decline of the mob Its all therehisterrible work ethic his drug use his obsession with the mob of the distantpast the mafia of his fantasies of course hes writing a screenplay and ofcourse he cant spell All thats missing is the steroids outofcontrolsteroid use by the mobs young guns is whats killing the mafia as much asanything else Christopher is precisely the sort of mobster who turnsgovernment witness at the thought of real jail time            I guess Im answering the What happens next question The mafia is overas we know it or think we know it Its losing its commandandcontrolstructure There will always be localized ItalianAmerican gangs but a widenetwork of criminals who have their hooks into organized labor and adhere to acode of silence Thats pretty much over You can blame Rudy Giuliani TheSopranos  biggest fan for that Of course writers like me are alwayssaying the mob is dead and were always too early But the main problems themob faces are only getting worse One is recruitment The old neighborhoods arebreaking up and its the old neighborhoods that produced the mob farm teamsAlso no selfrespecting mobster wants his son to follow in his footsteps Ihate to refer to my own work but an article I wrote in the New York TimesMagazine last year focused on this very subject John Gottis fatalflawas a mobster and as a fatherwas that he had his son follow him into thebusiness No halfwayintelligent mobster had any respect for him afterthat            My prediction Hollywood will be making mob movies long after the mob as weknow it is gone And thats when ItalianAmericans will really have somethingto bitch about by the way where do you stand on the The Sopranosisnt good for Italians question            OK enough for now Are we good Or are you still lining up someone fromyour crew to take a shot at me            Jeff
