                    Background        Nontypeable         Haemophilus influenzae is an        important human respiratory tract pathogen               The bacterium causes acute otitis media as established by        pure culture of the organism from middle ear fluid during        disease         In addition nontypeable         H influenzae has been implicated as        a cause of otitis media with effusion which refers to the        presence of fluid in the middle ear in the absence of acute        symptoms Acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion        represent an enormous health problem for children worldwide              A large amount of effort has been devoted to        understanding the pathogenesis of otitis media with a goal        toward developing ways to prevent the disease                     Many middle ear fluids from children with otitis media        with effusion are sterile by culture However assays using        the polymerase chain reaction PCR have demonstrated that        DNA of nontypeable         H influenzae is present in a        substantial proportion of these middle ear fluids                 Furthermore reverse transcriptase        PCRbased assays have shown the presence of bacterial mRNA        indicating that bacteria are present in a viable and        metabolically active but nonculturable state            These observations suggest that in otitis media with        effusion bacteria are in a physiological state which        differs from that of bacteria growing planktonically in a        free floating phase Some authors have proposed that in        otitis media with effusion nontypeable         H influenzae grow in the form of a        biofilm in the middle ear              A biofilm is a structured community of bacterial cells        enveloped in a selfproduced polymeric matrix and adherent        to an inert or living surface      It is estimated        that  of bacteria in nature are attached to a surface        in the form of a biofilm Over the past decade bacteria in        the form of biofilms have been recognized as important        causes of a variety of human infections including        infections of prosthetic devices endocarditis dental        caries pneumonia in cystic fibrosis prostatitis and        others         Biofilms are more resistant to        immune clearance mechanisms and to antibiotics compared to        planktonic bacteria      In order to develop        strategies to treat and prevent infections caused by        bacteria in biofilms including otitis media with effusion        it will be important to elucidate the characteristics of        bacterial pathogens as biofilms        In addition to being a common cause of otitis media        nontypeable         H influenzae colonizes the lower        respiratory tract of adults with chronic obstructive        pulmonary disease COPD and is an important cause of        exacerbations of the disease      An ongoing        prospective study of bacterial infection in COPD at the        Buffalo Veterans Affairs Medical Center has revealed        interesting features regarding the dynamics of colonization        in COPD While active turnover of new strains of        nontypeable         H influenzae occurs some strains        have the ability to persist for many months Monthly sputum        cultures reveal intermittent negative cultures in spite of        continuous colonization by the same isolate proven by        molecular typing indicating that the organism is present        in spite of negative cultures of sputum    and authors        unpublished observations These observations suggest that        nontypeable         H influenzae grows as a biofilm in        the respiratory tract of adults with COPD reminiscent of         Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its well        established propensity to grow as a biofilm while causing        infection in patients with cystic fibrosis            In view of these lines of evidence suggesting that        nontypeable         H influenzae grows as a biofilm        during human respiratory tract infection the goals of the        present study are to  Develop an assay to study biofilms        of nontypeable         H influenzae in vitro         Characterize the extent to which isolates from the middle        ear fluid of children with otitis media and from the sputum        of adults with COPD form biofilms  Begin to elucidate        the characteristics of the outer membrane antigens of        nontypeable         H influenzae during growth as a        biofilm and  Preliminarily assess the role of pili in        biofilm formation                    Results                  Biofilm formation by clinical isolates          Fifteen isolates recovered from the sputum of adults          with COPD and  isolates recovered from the middle ear          fluid of children with otitis media were studied for          biofilm formation Figure aand bshow that striking          differences were observed among strains with regard to          the ability to form biofilms Values depicted in the bar          graphs represent the mean of three independent          experiments performed in quadriplicate The error bars          represent the standard deviation Although some          variability in values was seen the level of biofilm          formation was highly consistent from experiment to          experiment Strains which formed good biofilms eg          strains PH PH PH PH PH and          PH from Figure b and strains which formed poor          biofims eg PH PH PH PH and PH          do so consistently Inspection of Figure reveals that          one cannot readily divide strains into those which form          biofilms and those which do not Rather a broad range of          ability to form biofilms was seen among these randomly          chosen  clinical isolates                          Conditions for biofilm formation          In an effort to identify growth conditions which might          result in increased biofilm formation eight strains          which showed a range of ability to form biofilms were          chosen for further study The strains included  isolates          from middle ear fluid     and           isolates from the sputum of adults with COPD PH          PH PH PH The following reagents were          added individually to aliquots of media  glucose           glucose  sucrose  sucrose  M NaCl  ethanol          A biofilm assay was performed and the results were          compared with biofilms in growth media for each of the          strains None of the added reagents caused an increase in          biofilm formation for any of the strains                          Biofilm growth curve          To characterize the kinetics of biofilm formation the          level of biofilm formation was measured at selected time          points over a  hour period for  strains Figure shows          that a gradual increase in biofilm is seen over          approximately  hours After approximately  hours          biofilm formation shows a leveling off and the optical          density remains relatively stable to  hours at an          optical density which is characteristic of each of the           strains                          Expression of outer membrane antigens during growth          as a biofilm          To preliminarily assess the expression of outer          membrane antigens by nontypeable           H influenzae during growth as          biofilms cell envelopes of strain PH grown as a          biofilm in a  well plate were purified Simultaneously          cell envelopes of strain PH grown on agar plates          were purified by the same method Figure is a Coomassie          blue stained gel of cell envelopes of strain PH          grown on agar medium compared to cell envelopes of the          same strain grown as a biofilm Differences are noted in          minor bands and differences in the intensity of bands are          noted The major bands appear similar in the two          preparations          To further assess the expression of epitopes on          selected individual outer membrane antigens purified          cell envelopes were assayed in immunoblot assays with          well characterized polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies          Polyclonal antibodies to a peptide corresponding to loop           of the outer membrane protein P     which is the          only known porin of nontypeable           H influenzae  revealed expression          of P in the bacteria grown as a biofilm and in          planktonically grown bacteria Figure  Similarly the          epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies to outer          membrane protein P an OMP Alike protein and P a          highly conserved protein in all strains of nontypeable           H influenzae  were expressed in          the outer membranes of cells grown as biofilms and cells          grown planktonically Figure           When bacteria were grown on agar plates using the same          media as for growth in biofilms brain heart infusion           hemin  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide the          expression of a lipooligosaccharide epitope was reduced          compared to the level of expression in biofilms Figure           This epitope appears to be expressed at similar          levels as in biofilms when the bacteria are grown on          chocolate agar and in brain heart infusion broth data          not shown Bacteria grow more slowly on the brain heart          infusion agar compared to chocolate agar The observation          that the expression of epitopes on outer membrane          proteins P P and P was similar in biofilms and agar          Figure  indicates that the alteration in expression of          the epitope on lipooligosaccharide is not explained by          slow growth but represents altered expression of          lipooligosacharide under different growth conditions                          Role of pili in biofilm formation          To assess the potential role of pili in biofilm          formation a variant of a strain of nontypeable           H influenzae which lacks          expression of pili was tested for biofilm formation along          with its isogenic parent strain Strain M lacks          expression of pili as indicated by absence of          hemagglutination and absence of a  kDa band on SDSPAGE          corresponding to pilin     In an experiment          comparing biofilm formation in  duplicate wells strain          M the pilus deficient variant yielded an average          optical density of  whereas its isogenic parent          strain M yielded an average optical density of           This experiment was repeated multiple times and the pilus          deficient variant showed a  to  fold decrease in          biofilm formation compared to its isogenic parent strain          in every experiment                            Discussion        Assays of  randomly chosen clinical isolates from the        middle ear of children with otitis media and from the        sputum of adults with COPD show that isolates of        nontypeable         H influenzae demonstrate striking        differences in their propensity to grow as biofilms in        vitro These differences are highly reproducible in that        individual isolates show similar levels of biofilm        formation on repeated experiments        The assay for biofilm formation used in this study is        based on the ability of bacteria to adhere to plastic wells        in microtiter plates This method has been used to study        biofilm formation by a variety of other grampositive and        gramnegative bacteria        The method has        both advantages and disadvantages compared to studying        biofilm formation in flow cells the other widely used        method The microtiter plate assay yields reproducible        results and is convenient allowing one to study large        numbers of strains and conditions Furthermore the method        yields quantitative results based on measuring the optical        density of wells An important potential limitation of the        microtiter plate method is that one might question whether        the method is capable of distinguishing true biofilm        formation from bacteria simply adhering to plastic wells        Two lines of evidence suggest that the method is measuring        biofilm formation First Watnick and Kolter    showed        by confocal laser microscopy that the morphology of        biofilms of         Vibrio cholerae grown on cover slips        in static culture is similar to the morphology of biofilms        grown in a flow cell And second with regard to this        study the protein patterns in SDS polyacrylamide gel        electrophoresis and expression of lipooligosaccharide        epitopes are different in bacteria recovered from biofilms        grown in micotiter wells compared to planktonic cells grown        in media These observations suggest that the assay is        detecting bacteria as biofilms rather than simply measuring        planktonic bacteria adhering to plastic wells However        more definitive answers regarding biofilm formation in        human infection caused by nontypeable         H influenzae awaits detailed studies        involving confocal laser microscopy of clinical samples        containing the organism        The importance of nontypeable         H influenzae as a human respiratory        tract pathogen has stimulated a large body of research to        elucidate the antigenic characteristics of the outer        membrane of the organism This work is important in        understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis characterizing        the human immune response to infection and guiding vaccine        development This large body of work has been performed        exclusively on bacteria grown planktonically In view of        the mounting evidence that nontypeable         H influenzae grows as a biofilm in        otitis media with effusion and in the respiratory tract of        adults with COPD it will be important to characterize the        bacterial surface antigens of the organism during growth as        a biofilm The present study used well characterized        polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to begin to address        this important question        P the major outer membrane protein in the outer        membrane is the only known porin protein of         H influenzae Immunoblot assays with        antiserum raised to a conserved surface exposed loop of P        showed that expression of P was similar in amount        molecular mass and immunoreactivity in bacteria grown        planktonically and as a biofilm This observation is in        contrast to expression of porin proteins of         Escherichia coli and         Pseudomonas aeruginosa whose        expression are altered during growth as a biofilm                    Similarly expression of outer membrane protein P an        OMP Alike protein and P a highly conserved  kDa        protein is preserved in cells grown as biofilms based on        immunoblot assays with monoclonal antibodies Figure         The expression of P and P in biofilms is especially        important since these proteins are under consideration as        vaccine antigens Finally alteration of expression of an        epitope on lipooligosaccharide suggests that the organism        expresses a different lipooligosaccharide molecule during        growth as a biofilm Similarly expression of        lipopolysaccharide of         Pseudomonas aeruginosa is altered        during growth as biofilms     These studies of outer        membrane antigen expression are limited by the sensitivity        of immunoblot assays While the assays establish that P        P and P and the epitopes recognized by the antibodies are        expressed in biofilms and that expression of        lipooligosaccharide is altered one must be cautious in        drawing firm conclusions regarding the level of expression        and the surface accessibility of the epitopes recognized by        the antibodies based on results of immunoblot assays alone        because they are not quantitative assays        An isogenic variant of nontypeable         H influenzae deficient in expression        in pili showed a marked reduction in the ability to grow as        a biofilm This observation parallels that made in several        other bacterial species showing the pili are critical in        the early stages of biofilm formation             This paper is the first report of formation of biofilms        by         H influenzae  Work on biofilm        formation by nontypeable         H influenzae should focus in several        areas It will be important to define more precisely the        extent to which the organism grows as biofilms during        colonization and infection of the human respiratory tract        The biofilm of many bacterial species is composed of        extracellular polysaccharide such as capsule             Since nontypeable         H influenzae does not express a        capsule it will be interesting to characterize the        composition of the biofilm As the role of biofilms in        human infection becomes better defined elucidating the        human immune response to antigens expressed during growth        as biofilms may be important in understanding host        responses and in devising strategies to prevent infection        by nontypeable         H influenzae                     Conclusions        Nontypeable         Haemophilus influenzae forms biofilms        in vitro Clinical isolates show substantial variability in        their ability to grow as biofilms Three major outer        membrane proteins P P and P are expressed during        growth as a biofilm Expression of an epitope on        lipooligosaccharide is altered during growth as a biofilm        Pili are important in biofilm formation As the role of        biofilms in human infection becomes better defined        characterization of biofilms may be important in        understanding the pathogenesis of infection and immune        response to nontypeable         H influenzae in children with otitis        media and adults with COPD                    Materials and methods                  Bacterial strains          A total of  isolates of nontypeable           H influenzae were studied Fifteen          were isolated from the sputum of  adults with COPD as          part of a prospective study being conducted at the          Buffalo Veterans Affairs Medical Center The isolates          recovered from the same patient were proven to be          distinct strains of nontypeable           H influenzae based on outer          membrane protein patterns      Fifteen isolates          were recovered from the middle ear fluids obtained by          tympanocentesis from children with otitis media Twelve          were from Buffalo New York  from Columbus Ohio           from Seattle Washington and  from Dallas Texas          Nontypeable           H influenzae strain M and an          isogenic variant designated M which is deficient in          expression of pili were kindly provided by Robert Munson                       Bacteria were grown on chocolate agar or in brain          heart infusion broth supplemented with hemin and          nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide both at  gml In          the experiments to compare cell envelopes of bacteria          grown planktonically with those grown as biofilms          bacteria were grown on brain heart infusion agar          supplemented as noted above Media was supplemented with          glucose sucrose NaCl and ethanol in selected          experiments as described in the Results                          Biofilm growth assay          The assay to grow and quantitate nontypeable           H influenzae biofilms was          essentially the same assay which has been used for          several other bacterial species        An          overnight broth culture was diluted  in fresh broth          and  l was inoculated into the wells of a  well          Linbro tissue culture plate ICN

incubated at room temperature for           minutes Wells were washed vigorously with distilled          water and the plate was air dried A volume of  l of           ethanol was added to each well

identically otherwise The OD            was standardized against these          wells                          Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel          electrophoresis SDS PAGE and immunoblot assays          Cell envelopes were subjected to SDS PAGE and          Coomassie blue staining using previously described          methods     Immunoblot assays were performed as          described previously     After incubating with the          antibodies blots were developed with the appropriate          murine or rabbit peroxidase conjugated secondary          antibody                          Purification of cell envelopes          To study the outer membrane of nontypeable           H influenzae  bacteria were grown          as a biofilm overnight in a  well Linbro tissue
