                    Background        Due to the current unavailability of antiHIV vaccines        other preventive methods have to be developed to control        the ongoing AIDS pandemic This includes the design and        application of safe and effective topical microbicides        Screening of pharmaceutical excipients revealed that        cellulose acetate phthalate CAP commonly used for        enteric coating of tablets and capsules     has        antiHIV activity CAP in micronized form and formulated        into a cream is a broad spectrum microbicide inactivating        several sexually transmitted disease STD pathogens              including HIV      It was of interest to        explore the mechanisms whereby CAP causes inactivation of        HIV Since CAP has a relatively high molecular weight M         w       its effect on HIV        virions would be expected to be confined to the virus        surface ie to the envelope glycoproteins gp andor        gp Thus CAP would be expected to affect one or more        steps required for HIV entry into cells ie binding to        cellular CD to the major HIV coreceptors CXCR or CCR        for X and R viruses     respectively and fusion with        cell membranes             Results        presented here show that CAP pretreated HIV has a reduced        capacity to bind to the coreceptors leading to impaired        virus

with          MT cells  cellswell and placed into well          polystyrene plates The mixtures were incubated for  h          at C and the volume was adjusted with RPMI medium          containing  FBS to  l On the  thand  thday          after incubation at C  l of culture supernatants          were removed from each well and equal volumes of fresh          medium were added On the  thday XTT

        instead of MT cells and virus production was measured          by ELISA for p antigen one week after infection The          percentage of residual infectivity after CAP treatment          was

IsopaqueFicoll          technique                              Quantitation of CAPgp binding          Forty g of gp were mixed with  g of CAP in  ml          TS or  M NaCI  M Tris pH  and incubated at C          for  min The mixtures were transferred into a          Centricon centrifugal ultrafiltration device with a M           w cutoff of  and centrifuged          at   g for  min The filtrates were transferred          to a similar device with a M           w cutoff of  and centrifuged          under the same conditions CAP retained on top of the          filter was quantitated as a complex with ruthenium red              The retentate on the  M           w cutoff filter was dissolved in  ml          of  M guanidinium hydrochloride and CAP released from          the CAPgp complex and retained on the  M           w cutoff filter was quantitated by          the same method                          Molecular Modeling          A cellulose chain consisting of one cellotetraose unit          composed of four linked Dglucose units was          created in Quanta    and  of the hydroxyl groups          at positions  and  were modified to acetyl ester and           of the hydroxyl groups at position  were modified to          phthaloyl ester      The acetylated and          phthaloylated cellotetraose structure CTAP was          minimized by the steepest descent method followed by the          adopted basis NewtonRaphson ABNR method The energy          change of  Kcalmol between two successive structures          was used as the termination criterion in both the          steps          The crystal structure of gp gcl    was          retrieved from the pdb  httpwwwrcsborg and the V          loop created by homology modeling based on the nmr          structure of the V loop from ce using the SWISSMODEL             automated comparative protein modeling server           httpwwwexpasychSWISSMODELhtml was attached to          the gp crystal structure using Quantas protein design          module          The docking simulation of CTAP onto the entire gp          protein surface was performed by the Dockvision program              A grid box         with grid          stepsize of   was created to cover the entire protein          surface with enough area for the ligand to dock The          default forcefield Research Potential Function was used          to perform  Monte Carlo runs for the docking Both          ligand and the target protein were kept rigid          Intermolecular energy criteria were used to identify the          best possible dockings of CTAP                            Results                  Impaired infectivity of CAP treated HIV          Results of earlier studies indicated that HIV          infection of cells is inhibited in the presence of CAP          ED              to  gml for HIV IIIB          ie   nM     However the mechanism involved          in the inhibitory activity and the possibility of virus          inactivation by CAP have not been explored Results shown          in Fig indicate that CAP in a dose dependent manner          rapidly inactivates at C HIV IIIB an X virus and          HIV BaL an R virus the latter appearing relatively          more resistant                          CAP retention on the surface of treated HIV          particles          Evidence for CAPHIV binding was obtained from          results of solid phase immunoassays in which attachment          of HIV IIIB and BaL virus particles respectively          detected by subsequent ELISA of p antigen released          from virus particles by detergent treatment to wells          precoated with CAP was measured Fig A CAP treated          HIV IIIB and BaL viruses unlike control viruses bound          to wells coated with antibodies against phthalate Fig          B These results indicate that treated HIV particles          utilizing either CXCR or CCR as coreceptors retain CAP          on their surface and suggest that this is responsible for          the altered properties and impaired infectivity of the          treated viruses                          Identification of CAP binding sites on HIV          envelope glycoproteins          The attachment sites on the surface of HIV IIIB for          CAP were determined from binding of control and CAP          treated HIV respectively to distinct ligands Fig           The quantities of control virus and treated virus in          these experiments were identical as determined from the          content of p antigen in preparations of          detergentdisrupted virus particles CAP binding to HIV          IIIB particles most profoundly affected their binding to          the V loop specific mAbs     and     and          to the coreceptor CXCR while binding to sCD to virus          neutralizing mAbs specific for the CD binding site on          gp b    and D     to mAb b specific          for a discontinuous conserved epitope proximal to the          binding site for both CD and antiCD binding site          antibodies     to mAb G specific for an epitope          centered around the CV domain of gp also involving          Nlinked glycans    and to the gp specific mAb F             was less affected In order to determine whether          R viruses are similarly affected by CAP the binding of          HIV BaL as a representative of this virus group to          antiV BaL and CCR respectively before and after CAP          treatment was studied The results shown in Fig          indicate that the CAPtreated HIV BaL bound to these          ligands much less than did untreated virus          The binding of control and CAPtreated HIV IIIB to          antibodies against peptides derived from gpgp             was also determined In agreement with the results          obtained using mAbs CAP treatment resulted in most          pronounced decreases of virus binding to antibodies          against peptide   V loop and the adjacent          peptide  Fig                           Pretreatment with CAP impairs gp binding to          coreceptors          Data reported so far suggest that the lethal hit to          HIV caused by CAP treatment involves the coreceptor          binding site on gp To further support this          conclusion the binding of labeled gpCD complexes to          coreceptor      expressing cells was studied          First it was determined from quantitative binding          studies using CAP staining with ruthenium red    that          pretreatment with CAP resulted in binding of             CAP moleculesgp in TS The binding appeared augmented          by   in  M NaCl The binding capacity of gp for          sCD was preserved after CAP treatment Fig  On the          other hand gpsCD complexes containing CAP treated          gp bound to coreceptor expressing cells to a much          lesser extent than similar complexes containing untreated          gp Fig                             Discussion        Negatively charged sulfated polymers were reported to        have antiHIV activity and are being considered for        development as topical microbicides They include dextran        sulfate      carrageenans             dextrinsulfate      cellulose sulfate    and        naphthalene sulfonate polymer PRO      Except        for dextrinsulfate and PRO  which appear to have        antiHIV inhibitory activities similar to that of CAP        the other sulfonated polymers are less inhibitory              HIV may develop resistance to the inhibitory        effect of dextran sulfate and R viruses were reported not        to be inhibited by this polymer      Dextran sulfate        was shown to bind to gp and to interfere with        gpCXCR interactions but it did not bind to gp of R        viruses            CAP in micronized form providing an acidic environment        causes disintegration of HIV leading to loss of        infectivity  Here we have shown that CAP directly        inactivates HIV at neutral pH since treated virus        particles after removal of excess CAP had reduced or no        infectivity Fig  in agreement with recent observations             Virus inactivation can be attributed to strong        binding of CAP to HIV preventing the access to virus        particles predominantly of antibodies against the gp V        loop known to be involved in coreceptor binding and        specificity         and to epitopes located        adjacent to the V loop Fig  Indeed CAP binding to        HIV resulted in blockade of sites involved in coreceptor        binding Fig  This was observed for both HIV IIIB an        X virus and HIV BaL an R virus In agreement with        this finding CAP inhibited infection by both X and R        viruses in         in vitro models for vaginal HIV        infection      Sites on the HIV envelope other        than the coreceptor binding domains may possibly be also        involved in interactions with CAP contributing to        inhibition of virus infection        Studies with gp allowed to determine the        stoichiometry of the reaction between gp and CAP        resulting in the observation that approximately one CAP        molecule binds to one molecule of gp Interestingly        CAPgp binding also occurs in M NaCl conditions under        which binding of sulfated polysaccharides to gp is        abolished     This suggests that electrostatic        interactions do not play an exclusive role in CAPgp        binding            Since CAP has an approximate M         w of    and its structure has not        been determined a model for CAP docking onto gp HXBc        was generated using a chemically modified cellotetraose        The entire gp surface was considered for docking        acetylated and phthaloylated cellotetraose CTAP except        the trimerization and CD binding sites on gp            The two optimally docked CTAP molecules were selected for        further analyses The first one marked as         Dock in Fig  docked near regions        corresponding to amino acid residues  indicated in        red and  indicated in purple The orientation of        CTAP revealed that if extended to generate the larger CAP        molecule blockade of the coreceptor binding site        indicated in gray in Fig     and the V loop        indicated in yellow in Fig  would result These docking        results agree with the observation that capture of CAP        treated HIV virions to antibodies against peptides from        these regions    was decreased        Fig  CTAP interacts primarily through several hydrogen        bonds with gp residues K N Q N and T        Though there were no hydrophobic or electrostatic        interactions discernable such interactions cannot be ruled        out as CTAP represents only a small part of the CAP        molecule The second best docking positioned CTAP near the        V loop marked as         Dock in Fig  CTAP in this        position interacts with gp through both hydrogen bonding        residues R and R and hydrophobic forces F with        two CH          CO units of CTAP The interacting        region is in the RGPGRAF principal neutralizing domain        PND of the V loop     Both R and R residues        are also in close proximity to two acid groups of the CTAP        phthalic acid moiety and may take part in electrostatic        interactions Although CTAP is only a partial        representation of the CAP molecule the docking simulations        agree with the experimental results        Results presented earlier    combined with those        presented here suggest that CAP acts on HIV by several        mechanisms depending on pH and the physical form and        concentration of this compound The direct virus        inactivating effect of CAP the multiple mechanisms        involved in prevention of HIV infection the broad        spectrum activity against several STD pathogens the        established safety record low cost and availability in        large scale suggest that CAP has advantages over other        polymeric substances considered as topical vaginal        microbicides for prevention of STDs including AIDS                    Conclusions        Cellulose acetate phthalate CAP is a pharmaceutical        excipient which has been used for over four decades for        enteric film coating of tablets and capsules It is        inexpensive and generally regarded as a nontoxic material        free of adverse effects As such it is included in the US        Food and Drug Administration Inactive Ingredients Guide        Our earlier studies indicated that CAP inhibited infection        by HIV and several herpes viruses in vitro CAP was        effective in blocking vaginal transmission of these viruses        in animal model systems The underlying molecular        machanisms for these inhibitory effects remained to be        established Data presented here show that CAP remains        bound to HIV after removal of unreacted compound        impairing virus infectivity due to blockade of binding        sites for cellular coreceptors CXCR and CCR The        industrial availability history of safe use and mechanism        of antiHIV activity ie virus inactivation rather than        reversible inhibition suggest that CAP is an ideal        candidate
