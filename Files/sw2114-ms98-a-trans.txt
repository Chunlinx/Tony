        well uh she said uh one was a total ban on gun control and ten was uh no control at all where do you fit in there     yeah well i think youd probably have to put me at the at the ten area ten or nine   oh is that right well were probably not too far apart id probably fall in there at a seven or eight   yeah i uh i just you know its its you know weapons weapons obviously do not kill its the people that operate them and   well i pretty much agree with that thats uh   with with two hundred years of uncontrolled gun control in this country i mean it was founded on that it was one of the things that founded this country i cant imagine trying to to do that and if you pass laws youre gonna make a lot of   umhum   criminals criminals because people wouldnt register them i i i live in California and and we just had a a registration a law registration for automatic guns and uh   uhhuh   they know that there are tens of thousands of them out in this state and less than about i think fifteen hundred people registered them   is that right in the whole state   yeah yeah in the whole state   golly well the   so what is happened now is that those people that did not register them are um   theyre now criminals themselves yeah thats thats the crazy thing about it youre youre putting   theyre now criminals   theyre theyre putting more laws and more restrictions and more burden on the honest citizen the one who doesnt give them a problem anyway       you know and its its crazy theyre just putting more giving more paper work problems to the honest citizen and and you know because uh a person whose gonna use a gun for a crime hes hes not too concerned with the crime of not registering his gun   no no no   thats   absolutely you know its like its i i i i dont really quite understand the idea that people think that i mean i im all for registration in the sense that uh a a a lawful person can go down and get a gun and and maybe you shouldnt be given one the day that you go down they should be able to do a check i think possibly and   yeah i i would agree with that that you know well you know thats thats why i say i kind of fall into a seven or eight range there you know i i dont have a problem with registration   yeah yeah   but uh you know when it comes to restrictions and and   yeah and and just plain cant have guns   yeah yeah it it is crazy because like you say this country was founded uh and obviously had a uh had a big interest in in letting them their citizens arm themselves and which uh you know which maybe does cause some problems that maybe other countries with more restrictive laws dont have but its one of the prices that you have to pay for for freedom i think   oh absolutely not only that but i think theres also a hidden a hidden wealth in in in the citizen having firearms and that hidden wealth is is that i would really i would really feel sorry for anybody for a country that that tried to physically invade this country   yeah yeah   mean because you know its its a country where everybody has a gun and theyre gonna have some trouble  i mean you know in the mom and pop little towns and stuff theyre gonna run into people with guns   uhhuh yeah oh yeah yeah theyre   and and that that is sort of a hidden security factor i think for this nation you know i mean   oh yeah everybody who lives out in the country or or around around my area everybody who lives out in the country has a gun   sure at least one   yeah you know and its not for uh not for protection or hunting or or anything just you know for all those reasons just you know nobody thinks anything about having a gun its no big deal     its thats the way they just brought up well uh wherere you from by the way   but but yeah i am in uh Trenton Texas did you yeah did you say you were in California   Texas yeah im in California right now im im originally from North Carolina though i   well i well i didnt know this program reached out that far   hey its reaching all over   all right well thats thats a neat deal   well listen you think theyve earned their money weve earned our money tonight   oh i bet we have we gave them a few minutes worth   all right well listen you take care of yourself all right   all right you too good night then bye bye   good night all right
