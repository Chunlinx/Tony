                  well mine is very very simple im a nurse  i wear white or i wear scrubs  so i guess youll have to carry this one      uhhuh youre all set then    oh geez i im a teacher        and uh basically what we do is we dress for the weather especially the climates inside the school   isnt it different it is different isnt it inside than   not so much they climates out         uh my daughter says that too that its freezing when they turn on the air conditioning and its so hot when they turn on the heat      it is its unbelievable usually we layer our clothing      uhhuh   and um that way we have you know we can strip off layers        and not so much our pants but you wear a sweater and a short sleeve shirt underneath that   yeah   and then you can take the sweater off      yeah   or something thats medium weight        and especially up here we get the you know we get winters and its really cold and sometimes in the classrooms its really cold too   right    yeah   so sometimes you just leave your jackets on all the time             gosh   you know so   yeah its probably pays pays for you to leave something there do you do you do that      um not that often because a lot of things get stolen      really oh great   so  its  mostly what you wear into work you know wear a short sleeve shirt or a short sleeve blouse      yeah      and a sweater if youre wearing slacks and if youre wearing a over the dress you wear a sweater you know a cardigan or something over the dress and um you know bring your jacket you can just carry it around with you   yeah           you can wear socks to work there      yes we can and   yeah our teachers cant do that yet   umhum well we have a really big high school so its you know it gets very uncomfortable on hills      uhhuh   most the teachers have taking to wearing uh track shoes             oh  the nurses have too thats interesting a lot of them are wearing Reeboks now because most of them the prefer the pants to the dresses   you know sneakers and                uhhuh   and with the scrubs too you know which is just you know scrubs are like what they wear in the O R and i      right   they just wear Reeboks its really comfortable i havent done it yet      no   but its probably coming because were all going into scrubs right now it depends on the area where you work   theyre great    right   but soon the whole area is going into scrubs and so umhum      oh really      so probably ill go ahead and break down and        you know i guess i guess from the school  this is just not professional you know  so im kind of a hold out            oh that happens a lot i know my aunt was director she just retired was director of nurses at the hospital up here   yeah      and she always wore a cap and   oh      oh yeah she was like a real hold out      oh boy   and then finally she took that off and that was like big concession on her part      oh   and then she went to her hospital you know her uniform        and she always wore her you know uniform shoes never wore sneakers   yeah yeah   she absolutely refused   yeah and i still do that and theyre very expensive they are comfortable though i i dont know i      yeah thats what she was saying    one thing ive noticed thats come back here are clogs      really   yeah they started to make a come back you see them in the stores more and more and  i didnt think id ever see those again      oh i know it well in California they have these oh gosh i cant think of the name of them        they have a name they come from Italy and theyre cork   uhhuh   and they have like two straps on top like a sandal and they form to fit your feet      oh neat   theyre soft and after you wear them a day then they only fit your feet      oh that sounds great   and theyre wearing those and ive seen a little bit of it in the stores here now      really   but i dont know being up there if youll see too much  they wouldnt be very practical except in the summer time      umhum   but um yeah thats the new thing and its sort of on that style you know except that its open like a sandal      right a lot of us during the winter would wear boots and then peel them off and carry our shoes      yeah yeah yeah      you know or just wear the shoes in and hope for the best      yeah really      hum things have plowed pretty well   im not used to that anymore i came down here from New York but      oh really   yes i remember boots and things like that but not anymore            uhhuh yeah my parents just came up from Florida and they had to get rid of all their a lot of their summer summer clothes      yeah   and they say my gosh one minute its eighty and the next minute its you know sixty and theyre freezing  and they said oh what and they say wait a minute we had a mild winter this year      really really    oh oh wait till next year uh      well hopefully we seem to be running on mild winters lately      they weathers changing all over the country      yeah were getting a lot more rain and ice than we are snow      hum   and uh that makes it difficult on as far as clothing goes because you dont know what to put on your feet      yeah oh yeah yeah        yeah i dont think anyone in Texas owns
