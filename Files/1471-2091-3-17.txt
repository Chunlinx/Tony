                    Background        The saturation status of unconjugated bilirubin UCB is        relevant to understanding the pathophysiology of jaundice        and to interpreting experiments

mesobilirubinXIII MBR along with        several soluble reference acids in buffered mixtures of C        H                      SO and water         Due to        the very low aqueous solubility of MBR data were obtained        only at two high concentrations of C H                      SO  and  vol Its pK                   a            values in water actually in  vol of C H

chloroform and        buffered aqueous solutions            These serious discrepancies led us to reexamine several        experimental aspects of the CNMR studies and the        implications of their purported low pK                   a            values for the solubility of UCB Inaccuracies in the        measurements of buffer pH and of the pK                   a            values of the reference Ccarboxylic acids related        to failure to correct for the strong effects of DMSO on the        pK                   a            values of weak acids have been previously noted           and acknowledged     In addition as discussed later a        thermodynamic theory about solubility in mixed solvents        using the S         o  values of  nM in water    and         mM in pure DMSO     suggested that S         o  of UCB would be only about  M in         vol DMSO and  M in  vol DMSO which are well        below concentrations used in the MBR studies This implies        serious supersaturation effects In fact turbidity was        reported for some of the systems used in the CNMR papers            indicating the formation of coarse suspensions By        definition as stressed in the Conclusions section pK                   a            determinations are valid only for monomeric species        and require that solutions are below saturation at all pH        values studied Even reversible aggregation of monomers in        undersaturated solutions is known to affect pK                   a            estimates     If supersaturation leads to the        formation of fine sols or coarse suspensions the data are        unacceptable for determination of the pK                   a            values of monomers        In the present paper we assess whether some of the        systems used in the CNMR studies were supersaturated        with MBR Our experimental work on sedimentation was done        with unconjugated bilirubin UCB and we used DMSO instead        of its deuterated analogue C H                      SO It is known that when alkaline        aqueous UCB is acidified to neutral or low pHs Usually a        colloid suspension of bilirubin is formed and the solution        remains clear as observed by the naked eye thus inviting        an erroneous interpretation     Such systems which        simulate true solutions often show sedimentation on        centrifugation         We here report that        sedimentation of UCB from apparently clear solutions can        likewise be extensive when UCB in DMSO is diluted with        aqueous buffers to final mole fractions N of DMSO           and  corresponding to   and  vol        of DMSO A thermodynamic theory is used to examine the        effect of added DMSO on S         o   Our findings consistent with our        partitionderived S         o   S and pK                   a            values of UCB in aqueous buffers     indicate that        the recently reported low pK

supernatants after          centrifugation          Many systems initially appeared optically clear but          well over  of initial UCB sedimented on centrifugation          of most samples below pH  Overall recoveries UCB in          supernatant  UCB in redissolved precipitate were          between  and  Only residual UCB in supernatants          are reported          Figs ABCplot the measured residual UCB in the          supernatant vs the initial UCB at N           DMSO     and           Deviations of their ratio below unity dotted lines          represent a decrease in UCB mainly from precipitation          but possibly also from limited degradation At N            Fig A UCB after sedimentation varied from  M          at pH  to  M at pH  At N   Fig B          UCB ranged from  to  M at pH  and from           to  M at pH  and most of the UCB sedimented By          contrast at pH  and  phosphate only minor          precipitation was observed At N   Fig C UCB          ranged from  to  M at all three pH values  to                                    Sedimentation of bilirubinalbumin complexes          The supernatant from the original supersaturated          UCBHSA system when diluted with th vol of buffer          and centrifuged again showed more sedimentation and a          progressive rise in UCB as one moved down the column of          fluid By contrast after dilution with th volume of          DMSO to decrease UCB saturation the supernatants          produced no further sedimentation and there were no          significant differences in UCB or protein          concentrations along the axis of the fluid column Thus          the UCBHSA complex which constitutes over  of the          UCB in this system     did not sediment                            Discussion                  Findings and their relation to thermodynamic          theory          Supersaturated aqueous systems of UCB that are          optically clear before centrifugation may exhibit          considerable variation in the extent of sedimentation                 Although sedimentation is often          extensive it is generally incomplete and may not be          observed at all Our data in DMSOwater show the same          features which are expected from the complex kinetics of          nucleation and growth of insoluble aggregates of UCB          diacid H             B leading to the formation of a          new solid phase      Our centrifugation  min at                     g   was quite mild and the short          minute period between preparation of UCBDMSOwater          systems and centrifugation severely limited the          timedependent growth to large aggregates Lack of          sedimentation of the UCBHSA complex mol wt           indicates that fine colloids composed of  UCB          molecules would be too small to sediment Thus          supersaturated systems lacking coarse insoluble          aggregates may not show sedimentation but any          sedimentation observed indicates their presence          To evaluate the important effect of pH on          sedimentation efficiency we calculated S in water using          chloroformwater partition data on UCB and the best          measure of S           o  in chloroform  mM     S at          any pH eg  nM at pH  and  M at pH  can          be calculated from the fitted partition data or          equivalently from Eq  using the partitionderived S           o  in water of  nM and pK                       a              values of  and      In aqueous systems              the lowest UCB in water below which no          sedimentation was observed at             g  for a few hours was  nM at pH           modestly higher than our partitionderived S of           nM     Even under such vigorous centrifugation the          lowest UCB increased rapidly with increasing pH to           M  times S at pH  and  M  times S at pH               This indicates increasing          chargestabilization of fine nonsedimenting colloids of          H             B by adsorbed UCB anions                In contrast below pH  sedimentation of  M UCB          was nearly complete     This is compatible with a          dearth of stabilizing UCB anions at this pH as expected          from the high pK                       a              values of  and               Our present data on residual UCB in DMSOwater          systems likewise show decreased sedimentation with          increasing pH Fig ABC At each N           DMSO   the lowest UCB were at the          lowest pH values  M N   pH   M N            pH  and  M N   pH           As in water these are likely to be closest to the S           o  values at each N Indeed they are          only moderately higher than the corresponding S           o  values of  M  M and           M respectively calculated from Equation  using S           o  values of  nM in water    and           mM in DMSO              log S           omixed   log S           owater   log S           oDMSO   log S           owater    N             Eq             Equation  is a thermodynamic relationship based on          assumptions of complete ideality of mixing     In          general a roughly linear variation of log S           o  with N at low N is expected For          example data from naphthoic acid in DMSOwater             show that log S           o  is a linear function of N up to N            Such a relationship leads to a relatively small          effect of low N values on S           o   Thus according to Equation  S           o  increases by a factor of only  at          N   and  at N   but by a relatively          larger factor of  at N   This would markedly          reduce the supersaturation factor UCB S           o   which is a measure of the          tendency of UCB to come out of solution at N   This          explains in part the relatively high UCB at high pH at          N   Fig A          The pH effects on UCB at each N           DMSO  are of interest also The lowest          UCB at each pH registered relatively small increases          with significant increases in pH for example from  M          pH  to  M pH  at N   from  M          pH  to  M pH  at N   and from  M          pH  to  M pH  at N   These increases          are probably caused mainly by increasing          chargestabilization of colloidal aggregates as in          aqueous media       If instead the relatively          small increases are ascribed entirely to increases in          true solubility S at the high pH Eq  the required          pK                       a              values are about  at N   and  and           at N   The true pK                       a              s of UCB in DMSOwater are thus probably          significantly higher          We note that some variability in sedimentation results          from our shortterm experiments most evident at the low          residual UCB in Figs Band C in part magnified by          the loglog scale used Some variability is expected          however because of the complexity of the kinetic          processes of nucleation growth and flocculation that          precede sedimentation In Fig A the difference between          acetate and Tris buffers is quite small note the linear          scale compatible with the  higher H  in the          acetate buffer In Fig B the markedly lower          sedimentation from phosphate buffers at pH  as          compared to Tris buffer at pH  can be ascribed mainly          to the much higher pH values and ionic strength of the          phosphate systems Another significant factor may be the          difference in charge between the buffer salts phosphate          is anionic whereas Tris is cationic and zwitterionic The          cationic species of Tris can in principle reduce the          negative charges on the surface of the colloidal H             B sufficiently to facilitate the          formation of coarser particles and thus increase          sedimentation                          Implications for pK a values of mesobilirubinXIII          MBR          In the recent CNMR studies of the ionization of the          CCOOH groups of MBR        it was assumed that          the relevant physical properties of UCB and MBR and of          CH                          SO DMSO and C H                          SO are similar Actually as          expected from the replacement of two vinyl groups in UCB          with two ethyl groups in MBR MBR is slightly more          soluble in organic solvents    and has a higher R           f  on silica gel tlc     MBR is          thus more hydrophobic and should be less soluble in water          than is UCB Our low UCB in DMSOwater systems at          comparable N therefore indicate that many of the C H                          SObuffer systems used in the          CNMR studies       were likely supersaturated          with MBR In those studies the MBR concentrations used          were stated to be  to  M at N                compared to our lowest UCB of  M at pH  and           M at pH  At this N  of  MBR data points were          obtained at pH below  and  below pH      so          that even  M MBR was likely to be supersaturated At N            our lowest UCB  M at pH  was close to          the lower limit of the  to  M range of MBR used               Thus many data points obtained at pH values          down to       were probably from supersaturated          systems despite being optically clear As noted here and          elsewhere          optical clarity gives          no assurance of the absence of supersaturation          Actually turbidity was reported in some of the          CNMR samples     indicating that coarse insoluble          aggregates of MBR were present The claim that such          turbidity did not affect CNMR measurements               contrasts with evidence that even small multimers can          change NMR chemical shifts      It should be noted          also that at high concentrations of B  extensive          reversible selfassociation of B can lead to apparently          stable supersaturation with no separation of an insoluble          phase     For example at pH  and a UCB          concentration of  M  times S the weightaverage          aggregation number of UCB has been found to be               corresponding to a molecular weight of  The          aggregation number remained fairly high  in           wv ethanol     The successful application of          equilibrium ultracentrifugation for that study             suggests a complete absence of even small colloidal          species of UCB Selfassociation of MBR dianions in C H                                   SOwater mixtures cannot be ruled          out on           a priori  grounds It has been shown          that neglect of selfassociation of B leads to an          artefactually low estimate of pK                       a              values for UCB              In addition to the problems of insolubility          supersaturation and selfaggregation of the MBR systems          in C H                          SOwater        we had shown          previously that inaccuracies in the pH measurements          affected both the magnitude of pK                       a              the change in pK                       a              on adding C H                          SO to water as well as the degree          of the variation of pK                       a              with N     This is important for extrapolating          pK                       a              values in C H                          SOwater to pure water N            Indeed remeasurement of one soluble acid raised its pK                       a              by as much as  units at N       Thus the          inaccuracies in pH measurement produced serious errors in          reported pK                       a              values of more than fifteen soluble acids used as          models for MBR as well as for MBR itself                           Many methods using appropriate pH measurements have          been applied in the past to determine thermodynamic pK                       a              values of soluble acids in nonaqueous or partially          aqueous media including DMSOwater systems               Many other relevant references were given in our prior          paper     In that paper our pK                       a              measurements on acetic acid in DMSOwater systems          were based on the potentiometric method using properly          calibrated glass electrodes which determine the activity          of H  and on estimates of the activity coefficients of          the acetate ion This method which is well established          for aqueous solutions yielded results in good agreement          with data from the literature that was based on a very          different method measurements of electrical conductivity              In the CNMR papers therefore it was not          justified to assume that pH values do not change on          adding DMSO         or to use uncalibrated pH          measurements for determination of the pK                       a              values of soluble acids              Our sedimentation data and their interpretation          indicate that significant additional uncertainties not          important for the soluble acids investigated exist for          the reported pK                       a              values of the relatively insoluble MBR in CD

     Conclusions        The present sedimentation data for UCB in DMSOwater        demonstrate that the true solubilities of UCB even at        fairly high pH values are low at DMSO mole fractions up

Stock UCB in DMSO  to  mM and stock HSA  M in           M TrisHCl buffer pH  were prepared freshly for          each experiment                          Preparation of UCBDMSObuffer systems          Test systems  mL of UCB were prepared in          duplicate to  mL of the stock buffer were added          successively the appropriate volumes of water DMSO and          finally up to  L of stock UCBDMSO solution To          minimize UCB oxidation all tubes and solutions were          deoxygenated with Argon and kept in the dark     To          determine the UCB in the UCBDMSO stock  L was          added to  mL of the HSA stock The absorbance           A   at  nm was read against a          blank containing  mL of HSA stock plus  L DMSO          and the UCB calculated using the extinction          coefficient   M cm      The pH          measurement of each final DMSOaqueous buffer system          included an electrode calibration using the strong acid          HClO                 The  M phosphate buffer          in N   DMSO was centrifuged because of partial          insolubility    and only the supernatant was used                          Centrifugation and analysis of residual UCB in          supernatants          Fifteen min after mixing samples were assessed          visually for turbidity or precipitation After          Vortexmixing duplicate  mL aliquots were transferred          to polypropylene tubes and centrifuged for  min at C          and            g  Mikroliter centrifuge Hettich          Tuttlingen Germany The supernatants were assayed          spectrophotometrically within  min The precipitates          were washed once with  mL of water again centrifuged          the water aspirated and the packed precipitate dissolved          in DMSO for

comparable          medium without UCB was used as a blank In all systems          including the redissolved UCB sediments we applied the          extinction coefficient of  M cm at the peak          wavelength of  nm for UCB in pure DMSO              Preliminary calibration studies of the effects of DMSO          concentration and buffer composition on           A  had confirmed this value for pure          UCB in pure DMSO and in DMSObuffer systems containing           vol DMSO In the systems containing  and  vol DMSO          the spectrum developed a plateau between  and  nm          but           A  at  nm remained within            of the value expected from applying the extinction          coefficient of  M cm to the measured quantity          of UCB dissolved in each system The variability is in          part due to degradation discussed above and in part due          to the low absorbances at UCB below the saturation          limit in some bufferDMSO systems For these reasons no          corrections were made for these minor differences in           A                            Sedimentation of bilirubinalbumin complexes          To determine if UCB bound to HSA would sediment we          prepared a system containing HSA  M and UCB  M          in  M TrisHCl buffer pH  Microcentrifugation          for  min yielded a small amount of precipitated UCB          Three aliquots of the clear supernatant were diluted with          th volume of DMSO and a fourth aliquot diluted with          th volume of buffer The diluted samples in          duplicate were then microcentrifuged for another  min          and  L samples taken from the top middle and bottom          of the fluid column in each tube using a Hamilton          syringe Protein concentrations were determined with the          BioRad bicinchonic acid method which is unaffected by          bilirubin After dilution with  mL DMSO triplicate           A  readings were taken at           nm
