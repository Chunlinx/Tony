WHERE TO GOW ith a country this big how do you get to know the place as a whole The answer is of course that you cant Not even most Canadians will have seen all that you will see on a wellplanned trip A visit to Canada aiming at anything more than just one destinationToronto Montral or Vancouveris bound to seem a little intimidating The distances to cover are enormous But it can be done with the journey itself a large part of the adventure as you zoom across the wideopen spaces separating one city from another The Handy Travel Tips section beginning on page  gives detailed practical guidance but here are some general ideas to help you plan your tripOn a first visit youll probably be able to get a feel for just a few of the regions we describe but you can capture the essence of Canada in a judicious combination of two or three major cities and the marvelous outdoor life We do not attempt an encyclopedic coverage of every nook and cranny from the US border to the Arctic Circle but we do provide a representative sample of the countrys attractionsWhereWeve divided the country into six regions each with at least one major town accessible by air as a launching pad from which to explore the hinterland Ontario Qubec the Atlantic Newfoundland and the Maritimes British Columbia the Rockies and the Prairie Provinces Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the North Yukon Nunavut and the Northwest TerritoriesTwo suggested plans of attack are either to start in Toronto or Montral and take in Ontario and Qubec with side trips to the Atlantic coast or even out to the West or to start in Vancouver or Calgary and explore the Rockies and British Columbia before heading east to Ontario or Qubec taking in the Prairies on a crosscountry train ride The North on a first trip must be considered a proposition strictly for the adventurous In any case count on at least three weeks ideally a month to even begin to do the place justiceWhenOne of the great advantages to Canadas vast size is that apart from a couple of major tourist attractions such as Niagara Falls its never overcrowded Even in high summer theres still plenty of room for everybody Nonetheless it is advisable to make advance bookings for some resort hotels on the Pacific coast in the Rockies or around the Great LakesJuly and August guarantee the best weather though it can get very hot in Montral Toronto and the Prairie Provinces aggravated in those provinces by the hot chinook wind off the Rockies Farther to the north mosquitoes can be a problem in summer Connoisseurs of the forests of Qubec and the Maritimes favor the spectacular autumn from September to midOctober While the West Coast is mild in May and June in central and eastern Canada youll still find snow on the ground in May and a nip in the air into the month of June The period from November to April is strictly for winter sports enthusiastsRemember the old adage Theres no bad weather only bad clothing In addition to your light summer wear be sure to bring a sweater for the occasional chilly evenings Rather than weighing down your luggage with anything cumbersome take a leaf out of the Canadians book and keep warm by wearing several layers If youre thinking of going north consider long underwear In any case dont forget a raincoat especially for British Columbia Important everywhere is a good pair of walking shoessomething light but more solid than tennis shoesHowThe most adventurous traveler who loves to improvise will still need a certain amount of advance planning Canadas provincial tourist offices are conscientious and well worth consulting even before you leave home The national tourist office is also helpful but in Canada the provinces jealously protect their prerogatives against the federal government and maintain their own tourist offices that can give you detailed information about resorts accommodations camping and sports facilitiesTo cover half a continent air travel is invaluable To get the cheapest deal plan the broad outlines of your itinerary ahead of time so that you can buy your tickets before you reach Canada The two national airlines Air Canada and Canadian each linked to smaller companies flying the interior have cutrate multipleflight ticketing Helicopters and hydroplanes can fly you for fishing and camping expeditions in the more remote areas Do take advantage of the boat cruises wherever you canaround Newfoundland Halifax harbor the Great Lakes or the Inside Passage off the Pacific coastFor a closer look at all the wideopen spaces take a train VIA Rail Canada is the national passengertrain system using the tracks of Canadian Pacific and Canadian National who devote themselves strictly to more lucrative freight carrying Serving pretty good food in comfortable diners with club cars observation decks and sleeping cars VIA takes a leisurely four days from Montral to Vancouver From Montral to Toronto its  hours faster by train than by road You may also want to consider Rocky Mountaineer Railtours tel   wwwrockymountaineercom which offers daylight trips through the Canadian RockiesBuses are a possibility for the occasional excursion but a car remains essential for independent mobility The airlines will arrange for car rentals at each airport The TransCanada Highway stretches nearly  km  miles from coast to coast and secondary roads are very good until you get into the backwoods Inside the major cities you may prefer to park your car and use the generally efficient public transport One of the best ways to explore the hinterland especially in the national and provincial parks is to rent a comfortably equipped mobile home or camper This too should be done in advanceONTARIOThis choice piece of real estate between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay is the countrys dominant provincetoo dominant for the liking of many of the others With  million people clustered almost entirely along the southern border Ontario is the most populous province and the wealthiest generating close to  percent of the gross national product from manufacturing construction minerals forestry and agriculture The province has grown in vitality with the influx of

halfhour documentary film to understand the dramatic fate of the mission It must be said that the Huron were less interested in conversion to Christianity than in the goods to be gained from the fur traders who followed the priests on this first French settlement in Ontario But dealing directly with Europeans threatened the position of the rival Iroquois as middlemen between the Huron and

AtikokanOttawaLike most national capitals created artificially to avoid favoring one established metropolis over another Ottawa is the perennial butt of carping and jokes Its true of Washington of Braslia of Canberra and even more so in Canada where the very idea of a centralized federal government is so hotly contested by its independentminded provinces People rarely like government at the best of times and when its the towns main almost exclusive industry they have a builtin prejudice against itBut Ottawas second major source of income is nonetheless tourism because the town is pleasant offering a pretty setting of parks and waterways for its firstclass museums and colorful monuments The countrys short history is epitomized by a skyline of solid Victorian parliamentary buildings and a bold modern architecture of office blocks and the new National Gallery And the government machinery remains firmly in touch with its roots when in winter the bureaucrats skate and ski to work along the frozen Rideau CanalAccommodatingly situated on the border between Ontario and Qubec Ottawa is a fully bilingual city though most of the Frenchspeaking community and the best restaurants now have their homes in Hull on the Qubec side of the Ottawa RiverExcept for longer excursions try to leave the car in the hotel parking lot and walk or take the bus The complex system of oneway streets designed to avoid rather than to reach key government buildings and the added confusion of curving rivers and canals make downtown driving a harrowing business even for locals One other point In the absence of any clear logic in street numbering its important when noting an address to be sure you have the nearest crossstreets as well as the number of the buildingParliament AreaLike the Parliament assemblage in London from which they unashamedly take their architectural inspiration the Parliament Buildings are an imposing NeoGothic pile restored from the ruins left after a

Ottawa the two strands of the regions history come together in the meticulous recreation of a thcentury pioneering village perhaps the best of the countrys many historical showpieces The homes of the regions first settlers had to be moved here east of Morrisburg when their original location was flooded in the digging of the St Lawrence Seaway Start your visit by climbing the small fort tower from which you get an overall view In a peaceful green canalside setting disturbed only by perky Canada geese notoriously loud honkers youll find authentic pre buildings from the simple timbered sawmill or old schoolhouse to the sophisticated brickbuilt Crysler Hall in the Palladian style favored by colonial land owners from Ontario to Alabama Crysler was a farmer on whose land an important battle was

Hotel He built it for his wife but she died before it was finished and it was abandoned as a vast empty fortress like those that Boldt admired in similar splendid ruin back home in the Rhine ValleyQUEBECIfoh happy dreamall the old ethnic rivalries could be set aside most Canadians would acknowledge that Qubec is not only the original Canada of the first European settlement but also the province that most comprehensively encompasses within its borders the worlds image of this huge country To begin with it is itself huge It could contain according to your taste three Frances or seven Britains Most of ittwothirds of the areais forest The north is coniferous serving the provinces important pulp and paper industry and the south is deciduous with the maple of the national flag providing delicious syrup and the ash oak and beech that blaze into crimson amber and gold in autumnThere arent as many beavers as in the great days of the fur trade but still enough to fell a few trees around the resort cottages in the Laurentian Mountains north of Montral Deer and moose abound for the hunters farther north there are herds of caribou and up towards the Arctic Circle a few polar bears tooWhere its not forest city or the farmland established by the habitants of the St Lawrence Valley and the Eastern Township Loyalists its water water everywhere The mighty St Lawrence River and Seaway link the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes Gigantic dams harness the waters hydroelectric power north on James Bay and east on the Manicouagan River Lakes and streams shimmer with salmon trout eel and pikeAs you travel from bilingual Montral to New Frances old capital Qubec City and the resolutely Frenchspeaking farm villages along the St Lawrence and around the Gasp Peninsula have a thought for local patriotic sensibility The Qubcois can justly claim to be cofounders of the Canadian nation Abandoned by what many still call the damned French maudits franais they felt that they alone had earned the name of canadiens and that their British conquerors usurped it As a tribute to their own past courage there is both pride and resentment in the Qubcois motto Je me souviens I Remember It was they who made the first and hardiest effort to hew a modern living out of this hard land Like colonials everywhere their missionaries sometimes brought more religion their traders more alcohol and their soldiers more guns than the natives really needed But the Qubcois understood the importance of learning from the native peoples how best to handle the Canadian wilderness Furtrading coureurs de bois settled down with Indian wives and today more than a few Qubcois proudly trace their ancestry back to native peoples with a telltale birthmark on the hip high cheekbones or long sleek black hairOutside Montral you cant assume everyone speaks English Many make it a point of pride not to until youve at least paid them the courtesy of a Bonjour By Qubec provincial law public signs are all in French and so we will often give you here beside the English names the French version as it appears on maps and signpostsMontralThis great metropolis Qubecs largest city with  million inhabitants is built on an island at the confluence of the Ottawa and St Lawrence rivers Second in population now to Toronto it remains a sprawling city of cosmopolitan neighborhoods each a delight to stroll around but best reached by taxi bus or the excellent Mtro where the trains whoosh along on rubber tires Given the daytime traffic snarls and usual bigcity parking problems use your car only for outoftown tripsMount RoyalFor an overall view of the city start with a bracing walk up the slopes of the charming Mount Royal Park Parc du MontRoyal Follow the footpath and stairs from the end of Peel Street or a shorter route from the Chemin Remembrance car park Perhaps the most pleasant way is to take a leisurely ride in a horsedrawn carriage from Dominion SquareKnown with characteristic local irony as la Montagne the Mountain the heights were spotted by Jacques Cartier on his historic journey up the St Lawrence River in  and named Mont Ral in homage to his king Franois IFrom the massive timber and stone Chalet de la Montagne or the steel cross at the summit illuminated at night you can look out over the river flowing from the Lac des Deux Montagnes past the city on its northeasterly journey to the Atlantic Montralers conveniently twist the compass by considering the St Lawrence as south of the city the roads parallel to the river are divided into east and west sectors by the Boulevard StLaurent Down by the port are the low stone buildings of Old Montral Vieux Montral The concrete steel and glass towers of the modern city cluster around Boulevard Ren Lvesque which runs parallel to the river At the far end JacquesCartier Bridge links Montral Island to the Expo  site on St Helens Island Ile SteHlne and over to the southern shore Victoria Bridge spans the St Lawrence to the southSouthwest of Mount Royal on the slopes of the smaller hill of Westmount are the grand villas and mansions of Montrals old AngloCanadian lite North and west of the park are many of the

VermontLandscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted designer of New Yorks Central Park Mount Royal is a popular refuge from the city bustle the place for picnics in the summer and tobogganing and skiing in the winter with the little Beaver Lake Lac des Castors for sailing model boats or skating A stroll around the lake is the perfect way to capture a sense of the towns ethnic diversity On the park benches you may hear gossip not only in French and English but Italian Greek Yiddish and RussianOld MontralBetween rue StAntoine and the port and flanked by rue McGill and rue Berri this is the site of Maisonneuves original settlement of VilleMarie Mtro ChampdeMars All but a few stones of the thcentury city ramparts have gone but many historic houses have been restored to evoke some of the flavor of New FranceThe colorful treelined Place JacquesCartier makes a good point from which to start a walking tour or a riding tour in a horsedrawn calche available here for hire An itinerary can be mapped out over coffee at one of the many pleasant sidewalk cafs Once a fruit and vegetable market the cobblestone square remains a favorite venue for flowervendors and itinerant artists The old stone buildings were designed to beat the harsh winters with distintive tall steepsloping roofs to keep the weighty snow and ice from accumulatingAcross the rue NotreDame the thcentury Htel de Ville City Hall is built in the imposing style of the French Renaissance It was from the balcony beneath the clock in  that General de Gaulle delivered his incendiary cry of Vive le Qubec libre warming the hearts of local separatists The general was not intimidated by the statue of Lord Horatio Nelson watching him from the top of Place JacquesCartier Montrals oldest monument was somewhat provocatively erected in  just four years after the British admirals devastating defeat of the French at TrafalgarDiagonally opposite the Htel de Ville on rue NotreDame the Chteau Ramezay was home of the French governor Claude de Ramezay from  to  It passed successively into the hands of the French West Indies Trading Company to store its spices the British and during their brief occupation of the city in

back to  It is the family home of the controversial thcentury politician LouisJoseph Papineau leader of the militant patriotes but also cautious protector of his seigneurial property see page  In  the house nearly burned down in a violent riot and British soldiers had to come to Papineaus rescue He fled to the countryside and did not take part in the subsequent insurrectionOn the corner of rue StPaul the older Maison du Calvet was built in  by a prominent Huguenot merchant As a Protestant Pierre du Calvet was appointed by the British justice of the peace but then ended up in jail himself for selling supplies and information to the American invaders With its broad chimney finegrained limestone frames around the doors and gracefully tapered casement windows the house is one of the more handsome architectural specimens of the French colonial era The sturdy interior of wide roughhewn floorboards and massive pinewood roofbeams is fitted out from the Montral Museum of Fine Arts with antique Qubec furniture rugs lanterns clocks and porcelain appropriate to the life of a wealthy thcentury businessman A framed copy of the bilingual Qubec Gazette dating from  suggests that colonials of the New World had an uncommon interest in the more arcane news of international events in the Old World such as Turkeys troubles with Venice or the quarrels of the Dutch royal familySince  the church of NotreDamedeBonsecours  rue SaintPaul Est has stood on the site of a chapel that was built for the colonys first schoolteacher Marguerite Bourgeois but destroyed by fire She and three young woman companions brought a civilizing influence to the harshness of the beleaguered settlement Acting as both teachers and nurses they also took charge of marriageable girls known as the filles du Roi the Kings daughters The filles du Roi were in fact daughters of peasants and poor artisans shipped over from France as wives for bachelor farmers and fur traders In the th century NotreDamedeBonsecours became the Sailors Chapel to which survivors of shipwrecks brought model ships they had carved as offerings of thanksgiving The models still hang from the ceiling lit up now by tiny electric bulbs Notice how the trompe loeil painting on the low arched ceiling aspires to turn the little church into a lofty Gothic cathedral Climb the church tower for a good view of Vieux Montral and the harborMost of the ugly old warehouses have been demolished along the Vieux Port at the foot of Place JacquesCartier Some have been refurbished as cafs or hotels one pier now houses the

commemorates their adventure The statue at the Pointe is of an AngloCanadian John Young who developed the ports commerce in the th centuryThe rue StSulpice takes you over the Place dArmes close to the site of the first French battles with the Iroquois Today it serves as a visual link between the historic old town of the pioneers and the new city of commerce and industry In the middle is a statue of Maisonneuve looking very like one of Alexandre Dumas musketeers Hes brandishing the royal French fleurdelys flag that inspired the Qubec provincial flag of today The thcentury NeoGothic NotreDame Basilica was designed by James ODonell an Irish Protestant New Yorker so inspired by his assignment that he converted to Catholicism It once took  men to ring the great bell in the west tower a task now accomplished with electricity The garishly opulent interior was the work of a Qubcois Victor Bourgeau Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Chapel behind the main altar unites modern and traditional religious art in a more intimate setting for marriages and memorial services A little museum displays church sculpture and painting notably some almost surreal works by PierreAdolpheArthur Guindon a Sulpician monk Next to the church is the Seminary of StSulpice Montrals oldest surviving edifice built in  to lead the missionary work among the Iroquois It also boasts North Americas oldest public clock The Place dArmes is enclosed on three sides by modern buildings including the huge Post Office tower while opposite NotreDame stands the venerable Bank of Montral  The black marble and brass of its monumental entrance hall impose a pious appreciation of Canadas oldest banking institution The statue of Patria is dedicated to the fallen of World War I Take a peek too around the grand Exchange

restaurants and offices looking out onto a peaceful garden The Ushaped courtyard makes a lovely setting for openair plays and recitals in the summer The stables were in fact nothing more romantic than a warehouse but they did for a time serve as a garage for horsecarriages Next to the stables is an old redbrick fire station transformed into the Montral History Center Centre dhistoire de Montral presenting an audiovisual documentary history of the cityDowntownThe nucleus of downtown Montral is located between Boulevard Ren Lvesque and Sherbrooke Street running parallel to the river bounded by Guy and StDenis Streets It is best characterized by its bold new office skyscrapers cultural complexes and shopping centers crowding in on a diehard bunch of old churches museums and allnight

Reclining Nude and more austere statues of Scottish poet Robert Burns and Canadian Prime Ministers Wilfrid Laurier and John MacDonald The Sun Life skyscraper built in  is the citys oldest Theres a summer city tourist information kiosk on the south side of the square and a yearround office north of the square at  rue SteCatherine OuestNortheast along Boulevard Ren Lvesque is the RomanCatholic cathedral of Montral something of a visual oddity at least for European visitors The cathedral of MarieReineduMonde Mary Queen of the World is a thcentury halfsize replica of St Peters Basilica in Rome Halfsize but still massive enoughinside the nave is  m  ft long the transept is  m  ft long and the vault of the dome is  m  ft high Beneath that dome over the high altar is another replica of St Peters Berninis celebrated gilded bronze canopy Unfortunately there is nothing to match Berninis great square to give you a proper perspective and the church is dwarfed by the huge Queen Elizabeth Hotel and the Sun Life skyscraperThe new gigantism continues with Place VilleMarie  dominated by the other side of the Queen Elizabeth Canadian National Railways Central Station and the soaring Royal Bank building an intersecting crossshaped tower designed by IM Pei The Qubec provincial tourist information office is at the northern corner of the square near the intersection of Peel and St Catherine Street WestBut Place VilleMarie is above all the starting point of Montrals vast underground city which acts as an ecological punchline to the joke of a Qubec winter In selfdefense against five or six months of ice snow and slush  pedestrians frequent a complete alternative city of shops cinemas nightclubs restaurants and cafs Hotel residents can spend a whole night out on the town in the winter months without overcoat or galoshes And its almost as popular on a sweltering day in July Some  km  miles of subterranean galleries linked by Mtro stretch across the city taking in Place

opened in  during the grand building spree of the Montral Olympic Games Montrals NeighborhoodsFrom a local point of view Vieux Montral is a tourist attraction for the landmarks of the citys historical beginnings while downtown is for business and special nights out But the real color and spice of the peoples everyday life is to be found in their neighborhoodsAnd youll find in the architecture the missing links between the Frenchinspired homes of Vieux Montral and the international anonymity of the city centers thcentury skyscrapers While the bourgeoisies redbrick or stone houses are clearly inspired by Georgian and Victorian London and grander residences by the country houses and chteaux of continental Europe the workingclass row houses with outside iron staircases leading to upper floors thus saving space inside are a more characteristic Montral featureAlmost a neighborhood all to itself Boulevard StLaurent used to mark the border between the AngloCanadians to the west and the

monuments of Qubec Citys past triumphs and tribulations but even more alert to the colors and smells of the living presentQubec is said to be derived from an Algonquin word meaning where the river narrows and this becomes most apparent when you see the citys great outcrop of rock jutting out over the St Lawrence It was named Cap Diamant after the shiny stones that Jacques Cartier mistook for diamonds see page  Thus the city dominated river traffic and prospered from a flourishing trade in fur lumber shipbuilding tanneries furniture and textiles Modern shipping and the advent of the

craggy canyons above the fastflowing river is the pioneer country that made British Columbia Driving east from Vancouver on the TransCanada Highway and following the Fraser River north to its tributary the Thompson you are backtracking along the great exploration route traced by intrepid fur traders from the prairies to the Pacific Its also the route unerringly followed by millions of

hundred inhabitants was once a gold rush boomtown and the major construction depot for the CPRThe strands of BCs destiny come together where the Fraser Canyon narrows at the torrential rapids of Hells Gate For thousands of years this point in the rivers descent to the ocean was the local native peoples favored fishing spot for the salmon swimming to their spawning grounds It was here in  that they helped NorWester fur trader Simon Fraser with his canoe past the rapids over a swaying ropeway of vines strung along the canyon wall enabling him to follow to the ocean the river that bears his name In  the CNR blocked the salmons passage with rockblasts through the canyon for the railway The consequent  percent reduction of the annual sockeye salmon catch was remedied only  years later when multimilliondollar steelandconcrete channels were built for the fish The native peoples are back again in areas like this leaning far out over precarious rocky ledges to pluck with dip nets just a tiny amount of salmon compared with the millions caught by the commercial fisheries at the Fraser estuary Take the cable car across the gorge for a closeup view of the rapids For a taste of what the fuss is all about try a grilled salmon lunch at the restaurant by the cablecar terminalThe Thompson River joins the Fraser at Lytton Before turning east on the TransCanada Highway to follow the
