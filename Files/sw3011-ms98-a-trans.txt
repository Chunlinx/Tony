              all right so uh you live in Dallas   yes i live in Dallas   now i understand that um the the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down   yeah i think right now its its kind of bad uh i dont live in a house i live in an apartment   oh   are are you in a house okay   yeah uhhuh yeah we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington   well i guess the best i can do is is uh compare apartments  if i can compare the one that i have now with the one that i had the last time the one that i have now uh       has a lot more amenities i guess is the right word than the one that i moved out of uh this one you know gave us free cable and uh ceiling fans and uh it was practically new when i moved in here and the carpet was new and   huh do you live in the highrise   no its not a highrise its just a a two story building   uhhuh   uh but theres you know there there are a lot of buildings but its just two stories uh on the second floor they have they dont have a patio but they have a sunroom instead of the patio on the first floor um where i am theres a patio   oh okay so so you just you have one floor all to yourself oh okay   yeah the rooms are nice and large and lets see i have i have two bedrooms and uh   oh thats nice do you get your own washer dryer   well i i i have a washer and dryer area and i i did buy the washer and dryer but they didnt provide it the one that i moved from didnt didnt have a place to put put them and thats one of the reasons that i did move   oh yeah that is nice   yeah get tired of dragging clothes to the Laundromat     yeah   so tell me about   yeah ive always uh been pretty lucky the real estate out heres been pretty good its uh the the prices of well the prices came down last year weve we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome  the past uh   yeah   uh year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia it just never happened before so its really surprising everybody  all the developers dont know what to do   uhhuh just its real good yeah its a good time to buy if youre in the market   yeah unfortunately were uh we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids and we have a three bedroom house and its pretty much filled up right now   umhum oh so you want a bigger one   yeah umhum get an extra bedroom or a basement right now its just a a single level rambler   uhhuh one thing about the houses in uh in Dallas they dont uh utilize basements the way they did in New York       my parents in New York had uh a uh three family house   uhhuh   actual actually it was a two family house where the the um the downstairs and the second floor they had and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment   oh   and uh they had a basement and they you know they finished the basement and they were able to rent that out also but uh in Dallas i i just i i just havent seen basements in houses   yeah yeah   and ive looked at a lot of them   yeah a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there and thats what he said was that you know it just wasnt something that people had down there they put pools and garages on but uh no basements   no its not right i havent i havent i have yet to see a basement in a house   hum maybe its all the sand is there a lot of sand in i always think its like a desert i dont know   when i think of Dallas always     well no  no no no you know i dont see that kind of sand here um there are some areas though where where they have a problem with uh the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the   uhhuh   to the uh or the foundation sinking or something you know just a just a little bit some more than others but you you have to know the right spot to to pick where that doesnt happen and uh   yeah well out here we um we live in what used to be uh like a prairie or whatever a natural you know natural grasslands and uh they its just you go down four inches and you get to sandstone well fourteen inches you get to sandstone   uhhuh yeah   and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast  its just solid sandstone   i see huh where did you say youre at Colorado   no Virginia yeah its sort of unusual really most of Virginia is clay   Virginia Virginia thats right uhhuh anywhere near uh Virginia Beach huh   oh yeah uhhuh  yeah my uh my folks used to live there back before i was born they lived there   oh uhhuh well different areas in Dallas have different kind in uh in Texas ill say because down in east Texas theres a lot of red clay and um   uhhuh   in the in the Dallas you know Fort Worth city areas you dont see that   yeah well uh Texas is a big state so i imagine the the type of houses and uh things like that are truly different from area to area  but uh   yeah yeah well   thats the same way out here because um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington   uhhuh   and anything inside that beltway the highway the real estates forty thousand dollars more expensive   yeah   so you know you really cant afford i i i could never afford a house inside the beltway thats why we came out here this is called the the the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from DC twenty five   oh   from the city but um its considered the country since its uh you know that far out but um yeah we live out by Dulles Airport   well i see   yeah and uh  thats one of the few places still in northern Virginia they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here and you know its its still pretty rural   umhum   uh not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore land has gotten so expensive they just cant afford to have low income housing like that   so is your house in an area by itself i mean   no were in a development theres uh yeah theres another one half an acre away or a quarter acre away rather   not connected to another one oh but its not theyre not connected are they uhhuh   oh no huhuh yeah its uh a stand alone single family home i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up   yeah   uh my folks um had an apartment for a while when we were kids but um for the most part i they they always had you know and Pennsylvania always had a single family home and so   uhhuh   you know as soon as we could we we got a single family home and thats all i ever knew growing up so i stayed in a townhouse for uh two years and then uh saved up enough money to to get a   uhhuh
