          what are your favorite programs   uh its kind of hard to put my finger on a on a favorite TV program however uh one that ive been watching for a number of years is Dallas and uh   oh how funny     and uh its going to be going off the air uh lets see a week from Friday a week from tonight its going to be its last show so ive ive kind of enjoyed watching over the years ive been disappointed in it and also pleased in it and uh i was uh greatly disappointed uh when i did move down to Plano to uh find out that the uh the uh great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house           ive seen the sign that goes to there ive well i think ive seen it in the distance     umhum   but i have not even seen it and i have not seen the program   oh well thats a shame   so and and uh i know when we went to London it was really funny uh people recognized Dallas Texas by the the Texas uh the the Cowboys and by that program   umhum yes   and thats thats the two things they associate with Dallas Texas so i and i they asked me several several times they ask me why are there two bridges       and i didnt know what they were talking about it took me a long time theyre talking about the viaducts   umhum   is that that is right isnt it   yeah   because they ask me why are there two bridges going into Dallas       darned if i know  i was blank looking you know i felt really dumb   well it its uh when you look at the uh you know route seventy five coming down there i i mean its actually a bridge but its a bridge over top of roadway theres no water there i mean uh   well theres water in the Trinity i thought it was to going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity   yeah well theres there um well they i think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas one from the east and one from the west   oh do they oh   and thats why   oh i see   uh it kind of confuses people but uh uh i enjoy a a a lot of different comedies um i think its mainly for an escape um you know you uh my job is not the most thrilling in the world and uh i enjoy laughing and uh some of the shows that uh are on the air some are just purely you know brain drainers   uhhuh   and then theres other ones that uh deal with uh in a funny manner uh socially relevant things and uh one show that comes to mind is like Designing Women   i think that is just a hoot thats one of those few that i do watch and the television is on my husband likes to watch TV its on   um yeah   i usually read and watch TV   umhum   and usually i can handle both at the same time you know because i am pretty sure where the TV plots going   yeah umhum   but thats one of the few that i just actually watch because its funny   yes   i really enjoy that one   yes it uh it has been very entertaining and and also uh the the issues they deal with uh really tends to open open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems and uh ive ive really enjoyed that one since it came on um dont like the politics surrounding the program though but i mean other than that you know there seems to be a little fighting in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses but uh and then uh ive kind of gotten hooked on PBS stuff uh public uh TV uh i like things like Nova and uh some of the the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff i just enjoy watching that stuff   now we watch a lot of those uh and the ones that sometimes will hook me to put down my book will be the one there was one uh recently about the Gettysburg Address   umhum   and they wrapped a fictional story around it   uhhuh   and i thought that was well done   umhum   and and it it caught my attention i wound up watching the whole thing um i guess the awards ceremonies and there seems to be dozens of them per year       maybe ive spent two minutes watching to see what they have on and if they make a fool of themselves or not         but uh they could take that whole collection and it would disappear and id never miss it for a minute   yeah   particularly the beauty pageants i i particularly take issue with those i i really dislike those   well im one of those rare guys who i i rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event um if ever watch one uh theres just not that much im im interested in um for a while i i i watched some football but ive just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and and watch a baseball game   you know my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys and now were out running around and if theyre if theyre playing hell turn it on while were in the car to see what the score is and hell listen but even ive said hey look youre fascinated with this you sit and listen to the Cowboys let me run in here and ill do some things and ill come back and you dont have to miss hell say nah nah nah and he doesnt he doesnt watch it he listen like i say if its convenient hell listen to it   umhum   but he just doesnt watch them on TV like he used to   well i think it was great when they were you know like world champs and they were doing real well i uh i personally i i came from the Washington area and so i was a big Washington Redskins fan   oh oh those people yeah   and uh when i came down to Dallas it was uh you know i found myself rooting for the home team i uh in fact i have a uh a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker   oh how neat   the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys   well i actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans   yeah oh wow   and i i i made the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything and uh that was   hm   that was a lot of fun but   yeah   i dont know i havent been as ill tell you what i love to watch and this is not this is rarely on television but what is a lot of fun to go attend is this arena football yeah i like its so much better than straight football   hm no i havent seen that   it it doesnt it has a lot of different rules the field is half the size   umhum umhum   and theres no they cant call time and things like that it moves a lot faster   uh gee ill have to try to catch that sometime if   uh again i think it may be on cable more than anything else we dont have cable   yeah thats proba bly true yeah we dont either i uh i couldnt rationalize paying you know its like if i pay for a movie channel then i have to watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them and if i you know if i didnt use cable for anything else other than the basic well i can get that for free and well i dont really dont need CNN i see enough bad news all the time i dont need to see more of it so i ive kind of uh rationalized that its its probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see   well   and of course when we were living in Texas it was real convenient with Tom Thumb you know having movies uh back then it was ninety nine cents i mean go   oh theyre everywhere theyre on every corner everything youve ever wanted to see   yeah and you can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like HBO or Cinemax   well and i like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that   umhum   or it becomes snack time for various reasons you can put you know the only thing this Dance with Wolves i want to see it in a theater   yeah oh yes i do too   because i understand that that your youll lose fifty percent of it if you dont   yeah and i ive been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it she she doesnt like going to movie theaters because usually theyre dirty   and uh you know she just doesnt like them and um she doesnt think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie and ive told her you know everybody i know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick   thats what i hear too   and uh so im im hoping i can get her talked into it soon   well my husband smokes hes one of the dinosaurs that still smokes and you cant smoke in movie theaters   hm   and that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies but i havent really cared up until this point but i we are this weekend going to go see Dance with Wolves its thats it we will do it   um thats great   so yeah finally   yeah but as as far as uh regular TV shows i mean ive got some some shows that i that that i would be afraid to admit to you that ive actually sat down and watched         and then theres theres others that uh uh i i wish i had time to see its like i enjoy watching Cheers its very funny some of the things in it are mindless but i i just dont have time to watch it um i think about the only night that i really sit in front of the TV set all night long probably is on Monday nights and because um i work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday Monday night im just worn out so i kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and and look over things and i can sit in front of the TV set and look at you know do go through my mail and and watch TV at the same time   well i tend my job tends to be very demanding   umhum   and to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isnt as bad as it used to
