        and theyre talking about uh federal government arent they     im sure well actually probably any government but the federal ones the big one   hm   so uh so what do you what do you think in the short term we should be doing to to improve it   well i saw a program on it recently and and it said everywhere time they cut you know like fifty five million dollars on a certain thing then they brag about how much money they cut and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and thats why the budget is never balanced   right right   The Gramm Rudman Act didnt solve the problem they just take all the money that they say they cut and they spend it somewhere else   yeah   or they you know they pad out their staff or you know spend it in bounced checks at the commissary or     huh ah yeah im getting pretty kind of disgusted with the uh um the  you know the fact that theyre counting um a reduced deficit as being some big step right i mean first of all were were we were about ready to hit the largest deficit i mean this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever and two a deficit is i mean the deficit is only uh is  as as far from a balanced budget you reduce the deficit you youre still not youre still not youre still overspending   umhum   right i mean its its just the amount that youre overspending and and this is you know and for some reason uh the way that the reporting is going on now it seems like like the uh the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount um yeah i i i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh sort of the the uh well i mean its it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that youve got um people you know trying to trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected   umhum   and uh there isnt any sort of overall accountability and and uh i dont know i guess i suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that were gonna have is is is exposure and information and and i dont know that that in in general the American people are that interested you know to listen to to as much uh uh you know i mean youre gonna have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how and how how partisan and how  and how self interested their their motives are and and take it to task for it   umhum   because uh its not gonna get solved if you know if people are still trying to you know like besides like you were saying you said you know where you uh hey we just you know we just cut defense let me grab some of this money for my state now and then we can throw in some highway bill or we can throw in some you know some other kind of thing and uh its a pretty vicious uh vicious cycle i dont know   well i think they should they should limit the Senate to one term one six year term   that yeah thats being batted around i uh my my dad was always a proponent a proponent of that he uh he felt that that would   umhum   get people involved who were who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants yeah   right and and dont let them come back and and uh keep Congress to um two terms and two years a piece and then itll be overturning and they wont have the same people there all the time   yeah right   and then all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks and and thatll keep them busy enough so that they wont have as much influence     right uhhuh   and because thats one of the things one of the biggest things is that um the fact that theyre always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another whether its the oil companies or the automotive companies and like the air bag thing the air bag came out what twenty years ago   right   and only now theyre getting it put in cars you know and the oil companies arent really arent responsible you know   uhhuh yeah   the Valdez proved that and then the government doesnt jump on them hard enough to make them do anything it shouldve been done immediately   right yeah  yeah i think i think that thats probably right because in terms of long term you you just got to get people um i mean  at one point at least on a local level um going into politics is you know what youre doing is is really trying to serve the community right i mean you dont expect to make any money out of it you know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame but   umhum   but its uh you put in a lot of work in exchange for that and and i dont have the feeling that national level politicians are are at all like that you know   right no they listen to wherever the money is   yeah and uh you know and i think that the the the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with uh you know with inept inept politicians or people who dont know how to deal with the public   right  yeah theyre not as efficient thats for sure   but on the other hand maybe thats in a lot of them
