                    Introduction        Coronary heart disease CHD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the        United States and is associated with substantial economic cost  Hyperlipidemia        represents an important modifiable risk factor in the development and progression of CHD        Estimates indicate that nearly  million American adults have total blood cholesterol        levels of greater than  mmoll  mgdl with  having levels greater than         mmoll  mgdl  Identification and treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia play        an essential role in the primary and secondary prevention of CHD        Currently evidencebased practice guidelines focus on lowdensity lipoprotein        cholesterol LDLC as the primary target for risk reduction therapy and recommend that the        intensity and target goals of LDLClowering therapy should be adjusted to individual        absolute risk for CHD  Absolute CHD risk is categorized as low moderate or high based        on the presence or absence of CHD CHDequivalent conditions and major risk factors other        than LDLC While therapeutic lifestyle changes are integral to general risk reduction        drug treatment proves necessary for selected patients whose absolute risk is high andor        whose LDLC is inadequately controlled with lifestyle modifications alone Among existing        drug therapies hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors more commonly        known as statins provide a generally welltolerated and effective option for lowering        LDLC levels and decreasing the likelihood of subsequent CHD events         Despite the compelling evidence of statins therapeutic benefits the literature abounds        with documentation of wide treatment gaps in clinical practice  Available research        however offers only a limited understanding of how statin therapy varies by CHD risk        particularly for statineligible patients in the moderaterisk group Also national data        are limited regarding recent changes in statin use        Using serial crosssectional data from  through  we tracked trends in statin        use in the United States during ambulatory visits categorized by CHD risk with or without        a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia In addition we analyzed the independent associations of        patient and physician characteristics with statin use for insights as to how to target        interventions to improve statin use                    Methods                  Data Sources          Annual data from through  were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical          Care Survey NAMCS and the outpatient department component of the National Hospital          Ambulatory Medical Care Survey NHAMCS The National Center for Health Statistics          provides complete descriptions of both surveys and yearly data at          httpwwwcdcgovnchsaboutmajorahcdahcdhtm These surveys particularly NAMCS          have been validated against other data sources  and have also been utilized in          past research of cholesterol management           In brief NAMCS captures healthcare services provided by officebased physicians          while NHAMCS assesses services offered at hospital outpatient departments Both surveys          utilize multistage probability sampling procedures enabling the generation of nationally          representative estimates Between  and  annual participation rates among          physicians selected for NAMCS averaged  while the participation rate in NHAMCS by          selected hospitals with outpatient departments was  In our study we combined NAMCS          and NHAMCS data to obtain a wider range of outpatient settings and a broader          socioeconomic spectrum of patients seeking ambulatory care          Standard encounter forms were completed for a systematic random sample of patient          visits during randomly assigned reporting periods Item nonresponse rates were mostly           or less in both surveys for all years Yearly encounter forms varied slightly between          NAMCS and NHAMCS and were revised every two years Our analysis focused on domains of          data that were consistently collected in both NAMCS and NHAMCS for the time period           including patient demographic and geography characteristics reasons for visit          up to three diagnoses up to three new and continuing medications up to five in           and six in  and lifestyle counseling services provided or ordered at          the visit                          Participants                      CHD risk categorization            We estimated CHD risk for adults aged  y and older based on risk factor counting            CHD risk was mutually exclusively categorized as low  risk factors moderate             risk factors or high CHD other atherosclerotic diseases or diabetes The            moderaterisk group included visits by patients without CHD or equivalent but with at            least two of the following risk factors age for men  y for women  y            cigarette smoking or a physicianreported diagnosis of hypertension Unfortunately            the other two major CHD risk factorshighdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels and            family history of premature CHDwere not captured in either data source Also neither            data source provided actual cholesterol measurements Disease conditions were            identified by International Classification of Disease ICD codes as well as by the            appropriate reasonforvisit codes that are specific to NAMCS and NHAMCS For instance            we identified patients as having hyperlipidemia if their encounter forms contained an            International Classification of Disease code within  For the sake of this            study patients whose encounter forms did not indicate the presence of a condition were            assumed to not have that condition                                Patient visit characteristics            Nonclincal characteristics included patient age gender raceethnicity medical            insurance visit status United States census region metropolitan area status            physician specialty and practice setting Medical insurance was classified as            privatecommercial public ie Medicare and Medicaid or other eg workers            compensation or selfpay Visit status distinguished firsttime visits from return            visits to a practice Physician specialty was available only from NAMCS which            contributed more than  of the total visits for each of the study years We            categorized physician specialties as cardiology internal medicine general and family            practice or other                                Measures            Of primary interest were the rate of statin use relative to CHD risk and the            relationship of statin use to patient visit characteristics The rate of statin use was            calculated as the proportion of patient visits where a statin was reported ie            atorvastatin lovastatin pravastatin simvastatin or fluvastatin Before its removal            from the market in  cerivastatin was used scarcely  among visits by            patients with hyperlipidemia and therefore is not reported in this study Measuring            the rate of statin use by CHD risk category provided a relative indicator of            appropriate prescribing patterns that is the prevalence of statin use should be            highest among highrisk patients for whom secondary prevention is a priority            Variations of statin use by patient visit characteristics if detected would reflect a            lack of equity in processes of care in that uniform practices are expected unless            evidencebased guidelines recommend otherwise                                Analyses            Statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Windows software SAS Institute            Cary North Carolina United States and SAScallable SUDAAN software RTI Research            Triangle Park North Carolina United States to account for sampling weights and the            complex survey design The unit of analysis is the patient visit We report national            annual means of the rate of statin use by CHD risk category and corresponding             confidence intervals for the years  through               tests examined the association of statin use with individual            patient visit characteristics for combined  NAMCS and NHAMCS data The            independent effect of each patient visit characteristic on statin use after controlling            for all other characteristics was assessed with multivariate logistic regression                                      Results        In  visits by patients at moderate or high risk involved higher proportions of        older patients mean age  y than lowrisk patient visits mean age  y and        consequently were more likely to be covered by public insurance particularly Medicaid        Table  Moderate and highrisk patient visits also were made up of more men and return        patients In addition a greater percentage of highrisk patient visits  were seen by        cardiologists than patient visits at low and moderate risk  and  respectively        Internists and general and family practitioners played a dominant role in the care of        moderate and highrisk patients accounting for  of visits by moderaterisk patients        and  of visits by highrisk patients Distributions by raceethnicity geographic        region residence area and practice setting did not differ by CHD risk Overall the        majority of patient visits were return visits to officebased physicians made by        nonHispanic whites and residents living within metropolitan statistic areas Patient        visits were distributed similarly across the four geographic regions with a slightly        higher proportion from the southern region        Throughout the study period statins were primarily used among patients whose visit        involved reported hyperlipidemia representing  of all statin use in  and  in         Statin use increased nearly fold from   confidence interval  of all        visits with reported hyperlipidemia in  to   in  but then declined to          in  Figure  Of note however the annual rate of increase in        frequency of patient visits with reported hyperlipidemia was  in  and  in         while it averaged only  through  The dominance of statins as lipidlowering agents        grew markedly from  of all lipidlowering medications in  to  in  Figure         Among available statins lovastatin remained the therapeutic choice through  after        which it was surpassed by other statins particularly simvastatin and then atorvastatin        Figure  Atorvastatin constituted   and simvastatin   of all        statin use in         As expected high CHD risk patient visits resulted in greater statin use and the        divergence in statin use among the three risk categories has grown in recent years        Absolute increases in the rate of statin use were greatest for highrisk patient visits        with or without reported hyperlipidemiaa  percentagepoint increase from  of all        visits in  to  in followed by a nine percentagepoint increase  to  for        moderaterisk patient visits and a  percentagepoint increase  to  for        lowrisk patient visits Figure  Statin use in the moderaterisk group peaked at          in  Similarly the rate of statin use in the highrisk group declined        slightly from  to         Among patient visits with reported hyperlipidemia statins were used in   of        highrisk visits and   of moderaterisk visits in  The highrisk groups        statin use rate rose to   in  and was   in  Likewise the        rate in the moderaterisk group climbed to   in  and stabilized at          in  In addition lifestyle counseling ie regarding diet exercise or        smoking cessation occurred in only   of new and general medical examination        visits in  for patients who had moderate CHD risk and were diagnosed with        hyperlipidemia Improvements over time in counseling rates were minimal        The increase in statin use with CHD risk and with the year of study persisted after        controlling for physicianreported hyperlipidemia number of medications and nonclinical        patient visit characteristics Table  Moderate to highrisk patient visits had a         to fold greater likelihood of taking a statin relative to visits by patients at low        risk Statin use was approximately three times as likely in  and  as in  and         Additionally lower statin use was independently associated with younger patient age        female gender African American background versus nonHispanic white noncardiologist        care and fewer total reported medications                    Discussion        Despite significant increases from  to  in use of statins associated with        hyperlipidemic patient visits the magnitude of increases is smaller than expected and the        rate of use remains suboptimal according to the best available evidence The underuse of        statins is most prominent among visits by patients at high or moderate risk of CHD who do        not have a physiciannoted diagnosis of hyperlipidemia but may nonetheless be eligible for        lipidlowering drug therapy Previous research reports that physicians are more likely to        diagnose hyperlipidemia if laboratory reports show abnormal lipid levels  However the        normal ranges of lipid levels on many laboratory reports do not take into account        individual patients absolute risk        When evaluating statin use across different CHD risk categories the observed trends        raise several issues Both the rate of statin use and the absolute increases in the rate        over time were positively associated with the level of CHD risk which appropriately        conforms to the notion of risk stratification The associations persisted after adjusting        for potentially confounding factors such as a hyperlipidemia diagnosis and nonclinical        patient visit characteristics Even so in  one year after the publication of Adult        Treatment Panel III  statins were reportedly used in only  of patient visits with        established CHD or its equivalents and the average rate was no higher than  among        highrisk visits where a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia also was noted These data suggest a        dramatic treatment gap Another analysis based on national data estimated that  of        Americans with existing CHD would benefit from drug therapy to achieve the target LDLC        goal of  mmoll  mgdl or less assuming a  LDLC reduction with diet         However only  of those eligible individuals received lipidlowering drug therapy        suggesting a gap of   These obvious treatment gaps are disconcerting especially in        light of the recent Adult Treatment Panel III update that supports more intensive        lipidlowering drug therapy for patients at high and moderately high risk for a heart        attack Barriers to adequate treatment of highrisk patients may stem from the patient        eg lack of drug adherence concern about adverse effects inadequate knowledge of their        hyperlipidemia and drug cost the physician eg lack of guideline awareness failure        to measure lipid levels and overestimation of actual treatment and the healthcare        system eg lack of monitoring and followup and emphasis on acute medical problems         If the current practice continues the observed treatment gaps are expected to        persist or even widen        While statins deliver the greatest benefits when used for secondary prevention evidence        continues to accumulate that suggests an important role of statins in the primary        prevention of cardiovascular events particularly for patients at increased risk         Our data show an increase in statin use from  of moderaterisk patient visits in  to         in  but without continued growth subsequently Optimal proportions could not be        determined because of the lack of detailed clinical data Nonetheless National Health and        Nutrition Examination Survey III data showed that  of  million adult Americans        without CHD who had two or more risk factors had an LDLC level above the recommended         mmoll  mgdl and that  would remain eligible for drug therapy even after a         decrease in LDLC with diet  In addition Fedder and colleagues found a doubling        effect in the number eligible for primary prevention drug therapy by switching to        Framingham risk scoring  Other researchers have reported that the proportions of        treatmenteligible primary prevention patients who received no drug therapy reached as high        as   In our study statin use was reported in only  of moderaterisk patient        visits for which a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia was noted which is surprisingly low given        that the entire group would be expected to benefit from statin therapy We also concur with        other researchers who have discussed the role that inadequate lifestyle counseling plays in        the existing cholesterol treatment gaps  Our data show that lifestyle counseling        occurred during fewer than  of new and general medical examination visits by        moderaterisk patients even though these types of visits arguably represent better        opportunities for counseling services than return illnessfocused visits        It is intriguing to note that earlier increases in statin use were not sustained in         and  Studies using alternative data sources are needed to corroborate this        observation and detailed market research is necessary for understanding the underlying        causes of this unexpected decline in use We speculate that the observed trends may be        partially explained by discordant rates of increase in the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia        versus the prescribing of statins Also NAMCS and NHAMCS data released after  will        help determine whether the noted declines are due to random fluctuations in data        reporting        Wide gaps between evidencebased lipidlowering therapy and physician practice were        reported in many other western countries as well For instance a survey conducted in nine        European countries found that only  of patients with confirmed CHD received        lipidlowering medications  Likewise in a populationbased study from the        Netherlands merely  of individuals eligible for lipidlowering drugs were actually        treated         In spite of being clearly underused statins increasingly dominate lipidlowering drug        therapy accounting for  of all lipidlowering medications used in  which confirms        the trends seen in United States retail pharmacy dispensing data  Also in concert with        other researchers  we observed a shift in the leading statin prescribed over time        from lovastatin to simvastatin and then to atorvastatin corresponding to their market        entry Atorvastatin accounted for over half of all statin use in  Even though most        statins share similar tolerability some evidence shows that atorvastatin has greater        dosespecific potency for lowering LDLC and total cholesterol         Additionally our data add support to available literature documenting inequities in use        of statins for patients with different social and clinical characteristics  Of        particular note are the lower rates of statin use in atrisk younger patients females        AfricanAmericans and patients cared for by noncardiologists These findings may be        useful for guiding targeted interventions that aim to bring physician practice into        agreement with published guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction        Our findings must be interpreted in the context of data limitations Although both NAMCS        and NHAMCS are designed to produce nationally representative estimates these estimates are        not linked to individuals but to patient visits As a result reported statin use may        overestimate the actual administration because patients prescribed drug therapy likely make        more visits because of greater disease severity andor the need of frequent followups        Also we are missing people with risk factors who have not been seen by a physician or        whose risk factors failed to be recorded On the other hand underestimation is also        possible for example because of physicians lack of awareness or incomplete reporting of        patient medication uses However the failure to inquire or report an important agent such        as a statin may be a clinical oversight in itself and contribute to therapeutic gaps The        degree of inaccuracy in our estimates is perhaps small however as suggested by the        comparability of the current results to previous reports        Lack of detailed clinical data prohibits accurate risk assessment based on Framingham        risk scoring While the risk factor counting algorithm that we used may simulate practical        risk estimation by many physicians it precludes the assessment of appropriateness of        statin use in relation to the latest lipidlowering guidelines This creates difficulty        interpreting the rate of statin use observed for the moderaterisk group In particular        adequate information is not available to differentiate varying levels of absolute risk        among the moderaterisk group We likely misclassified some patients as moderate risk when        they may have actually been high risk despite the absence of CHD or CHD equivalents On the        other hand indications for statins might be marginal for some young patients with modestly        elevated risk factors A final caveat is that neither NAMCS nor NHAMCS captures patient        compliance or outcomes although these are perhaps separate issues from physician adherence        to evidencebased medicine        Despite the acknowledged limitations NAMCS and NHAMCS cover a longer consecutive time        span and provide more complete information about diseasespecific physician activities than        many other national data bases eg the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey the National        Health Assessment Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health Interview        Survey        In conclusion persistent gaps in statin therapy suggest a continued need for improved        CHD risk stratification of all patients and treatment with statins when indicated        Information technology and broader national policy around quality measurement and reporting        are just two potential strategies that could be used to improve current practice        Patientcentered interventions should strengthen patient education and improve patient        access to different treatment options Interventions should be targeted to atrisk patients        whose drug regimens need to be reassessed and to physicians particularly        noncardiologists whose practices need be improved Guidelines for cardiovascular risk        reduction treatment and determination of the specific patients who can benefit from statin        therapy will continue to evolve Indications for use in primary CHD prevention are likely        to expand for statins Given the observed practice shortfalls drug therapy in        moderaterisk patients remains an important priority for improvement
