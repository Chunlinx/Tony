                                 Refugee Showdown            The European press engagedin namecalling Wednesday over the handling of the Kosovar refugee crisis Inan exclusive interview with La Stampa of Turin Italy NATO SecretaryGeneral JavierSolana said that after much debate European countries had agreed that refugees should be airlifted to Western Europe But the Guardian of Londonreported on its front page that the countries of the European Union are atloggerheads on the issue and insist that they can absorb no more than a th of the one million Albanian Kosovars ousted by Serbia Thecountries are heading for a showdown over which of them will accept refugeeshow many at what cost and on what terms the paper said            On the Guardian soped page columnist Polly Toynbee attacked British government policy sayingits not body bags the Government fears at the moment its live Kosovanbodies swamping our shores In another British liberal paper the Independent  Francewas condemned for its initial refusal subsequently reversed to accept anyrefugees with reference to the similar attitude struck during the Bosnianwar and Germany was attacked for drastically reducing the numbers it hadbeen expected to take            Frances leading newspaper Le Monde  said in aneditorial Wednesday that the French government has good and solid reasons fornot wanting to accept the Kosovarsthat to do so would be to condone ethniccleansing and to play Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevics game But itadded that Prime Minister Lionel Jospins position would be clearer and lesssubject to the suspicion that he was only worried about reopening the countrysimmigration debate if he carried his argument to its logical conclusion Thisbeing that the refugees can only be returned to Kosovo if there is some kind ofintervention on the ground The defence of the right of the refugees to returnhome is a slogan empty of meaning if one continues to exclude categorically thecommittal of ground troops the editorial concluded            Like Solana in hisinterview with La Stampa Western European newspapers stand unitedbehind NATOs outright rejection of Milosevics ceasefire offer and the ideaof sending in ground troops seems to be gathering ever stronger support ButSecretaryGeneral Solana stressed the limitations of the NATO offensive Onecant do miracles with countries with pilots who belong to countries that haveparliaments he said One has to go forward step by step General WesleyClark furthermore has two constrictions to safeguard the lives of the pilotsand to guarantee that there is no collateral damage So this is not a war inthe classic sense but a military campaign The conservative Daily Telegraph ofLondon said in an editorial that Milosevics promised respite from houndingkilling and raping Kosovars does not begin to meet alliance requirements Thealliance should keep in mind the infamy of what is happening and hold true tothe principles of democracy individual liberty and the rule of law which itsfounding treaty proclaims            The Israeli papers continued to wrestle Tuesday they werenot published Wednesday with the analogies between the Kosovo crisis and theHolocaust and with Israels wartime debt to the Serbs As a Jew I am sure itis my obligation to come to the aid of Milosevics victims in Kosovo ElieWiesel author Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate wrote onthe front page of Yediot Aharanot  Some say that when we the Jews inEurope needed the worlds intervention no one came to our help But does thatmean we must be indifferent today On the contrary What the world did not dothen it is doing now Yet he dismissed comparisons between Milosevic andAdolf Hitler What is happening in Kosovo is not a Holocaust A Holocaust is agenocidal plan Milosevic is committing grave crimes but the comparison ofother disasters to the Holocaust has led to the diminution of its significanceEvery disaster has become a Holocaust and every criminal a Hitler            While the Russian papers Wednesday gave top billingto domestic stories especially the arrest warrant for President BorisYeltsins tycoon friend Boris Berezovsky on charges of money laundering theycovered the Kosovar refugee crisis in a manner often strongly critical of theWestern alliance Izvestia said the West was losing its image as awise democratic and civilized collective force  Rather as represented byNATO the West is doing insane things contrary to the fundamental principlesof democracy Allegedly for the sake of their own salvation the KosovarAlbanians are being crushed from the air along with Serbs and MontenegransTrying to prevent the Kosovars mass exodus to Europe NATO did nothing butprovoke it by its air strikes The Wests civilizing role seems to involve thedestruction for the first time since Hitler of Europes most beautifulcities  A game with no rules has started in the world and one beyond thelimits of law too There is only one step from this to the apocalypse itsaid            Finally an apology Ina last week I mistakenly referred to an article in the Toronto Globe and Mailattacking the NATO air strikes as an editorial when it was in fact a signedpiece by Marcus Gee
