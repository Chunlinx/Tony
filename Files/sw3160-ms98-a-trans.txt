                 well course my favorite team there is the Texas Rangers so  i watch them all the time and who do you watch   uh the Mets but i dont do that anymore  because uh theyre doing lousy  i dont know   the Mets this isnt their best season is it   no no   well the Rangers are the few games behind Minnesota but if we could win the next oh i guess wed win have to win most all of them we could still go to the to the race to do the   i think youre uh  definitely an avid fan huh   well i watched the two games the last two nights so   they just i gave up on the Mets around August you know   oh is that right   how many games out is Texas   pardon   how many games out are they   i think theyre out six and so they have to still win almost every single game that they have to play to the end now   right right yeah i think Minnesotas got to get like three wins or or Texas has to lose three games or some combination of that  well maybe next year   or else yeah yeah i dont know Minnesotas won a good game theyre theyre doing a good job this year i dont know   yeah they they are they are   they really but im gonna watch tonight because Nolan Ryans gonna pitch so i always like to watch him pitch   yeah whos whos who he used to be on the Mets a long time ago but whos whos who else is like Texass big players that that uh   yeah umhum well uh we just traded Buechele and i really liked him but but hes gone now  so i i guess uh Sierra i like to watch him bat   right Ruben right hes supposed to be good   yeah hes hes really good Francos good except that uh hes got injuries right now his hamstrings down in the bottom of his legs he cant run very well but it he usually hits a home run then he just trots around the bases its okay  and um   hes the shortstop though right Franco     yeah well theyve moved him now since he cant move that quickly since it hurts him   right   they moved him to second base and they moved Petralli into that area in that runs now in between the shortstop area and he takes second base   and Sierras an outfielder   um Sierra lets see yeah Sierras into is he middle field or left field hes not left field he must be center field   yeah i dont see i dont know the American League that well once in a while i watch the Yankees um but rarely and uh but this guy that im i work with is in this rotisserie league where they they choose   do you oh now whats that i dont know what that is   well you choose players and you do stuff based on stats and everything like that so hes always talking to me about the American League   oh   like he gets points for every time uh i think he has Ruben Sierra on his team and every time he hits a home run or steals a base or gets a hit he gets a certain amount of points and then you get pitchers and stuff like that   oh oh   so hes always talking about the American League which is like i said because i watch the Mets i dont really know that much about the American League   yeah thats hard   youre not an Astro fan   um no not too  not too much  i i guess i just dont watch them that much um       i like to watch the Oakland As play they have a lot of good players too but i havent watched them for a while so i dont know how theyre doing too well this season   no theyre not they they were doing well for a while but then they kind of fell off do you get all the games out there i mean you get you get to watch the As a lot and stuff like that   um once every so often mostly Rangers games come on because thats our area but um   right     every once in a while on a Saturday or a Sunday theyll put a another league on you know   right   but its it just depends how to you know how they fill the time sometimes anyway i um we got   this is my first conversation through this Texas Instruments thing   what   this is the first time ive done one of these conversations yeah   oh is it oh well thats kind of fun   so i didnt even expect it i just i happened to have the uh i didnt even know what my um  my personal identification number was i just happened to have the folder right in front of me im glad i brought it into work just     yeah uh isnt its a fun thing i think youll like it its a its a old thing to do and um anyway we just uh if you get run out of things to say then you say good bye  it was nice talking to you too   okay well its nice talking to you and uh be good thank you   and have a good day um byebye   okay byebye
