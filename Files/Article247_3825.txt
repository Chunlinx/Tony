                                 The Cartoon Mayor                        Dear Steve            I couldnt agree with you more about Mayor Giuliani andhis hollow showboating regarding the Brooklyn Museum controversy While much ofwhat passes for  th century modern art isabsolutely horseshitpainting an entire canvas red is mere laziness andclaiming that it has meaning doesnt make it soGiuliani seems determined tobase his whole political career on crushing the messy process that is popularculture and scapegoating people too weak to defend themselves            As New Yorkers will recall he launched his career bygoing after homeless guys who spritz your windshield at intersections anddemand a buck to finish the job OK so they were annoying but there are crackhouses that have enjoyed continuous operation during the years that the mayorhas been after the squeegee men Then he put all the accouterments of streetlife out of businessnewsstands hotdog stands street vendorsall of whichgave New York a sidewalklevel buzz that separated it from your averagesuburban mall Last year he attacked taxi drivers with fines forspeedingfrankly any cabby who can speed in thesechoked streets gets an extra tip from yours trulyand an array of nuisanceregulations designed to make their lives impossible I drove a cab for yearsand thought it was too hard for  a shift these days youre lucky if youmake  for  hours of backbreaking through the streets of Manhattan Whatkind of bully picks on guys who earn five bucks an hour            More frightening hes turned Times Square and itsmenagerie of wonderful filth and decadence into Disney World North The pornshops are all but gone nightclubs find it nearly impossible to function aftergetting busted all the time and now hes stopping the rent check to thebiggest cultural institution in Brooklyn What always made New York great wasits anarchic brew of mayhem and energy Giuliani is determined to replace bothwith sterility and bourgeois consumerism            OK back to comic strips After yesterdays missive anumber of people emailed me to remind me of Scott Adams Dilbert and of course its a great strip It speaks to thecubical culture in which many Americans including me until a few years agospend twothirds of their waking hours and does so with consistently funny gaglines Still theres quite a bit of repetition there too which I think isinevitable How can anyone draw  cartoons a year for  years or more andhave each idea be original I think thats why recent giants like Watterson Calvin and Hobbes  and Larson  The Far Side  quit after roughly a decade eachyou get prettytapped out at plus ideas and they had the class to recognize thatMoreover the daily papers are constantly shrinking the space available forcomic strips which means that its impossible to stretch out artistically            Ah Id forgotten all about editorial cartoonist RananLurie for whom I once toiled as a graphics assistant wage  an hour nobenefits in  for two months until you retrieved my repressed memoriesFortunately I dont read papers where he appears but his work is triteappallingly apolitical and graphically bereft of any character whatsoeverEven worse the guy never paid me for thinking up ideas crosshatchingetcyo Ranan with interest that comes to half the value of your Trump Towerapartment now I need the cash for drawing lessons man            But the greatest conflict in cartooning is about whichis more important Ideas or drawing It helps when a creator enjoys both a museand a good hand as you do Steve but the vast majority of cartoonists arelucky to have one or the other Editors it seems lean more to the graphicsside but I think people like Larson and James Thurber prove that you can drawgreat cartoons with lousy art I have yet to find a great cartoonist with bador nonexistent ideas In my case I know that the art has always been my weakpoint which is why I developed a highly stylized drawing style it also helpsto set it apart from the donkeyandelephant crowd of editorial cartoonistsand why I still take drawing lessons and study everything from old woodcuts toCuban comics I cant understand gifted artists who intentionally draw lesswell than theyre able to its a form of selfmutilation As for the ideaseither you have them or you dont and there isnt much you can do about iteither way            Speaking of Peter Max I hear hes made sort of acomeback on the s nostalgia bandwagonhe even had some show a few yearsback in Des Moines of all places            Very truly yoursTed
