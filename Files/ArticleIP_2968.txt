                                 The Rules            George Washington wasvirtuous but was virtuousness altogether a good thing This entirelyreasonable question turns out to be extremely old Stendhal posed it in thes in his novel Lucien Leuwen  in which the wealthy young Parisianhero contemplates fleeing the corruptions of monarchical old France for a newstart in virtuous republican America But would Stendhals hero be able tostand the virtuous republicans He considers paying a visit on GeorgeWashington himselfAmericas greatest manat home on his farm But would hefind Washingtons conversation bright and sparkling            Washington would have boredme to death Stendhals hero concludes American readers are aghast Iwould prefer by a hundred times the elegant manners of a corrupt heart            Now comesthe Library of America with a handsome new edition published on elegant paperwith a lustrous black cover of the writings of Washington himself more than athousand pages of letters and documents of every sort which allows us to judgefor ourselves The book makes a strange impression The Library of America inits admirable effort to present Americas literature and classic politicaldocuments in pristine form has adopted the rather extreme policy of publishingits volumes without any sort of introductory guide which is probably just aswell in the case of literary authors whose work is easily approached            Some authors require an introduction thoughpoliticalwriters especially The Library of America produced a fat page volume ofJefferson some years ago but Jeffersons writings turned out to be a shapelessheap of private letters and peculiar jottings intermixed with an occasionalmanifesto of immortal grandeurand to make your way through them unaided wasnearly impossible Likewise with the new Washington volume Washington was nota book writer or any kind of writer at all professionally speaking but tookquill in hand merely to address particular situations as they arose HisWritings  as a result offer a puzzling mass of personal lettersmilitary records presidential orations ringing statements and randominsignificant scribblings all of them put into chronological order by theLibrary of Americawhich is to say into very little order at all except thatof chance            Still thepatriotic reader plunges inand instantly discovers in the volumes firstentry a document of capital importance in re the insidious GallicallyantiAmerican accusation offered by Stendhals novel The opening documentdating from  when Washington was  is a numbered catechism of dos anddonts called Rules of Civility  Decent Behavior in Company andConversation Whether this document belongs in a collection of Washingtonswritings seems a little dubious given that as the assiduous reader willdiscover with a glance at the note on page  by the volumes editor JohnRhodehamel Washington did not actually write these Rules but merely copiedthem from an English translation of a Frenchlanguage Jesuit text from the th century            The Rules contain  numbered passagesoffering such worthy bits of advice as this from No  Bedew no mans facewith your Spittle by approaching too near him when you Speak or this fromNo  Do not Puff up the Cheeks Loll not out the tongue rub the Hands orbeard thrust out the lips or bite them or keep the Lips too open or tooClose No  says Being Set at meat Scratch not neither Spit Cough or blowyour Nose except theres a Necessity for it And at once from the openingdocument of Washingtons Writings  the suspicion arises that the Fatherof Our Country was in truth a hideous Bore            Alas Butwhat makes the unhappy discovery truly appalling is the further incrediblediscovery that Washingtons earnest and humorless Rules are considered byexperts to be the key to his entire career and therefore in some respect akey to Americas two centuries of national success Last year a conservativewriter named Richard Brookhiser published a biography titled FoundingFather Rediscovering George Washington  which made the point thatWashington by keeping in mind his carefully inscribed numbered Rulesthroughout his momentous life conducted himself correctly in all the LittleWays no bedewing of others with Spittle Hats properly Doffed and so forthwhich led to right conduct in the Big Ways too thus to political and militarytriumph            Supremely convinced of this point Brookhiser has goneahead and brought out his own little edition of Washingtons rules under thetitle Rules of Civility The  Precepts That Guided Our First President inWar and Peace  slightly altered to eliminate the  th centuryidiosyncrasies a pity and emended with small commentaries by Brookhiserhimself some of them pertaining to events in Washingtons life otherssolemnly applying of Washingtons rules to circumstances of today            Yet evenBrookhiser for all his sober devotion to civility as the key to everythingcannot escape noticing something ridiculous therefore comic in Washingtonsrules And so bravely embracing what he cannot deny Brookhiser in hisedition of the rules throws in some jocularity of his own with the surelightness of touch you would expect from an author who has based his biographyof Washington on a guide to etiquette Washingtons Rule No  proclaims inthe Library of Americas superior  th century version When inCompany put not your Hands to any Part of the Body not usually Discovered Towhich Brookhiser gruesomely adds in his own edition A rule often floutedby rap singers and pitchers  Washingtons Rule No  says In thePresence of Others Sing not to yourself with a humming Noise nor Drum withyour Fingers or Feet To which Brookhiser adds Dont carry a boom boxeither  And the embarrassments pile up one upon the other and thepatriotic reader wilts in his chair and Washington ends up too ludicrous forwords            At least the Library of AmericasWritings contains an endless supply of additional material There aremilitary entries full of wampum and warpaths during the French and Indian Warand complaints to Congress during the Revolutionary War which areinteresting to read even if Washingtonunlike Grant and Sherman from theCivil Warwas not much of a military writer There is a long amiable letter tothe young Lafayette in  in which Washington in a giddy mood drifts intoa reverie about competing for Lafayettes young wife with Lafayette himselfafunny bit of teasing followed abruptly by a rueful reassurance worthy ofStendhal himself that amidst all the wonders recorded in holy writ noinstance can be produced where a Woman from real inclination haspreferred an old man It is interesting to see how warm he grew towardAlexander Hamilton he signed his letters I am Your Affectionate and howawkward and selfconscious toward Jefferson whose allies were beratingWashington in such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be appliedto a Nero a notorious defaulter or even to a common pickpocket            Naturally the Library of America edition also contains hidden here and therein impossibletofind locations a number of solemn and stirring documents ofstatefor instance the reply genuinely dear to my own multiculturallyAmerican Jewish heart that Washington made as president to a letter from theHebrew Congregation of Newport RI The congregation had written tocongratulate him about something or other unspecified by the notes andWashington replied                           The Citizens of theUnited States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given tomankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy a policy worthy ofimitation All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities ofcitizenship It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it was bythe indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise oftheir inherent natural rights For happily the Government of the United Stateswhich gives to bigotry no sanction to persecution no assistance requires onlythat they who live under its protection should demean themselves as goodcitizens in giving in on all occasions their effectual support                                        May the children of theStock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the goodwill of the other Inhabitants while every one shall sit in safety under hisown vine and figtree and there shall be none to make him afraid                        The letter is wonderfullygraciousand yet the graciousness owes everything to Washingtons feelingsabout republican revolution and nothing at all to what could be learned from a th century Jesuit manual of courtly behavior
