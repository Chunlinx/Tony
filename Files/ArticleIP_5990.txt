                                 The Flytrap Ad War            Tuesday one week before themidterm elections the National Republican Congressional Committee began airingTV ads around the country reminding voters of President Clintons misconductin the Monica Lewinsky affair To download video of the ads click hereDemocrats pounced on the ads calling them a clumsy rehash of old charges andpredicting that they would backfire by antagonizing voters who are sick of thescandal This is a classic case of selffulfilling characterization The adsare actually far more sophisticated than the Democrats admit But if the pressbuys the Democrats simplistic representation of the ads they will indeedbackfire            The adsdo not rehash the case brought by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr Insteadthey take into account the political reactions that have since transpired thepublics fatigue the backlash against Starr the demise of the impeachmentprocess and the scandals decline as a news story The ads counter or in somecases exploit these common reactions which can be summarized as follows                           Reaction  Starr is a partisanzealot When the scandal broke in January Clinton was the center ofattention suspicion and denunciation His surrogates responded by divertingscrutiny to Starrs alleged misdeeds Millions of Americans would like to voteagainst both men With that in mind the Republican ads push Clinton back tocenter stage The first ad titled One Person  shows video footage ofClinton wagging his finger in January as he falsely denied his affair withLewinsky Theres one person who doesnt want the Republicans in charge thenarrator reminds viewers The ad never mentions the scandal nor does itinclude the audio of Clintons denial It doesnt need to We all remember thewagging finger            Making thepresident the issue is a classic oppositionparty strategy In Republicans captured Congress by framing the election as a referendum onClintons  tax increase a k a deficitreduction package and his failednational health insurance proposal In  they conceded Clintonsreelection and warned voters that Democratic control of Congress would givehim a blank check The GOPs  ads make the same point relying this timeon the word balance Republicans are the balance we need says the tag lineof one ad For balance vote Republican says another                           Reaction  Clintons offenses arentimpeachable For several weeks in August and September it looked asthough Congress might remove Clinton from office or force him to resign Butpublic support failed to materialize Starrs report ignited a backlash andCongress lost its nerve Now it looks as though Clinton will escape punishmentThats good for Clinton but perhaps bad for Democrats If impeachment is mootthe most obvious way to punish Clinton is to vote against his party in theelections            This isthe message of the second Republican ad titled Reward  Its language isa textbook frame job In every election there is a big question to thinkabout This year the question is Should we reward Bill Clinton Should wemake the Democrats more powerful  And should we reward not telling thetruth That is the question of this election Reward Bill Clinton or voteRepublican Since Clinton wont be impeached the ad suggests his reward orpunishment is in your hands Electing Republicans is a way voters can punishClinton says a strategist who helped design the commercials                           Reaction  Stop the investigation andprosecution Most people find Clintons behavior reprehensible but dontthink it should be prosecuted by an independent counsel or investigated byCongress They think Clinton had sex with Lewinsky and lied about it but theydont consider this a crime Clintons surrogates have exploited this paradoxby accusing Starr Republicans in Congress and conservative Clinton haters ofconspiring to criminalize their war against Clinton            The adsrespect this distinction by focusing entirely on morals and lying to thepublic The most striking thing about them is that they avoid any mention ofthe charges Starr has leveled against Clinton Instead they highlight themoral rather than legal aspects of Clintons offenses And rather than dwell onClintons offstage lies to Paula Jones lawyers or to the Starr grand jury theads spotlight his centerstage lies to the public on television They dontmention sex the affair or anything that ordinary people might deem privateOnly Clintons public deceit is at issue            The third ad What Did You Tell YourKids  illustrates the Republican strategy It features one young suburbanmother talking to another What did you tell your kids asks the first womanI didnt know what to say answers the second The first woman replies Itswrong For seven months he lied to us Like the fingerwagging scene in OnePerson  this ad reminds viewers not of what Clinton did to Jones or Starrbut of what he did to us  It doesnt say his lies were criminal itmerely says they were wrong This isnt an abstract matter of law the adsuggests Its about your kids            A fourthad reportedly set to begin airing Friday drives home the point Rememberwhen he looked us in the eye asks the narrator as Clinton wags his fingerThen the legal mumbo jumbo the ad recalls It goes on to quote theDemocratic Party chairmans praise for Clintons moral leadership Again thepoint is to bypass the troubled legal case against Clinton and to focus insteadon the overwhelming moral case Indeed the ad accuses Clinton rather than hiscritics of invoking legal mumbo jumbo to obscure the immorality of hismisconduct                           Reaction  Get on with the peoplesbusiness Once Congress took up Starrs report the electorates hostilityto the investigation shifted to the GOP Each of the Republican adsacknowledges and answers the publics desire to see other issues discussedBut arent there other things to do asks the second mother in What DidYou Tell Your Kids The first mother then explains that the Republicansare doing them They cut taxes they helped balance the budget and theyreputting people on welfare back to work            The firstad One Person  addresses this complaint in a different way bysituating Clintons lies about Lewinsky in a larger critique of his honestyabout public matters It begins with video clips of Clinton contradictinghimself on how long it will take to balance the budget The ad dwells entirelyon fiscal questions such as Social Security Only at the end does it show himwagging his finger about Lewinsky The message is that you should vote againstClinton not because he lied about sex but because he lies about everything            Unfortunately for the GOP the sophisticationand delicacy of the ads is already being overwhelmed by the Democratssimplification of them In a Rose Garden appearance Wednesday Clinton chargedthat Republicans are trying to divert your attention from the Americanpeople and their families and their future Vice President Al Gore HouseMajority Leader Dick Gephardt and Democratic Party officials equated the adswith previous efforts to investigate and impeach Clinton over his sexlife As Gore put it The American people will look at these ads and sayenough is enough Get on with the business of the American people and talkabout the real issues            Thedanger for the GOP is that more voters will see shallow media coverage of theadsGOP revives Clinton sex scandalthan will see the ads themselvesScandal ads hit campaign shouts
