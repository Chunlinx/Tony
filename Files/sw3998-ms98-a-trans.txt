              hi   im Bridget   hi Bridget im Gunner im here in Dallas   are you im in Lubbock   oh you are oh okay   yeah i go to school at Tech   oh okay   okay you ready for me to push one   yeah sure am   okay   okay   okay   so what do you think about the elderly and their health care   well  uh i think there uh you know need to have uh some some means of taking care of them in a in a reasonable and uh uh i guess respectful way   uhhuh   and uh its uh i guess my biggest problem is that uh they seem to uh be uh be you know put in nursing homes and just forgotten about thats   yeah i think thats really sad   you know have you uh ever spent much time or worked around one or anything   yeah i have um my great grandmother was in one and i used to go visit her a lot i think its sad because one its so expensive   oh yeah   just to put them in there and its such a traumatic decision anyway and then its like no one goes and sees them i think thats really sad i mean that i didnt even think about that what i first was thinking about this topic and stuff and thats just thats thats amazes me you know   is there uh uh well shoot i guess theres no uh Medicare i dont think pays for it   no i dont think so   um um i dont know its just the whole thing is just kind of amazing to me   uhhuh   uh     but they need someone to take care of them you know   uhhuh   you can kind of see both sides  i mean the people that have to be in one you know should be or people that are just put in one you know that do not need serious you know medical care i think thats kind of sad   yeah and a lot of other countries though uh uh you know basically like family takes them   yeah thats uhhuh   and uh i guess take them for as long as they are you know as long as they live   yeah yeah should go back to that think more people should do that   well i yeah i do too   hard as it may sound or be for some people its not really that hard   um   least it would be easier   especially now that all the you know everybody is getting older and living longer and   uhhuh thats true   uh you know its its theres going to be more and more  folks   yeah theres going to be more older people   hm   whether they like to admit it or not   yeah   thats true though i didnt think about that either people got to think about that and just i just think its its kind of sad even knowing if your you know if your parents would even want to go in one or not you know i mean my parents are like no way i know theres no way they would ever want to be put in one   um yeah   and i know that my parents plan to take care of their parents you know if it ever gets to the point where they cant take care of themselves you know theyre going to go to Florida or whatever to take care of them thats what they have to do because they dont want to just put them in a nursing home   yeah   they dont think thats right   um yeah that is uh thats difficult i tell you   i guess it would depend on a lot of things like like financial especially and depending on how old they are and how you know i can see if like my grandmother whose mother used to be in a nursing home she used to go up there and see her every day whose my greatgrandmother was in one she used to go see her every day and that is great but when she got sick then you know she cant go see her and stuff and you cant expect so i guess it would depend on how old they were too   uhhuh   because if if the parents if the children were too old to take care of the parents then i dont think that would be very good either   yeah yeah hm   pretty touchy topic   yeah it sure is i know like uh uh lot of places its like hundred dollars a day   oh yeah at least   you know   theyre pretty expensive   i know but uh   but people always figure it as if they had a live in nurse too thats you know just as expensive   is it i dont even know   it is because i know when my grandmother was looking to put her mother in that is a big ordeal shes like well its just expensive to have a nurse twenty four hours a day than it is to put her in a a place where at least theres other people you know   yeah   i mean and she went and saw her every day like i said and thats good i think because i dont think if you just put them in there and forget about them i dont think thats right   yeah yeah really   think thats sad
