                    Background        Comparative gene expression using microarrays plays an        increasingly important role in analysis of biological        control mechanisms phenotyping cell classification and a        variety of other applications see       for review        There are now several commercial purveyors of microarray        equipment and reagents as well as companies that perform        experiments on a contract basis The output of microarray        experiments typically consists of intensity measurements        that are manipulated by scaling background subtraction and        other correction procedures the details of which are often        proprietary In the case of experiments performed by        contract computer files are returned to the customer which        contain lists of sequences matched intensities and in        some instances intensity ratios compared to internal        references        Representation of intensity data as ratios has        considerable value for biologists Seldom are absolute        levels of mRNA expression of interest Rather the relative        changes in expression of individual genes between two        samples are more informative But the use of ratios to        characterize differences may have drawbacks For example        estimates of significance are more difficult to determine        In addition potential improvements in estimates of high        signals compared to low signals may not be adequately        represented by a ratio Thus a conservative evaluation of        confidence levels is called for limiting useful        information that may be extracted from the intensity        data        Analytical approaches that rely on signal subtraction        may have certain advantages       Variances for such        difference values are the sums of the variances for the        individual measurements Therefore a simple general        method to estimate variance at specific signal intensities        may permit more effective data analysis In the absence of        replicates the intensity distributions for individual        genes and therefore the distribution mean  and        variance   are unknown For an experiment that        examines two hybridizations that involve the same RNA        sample each gene is matched with two intensities         S and         S  The s for the distributions of        each         S are not known and range widely        reflecting low or high gene expression However for        properly handled data  for the difference         S          S           S  should be approximately zero for        all intensity levels If the intensities are distributed        normally then the          S distribution can be used in        principle to determine  for a given signal                    S           because                    S                             S   that is the variance of        the difference of two identical distributions is twice the        variance of the individual function        Here we present results from investigation of two        commercial microarray platforms the Affymetrix system and        the Incyte Genomics system We show that the control data        for both platforms after proprietary manipulation        procedures are well behaved using some statistical        measures We further show that intensity differences can be        used to supply variance estimates of these differences in a        simple way without the need for multiple replicate        datasets These variances can be applied to noncontrol        data to estimate         p values for specific changes in gene        expression The method described here is intended to        supplement more elaborate analytical procedures that depend        on larger numbers of independent observations                    Results                  Reproducibility of intensity measurements          The two platforms were examined independently and all          comparisons were limited to datasets within one platform          For the Affymetrix experiments RNA samples from           D melanogastor heads were used          for Incyte experiments human HEK cell line RNA see          Methods Intensity measurements from the mRNA samples          were analyzed using the data provided by the commercial          groups no scaling or background subtraction was          performed other than the proprietary modifications to          intensities carried out prior to distribution of the          files to the customer          To investigate the general properties of the data the          intensities from two independent experiments using the          same control RNA            S and           S  were plotted Figs   In          both cases Affymetrix and Incyte the data fit a          straight line with slope approximately equal to one and          intercept near zero Thus the data produced by both          platforms were judged to be well behaved with no obvious          skewing or bias in the expression measurements                          Distributions of intensity differences          To analyze data scatter in a different way          intensities of the control RNAs within each data type          were subtracted from one another and the differences            SS  were graphed as a histogram          Figs   As expected from the intensity plots in          Figure  the differences in each dataset were          distributed as a bellshaped curve with a mean near zero          The histograms revealed some outliers suggesting          possible divergence from the normal distribution          However at least some of these outliers resulted from          the noncontinuous distribution of signal intensities in          the datasets Standard deviations of each histogram were          different probably due to differences in the detection          methods scaling etc used by the two groups However          each histogram had general attributes of a Gaussian          distribution eg area as a function of           z value where           z             x    not shown Because a          sum of Gaussians is also Gaussian this finding was          consistent with normally distributed individual intensity          measurements                          Variance of intensity difference as a function of          signal intensity          In many cases measurement accuracies and the          signficance of individual measurements are related in a          straightforward way to the magnitude of the signal          Photon counts are such a case and it is expected that          higher signal strengths intensities should have smaller          percentage errors compared to weaker signals If such          measurement errors could be estimated confidence values          could be calculated for specific differences          To obtain such estimates an average intensity was          calculated for each signal pair             SS  The averaged          intensities were sorted in descending rank order and were          averaged again using a sliding window with           consecutive values incremented by one position at a time          The matching differences            S  were also grouped in sets of           in the same way However instead of averaging the                     S sets were used to compute                       S   Plots revealed the          relationship between the intensity and                        S                                  S   Figs   To these          plots various curves were fitted including polynomials          and straight lines and goodnessoffit values R           calculated Linear fits to the signal vs                        S            data did not produce acceptable approximations to          the Incyte data R   However quadratic and          cubic polynomials fit the Incyte data reasonably well R            A linear equation fit the Affymetrix data          well R   but visual inspection revealed a poor          fit at lower intensities thus a quadratic was used Such          polynomials provided a means to estimate                        S             and hence           z values for each difference          Notably it was important to use data spanning the entire          relevant intensity range extrapolation from low          intensity data to highintensity data did not give          reliable results not shown Functions were also fit to          plots of average signal vs                        S             These plots suggested that the scatter in the data          increased at a rate intermediate between  and   with          the Affymetrix data more closely approximating          proportionality to  than the Incyte data not          shown          The fine structure of the signal vs variance plots          was also interesting In both cases the plots were noisy          though the Affymetrix data was smoother than the Incyte          data Finestructure patterns were not preserved among          different experiments using one platform and therefore          probably do not reflect any fundamental trend for a given          platform see Discussion Quality of the Incyte data was          arguably poorer than the Affymetrix data based on the          analysis of signal vs   However other Incyte          datasets displayed smoother behavior though the general          form of the intensity vs  data was similar see          Discussion                          Application of the method          The algorithm described above was applied to a          microarray experiment designed to compare gene expression          in human cells harboring either a cadherinderived          inhibitor CadCD of the catenin pathway or a          dominantnegative Tcf inhibitor TcfDN of the pathway               The biological interpretation of the results will          be presented elsewhere Pierce and Kamb unpublished          Each RNA sample was compared to the control RNAs made          from cells without expressed inhibitors used in the          analysis of the Incyte platform described above Plots of          all single dye intensity combinations were fit well by          unit slope lines through the origin eg Fig  and          the            S histogram was approximately          Gaussian not shown suggesting reasonable data quality          No dramatic differences in gene expression were detected          the single largest ratio was only fold compared to          the control           z values for the CadCD  Control          and TcfDN  Control were compared using  computed from          the cubic polynomial of Fig A All measurements with          low averages            SS    corresponding          to about  of the total dataset were excluded          Comparison of the two inhibitors using the          differenceaveraging method described above yielded many          more significant differences than the Incyte groups          suggested ratio threshold intensity ratio   or            Table  For the application of the difference          averaging method            z    corresponding to           p   for normally          distributed data was chosen as cutoff All the ratio          outliers with a single exception that had low          intensities in both experiments were also present in the          set of sequences selected based on           z  The biological relevance of          this set of selected points was suggested by inclusion of          a gene cyclinD known to be downregulated by          expression of TcfDN     This gene            z   displayed only a          fold suppression compared to the control but its          high measured intensities pushed it over the limit for          significance using the signal differenceaveraging          method Furthermore for all but three of the sequences          selected by            z    the sign of the          difference was the same in both datasets as expected          based on the biological actions of the two inhibitors          Ratios as low as   were deemed significant for            z    not shown Such low          ratios may have biological significance especially          considering the steep doseresponse of many signaling          systems and the fact that microarray experiments provide          populationaveraged rather than singlecell measurements          of mRNA changes                                Discussion        In using intensity ratios for comparison of gene        expression levels a choice must be made about data        presentation In particular it is necessary to confront a        mathematical problem inherent in expression ratios        Consider a comparison of two RNA samples A and B and        associated intensity values for RNAs a         n and b         n  If after background subtraction        one RNA b         i  is undetectable while a         i yields a measurable signal then a         i  b         i approaches infinity Moreover for a         i  b         i  a         i  b         i   but for a         i  b         i    a         i  b         i   resulting in an asymmetric        representation of comparative intensity values These        situations can be rectified in arbitrary ways for        instance by setting backgrounds to a nonzero value and        using a logarithm transform of the ratio Alternatively        introduction of a discontinuity along with signratio        inversion eg for a         i  b         i  use a         i  b         i  for a         i  b         i  use b         i  a         i  solves the problem Such        considerations do not arise if intensity differences are        used        Several algorithms have been developed to analyze        microarray data both in the private and public sectors        Some attention has been devoted to the problem of        estimating backgrounds scaling data for dataset merging        and determining statistical significance of intensity        differences or ratios The most sophisticated published        treatments for determination of significance use Bayesian        probability methods maximum likelihood procedures or        multiparameter fitting to analyze samples of gene        expression data       As pointed out by others the        lack of replicates of individual sequence intensities        blocks the most direct route to estimates of variance        However certain statistical treatments can provide        estimates for the means and variances of small numbers of        replicates eg  in the case of Long         et al      within microarray        datasets However collection of even a few repeats can be        technically impractical or prohibitively expensive        Nevertheless repetition is the most reliable way to        collect statistical information and the strategy described        here is intended to supplement not replace such        replication experiments        The method of microarray data analysis presented here is        platformindependent and can be used to explore data        quality and to estimate variances The calculated variances        provide a statistical basis for interpreting significance        of intensity differences The relationship between        intensity values          S  and                    S          is discerned using an averaging procedure that groups        sets of points of related intensities to estimate                   S   and hence                    S           The use of all data together to fit a function        argues for a high degree of robustness in the procedure        that should resist fluctuations in the intensity        measurements caused by noise Furthermore local averaging        of intensity differences and calculation of                    S          coupled with a global data fit provides the most        reliable estimates for                    S          as a function of signal assuming that variance is        mainly a result of signal intensity and is not otherwise        sequencespecific The general smoothness of the plots        supports this view Within a given platform the  plots        have similar general shapes that can be fitted well by low        order polynomials Higher order polynomials yield better R        values but are probably not justified due to the noise in        the data A general function is desired not one that fits        the idiosyncratic noise in a specific pairwise comparison        Despite its presumed robustness the differenceaveraging        method is expected to perform better with higher quality        data as input        The estimators derived from this type of analysis can be        used to evaluate the significance of intensity differences        in noncontrol datasets because they relate the magnitude        of the intensity value         S  reported in the data file to the        standard deviation of an intensity distribution with           S Fig  For example a given pair        of signals corresponding to measurements for one sequence        eg a gene can be compared statistically by computing        the variance for each signal using the function derived        from the fitted data eg a cubic polynomial in Fig         The variance of the difference          SS  is simply     The        observation that distributions of intensity differences        were approximately Gaussian in form suggests that         z values may provide reliable        estimates for         p values Only two replicates are        required In the case of twodye experimental platforms        such as Incyte interchip variances can be estimated in        the manner shown here Intrachip variances can be        estimated in a similar way using two dyes on a single        chip The interchip estimators for  provide a        conservative statistical measure of significance if applied        to interchip experiments and provide a justification for        determining significance of differences in merged datasets        Due to its simplicity the approach does not require a        sophisticated understanding of statistical principles        Furthermore the entire analytical procedure can be        performed inside a spreadsheet application such as        Microsoft Excel        The two microarray platforms tested here use different        types of sequence on the chip Affymetrix employs sets of        oligonucleotides to interrogate a specific RNA Incyte uses        a single spotted DNA of substantially greater length In        contrast to Incyte data the final intensity measurement in        the Affymetrix case is a function of individual intensities        derived from the oligonucleotides The data from Affymetrix        chips were at least superficially well behaved The data        from both platforms especially Incytes appear to include        noise other than the counting statistics type The scatter        does not scale with   This behavior was not restricted        to the dataset that was the principal subject of the        present study all other Incyte datasets analyzed        including those with a much smoother appearance displayed        similar dependence not shown Such noise may originate        from variability in the spotting or detection        There are some peculiarities in both datasets regarding        the fine structure of the         S vs                    S          plots Figs   In particular there are        positions where sudden discontinuities arise The        explanation for some of these jumps may involve outliers        ie single poorly measured array points However in many        cases the jumps were inconsistent with one or two aberrant        measurements that might produce spikes in the averaged        data Rather the jumps resulted from a stable change in        intensity vs                    S           causing an abrupt transition to a new level        discernible as a sudden offset in the scatter plot data It        is noteworthy that plots of         S vs                    S          as in Figs   do not display the same fine        structure features though they all are of similar general        form see Figs  for another example For instance the        large jump at intensity  visible in Fig Awas not as        dramatic in other Incyte datasets The origin of these        transitions is not clear                    Conclusion        We have presented a simple analytical approach based on        differences in signal intensities and averaging for        analysis of microarray data which can be performed without        advanced statistics or specialized software This procedure        provides insight into the properties of the data under        consideration as well as estimates of variances as a        function of signal strength Application of the method        gives statistical support for a more aggressive        interpretation of microarray intensity data                    Materials and Methods                  RNA samples          RNA for the Affymetrix experiment consisted of          polyA RNA isolated from heads from fruit flies that          overexpressed Fos and Jun RNA for the Incyte platform          experiments was polyA RNA prepared from HEK human          cells that expressed a mutant SY catenin oncogene               Other samples eg head polyA RNA from fly          heads that expressed dominantnegative Fos and Jun          molecules and polyA RNA from HEK cells that          expressed either a cadherin or Tcf inhibitor of the          catenin pathway were also collected and examined                Kamb unpublished                          Software          All analytical procedures and graphing was performed          using Microsoft Excel  no other software packages or          custom code was used                          Data analysis          A basic summary of the Affymetrix chip data is          provided in Table  similar information was not          available for Incyte data Data files were imported into          Excel and the companies internal controls were removed          Intensity differences for pairs of control signals            SS  were calculated as well as          average signals for each pair            SS  These columns were          sorted on average signal in descending order and          averaging window sizes were tested After settling on           data points as the window an averaged            SS  incremented by one point          each time was calculated along with  and  for the          corresponding sets of  points used in the signal          averaging process Polynomials and lines were fit to          plots of avg            SS  vs                       S
