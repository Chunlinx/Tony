                                 All Chats Lead to Talk                        Dear Walter            Of course Mark Bartons homicides didnt stem from day trading alone Imeant that the Journal was far too offhand about thenondigital factors that may have set him off The story begins with somegeneral exposition about the sketchy details of Bartons past but once thenarrative hits  right before the Internet boom it restricts itself toBartons highs and lows as a day trader Thats why the Journals lineabout trading not being the sole cause seemed so slappedon and insufficient tome As you suggest his killing spree may turn out to have a spray of policyand business consequences for gun control regulation of day trading theonline sector of the financial industry So before we are asked to digestproposals and reforms I am hungry to know more about the other causes ofBartons rampage and some real consideration of what if anything makes daytrading particularly nefarious            For example the piece describes how Barton used the extrarisky practice oftrading on margin or borrowing funds against the securities he alreadyowned which he was required to back up with additional funds when the value ofthose securities dropped But the story doesnt tell us if trading on margin isallowed at Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanleyin other words if he could havebet as riskily at a more established firm or away from a computer            You write that Bartons daytrading career is emblematic of theglitzandgreed s and that Americans are abandoning safe investments inthe quest for instant riches I am chary of decadelong generalizations Ithought the s were supposed to have been about glitzandgreed Yourstatement is wide enough to span the gold rush the junkbond era and the LasVegas Strip Sure online investing is more populist and easily accessible thanpanning for gold or highrisk bond trading but you make it sound as if drovesof us are abandoning steady salaries for a home office a modem and a bunch oftrading accounts So tops on my list of Pieces Id Like To Read remains asolid analysis of the scope and specific dangers of day trading and how itcompares to more conventional forms of extracurricular investing            Perhaps as you hypothesize Hillary chose to air her woes in Talkbecause its a sympathetic forum But so are lots of magazines remember theNew York Times Magazines recent rahrah cover story I think shechose it simply because its the highestprofile magazine of the year HerSenate candidacy is a direct reward for the crosses shes had to bear beforeMonica her approval rating was too low to justify a run What bothers me mostabout the interview is that she seems to be trying to nourish her candidacywith a new harvest of Flytrapinduced sympathy            Boy did you dis my offer of a Talk subscription Your highmindedsneer leaves me crestfallendoes this mean you wont want to dish over ittomorrow I have a copy in front of me and Hillary aside it looks deliciousI cant wait to read Martin Amis on Hannibal  Tom Stoppard on hisnewfound Jewish heritage and Mimi Swartz on the legal revenge being exacted bywronged first wives But if you wont share with me then at least my fellow Ftrain riders will                           A demain Jodi            PS No I dont eat on the subway But I could if I wanted to A dirtylittle secret Like many of Mayor Giulianis quality of lifeprohibitionsincluding those on jaywalking and cursingthe nosnacks on thesubway rule is never ever enforced
