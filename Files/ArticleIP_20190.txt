                                  War Powerless            President Clinton wants tosend  American soldiers on a NATO peacekeeping mission to Kosovo If allgoes as planned though what goes as planned in the Balkans the troops willspend the next three to five years disarming ethnic Albanian guerillasreplacing Serbian policemen with ethnic Albanians and generally restoringorder to the Godforsaken Yugoslavian province The mission is a superb idea anoble effort to pacify the troubled region before war spills into the rest ofEurope            Its also illegal TheClinton administration is briefing and consulting with Congress about themission but will not seek congressional approval The administration insiststhat it does not need such approval Ample constitutional precedent BosniaSomalia Haiti proves that the commander in chief can conduct such forcefuloperations without a congressional sayso And Congress it seems agrees            It is probably hopeless and certainly unfashionable toremind the president and Congress that they are wrong Few passages in theConstitution have been more abused than Article  Section  which givesCongress sole power to declare war and grant letters of marque andreprisal Constitutional history is fuzzy on many matters but on this it ispellucid The framers intended Congress and Congress alone to decide whetherand when to send troops into combat According to scholars letters of marqueand reprisal are roughly speaking the  th century equivalent ofour smallscale military actions The framers allowed that the president couldauthorize defense and immediate retaliation in the case of a surprise attackOtherwise the authority belonged to Congress Our elected representatives weresupposed to deliberate slowly on this most consequential of state actionsThe framers feared above all that a vainglorious executive would ifunchecked drag the country into foolish foreign entanglements            This principle ofcongressional supremacy guided the United States through World War IIOccasionally Congress declared war before sending troops mostly it didntBut Congress military influence began to wane as presidents grabbed more andmore power The seminal event was the Korean War which President Harry Trumanwaged with UN approval and virtual silence from Congress The shift continuedthrough Vietnam and the secret invasions of Cambodia and Laos In Congress reasserted itself by passing the War Powers Resolution over Nixonsveto Under the resolution more commonly known as the War Powers Act thepresident has  days to obtain congressional approval of a military action IfCongress does not vote aye the troops must come home            The War Powers Resolution has been a monument tocongressional fecklessness and presidential bullying Every president hascalled the law unconstitutional and proceeded as if it and the Constitutiondidnt exist Ronald Reagan the grand champion of executive power ignored thewar powers clause and resolution in Grenada Lebanon Libya Central Americaand the Persian Gulf Reagans advisers usually so obeisant to originalintent when interpreting the Constitution were more cavalier on the subjectof war powers George Bush skirted congressional war powers in Panama anddenied that they applied to the Iraq war Clinton has ducked them in HaitiSomalia Bosnia and Iraq When administration officials cite ampleconstitutional precedent it is this ample but hardly constitutionalrecord to which they are referring Presidents have euphemized away theseizure of congressional authority minimizing their uses of force as surgicalstrikes police actions or immediate reprisals They have cited thepressures of the Cold War At a time when any regional flareup might provoke anuclear confrontation they argued America needed a single firm hand on thetiller As Reagan said You cant have  secretaries of state            Congress grumbled butdidnt stop the erosion of its power Whenever a president dispatched troops ormissiles congressional Democrats and a few Republicans would pipe up that thepresident was ignoring the War Powers Resolution The president would argue itdidnt apply Congress would gripe a bit more and by that time the troopswould be on their way home The resolution has become a convenient cover Itallows Congress to complain that the president is breaking the law withoutforcing Congress to take any real responsibility If the operation goes awryCongress can load all the blame on the president If the operation goes wellthe president takes all the credit anyway Theres nothing in it forCongress says Eric Alterman author of Who Speaks for America WhyDemocracy Matters in Foreign Policy  No one is going to make his career asa great foreign policy senator The political adage states that politics stopsat the waters edge In fact politics doesnt even start Congress just isntinterested enough            This time around Congress isnt even bothering to invokethe war powers clause or resolution Both the rescue of Kosovo and the ongoingbombardment of Iraq are undoubtedly military operations as contemplated by theConstitution Both expose US troops to hostilities and neither is animmediate retaliation for an attack on the United States The Iraq bombing hasbeen going on for two months and the administration has not signaled anywillingness to abide by the War Powers Resolution The Kosovo engagement isscheduled for three years but the administration has no intention of everputting it to congressional vote Congress has never held a War PowersResolution vote on the Bosnia mission which began in  Even so Congressperhaps exhausted by impeachment or simply supportive of the operations hasbeen notably silent There is war powers fatigue says Brookings Institutionscholar Richard Haass            The fact remains that thecongressional surrender of war powers is antidemocratic and antirepublicanThe most important duty of the statethe power to wage waris now held by oneman and his unelected advisers Members of Congress who were elected todeliberate and make these nasty decisions have abdicated the duty the framersintended them to have Their abdication deprives the rest of the nation of thechance to hear and participate in debate It is no coincidence that the Iraqwar the only recent military engagement preceded by a vigorous nationaldebate was also an operation that Americans supported wholeheartedly DoAmericans even know where Kosovo is            Congressional Democrats and Republicans have cooperated inabandoning war powers The indifference of congressional Republicans is notsurprising Since the days of Reagan they have generally endorsed theexecutives warmaking authority The Democrats indifference is moredemoralizing Democrats after all endorsed Congress war powers when Reaganand Bush were sending in the Marines Why dont they now The president tooseems hypocritical After all he fervently participated in the antiVietnammovement and the War Powers Resolution was a great triumph of that movementNow that he owns the executive authority he once feared in Nixon Clinton hascavalierly dismissed constraints on his power            Congressional war powers are not an entirelylost cause A few stubborn legislators are still shouting about it Sen JoeBiden DDel wants to amend the War Powers Resolution to give it more teethHe will hold hearings if he can get Senate Foreign Relations Committee ChairmanJesse Helms RNC to agree to them Rep Tom Campbell RCalif aninternational law professor has championed congressional war powers for yearsLast year he tried and failed to invoke the War Powers Resolution for theBosnia mission Now he and Rep Barney Frank DMass are circulating a letterto colleagues that they will send to the president next week The letterinsists that The Constitution compels you to obtain authority from Congressbefore taking military action against Yugoslavia So far Campbell and Frankhave enlisted only  cosigners and the administration shows no signs ofpaying attention            You can see why the administration wouldnt listenA congressional debate and vote on whether we should intervene in Kosovo couldbe a fiasco The intervention could be stopped by a block of isolationistsenators and House members Our failure to intervene might well cause the warto escalate and spread But the absence of such a debate and vote may be worseThe Constitution is most necessary when it is most inconvenient
