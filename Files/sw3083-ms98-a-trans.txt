        okay what do you think is the biggest problem   the biggest problem well like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools   uhhuh   that uh you know you can throw money at it but its i dont know to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know because i mean the general values that were teaching   uhhuh   kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school i mean   yeah is it the do you think its the values that theyre teaching in school or the the values they get from home   uh well the values more or less at home and the TV just a general i mean learning is not a a revered endeavor really i mean its a lot more its socially well i wont say socially unacceptable but whereas like in uh a person that uh study they put a lot more emphasis on athletics and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society and i think that carries over to school a lot so   right yeah i i i i think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the the home environment being part of it you know if i think too many parents expect uh the the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the students to the kids and you know while were not going to worry about uh teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh expect them to to pick it up at school and youre not going to do that you know youre going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home and uh   yeah   uh i think that that part of thats showing up now you know with with things because kids i think have probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than than uh we may have seen in the past uh and uh part of its the the family i think and part of its uh the living conditions of certain people are are subjected too uh drugs is a big problem now and i think thats thats thats another root problem   yeah yeah you know i wonder if thats a a root problem or not because i think about that a lot and its just like everybody likes to blame uh everything on drugs now but i wonder you know do you get the oh thats kind of side tracked but uh i just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better   uhhuh   i thought well you know of course theyre doing better and not so much when i was growing up uh Catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools but uh they still had a a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material i mean everybody that went to a Catholic school had uh at least the parents did at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it and i wonder if not so much that uh   right right well i think its like you say its its the socioeconomic mix there you know the theyre uh the you you look at the if the if the the uh schools like that that where you got a lot of kids who are basically uh that might be more well to well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and theyre not all that way but you know some that are um   yeah   that theyre theyre theyre not quite the same as as the kids that are going to the inner city uh you know public schools   yeah this is interesting because i in my mind i dont have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but uh this this was actually inner city   yeah   people were sending i mean just because their kids had the ability and the and the drive to do try and get an education they didnt send him to a public school you know you have like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where youre pressured not to learn in instance   well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that its its because the parents are more interested in them receiving them uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be now passed on down to to the kid as well and uh maybe they pick up on that   yeah   then and then from the other aspect um maybe the uh the school itself is is has more emphasis on uh trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh they may be able to to give the resources thats needed to uh to do a good job   yeah i wondering what do you what would you do to fix the school systems uh     uh thats a tough question how to fix the school system uh with uh i would try to   yeah   i guess uh to see about getting parents more involved  try to to come up with more ways to do that uh uh uh stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and uh more more classes that i think that are and i think this is is happening some around the country in terms of um morals trying to teach the kinds of things that that arent getting taught at home and uh and and respect for other people uh i think thats a big part of it you know people you know if you dont care about property and people you know youre not going to care about uh about learning i think   yeah   you know youre not going to really care about yourself   yeah thats what i was going to say its the chicken and the egg thing i wonder a lot of times you know people i mean a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools you know vandalism wise and you go to   right uhhuh   i mean its been a while since i been in high school theyre even in grade school when they do that but i cant remember exactly what goes through their head when theyre doing that but you got to think in a way its kind of a outward showing of that they dont think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school   well you know and i thats not an easy but thats not an easy task you know thats why i say its its a tough question what would you do because you know even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when uh when when youre growing up in you know in a home which may be uh just the pits and uh you know you dont have any any kind of a environment good environment to live in you know its kind of hard to say well you need to take care of of other peoples stuff as well when youre when you you barely have anything yourself so i could see where that would be a problem and i think thats i think its there are others   yeah
