                    Background        Hotspots have been defined as the minimal functional        proteinprotein interaction domains through which        biological activity can be modulated       A novel        strategy called Phenogenix has been developed as a means        for studying these interactions To enable Phenogenix  we        use large and diverse phage display libraries consisting of        randomized  mer and  mer amino acid peptides with          independent clones Because of their ability to        modulate protein protein interactions the resulting        peptides are called Hotspot Ligands HSPLs Using this        approach we have successfully identified peptide agonists        and antagonists for a number of biologically important        molecules including growth hormone receptor insulin        receptor and the insulinlike growth factor receptor                    In this report we describe the use of Phenogenix to        identify the critical proteinprotein interactions        underlying the TNFTNFR axis TNF and TNF have been        extensively studied and are involved in immune and        proinflammatory responses playing an important role in        host defenses against infection and other disease states               The biological effects of TNF and TNF are        mediated through the two membrane associated receptors        TNFR p and TNFR p that are expressed on the        target cells      The postulated pathogenic roles for        TNF include sepsis and other bacterial and viral        pathologies       certain cancers            metastasis    and chronic autoimmune disorders such as        rheumatoid arthritis      multiple sclerosis           and Crohns disease     It is worth noting that TNF        mutants have been identified that selectively bind TNFR        One such mutant induced less systemic toxicity yet showed        no compromise in its antitumor activity in nude mice            These observations indicated that finding modulators        specific for each of the TNF receptors is indeed        possible        While TNF binds equally well to both receptors the        majority of biologic responses attributed to TNF are        mediated via TNFR although there is evidence that        activation of TNFR is responsible for some adverse effects        of TNF          Thus the differential        regulation of these two receptors may require drugs that        specifically target either TNFR or TNFR allowing        therapeutic efficacy without the expected toxicity profile        One obvious possibility then is to search for Surrogates        that selectively bind and regulate the individual        receptors To date several antagonistic protein reagents        have been isolated for treating diseases with an underlying        TNF etiology These include neutralizing monoclonal        antibodies and soluble forms of TNFR and TNFR              However both antibodies and extracellular receptors        are large proteins and not amenable to oral administration        They also carry the unwanted risk of stimulating an        autoimmune response during chronic use        By panning our peptide libraries against the TNFR we        isolated four HSPL peptides binding specifically to human        TNFR that allow the subdivision of the receptor into a        minimum of at least three independent hotspots involved in        its interaction with TNF In a biological model for TNF        activation of TNFR three of the four peptides induced        cytotoxic response in the target cell line suggesting that        at least one of these domains induced a unique        TNFRspecific biological response Overall these data        show the utility of using the HSPL peptides for subdividing        proteinprotein interacting domains and for defining unique        novel biological activities not observed through the        natural ligandreceptor interaction                    Results        Human TNFR was panned with random  mer and  mer        phage display peptide libraries of high diversity              After four rounds of panning four phage clones were        isolated with specificity for TNFR The peptides were        initially divided into two groups a  mer designated        KcF and three  mers designated KcC KcD and KcF        Table  From the amino acid sequences KcC KcD and        KcF were found to have a pair of cysteine residues        suggesting the possibility of intrachain disulfide        bonding In addition a putative motif         W x         EY xx         RGG  was found for peptides KcF and        KcD Table  It was interesting that this motif was        related to a sequence         W x         E xxxxx         GG found at the Cterminal amino acids         of TNF No appreciable sequence homology was        seen between either of the natural ligands TNF or TNF        and KcF although the spacing of cysteine loop was close        to that seen in the cysteine rich domains of TNFR            At present it is not known whether these structural        elements play a role in binding of the peptides to TNFR        and it may be that the peptides mimic rather than        recapitulate the contact domains of the natural ligands        ELISA analysis showed that all four phage clones bound        specifically to human TNFR and did not react with either        human or murine TNFR or murine TNFR data not shown        Competition ELISAs were performed using TNF and TNF        vs the four phage clones at their ED          values Figure abcd More        TNF and TNF were required to compete KcF than the other        phage clones suggesting that certain intrinsic properties        of KcF such as its length andor amino acid content may        contribute to a higher relative affinity Table  In        addition the synthetic forms of KcC KcD KcF and the        recombinant KcF rKcF were able to compete the binding        of TNF and TNF as well as KcF and KcF phage clones in        the micromolar range unpublished data Interestingly the        three  mer HSPLs but not KcF were competed by an        antiTNFR monoclonal antibody mAb Figure         suggesting that KCF binds to a hotspot on TNFR distinct        from the other  peptides A summary of the phagepeptide        competition data is shown in Table         Binding of KcF to native TNFR was measured in Jurkat        and Jiyoye cells using a radioreceptor assay Jurkat cells        have been reported to have approximately equal numbers of        TNFR and TNFR per cell    whereas Jiyoye cells        express mainly TNFR unpublished data KcF inhibits        TNF binding to Jiyoye cells with a Ki of about  uM        whereas the Ki for the peptide in Jurkat cells was found to        be  uM Figure  Since TNF binding to Jurkat        probably involves both TNFR and TNFR the data offers        additional confirmation of KcFs selectivity for        TNFR        It has been previously reported that TNF induced a        TNFRspecific proliferation of the neuroblastoma cell line        SKNBE     KcF KcC and KcF inhibited the        proliferative response to TNF in this cell line        indicating that they could act as antagonists data not        shown In addition the same three peptides were found to        be cytotoxic to SKNBE cells in the absence of TNF        Figure a KcF possessed the strongest killing activity        with an IC          of  nM whereas the IC          s for KcC and KcF were  uM and         uM respectively None of the peptides induced a cytotoxic        response in cell lines not expressing TNFR data not        shown Interestingly KcD which shares a motif with        KcF Table  had no effect on SKNBE cells The absence        of activity by KcD did not appear to be due to breakdown        of the peptide during culturing since mass spectral        analyses on aliquots retrieved from culture media showed        relatively no degradation of peptides between the initial        and the final time points data not shown Therefore the        proliferation data suggests evidence of a hotspot on TNFR        recognized by KcF KcC and KcF that is linked to this        unique biological effect The inhibition of the KcC and        KcF cytotoxic effect with mAb Figure b confirms the        relationship between the peptideinduced cytotoxic event        and TNFR because of the antibodys specificity for TNFR        Overall these data indicate that the surface topology of        the TNFR binding site is very complex and may be composed        of multiple hotspots capable of different regulatory        functions                    Discussion        Peptide libraries have been successfully used for        identifying novel peptides mimicing natural molecules in        terms of the critical proteinprotein interactions involved        in biological activity Yanofsky et al    described a        peptide antagonist to IL that was active in the nM range        and Wrighton et al and Livnah et al     identified        peptides binding to the erythropoietin EPO receptor with        full agonist activity         in vivo  Neither the EPO agonist nor        the IL antagonist peptides show any significant sequence        homology to the natural ligand suggesting that they act as        mimics of the natural ligand In the case of the EPO        agonists Xray crystallographic analysis revealed that one        of these peptides spontaneously formed noncovalent        homodimers that allowed the dimerization of two EPO        receptors Two families of small peptides binding to the        human thrombopoietin receptor TPOR were isolated that        competed with the natural ligand TPO     The peptide        with the highest affinity was subsequently dimerized and        shown to function as a potent TPO agonist         in vivo  Recently a small        nonpeptide organic molecule binding to one chain of the        EPO receptor was multimerized and shown to mimic the        biological activities of the EPO            In this report we show that HSPLs can be isolated that        bind to human TNFR at its ligandbinding site and        subdivide it into multiple hotspots All of the peptides        were competed by both TNF and TNF implying they        recognized a hotspot that mapped either within or at least        overlapping the ligandbinding domain of TNFR The HSPLs        KcC KcD KcF but not KcF were also inhibited by the        neutralizing antibody mAb suggesting the  mers but not        KcF interact with a hotspot overlapping with the one        recognized by antibody The fact that recombinant KcF        peptide competed all of the phage expressed peptides Table         indicated that the four peptides also recognize a common        hotspot which may be the one responsible for TNF ligand        binding to the receptor In addition the biological data        suggests that KcD binds to a hotspot that can be further        separated from KcF KcF and KcC While we cannot rule        out possible allosteric interactions between the peptides        the data suggests that the HSPLs were able to dissect the        ligandbinding region of TNFR into several structural        andor functional hotspots In addition the HSPLs were        specific for TNFR unlike the native ligands TNF and        TNF which bind to both receptors These results        demonstrate that the approach has the ability to dissect        critical proteinprotein interaction domains in terms of        both structural and functional elements Using a similar        approach we recently reported on the subdivision of the        ligand binding domain on the insulin receptor into two        separate and nonoverlapping hotspots with different        biological activities            It has been shown that TNF induced proliferation of the        undifferentiated neuroblastoma cell line SKNBE resulted        from activation of TNFR     Proliferation of SKNBE        cells could be suppressed by the preincubation of cells        with antiTNFR blocking antibodies without concomitant        cytotoxicity data not shown While all of the peptides        blocked the agonist effects of TNF indicating that they        can act as antagonists KcC KcF and KcF by themselves        induced a cytotoxic response by killing SKNBE cells in        the absence of TNF This is surprising because these        peptides share a hotspot with the natural ligand TNF        which is proliferative rather thancytotoxic and KcC and        KcF bind to a hotspot common to the neutralizing but        noncytotoxic antibody mAb Overall these data suggest        that activation agonism or cytotoxicity of TNFR is        mediated through unique hotspots on the receptor that can        be defined by the peptides Under the present experimental        conditions it is unclear whether the natural ligand TNF        touches the hotspot responsible for cytotoxicity although        one can speculate that if it does the cytotoxic effect        might be nullified by the sum of the natural        ligandreceptor interactions Competition experiments        showing that mAb  reversed the effects of KcC and KcF        confirm that these two peptides induce their effects though        their interaction with TNFR These findings suggest that        TNFR has multiple biological functions In addition to        transferring TNF to TNFR as proposed by the ligand        passing model     TNFR may have a role in modulating        proliferative responses in both positive and negative        manner Ongoing studies will attempt to elucidate the        mechanism of action behind the phenomenon such as the        effects on downstream signaling pathways including NFkB        and apoptosis However it is possible that peptideinduced        cytotoxicity works through a mechanism similar to TNF        mediated apoptosis in Tcells                        Conclusions        In summary HSPLs were isolated with which we were able        to dissect the ligandbinding domain of a natural receptor        and generate information about novel and unexpected        bioactivities This technology has also been successfully        used for known protein targets such as the insulin        receptor    and TNF    as well as nonprotein        targets such as diseasespecific RNAs     We have also        shown that the HSPL libraries identify hotspots on novel        genes of unknown function and identify functional        interaction pathways manuscript in preparation Overall        the use of HSPLs have the potential to become a general        approach for scanning and understanding complex
