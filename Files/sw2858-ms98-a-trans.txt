              okay what do you think are some current trends in uh the way families spend time together based on what youve seen   um i i think that its getting to where theyre not spending time together   yeah     um i think uh like in my situation today on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together my husbands been off doing his thing all day today and ive been off doing my thing all day and i havent seen him since eight oclock this morning   really   so uh   are you newly married or   um two years   yeah yeah same same situation here ive been married about ten months so yeah i can i can i know what you mean   its its really hard hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and uh you both have hobbies that are different you know if you have hobbies that are the same then you know you can enjoy your hobby together but my husband and i have different hobbies   yeah is he a hunter and a fisher and all that   no no hes a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector   thats wild thats wild   um so he was off today uh looking at at records   uhhuh   so uh and i was off you know doing you know house household type things you know laundry and um did some shopping and stuff   yeah um um from the people ive talked to i dont know if i should bring this into it but um a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more um where they could manage their own schedule   uhhuh   and uh they could spend more time with their kids because they look back and you know theyre all like um kind of regretful i think   yeah i i think i think that would be the ideal situation i think that a lot of people like in my case i i do shift work   uhhuh   i dont i dont have that choice   yeah same here   um i have to be at work at at X hour you know at this at at a certain hour and i cant its not flexible um it it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours and and maybe after we decide to have kids i i might find a job that has flexible hours i would i hope so anyway um but i would i dont know   yeah that at TI is that where you work   uhhuh   its really kind of sad some of the people that i work with they like when i worked on second shift um their parent their kids go to school during the day and then they wouldnt see them at night because they would be in you know at work and the kids are going to be in bed   uhhuh   and so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something you know   yeah   so it was really sad just you know that a lot of families um have to well you know have to have dual income a lot of people choose to which is fine   yeah   but you know then the kids come to suffer   yeah i ideally it would it would be nice to be able to just have like back in the old days you know back like when when i grew up   uhhuh huh yeah   you know the the mom stayed home you know and raised the kids my mom didnt go back to work until i was in junior high school   yeah   um so she was there pretty much all my you know formative years   yeah   and that was nice and i liked that and i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids   uh   but i think with the way the future is um economy wise i dont think its going to be realistic   i know unfortunately thats probably true um do you think some the the parents spend quality time with their kids are do you think its more like watching TV and stuff like that not really uh   i yeah i i think that i think very few spend quality time i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff stuff like that i think that um   yeah   um uh most most kids that i see dont really they dont really value quality time   yeah its always that way until   until until theyre older and then they look back   until its too late yeah its true um whats what are some other questions they have im not sure i know  my parents are growing up i guess they never spent much time watching TV in fact ive never seen my mom turn on the TV we didnt really have one very often   oh really   yeah and and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff but you know my dad had his own business and it was easier for them to do that but i i dont know it was  i guess i didnt realize what a luxury it was at the time   yeah i i think kids now a days are raised on TV i mean thats thats almost like a surrogate TV is a surrogate parent   yeah yeah thats a good way to put it   and not a and not a very good one at that   yeah pretty good way to put it   if i had kids well if you had kids what kind of things do you hope to do   um i i hope to of course be able to teach them right from wrong i hope i hope to be able to spend um their growing up years being in the home you know not having to work um and being able to do i i i know a lot of people who who um   yeah   um i work parttime also and i a lot of people that i work for are mothers that stay home   uhhuh   um and they they do a lot of volunteer work and theyre real active in the community and um they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldnt ordinarily be able to do if they were working   uhhuh   and id id like to be able to do that id like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids   do volunteer work and be in clubs and stuff yeah i agree i hope that happens in my case   yeah yeah but i think thats for the the few and far between i think that uh probably ninety percent of the of the um parents out there are are probably working parents   yeah yeah huh   and i i dont i dont really see that that trend changing much if anything i think theres going to be fewer and fewer uh single income families   i know yeah and whats sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids   yeah   that may not necessarily be consistent with yours   exactly see i i never i dont even know what day care is really all about because i i never went to a day care center i never i never had that kind of experience   yeah huh i well i dont even think we had i dont even remember them being around when we were little   yeah i i see it seems like thats thats a big trend you know in the last ten years day cares have have have popped up and become a lot more um a lot bigger part of of the kids lives   yeah   its like a home away from home for a lot of them   sure is um well   i guess we could ring this off since we weve exhausted all of our ideas we seem to agree   yeah i i think yeah i think this is a good closing point   yeah so   well it was really nice talking to you   yeah you too i wish you the best   thanks you too um bye byebye   okay thanks byebye
