            okay all set then uh what do you think about it   uh i think its a real good concept uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined   umhum   from what ive seen on the news  theres a a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing   oh i didnt realize that   yeah um there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test but they didnt know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down and uh turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody elses blood test   umhum   same sort of problem that happens sometimes with these some of these uh like AIDS tests and such   okay umhum yeah thats right i have heard uh  i dont remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh a positive indication of drugs but theres not really there werent really any there uh every now and then theres an error and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated   yeah oh yeah   yeah i i work here at Texas Instruments so uh we we do a let me think do we yeah everyone coming in i guess i did three years ago   yeah yeah   everyone coming in uh goes through the drug testing procedure and   umhum   they talk about it as a  you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions uh   yeah   if they uh they test for drugs i im i cant even remember if we do random sampling anymore i know we did in the military but i dont know if once your in they continue to do it but i guess youre always on call for it   yeah   yeah i not very long ago worked for WalMart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh   uhhuh   a uh drug testing program uh well drug and alcohol testing program its its not a random  through the system as each employee comes in   umhum uhhuh   part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test  um but and uh i think the big problem though is is they send these  off to large labs   in my uhhuh right   and then they have thousands and thousands of the samples that uh going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up and things like that  a potential for inaccuracy   so your big beef with it is the uh is is its a good idea but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better or make sure its a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever yeah i i i tend to agree with you David   yeah yeah   yeah my brother uh my brother used to work for WalMart and then i dont know if he still does or what because i dont know if Sams is actually part of it but he you know is working at Sams now     yeah yeah Sams is part of WalMart   okay yeah then hes been working for the company for a while too yeah he enjoys it good company um you all uh have some his   yeah oh yeah the company i thought was a great place to work   telling me about good profit sharing and all that so   umhum   its good news   yeah they got to have had two or three years in with them then you start buying stock and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against uh uh stock portfolio uh not portfolio just you know against WalMart stock   uhhuh umhum   but uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while   yeah thats what my brother was telling me thats good good news good deal well uh how long were we supposed i havent done this in a couple months how long were we supposed to discuss for   uh youre supposed to get five minutes   okay we got a couple more minutes then i guess  uh think what else i can say about that um   um do you have any idea uh lets see were you were you were tested for drugs as you got into uh as as you got into TI   right um everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test   yeah uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through or   uh no well let me think about that yeah it was after i was i had already been hired um yeah you get hired then you come in the first i   oh okay   seems to me i remember that uh i was hired came in and went through some orientation and i thought i boy i cant remember that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test maybe it was during the interview i came up a couple times for an interview so its hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened but uh i guess just like other companies other friends ive been hearing about that have been moving around its its before they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment so im sure that happened to me too   yeah yeah   what what about oh they just instituted it there at WalMart so   yeah they they it was after i was already working there and they werent testing any of those that were already working so   right right yeah i wasnt
