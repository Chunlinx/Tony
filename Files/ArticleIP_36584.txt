                                 Getting Past the Past                           Please send your questions for publication to prudenceslatecom                                                         DearPrudence                                                      I was adopted and grew up in a very abusivehome I dont seem to be able to get past the bitterness and resentment I feelfor my parents For years I have wanted to confront them about the beatings Itook my mothers drinking and my dads complete indifference At  yearsold I am sober and reasonably successful despite having not completed mybachelors degree in accounting Ive had my own struggle with alcoholism andI have difficulty concentrating on much else besides how I grew upthough Imtrying to get past it                                       Meanwhile probably to assuage their guilt myfolks constantly ask me questions such as Did we raise you right It is hardto bite my tongue and lie to them telling them they spent plenty of qualitytime with me etc My fiancee has been very supportive and has suggested thatwhen my folks open the door with their questions that I should take advantageof it and unload                                       Whats yourtake                                       Closed door in DC                        Dear Closed            It certainly sounds as though your parents haveaccumulated many debits in your emotional ledger Prudie salutes you forpulling yourself together considering some overwhelming obstacles Its clearthat you need to unburden yourself either to a counselor or to your folksUntil all the resentment gets out it will eat away at the vessel it is storedin you            It is interesting andPrudie thinks meaningful that your parents continually pose these questionsAt some level of consciousness they know the answers This might be their wayof asking you to give voice to your feelings and to confront them Youcertainly have nothing to lose Next time such a question is posed ask them ifthey really want the answer If they say yes then try to hold yourselftogether and as calmly as you can give a truthful response Tears are OKhollering is not This may be what theyve been waiting for so that they cantalk about the past and apologize They  as well as you might need togive the disastrous past an airing A repair is possible but if itdoesnt happen youve unburdened yourself let in some sunlight andlost nothing Prudie is for realism and honesty and hopes the balance sheetcomes out with an improved bottom line            Prudie encouragingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      After  years of marriage and raising ourchildren my husband and I have decided to stop torturing each other We brokethe news of the divorce gently to friends and relatives and now are in theprocess of dividing  years of assets Because we see no sense in causing morefinancial distress than necessary we are still under the same roof while wework out the details                                       The problem is Weare not enemies It seems no one can stand this and whenever we encounterfriends or relatives they invariably ask personal questions to try to get eachof us to speak ill of the other As we dont do this the next comment isalways something like Well then why are you getting divorced The worstone was I dont think you really want a divorce or you would have gotten oneby now Please do you have an answer for these wellwishers that would notrequire giving them private and personal information                                       shan                        Dear sha            Who are your friendsa bunch of divorce lawyersPrudie thinks its marvelous that you and your spouse of two decades are ableto unhitch in a civilized amiable manner Unfortunately it has become acommonplace for abouttobe exes to badmouth each other to whomever willlisten Friendly divorces are somewhat unusual but possible Prudiehas even had one            The next time one ofthese yentas tries to goad you into dishing your soontobeformer mate justsmile and say Oh I am saving our life together for my memoirs That kind ofnonanswer always conveys the subtext nothing forthcoming here on to the nextsubject            Prudie admiringly                                             DearPrudence                                                      For my roommatesbirthday last year I took her out to a very expensive restaurant and boughther a nice gift One month later for my birthday she took me to a relativelycheap Mexican restaurant and gave me a Beanie Baby I hate stuffed animalsand she knows that We are both in similar financial situations and I feltcheated Her birthday is coming up soon Should I take her out again or justgive her a small gift and forget our tradition of the birthday dinner                                       Living With Selfish                        Dear Liv                           If you are surethat the two of you are in financially similar circumstances and also that sheknows of your dislike for stuffed animals Prudie suggests you send out forChinese food for her birthday dinner and give her back the Beanie Baby with afunny card Prudie says this because the roomie is obviously cheapand maybeeven hostile If she remarks on the tradition being different for herbirthday this year than last simply tell her that you are following her leadabout what level of celebration is appropriate This may totally louse up theliving situation so be prepared Because you refer to her as selfishhowever you may not wish to keep this arrangement going forever Maybe stick abirthday candle into the fortune cookie            Prudie reciprocally                                             DearPrudence                                                      During college my best friend was a fellownamed Jay We operated a small business together and continued daily contactfor over  years Things have gone smoothly for for Jay He moved toWashington DC and has worked as a highranking government official Sincehis move however our friendship has hit some snags He hangs out withpompous members of the political establishment has grown arrogant and doesnthave time to return my calls Late last week I heard that Jay is gettingmarried to the youngest daughter of a political crony and has failed toinvite me                                       Heres where Imstuck Even though my feelings are hurt should I send Jay a polite note ofcongratulations Shall I assume our friendship is over because he didnt inviteme I welcome your insightful advice                                       Joey                        Dear Jo            The fact that Jay didntinvite you by itself would not signal the friendships end but thetoobusytoreturnphonecalls does You two have obviously grown apart Timeand Life not the magazines often cool formerly warm relationships Prudiethinks it would be fine as a tip of the hat to what used to be to write him acongratulatory note if that is your inclination Dont do it however if itspurpose would be  to get an invitation or  to give him the needle Just bythe by it sounds as if you disapprove of this mans pompous friends andgrowing arrogance so give the friendship a decent burial emotionallyremember the good times and move on            Prudierealistically
