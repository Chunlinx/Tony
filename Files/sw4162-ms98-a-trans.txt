        well i think um       for at least for me uh because my sister is looking for day care one of the things that we talked about as being very important is the um   umhum   the in the teacher to uh the number of kids   umhum   because if youve got a lot a large number of children one teacher just wont cut it   right even if its in the home i think this is important even if its a private home situation   right right   and not a day care   umhum   um probably number one too would be close references if you know people that have had the experience at they hands on experience of one   right   would be very important word of mouth   word of mouth is good uh something that i dont think many people know about and i this is just something ive heard not something ive actually experienced um checked into is that um the agency that uh that license   um friends   um agencies agencies to care for kids like home either home or day care you can you can request to see if they have had any problems in the past   umhum umhum   is what ive been told   umhum   that would be a good a good resource to check   right right and all of course better business i would check any of your business um  any type of thing references of that type   umhum   as well as your word of mouth if you were putting them in uh uh school or any day care type you know thats public   umhum   you know what i mean like a church or a school type thing   yeah oh yeah oh yeah   i would check that awfully close um id go in often   yes and in and theres some places im sorry go ahead   unexpectedly unexpectedly wherever they where   right because then theres some places and i would and i would dont this would be a a big minus for the places there are some places that state that you cannot come in unannounced   umhum   you have to have an appointment or you know or whatever and i dont think you know if there humum   umhum umhum i wouldnt do that i mean i wouldnt not put my child in there though would you   no no never   you know i would never have a controlled situation not with a little one especially   yes   you know thats not a not a good situation on that   and i think youve also got to look you know whenever you go in and you know talk to the talk to the the the teachers and look at the toys that they have and the environment that the kidsll be in   umhum umhum umhum right thats real important i believe so too to meet the and administrators as well and really kind of   yes   research it and get an idea of how they feel about things you know have your questions ready on their feelings on things and all   umhum umhum   kind of how they basically anyway because they you know thats um seventy percent your childs life   umhum   you know is developing is there   yeah   so thats real important do you have any children in it yourself   no um i like i said my sisters in the process of trying to find one for hers   your sister is umhum yeah its a scary thing my daughters been in Houston and had to do it you know just out of the cold shes had to   umhum   but shes been real fortunately in finding women in their homes   right   and uh   right and and thats a good situation but it can it can it can turn bad with older children   umhum   um i was in a day care until i was thirteen just during like in the summers   uhhuh uhhuh   and what we found was and what finally got me out of this womens home was the fact that she would go off shopping with some of the older kids and leave me there to care for the little ones   oh wow yeah   you know and i mean this went on for a summer for a you know good two and a half months   umhum   you know and its her daily thing you know and so if youve got older children that you just dont want to leave at home   umhum umhum   sometimes a day care a a a private home or a day care setting is not the best   not the best situation yeah yeah thats for sure   right  right so but oh and another one is is how they discipline   umhum   um i know depending a couple of the day cares that that i went to whenever i was younger um one of them disciplined whenever we were outside you hugged a tree and you had time out   umhum umhum   whereas you know ive heard of some agencies you know that get into the physical discipline   umhum umhum   and you you really have to find a discipline that that matches your beliefs   yes right and what you would want done right yeah   or yeah right because it gets it can it can become very confusing for the child   umhum   so   i would think so   oh yeah   yeah   hm what about um well im in im in nursing   umhum   so one thing i would look at would be um   the cleanliness and the care health care   the cleanliness and the care the health thats right the certification of the of the teachers teachers   umhum umhum right   because theres a new state law mandating that everyone that works in a day care   umhum   knows knows infant and child CPR   right   but theres a lot of places
