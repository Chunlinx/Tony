                       ToEverything Intern Intern Intern                        I used to really like                  Slate                and I used to point it out to friends who were new to theInternet as an example of the best of the best I used to read everything andreally enjoyed doing so Now I am disgusted In fairness I am disgusted withother media outlets too Its just that I thought you guys would not run withthe pack so quickly on the Lewinsky scandal            There is other news goingon Some of it is pretty darn interesting We are probably going to have GulfWar II and it has every promise of being a hell of a lot nastier with morecivilian and more military casualties than ever before We have problems inBosnia Ireland and the Middle East Something interesting will probably bedeveloping around Cuba too If its sex you must talk about talk about thepope standing on an island and coming out against birth control again            Even if there were no othernews I just do not care about anyones sex life this much If there are othercrimes they will surely come out in the form of sound evidence and then theremight be a story            I lookforward to seeing                   Slate                again as a thinking persons mediaoutlet for people who have a life and need not read such junk Get back towork You are going to get hair on your palms if you keep this up

Dispatchthat Linda Tripps bugging of Monica Lewinsky is among the worst personalbetrayals I can imaginemuch worse in moral if not in legal terms thananything Clinton is accused of doing Surely Weisberg sees that adultery isthe ultimate personal betrayal It is the breaking of a vow of permanent sexualfidelity For those married by a religious authority such as Bill Clinton itis moreover a betrayal of ones community of faith and ones God Secretlytaping a friend is bad but friendship is less serious a relationship thanmarriage            But Ibegin to see in the publics indifference to the myriad accusations ofpresidential adultery that Weisberg speaks for the majority Whatever thereasons for this deplorable twist in public morality Americas loss of itsmoral compass is a tragedy even more consequential than Bill Clintonsadultery             John M OwenIV                                       MommyDearest                        In All the PresidentsWomen David Plotz lists the women frequently linked to President Clintonand the qualities they share he may have omitted something Many of thequalities attributed to Clintons women also describe his mother VirginiaKelley            She was a bighairedbrunette with a fleshy face full lips and large teeth Her clothes wereperhaps not exactly revealing but flashy nonetheless She enjoyed music tooand above all she was loyal to him            PerhapsClinton has an Oedipus complex There could be a Freudian angle to this wholesaga             LieslMassaro Fairfax Va                           Nightmarein Glen Oaks

our natural profound revulsion at the thought of the procedures used inabortion to an aesthetic response All abortions are grotesque or grossHis own viewpoint might be termed the anaesthetic approach As long as a fetusisnt conscious of any painisnt in his terms a sensate awarecreatureits OK to kill that fetus Such reasoning isnt much of a basis forpolicy either What distinguishes his unconscious fetus from someone undergeneral anesthesia Obviously Gawande is employing other criteria to make thatdistinction            In fact he follows the sameaesthetic that has worked so well for the socalled prochoice movement fordecades It can be summed up in a clich out of sight out of mind What makesthe focus on partialbirth abortion relevant is not its statistical impact butthe vividness of its picture of the real horrors of abortion Gawande himselfadmits that as a medical technique nothing makes partialbirth abortionfundamentally different from other forms of lateterm abortion            Gawande tries to gloss overhis discomforteveryones discomfortwith the cruelty and injustice ofabortion by comparing it to other unpleasant surgical procedures There is anobvious difference however between amputating a leg and aborting a fetus Theformer will not left to grow in its normal course become an independent humanperson            Gawandeadmits that knowing whether we have the technology to keep the fetus alivedoesnt answer the more fundamental question of when a fetus becomes aconscious being Medical science cannot now and perhaps never will be able toanswer that question Still less is science competent to pronounce on theexistence of the human soul It is for these reasons that the rights of thefetus must be defended as strongly as those of any other person
