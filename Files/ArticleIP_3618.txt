                                 Style Lab            One of my favorite thingsabout New York City is the way businesses huddle together The diamond dealersare all on  th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues Brazilianrestaurants are on  th and  th  If you want a guitarnew or used you need to go to  th Street Furs are in the high soff Seventh Avenue sewing machines are on West  th  Some of thesedistricts are ancient but new commercial clusters are emerging all the timeAt the moment one of the most pleasing is a little neighborhood a few blockseast of the once superfashionable neighborhood of SoHo In a dozen shops onElizabeth Mott and Prince streets the common thread is styleand anapproach to it that I find very appealing            A fewyears ago this neighborhood was a no mans land Bordered on the east by NewYorks fabled skid row the Bowery and on the south by Little Italy it stillhas something of the flavor of a faded ethnic neighborhood with Italianbutchers and windowless social clubs and old people sitting out on card chairson the sidewalk But lately the tone has been set by a group of small clothingstores that share an amorphous design sensibility Whats ordinarily sounappealing about fashion is its combination of snobbery high cost andhumorlessness Whats wonderful about these places is that they are just theopposite unsnooty relatively inexpensive and fun Many are presided over byrecent graduates of the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Parsons andRhode Island schools of design who are going into business for the first timeThey all have a workinprogress schoolproject attitude Most dont openuntil  oclock if then and they close whenever people stop coming in Onnice afternoons friends drop in on their bicycles to say hello and examine thegoods In several of the stores the owners apologized for not having theirfall collections finishedafter Labor Day Theres an pmatKinkosfeeling to the enterprise            Nevertheless NoLIta as the area is disagreeably calledthe abbreviation stands for North of Little Italy has become a styleincubator for the rest of the city which means for the country which meansfor the world The neighborhood is a favorite scouting territory for designersand buyers for largerscale style setters such as Calvin Klein as well as fornational chains such as J Crew Urban Outfitters and the Gap who come totroll for inspiration to put it charitably These chains many of which haveelegant flagship stores in nearby SoHo do with clothes what Target and IKEA dowith furniture and household objectsthey disseminate an affordable version ofurban chic to the middle class In the new ecology of downtown New Yorkstylistic innovation of various kinds is most likely to take place to the eastof Lafayette Street in NoLIta or the East Village or on the Lower East SideTo the west of Lafayette in SoHo those styles are marked up and sold to theunknowing In some cases the massmade interpretations are direct ripoffsfrom small independent designers who dont seem to mind For the most partthey take plagiarism as flattery At this stage in their careers thevalidation they get from seeing their stylistic ideas catch on is moreimportant than credit or royalties            Part ofwhats appealing about these places is that the idea of style they embody isholistic All the details of the store convey an aesthetic the lettering onthe window the paper stock used for business cards the lighting the floorthe ceiling the display racks The stores are designed by people who payattention to how everything looks But they manage to do so in the mainwithout seeming precious or prissy about it            Click tostart the tour            Once on the tour click anumbered square to advance to that tour stop            Click for textmostlyversion
