                                 Hamburger Hyper            As food scares go it wasnteven especially sickening Fewer than  people fell ill and not one died Yetthe Hudson Foods E coli outbreak in Colorado was all over the nationsheadlines The danger is not that the public has been needlessly alarmed butrather that the US Department of Agriculture and the media have focusedattention on the wrong threats            Awakeup call for American consumers is how one activist described the eventThe only thing is such outbreaks are not rare events In fact they arerelatively common and have been happening at least a few times a year for morethan a decade the further back Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecords go the spottier they get Only last Friday more than  poundsof beef were recalled from stores in Virginia and on Monday the AssociatedPress reported another outbreak at an Iowa high school            Nor was the Colorado E coli incident of unusualproportions There have been  bigger ones in the last  years            So why thebig national spaz over a small example of a relatively common occurrence Wellthe USDA said this was a big deal because  Hudson was reworking past daysmeat into current production and  Hudsons recordkeeping was so sloppy thatthe contamination couldnt be traced back to the real sourceone of half adozen slaughterhouses            But neither of those claims is the whole truthYes Hudson was adding rework to its new production but the USDA knew andapproved of the practice Rework is even part of the prototype stateoftheartfoodsafety program that USDAapproved plants must put into effect by earlynext year And yes problems with paperwork made it difficult to trace thecontaminated meat to its source But that was not because the paperwork wasshoddy Rather it was because the reworked old meat was being added into newproduct throughout the day instead of to a single easily traceable lot at thebeginning of the day The USDA knew of that practice too and two USDAinspectors supervised its implementation at the plant every day            But evenif everything the USDA argued was strictly true it didnt need to recallmillion pounds  days production Industry experts and the CDC agree ittakes a certain level of contamination to pose a threat Even if a whole daysproduction were contaminated and a small amount of leftover contaminated beefreworked into ensuing production within days the E coli which is veryslowgrowing in a nonconducive environment such as chilled beef would be sodiluted that it wouldnt pose a threat to anyone Even leaving wide margins forsafety at most the USDA should have recalled between  million and  millionpounds of beef            Hudson however is not innocent in all this Thehamburgers that caused the Colorado outbreak were practically designed toprevent E coli from cooking When prepared as Hudson recommended the size andthe shape of the burgers was such that the outside would have had to be burnedif the center was to be cooked            Butwhatever the USDA and Hudson might have done to contribute to the nationalruckus was topped by the media coverage Can This Meat Kill You screamedNewsweek s ridiculous Sept  cover The text within was no lesshysterical E Coli affects as many as  people in the United States eachyear Newsweek reported The CDCs latest numbers place the totals atonetenth that though it is true that they may be somewhat underreported Infact you are a hundred times more likely to die of a newly contractedinfection when you spend a night in a hospital than you are when you eat ahamburger            But just because the USDA flew off the handleand the press blew the story doesnt mean theres no story here E colioutbreaks are increasing and their sources are growing more and more diverseranging from swimming pools to salads But all the smokeblowing around meatprocessors is obscuring the real problem            A serious effort to curb Ecoli would focus on the cattle rather than on the processing of their meatEach of their four stomachs is a breeding ground for the virulent E colibacteria which is estimated to infect between  percent and  percent of USlivestock            In factground beef isnt the fastestgrowing source of E coli Runoff from cattlepastures goes into lakes where swimmers get infected Cattle manure is used tofertilize fields and the produce infects those who eat it            Cattle however enjoy the powerful protection inWashington DC of the nations ranchers who gave millions in the lastelection cycle And the ranchers are mighty resistant to any changes that couldcost them money Still some changes could be made quite easily Industryconsultant RA LaBudde argues that testing and exclusion of infected cattle isone possibilitywe already do it for a number of cattleborne infections likebrucellosis Cattle could also be kept off feed for  or more hours beforethey are slaughtered This would make their E colibearing digestive systemless likely to rupture thus making contamination less likely The problemwith this idea is that it violates the  Humane Slaughter Law Cattle needtheir last meal after all            Technologymay soon provide some solutions In August Mike Doyle of the University ofGeorgia applied for a patent on some nonvirulent strains of E coli that wipeout the nasty version when fed to cattle            The USDA argues however that what is neededis more enforcement power and to that end it is advancing a bill designed toexpand its authority The bill is irrelevant though No company has refused torecall meat that the USDA said needed recalling And considering that Hudson amillionayear company was dismembered in the wake of its cooperationwith the USDA any new powers would pale compared with what the department hasalready            If the USDA is interested intaking a hard look at the meat industry maybe it should look for inspirationto the battle between the Food and Drug Administration and the tobaccocompanies It is common practice to add fat back into hamburger to reach thehigh levels that consumers demandjust like cigarette makers add nicotine Itis a good bet that more people died last year from the extra fat they consumedin their Burger King burgers than will ever die from E coli
