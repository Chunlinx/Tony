                                 A Tip for Parents            The Washington Post leads with todays expected congressionaltestimony by a senior DOJ official weighing in against renewing the IndependentCounsel statute which is the first time the Clinton administration hasofficially taken this stand and marks a reversal of Justices longstandingsupport for the IC The New YorkTimes plays this story topfront but leads instead with MadeleineAlbrights meetings in Beijing with top Chinese officials in which sheexpressed the USs displeasure with their recent crackdown on oppositiongroups but was nonetheless encouraging about Chinas chances of joining theWorld Trade Organization The Times sees the meeting as illustrating theClinton administrations persistent separating of human rights and economicissues when it comes to China The Los AngelesTimes fronts Albright reading her stance as more of a honeymoon isover break from past Clinton China policy but leads with the pledge by whatit calls one of the nations most aggressive labor unions to spend  million ayear to organize physicians especially those who are salaried employees oflarge organizations such as HMOs USA Todayleads with revelations at a congressional hearing yesterday that the IRS cannotperform some of the basic accounting and recordkeeping tasks it expects oftaxpayers According to the story based on a GAO report sloppy IRS practicesmeant that in the first nine months of  the agency doled out  million infraudulent and wrong refunds and that it lost track of a Chevy Blazer and a laser printer The IRS didnt dispute the charges but attributed theproblems to outdated computers and personnel turnover problems itsaddressing says the paper but which take time            According to the Post and NYT which scrupulously creditstodays Post for all such details Deputy Attorney General Eric Holderwill testify that the IC statute cannot be fixed but also that there is no needto do so since the DOJ can investigate most official wrongdoing itself Whenthere would be a conflict of interest in doing so Holder will say the DOJcould still name special counsels But the papers dont say how this capabilityis thought by the administration to avoid the perceived most problematicfeature of the current law that if an independent counsel is to be truly notcontrolled by the executive branch he must be virtually immune from dismissalBoth papers show how times have changed by quoting Janet Reno in  when theClinton administration was plumping for the statutes renewal It is my firmconviction that the law has been a good one helping to restore publicconfidence in our systems ability to investigate wrongdoing by highlevelExecutive Branch officials            The WP  which along with the Boston Globe previously broke thenews that UN weapons inspection teams operating in Iraq employed equipmentand personnel provided by US intelligence services today deepens the story with the claim that such infiltrationwent on for three years was without the knowledge of the UN teams andproduced much valuable intelligence that was completely unrelated to theinspectors assignments This contrasts the paper explains with previousClinton administration reactions to the original story according to which anysuch use of intelligence equipment or agents was done with the full wittingcooperation of the inspectors and produced information related to theirinspection mission The story contains excellent detail about how the covertintelligence collection worked the radio relay system used by the UNinspectors to transmit images from the hinterlands back to Baghdad concealedantennas used to intercept Iraqi military transmissions The story also revealsthat some of the UN inspectors suspected US hanky panky as did an Iranianspy in Baghdad whose radio message about the operation was intercepted byBritish intelligence When the Brits asked the US what was up says thepaper they werent told            The fronts at USAT  the WP and LAT report that thenations main group of pediatricians has substantially backed off its longheldneutral position on circumcision for male infants The group now holds that thepractice is not essential to a childs wellbeing and that parents should notbe coerced by medical professionals into having it done Also the group saysthat if the procedure is done the baby should receive pain relief beforehandThe report does say that physicians should respect opting for the operation onreligious or cultural grounds            Todays Papers has more than a passing
