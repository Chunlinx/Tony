                                 Larry Bird            When Larry Bird and MagicJohnson retired six years ago they left the National Basketball Association inthe capable hands of Michael Jordan Now Bird wants it back His Indiana Pacersface the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in what could beJordans final season Basketball pundits think that the tough wily Pacers arethe team that can dethrone the fivetime champion Bulls            Bird athing of beauty and a joy forever as a player is turning out to be a fabulouscoach too When lured out of retirement a year agohe was bored to death offishing and golfingthe Pacers had just finished a miserable  season hadmissed the playoffs and were led by a core of aging disgruntled players Thisyear with a virtually identical roster Bird has coached Indiana to a recordthe best in the teams history Tuesday Bird wasnameddeservedlythe NBAs Coach of the Year Wednesday his team finished offthe New York Knicks to advance to the conference finals            Larry Legends emergence as a coaching phenom issurprising In part its so because when he played for the Celtics he used tosay he would never coach in the NBA Its also surprising because Bird theCoach is not much like Bird the Player at least not in the ways you mightexpect            At IndianaState University and during his early NBA career Bird gulled fans opposingplayers and the media He played the rube He had grown up in the small poorIndiana town of French Lick and he dubbed himself the Hick from French LickHis redneck accent and reinforced the impression that he was a dim good olboy So did his doughy face blond feathered hair and beaky nose Thefootinch Bird looks appropriately very much like Big Bird            But behind that bumpkins exterior lurked a manof endless guile and will Bird may have been slow but he was an astoundingpasser an elegant shooter a vicious rebounder and the leagues toughestcompetitor He was always busy on the court If he didnt make the assist hemade the basket if he didnt make the basket he grabbed the rebound if hedidnt grab the rebound he made the steal He was also a relentlesspsychological warrior So taciturn in public Bird was the NBAs most notorioustrash talker mocking opponents attempts to guard him Once when Magicrushed over to stop him Larry stared at him said You know youre too lateand buried a jumper Bird goaded and inspired his own teammates and theyheeded him If he told a teammate to do something he did it Thanks in largepart to Bird the Celtics were a  singleminded and selfless            Bird andMagic are permanently yoked in NBA legend They entered the NBA together rosetogether retired together One of the greatest achievements of each is that hedestroyed the stereotype about himself Magic the black mouthy Showtimeguard won over basketball fogies with his sound fundamentals and courtintelligence Bird the solid white guy won over Magics fans with hiscreative shooting and flashy passing            So why is Birds coaching career taking off when Magicsflopped Magics game stint coaching the Los Angeles Lakers was a disasterHe failed as a coach for the reason that other great players have failed ascoaches He thought about himself too much He complained his players didntcare about the game the way he did He felt he still belonged on the court Butthe yearold Bird has a cranky back and hes accomplished everything anybasketball player could ever dream of He doesnt want to play anymore and hedoesnt need to show off            As aresult Bird is a very effective very unobtrusive leader The player who usedto be involved in every play has become a coach who is hardly involved in anyof them Player Bird was a maximalist Coach Bird is a minimalist Hispredecessor as Pacers coach Larry Brown hectored and nitpicked in practicesand games Bird is quiet has short meetings and never chews out his playerspublicly He doesnt criticize them when they make turnovers or commit foulsand he doesnt tell them how to play He treats them as professionals just ashe liked his coaches to treat him            Birds coaching philosophy which he repeatsover and over is Its a players game He laid down a few commandments Thoushalt be well conditioned thou shalt be  thou shalt not hotdog Then he lethis players do their jobs            Pacersguard Mark Jackson explained Birds handsoff style this way to the DenverPost  You dont have to tell Chris Mullin how to come off a pick Youdont have to tell Reggie Miller what to do when he catches the ball in thefourth quarter You dont have to teach Rik Smits how to make post moves            The laissezfaire philosophy has worked wonders on thePacers Last year they were spooked This season they sense Birds trustThey play confidently hustle and never choke in the fourth quarter Theyreselfless They have the most balanced scoring of any NBA team Its true thatthe Pacers dont play beautiful or acrobatic basketball They play somethingmuch rarer in the NBA these days team basketball The greatest tribute to Birdis that his players now play as he used to            Withtypical canniness Bird chose to coach a team that would listen to him ThePacers are veterans The average age in the starting lineup is  and theroster is filled by NBA workhorses such as Mullin Jackson and Dale DavisThey have only one star Miller and no prima donnas            Could Bird manage a different group of playersIts a fulltime job just controlling the young hotheads on some NBA squadsLike many NBA oldtimers Bird deplores the MTVification of the league Hedoesnt like its glitz and disapproves of young players greed And he has saidhe wouldnt want to coach a team of youngsters            Bird might not want to coachkids but he surely could The Pacer who has made the most improvement underBird is Jalen Rose Rose used to be the NBA head case par excellence When heentered the NBA a few years ago he was supposed to be the next Magic afootinch guard who could do everything But Rose struggled poutedmightily feuded with coaches and generally demoralized himself and theplayers around him Under Bird he has settled in happily as a Pacers roleplayer Hes playing a little more scoring a little more and cooperating alot more Bird gave him respect and Rose reciprocated            It wouldbe a fitting reward for Bird if his mature Calvinist style did catch on aroundthe league Maybe just as he helped revive pro basketball as a player in theearly s he can revive the game as a coach in the late s saving it for ageneration of kids who never saw Larry Legend
