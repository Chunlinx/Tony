                            In  Richard Feynman delivered what many consider the first lecture on        nanotechnology This lecture presented to the American Physical Society at the California        Institute of Technology prompted intense discussion about the possibilities or        impossibilities of manipulating materials at the molecular level Although at the time of        his presentation the manipulation of single molecules and single atoms seemed improbable        if not impossible Feynman challenged his audience to consider a new field of physics one        in which individual molecules and atoms would be manipulated and controlled at the        molecular level Feynman         As an example of highly successful machines at the small scale Feynman prompted his        audience to consider the inherent properties of biological cells He colorfully noted that        although cells are very tiny they are very active they manufacture various substances        they walk around they wiggle and they do all kinds of wonderful things on a very small        scale Feynman  Of course many of these wonderful things that he was referring to        are a result of the activities of proteins and protein complexes within each cell        The field of nanotechnology has indeed emerged and blossomed since Feynmans         lecture and scientists from many disciplines are now taking a careful look at the protein        machines that power biological cells Drexler  These machines are inherently        nanoscale ranging in width from a few nanometers nm to over  nm and have been        carefully refined by millions of years of evolution        As a graduate student in molecular biology I have been especially interested in        creative approaches to bridging the fields of biology and nanotechnology Both DNA and        protein molecules possess a number of intrinsic characteristics that make them excellent        candidates for the assembly of dynamic nanostructures and nanodevices Properties such as        the sitespecific molecular recognition among interacting protein molecules the        templatedirected self assembly of complementary DNA strands and the mechanical properties        of certain protein complexes have enabled bionanotechnologists to envision a molecular        world built from the bottom up using biologicalbased starting materials        In my own research I have been very interested in investigating protein interactions        and protein pathways on a genomewide scale In many ways protein pathways are analogous        to nanoscale assembly lines since protein pathways often involve a series of proteins        that act in successive order to yield a particular molecular product or perform a        particular molecular function While these proteinbased assembly lines are commonplace        within biological cells they prompt two interesting questions with respect to the field of        nanotechnology First can we mimic these multicomponent proteinbased assembly lines on        nanofabricated surfaces And second can we tailor these nanoscale assembly lines to        perform new and unique tasks        Nanomechanical protein complexes such as the rotary ATP synthase complex have also        generated much interest from a nanotechnology standpoint Soong et al  These protein        complexes enable highly controlled mechanical motion at the nanoscale and may some day lead        to novel rotary machines that function as molecular motors for a variety of nanoscale        applications        In order to fully exploit these nanoscale protein machines it is of prime importance to        be able to position individual proteins and protein complexes at the nanoscale        Progress in this area has recently been reported by Yan et al  who developed a        method to construct twodimensional protein arrays using DNAdirected templates Building        on work pioneered by Nadrian Seeman Seeman  Yan et al constructed twodimensional        DNA nanogrids by exploiting the pairing that occurs between complementary DNA strands        Figure  The twodimensional DNA nanogrid exhibits a repeating periodic structure        Figure B due to the inherent qualities of the individual DNA tiles that make up the        nanogrid Figure A The distance between adjacent tile centers is approximately  nm        approximately  turns of the DNA double helix plus the diameter of two DNA helices        Yan et al utilized these DNA nanogrids to assemble periodic protein nanoarrays The DNA        nanogrid in this case served as a molecular scaffold for the self assembly of protein        molecules into ordered arrays In order to control the location of protein assembly Yan et        al first tethered a covalently linked biotin moiety to the central region of each DNA        tile The biotin was covalently linked to one of the DNA strands at the position        corresponding to the center of the tile This design resulted in a uniform array of        biotinylated tiles with each biotin moiety separated by about  nm The authors then        added streptavidin a protein that has a strong binding affinity for biotin to form a        periodic streptavidin protein array on top of the biotinylated DNA lattice The resulting        array represents the first periodic selfassembled DNA lattice in which individual protein        molecules are precisely positioned into a periodic array with nanometer dimensions        It is interesting to consider some of the applications of selfassembled protein arrays        Soong et al  demonstrated that the ATP synthase protein complex could be used to        power the rotation of an inorganic nickel nanopropeller ATP synthase is a multisubunit        protein complex with a domain that rotates about its membranebound axis during the natural        hydrolysis of ATP within a cell Soong et al attached a nanoscale inorganic propeller to        the rotary stalk of ATP synthase creating a rotary biomolecular motor It is intriguing        to consider the construction of an ordered array of ATP synthase driven nanomachines each        positioned precisely along a DNA scaffold similar to that described by Yan et al Such an        assembly combined with proposed nanogears Han et al  may one day enable the        construction of nanoscale variations of the traditional geartrain and rackandpinion        gearing systems Construction of such systems may facilitate the design of machines that        can transmit and transform rotary motion at the nanoscale        In addition to rotary biomolecular motors proteins that undergo substantial        conformational changes in response to external stimuli might also find some interesting        uses in nanoarrays Dubey et al  are working on methods to exploit the pH dependent        conformational changes of the hemagglutinin HA viral protein to construct what they term        viral protein linear VPL motors Proteins that undergo substantial conformational changes        in response to environmental stimuli may facilitate the design of nanoscale machines that        produce linear motion Drexler  as opposed to rotary motion At neutral pH the HA         polypeptide forms a compact structure composed of two helices folded        back onto each other At low pH HA         undergoes a substantial conformational change which results in a        single extended helix This conformational change results in a linear mechanical motion        with a linear movement of approximately  nm Dubey et al  It would be interesting        to investigate the applications of ordered arrays of dynamic VPL motors since an array of        such hinge structures may enable the coordinated linear movement of hundreds of tethered        macromolecules in a synchronous manner        The work of Yan et al  has opened up exciting new avenues in the field of        nanotechnology and has provided the molecular framework for the construction of dynamic        proteinbased assemblies It is foreseeable that variations of these same DNA scaffolds        will eventually be used for the design and construction of more complex proteinbased        assemblies such as nanoscale assembly lines or periodic arrays of dynamic motor        proteins This work is important to me because it demonstrates not only that it is possible        to create uniform arrays of protein biomolecules using biomolecular scaffolds but the        study also emphasizes the important role that molecular biology will undoubtedly play as        the field of nanotechnology matures        As the field of nanotechnology continues to evolve it is likely that we will see many        more nanotechnology applications utilizing biological macromolecules Toward the end of        Richard Feynmans  lecture he quipped What are the possibilities of small but        movable machines They may or may not be useful but they surely would be fun to make
