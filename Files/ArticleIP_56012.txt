Silent Run DeepRun the Answer                        A  assessment by the US Navy supports thecontinued exclusion of women from serving on submarines            It is unsurprising that the Navy generallyregarded as the most hidebound branch of the military and the one mostresistant to ending racial segregation found a compelling need in thenational interest and for essential military purposes that you wouldntunderstand to sustain a reactionary social policy What is unexpected is thatthe debate on submarine duty has been reopened One reason money The Navy isbuilding a new class of submarines and it would be less expensive to includeseparate quarters for men and women in the initial construction than to makechanges later should women at some point be granted the vote            Women serve on submarines in the navies of othernations including those of Australia Norway and Sweden but there is muchopposition within the US submarine service to altering the current policy Ionly
