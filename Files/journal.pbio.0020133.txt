                            Although the word revolution should not be used lightly in science there is no other        way to describe the recent explosion in our awareness and understanding of RNAmediated        gene silencing pathways The central player in RNAmediated gene silencing is a        doublestranded RNA dsRNA that is chopped into tiny RNAs by the enzyme Dicer The tiny        RNAs associate with various silencing effector complexes and attach to homologous target        sequences RNA or DNA by basepairing Depending on the protein composition of the effector        complex and the nature of the target sequence the outcome can be either mRNA degradation        translational repression or genome modification all of which silence gene expression        Figure  Present in plants animals and many fungi RNAmediated gene silencing        pathways have essential roles in development chromosome structure and virus resistance        Although the mechanistic details are still under investigation RNAmediated silencing has        already provided a powerful tool for studying gene function and spawned a fledgling        industry that aims to develop novel RNAbased therapeutics to treat human diseases        Robinson         Many biologists first learned of RNAmediated gene silencing in  following the        discovery in the nematode worm         Caenorhabditis elegans Fire et al  of a process called        RNA interference RNAi in which dsRNA triggers sequencespecific mRNA degradation The        roots of RNAmediated silencing however can be traced back  years when a handful of        botanical labs stumbled across strange cases of gene silencing in transgenic plants To        highlight the many seminal contributions of plant scientists to the field we offer here a        personal perspective on the origins and history of RNAmediated gene silencing in        plants                    Early Silencing Phenomena        Starting in the late s biologists working with transgenic plants found themselves        confronted with a bewildering array of unanticipated gene silencing phenomena        Martienssen and Richards  Most intriguing were cases in which silencing seemed to be        triggered by DNA or RNA sequence interactions which could occur between two separate        transgenes that shared sequence homology or between a transgene and homologous plant gene        Several early examples supplied the prototypes for two types of RNAmediated gene silencing        that are recognized today In one type silencing results from a block in mRNA synthesis        transcriptional gene silencing TGS in the second type silencing results from mRNA        degradation posttranscriptional gene silencing PTGS Figure         TGS was revealed when two different transgene complexes were introduced in sequential        steps into the tobacco genome Each complex encoded different proteins but contained        identical gene regulatory regions promoters Unexpectedly the first transgene complex        which was stably active on its own often became silenced in the presence of the second        Figure  The promoters of the silenced transgenes acquired DNA methylation a genome        modification frequently associated with silencing Silencing and methylation were reversed        when the transgene complexes segregated from each other in progeny suggesting that        interactions between the common promoter regions triggered silencing and methylation        Matzke et al  Park et al         PTGS was discovered in two ways One involved experiments to evaluate antisense        suppression a promising approach at the time for selectively silencing plant gene        expression In theory antisense RNA encoded by a transgene should basepair to the        complementary mRNA of a plant gene preventing its translation into protein Although the        control sense transgene RNAs are unable to basepair to mRNA and hence should not induce        silencing they often inexplicably did Smith et al  In another type of experiment        efforts to enhance floral coloration in petunia by overexpressing a transgene encoding a        protein involved in pigment synthesis led paradoxically to partial or complete loss of        color Figure  This resulted from coordinate silencing cosuppression of both the        transgene and the homologous plant gene Napoli et al  Van der Krol et al         later shown to occur at the posttranscriptional level De Carvalho et al  Van        Blokland et al  A related phenomenon called quelling was observed in the        filamentous fungus         Neurospora crassa Romano and Macino  Similarly to TGS        PTGS was often associated with DNA methylation of transgene sequences Ingelbrecht et al                Two influential papers appeared in the early s One reported the discovery of        RNAdirected DNA methylation in transgenic tobacco plants Wassenegger et al  This        was the earliest demonstration of RNAinduced modification of DNA a process that we return        to below A second study showed that plant RNA viruses could be both initiators and targets        of PTGS Plants expressing a transgene encoding a truncated viral coat protein became        resistant to the corresponding virus a state achieved by mutual degradation of viral RNA        and transgene mRNA Lindbo et al  In addition to forging a link between RNA virus        resistance and PTGS this study included a remarkably prescient model for PTGS that        featured an RNAdependent RNA polymerase RDR small RNAs and dsRNA all of which were        later found to be important for the RNAi PTGS was subsequently shown in  to protect        plants naturally from virus infection Covey et al  Ratcliff et al  Transgene        PTGS thus tapped into a preexisting natural mechanism for combating viruses        To recap by the year in which RNAi was reportedplant scientists had documented        sequencespecific RNA degradation PTGS sequencespecific DNA methylation that triggered        TGS and RNAdirected DNA methylation They had also proposed models for PTGS involving        dsRNA Lindbo et al  Metzlaff et al  small RNAs and RDR Lindbo et al                            RNAi        RNAi was discovered in experiments designed to compare the silencing activity of        singlestranded RNAs ssRNAs antisense or sense with their dsRNA hybrid While only        marginal silencing of a target gene was achieved after injecting worms with the individual        strands injection of a senseantisense mixture resulted in potent and specific silencing        Fire et al  This unequivocally fingered dsRNA as the trigger of silencing Shortly        thereafter dsRNA was shown to provoke gene silencing in other organisms including plants        Waterhouse et al  Indeed the relatedness of RNAi PTGS and quelling was confirmed        when genetic analyses in worms plants and         Neurospora identified common components in the respective        silencing pathways Denli and Hannon  This included the aforementioned RDR which can        synthesize dsRNA from ssRNA templates see Figure  PTGS is now accepted as the plant        equivalent of RNAi        The discovery of RNAi established a requirement for dsRNA in silencing but details of        the mechanism remained unclear In  plant scientists studying PTGS provided a crucial        clue when they detected small approximately  nucleotidelong RNAs corresponding to        silenced target genes in transgenic plants Hamilton and Baulcombe  They proposed        that the small RNAs provided the allimportant specificity determinant for silencing        Consistent with this a rapid succession of studies in         Drosophila systems demonstrated that  nucleotide short        interferingRNAs siRNAs derived from cutting longer dsRNA can guide mRNA cleavage        Zamore et al  Elbashir et al  identified RISC RNAinduced silencing        complex a nuclease that associates with small RNAs and executes target mRNA cleavage        Hammond et al  and identified Dicer the enzyme that chops dsRNA into short RNAs        Bernstein et al  see Figure         RNAiPTGS was detected originally in experiments involving transgenes injected RNAs or        viruses Did the RNAi machinery also generate small RNAs for host gene regulation        Strikingly the newly discovered siRNAs were the same size as several small temporal        RNAs first identified in  as important regulators of developmental timing in worms        Lee et al  Reinhart et al  Everything came together in  when heroic        cloning efforts unearthed dozens of natural small RNAs  nucleotides in length first        from worms and flies and later from plants and mammals Lai  Bartel  Similar to        siRNAs the natural small RNAs dubbed microRNAs miRNAs arise from Dicer processing of        dsRNA precursors and are incorporated into RISC Denli and Hannon  In many cases        miRNAs effect silencing by basepairing to the  ends of target mRNAs and repressing        translation see Figure  miRNAs are now recognized as key regulators of plant and animal        development Identifying their target genes and full range of action are areas of intense        research Lai  Bartel         Up until  RNAiPTGS and miRNAs were the most avidly studied aspects of RNAmediated        gene silencing The next major advance however abruptly turned attention back to        RNAguided modifications of the genome By  plant scientists working on RNAdirected        DNA methylation and TGS had demonstrated a requirement for dsRNAs that are processed to        short RNAs reinforcing a mechanistic link to PTGS Mette et al  Sijen et al         This established the principle of RNAguided genome modifications but the generality of        this process was uncertain because not all organisms methylate their DNA Widespread        acceptance came with the discovery in  of RNAimediated heterchromatin assembly in        fission yeast Hall et al  Volpe et al  This silencing pathway uses short RNAs        produced by Dicer and other RNAi components to direct methylation of DNAassociated        proteins histones thus generating condensed transcriptionally silent chromosome regions        heterochromatin see Figure  Targets of this pathway include centromeres which are        essential for normal chromosome segregation The RNAidependent heterochromatin pathway has        been found in plants Zilberman et al  and         Drosophila PalBhadra et al  and likely represents a        general means for creating condensed silent chromosome domains                    More Lessons from Plants        Plant scientists can chalk up other firsts in RNAmediated gene silencing Systemic        silencing in which a silencing signal short RNA or dsRNA moves from cell to cell and        through the vascular system to induce silencing at distant sites was initially detected in        plants in  Palauqui et al  Voinnet and Baulcombe  and later in worms Fire        et al  although not yet in         Drosophila or mammals Viral proteins that suppress silencing by        disarming the PTGSbased antiviral defense mechanism were discovered by plant virologists        in  Anandalakshmi et al  Bclin et al  Brigneti et al  Kasschau and        Carrington  One of these the p protein of tombusviruses acts as a sizeselective        caliper to sequester short RNAs from the silencing machinery Vargason et al  A        recent study suggests that animal viruses encode suppressors of RNAmediated silencing Li        et al         Although RNAmediated gene silencing pathways are evolutionarily conserved there are        various elaborations in different organisms For example the plant         Arabidopsis has four Dicerlike DCL proteins in contrast to        mammals and worms whose genomes encode only one Dicer protein Schauer et al  The        RDR family has also expanded in         Arabidopsis to include at least three active members An        important goal has been to determine the functions of individual family members Previous        studies in         Arabidopsis have shown that DCL is needed for processing miRNA        precursors important for plant development Park et al  Reinhart et al  but        not for siRNAs active in RNAi Finnegan et al  The paper by Xie et al  in        this issue of         PLoS Biology delineates distinct functions for DCL DCL and RDR        Nuclearlocalized DCL acts with RDR to generate short RNAs that elicit DNA and histone        modifications DCL produces short RNAs active in antiviral defense in the cytoplasm of        cells This study illustrates nicely how RNA silencing components have diversified in        plants to carry out specialized functions        By identifying small RNAs as agents of gene silencing that act at multiple levels        throughout the cell molecular biologists have created a new paradigm for eukaryotic gene        regulation Plant scientists have figured prominently in RNAmediated silencing research        Instrumental to their success was the early ability to produce large numbers of transgenic        plants which displayed a rich variety of gene silencing phenomena that were amenable to        analysis The agricultural biotechnology industry provided incentives to find ways to        stabilize transgene expression and use transgenic approaches to modulate plant gene        expression and to genetically engineer virus resistance As exemplified by the petunia        cosuppression experiments nonessential plant pigments provide conspicuous visual markers        that vividly reveal gene silencing The history of gene silencing research shows once again        that plants offer outstanding experimental systems for elucidating general biological        principles
