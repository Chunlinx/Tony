                                 Is AOL Paying Too Much for Time Warner                        The most tellingand remarkableline in all the reams virtual and realof commentary and analysis already written about America Onlines  billionacquisition of Time Warner was this one by Justin Lahart of TheStreetcomThe high price that AOL is willing to pay for Time Warner suggests that mediacompanies can carry much higher valuations            Now whether it really suggests that at all is an interesting questionwhich well get to in a minute But the important thing about this line is theway it illuminates just how dramatic the shift in power in the media world hasbeen over the past three to four years and how real certain of thesesupposedly inflated Internet valuations have become Because in Lahartsformulation its not Time Warner thats validating AOLs business by mergingwith it On the contrary its AOL that has that power of validation not justfor Time Warner but apparently for the entire world of offline media Byacquiring Time Warner AOL seems to be saying Content still does matterThere is a market for more traditional forms of journalism and entertainmentThis is a nice thing for content providers to hear But whats awesomeinthat old sense of the wordis that it took AOL to say it for the market tobelieve it            From this perspective whats really impressive about the deal is that itsan allstock acquisition aside from Time Warners debt which AOL willassume In other words this validation of the media business that AOL isapparently performing is being done with a currency that oldmedia types alwaysused to slag as debased or overinflated But neither Time Warnersmanagement nor the market seems to have any problem with that As Gerald LevinTime Warners CEO and the prospective CEO of the new company put it We think percent of AOL Time Warner which is how much Time Warner shareholders willget in the new company is worth more than  percent of Time Warner Andsince Time Warners shares ended the day up about  percent investors dotoo Internet money it seems is now real money            That is as it happens how it should be Although there are plenty of Netstocks whose shares are overinflatedjust dont ask me which NetstocksAOL is not one of them The company is generating huge amounts of freecash flow every year its return on invested capital is only going to rise inthe future its subscriber growth remains startling and switching costs forInternet subscribers are actually higher than people imagine If Time Warnerwas worth  billion at the end of last week which the market said it wasAOL was probably worth the  billion at which the market was valuing it            If you think that last sentence is pure madness then the rest of this willseem equally nutty But for the sake of argument lets say that AOL really isworth what the market says its worth If it is then the obvious question isIf AOL was twice as valuable as Time Warner on Friday why is its managementmaking a deal on Monday that treats it as only  times as valuable as TimeWarner            There are two answers The first is that Steve Case and Bob Pittman reallythink their stock is overvalued and that this is their chance toacquire some assets with real value before the Internet bubble bursts But Idont believe they think this at all and you know Jerry Levin is hoping theydont The second obviously is that they believe the combination of AOLsassets with Time Warnersboth its content magazines publishing TV moviesand music and its cable lineswill create more value than the two companieswould have created had they remained apart In other words they think thereactually will be real synergy between the two sets of assets            Synergy is the great willothewisp of mergers and although I thinktheres a plausible case that some real value will be created because of thisdeal than otherwise would have been click here for somethoughts on this issue the only question that matters is whether that valuewill be equal to the premium AOL is paying for Time Warners shares And giventhat AOLs shares actually fell almost  percent today the markets initialanswer is that it wont Right now the market thinks AOL overpaidasacquirers almost always dofor Time Warner            Lets be clear about what it would mean if the markets right It wouldntmean that AOL Time Warner wont become the most powerful media company in theworld It wouldnt mean that the company wont be incredibly profitable in thefuture It wouldnt even mean that AOL Time Warner isnt going to create lotsof shareholder value in the future What it would mean is that the differencebetween the value AOL Time Warner will create and the value AOL would havecreated on its own and that includes whatever return it could get on the billion its shelling out will be less than what AOL just paid for TimeWarner            The problem of course is that no one keeps track of these things and adecade from now when AOL Time Warner has  million global InternetcableTVwireless subscribers and a market cap of  billion its going to be hardto say the deal was a mistake even if it was But before we jump to theconclusion that this deal means that other media companies are worth a lot morethan we thought they were its worth remembering that if the stock market hasbeen valuing Time Warner and other media companies at Xand has been valuingthem that way for a while since Time Warners share price essentially didntmove in and AOL comes along and says Time Warner is actually worth almostX our default assumption should not be that media stocks have beenundervalued Steve Case and Bob Pittman are no doubt about it brilliant guysBut if you want to know what CBS and Disney are really worth youre better offtrusting the market than trusting them
