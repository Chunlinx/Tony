                                 George Wallace                           Note Life and Artis an occasional column that compares fiction in various media with thereallife facts it is ostensibly based on                                       George Wallace  TNTsbiopic about the former Alabama governor and fourtime presidential candidatebegins and ends with disclaimers The opening statement says that charactersand dialogue have been created or altered for dramatic purposes The closingstatement says that one of the central characters Archie Wallaces blackservant was created to reflect a viewpoint concerning this turbulent periodof American history            Besidesthese acknowledged fabrications how far has director John Frankenheimers TVmovie strayed from the truth Factually it seems not all that muchat leastnot by the standards of docudrama where synthesized characters and inventeddialogue are routine But in its selection of material to include andexcludeand in its interpretation George Wallace operates with apretty free hand            The film portrays the fervent opponent of the civil rightsmovement as a thoroughgoing bigot As Frankenheimer told the Los AngelesTimes  What were doing is the story of a racist To some such asStephan Lesher who wrote the authorized biography George Wallace AmericanPopulist  that interpretation is crude Lesher says in the WeeklyStandard that viewers without prior knowledge likely will leave the filmbelieving that Wallace began and ended with racismand fail to learn abouthow Wallace helped set the political agenda that dominates Congress and theWhite House today The film also does little to suggest what other historiansbelieve that Wallace was a canny opportunist who embraced racist rhetoric whenit was politically advantageous and jettisoned it when it wasnt            To recountWallaces famous civil rights battles the film uses facts that are more orless accurate though it includes two major fictionalizations along the wayWe see Wallace Gary Sinise lose his first bid for governor in  to anopponent who capitalized on segregationist themes and racist rhetoric Wallacethen declares to his aides Im not going to be outniggered again Did hereally say this Wallace denies it But his first biographer Marshall Fradywho cowrote the teleplay reported the remark in his book Wallace  andEmory professor Dan Carter the author of The Politics of Rage GeorgeWallace the Origins of the New Conservatism and the Transformation ofAmerican Politics  had it confirmed by a source who was present Wallaceran a harsher campaign in he did not for instance denounce the Klan ashe had in and won We dont see the campaign but we do hear parts of hisfamous  inaugural speech Sinise speaking from the actual transcriptpromises Segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever Thefilm also faithfully recreates Wallaces attempt to prevent two black studentsfrom registering at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa Wallace is seenstanding in a school doorway on a June  morning and then stepping asideeventually under federal pressure            Employing historical footage the film alsoshows state troopers attacking voterregistration marchers in Selma on March  with tear gas and clubs Sinises Wallace tells his aides that thetroopers were justifiably trying to keep the peace and protect the state fromagitators While accounts conflict about whether Wallace authorized thetroopers use of force the films portrayal of his reaction is consistent withthe record Carter writes Wallace never issued a single word of publiccriticism A quartercentury laterwhile expressing regret for the injuriessuffered by the marchershe insisted that troopers had saved their lives bystopping that march             Thefilms conclusion is also based on a real event In  Gov Wallacecrippled by a  assassination attempt enters Montgomerys Dexter StreetBaptist Church where the Rev Martin Luther King Jr had preached Wallaceasks the congregation for forgiveness The crowd starts to sing AmazingGrace The visit did happen Carter notes however that it wasntspontaneous as it is in the film Wallace had been invited to speak AlsoCarter says that news accounts give no hint that Wallace explicitly asked forforgiveness he just said he opposed integration because he favored statesrights not racism            Two inventions are used to bolster the dramatic power ofthis conclusion In one which takes place just after the Selma march sceneArchie Clarence Williams III the fictional prison trusty who serves asWallaces servant throughout the film stands behind the governor an ice pickin his hand debating whether to stab him Oblivious to Archies rage Wallaceprattles on about a favorite black handyman of his youth He clearly has far togo before he sees the error of his ways            Inanother set just before the church visit Wallace goes to the home of hisformer populist mentor exAlabama governor James E Big Jim Folsom The filmcorrectly implies that Wallace had split with the more liberal Folsom overracial politics But Wallace never paid a visit to Folsom to say I aint thesame now only to have the door slammed in his face by Folsoms wifea scenefrom the film the Wallace family threatened to over            Just as important the climactic forgivenessscene at the church is wrenched from its political context The film doesntshow that Wallace later apologized for his segregationist views on TVsuggesting that his conversion had political motives Commentators have notedthe growth of Alabamas black electorate which Wallace now had to court In Wallace won his last race for governor with a quarter of the black votescast in the Democratic primary a fact alluded to in a written epilogue at theend of the film Nor do we see Wallaces cynical attempts to win black votessuch as when he made sure a photographer was present at his meeting with RosaParks in the ssomething the civil rights activist always resentedaccording to Carter            Most strikingly Wallacespresidential campaignshe ran in    and are almostentirely omitted At a  rally in Laurel Md he was shot by a deranged manand paralyzed from the waist downone campaign scene we see in detail Butthere are almost no scenes of Wallace calling for law and order or railingagainst excessive government and pointyhead intellectuals We dont see himsurprise the nation in  with strong showings in the Maryland and WisconsinDemocratic primariesstates outside the Deep South where he wasnt expected tofare well Lesher is right that we dont see the side of Wallace that has had acontinuing influence on politics today As historian Alan Brinkley wrote in a review of Leshers book In his national campaigns Gov Wallace laid outin flamboyant and often witty form much of what would soon become the programof the New Right George Wallace commits Wallaces rhetoric and ideasto the past making him the last of one kind of politicianthe diehardsegregationistrather than perhaps the precursor of another
