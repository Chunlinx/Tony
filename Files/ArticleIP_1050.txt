                                 The White House and the Hatch Act            The presidency cannot beseparated from politics but the political uses of the presidency by theClinton administration strike many people as abusive There are calls for aspecial prosecutor What behavior would he or she prosecute What exactly isthe law about politicking and the presidency            The lawmost often cited is the Hatch Act  The law passed followingseveral big corruption cases involving the burgeoning postNew Dealbureaucracy and was aimed at the civil service But by its terms it appliesto almost anyone on the US government payroll Only the president vicepresident and appointees requiring Senate confirmation such as Cabinetsecretaries are exempt The original Hatch Act forbade government employees toraise funds give partisan public speeches or volunteer for any candidate orparty In  with President Clintons backing the act was amended to allowall these things so long as they are done outside the workplace and governmentemployees dont exploit their positions for political purposes            Enforcement of the Hatch Act was always erratic and therewas no serious attempt to apply its general ban on politicking to the WhiteHouse The  amendment specifically allows employees of the Executive Officeof the president to engage in political activity The law defines politicalactivity to include anything campaignrelated organizing eventsplanning party strategy except fund raising  which it completelyprohibits These same limits apply to Cabinet secretaries and all otherpresidential appointees approved by the Senate The presidents campaign orparty must reimburse the government for the use of its offices andresources            TheClinton administration imposed additional Hatchlike regulations on itselfWhite House employees can work on their political projects only if they putin  hours work over the course of the week on official business And theWhite House installed separate phone and fax lines for political work Butthese rules are not legally binding And in practice such distinctions betweenofficial and political White House work are almost meaningless                           Alexis Herman  who was in charge ofWhite House public liaison is the only member of the Clinton administrationnow under investigation for violation of the Hatch Act Her nomination to besecretary of labor is in trouble The allegation Herman headed a working groupthat planned strategies for hyping the president to different ethnic groupsShe did wrong the argument goes by using government computers to draw upcampaign strategy            According to the WhiteHouse Hermans work complied with Hatch The Clinton campaign reimbursed thegovernment for the work Herman did on the memos she wrote Besides theactivity under investigation is simply part of the job description of publicliaison which is supposed to outreach with different constituencies toimprove their relationships with the White House Clintonites say the publicliaisons under Reagan and Bush did much the same things For instance BushsLiaison Bobbie Kilberg spent much of her time wooing the religious right            Republicans point out that unlike Herman and George Stephanopoulos Reagan andBush aides such as James Baker and Robert Teeter resigned from theadministration to work on reelection campaigns But these resignations werelegally required under the rules of the pre Hatch Act which no longerapply            Other possible Hatch Act violations Newsweekreports that Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes solicited campaigncontributions despite Hatchs prohibition on fund raising And a White Housedatabase may have been used by Democratic Party fundraisers withoutreimbursement to the government as required            Legal questions are alsoraised by allegations that the administration granted access to the White Houseto elicit donations The New Yorker s Jane Mayer uncovered examples ofbig donors being invited to the White House tennis court and movie theater TheNew York Times this week quoted Democratic fundraisers who say theyattracted donors with promises of invitations to the White House includingcoffees and overnights in the Lincoln bedroom             Thesesorts of perks are potentially illegal for two reasons First election lawsbar the solicitation of money by both employees and nonemployees in allfederal office buildings the White House included In these casesRepublicans argue donors received White House invitations to entice them togive more money Even if the attendees were never explicitly asked to opentheir checkbooks on these visits the administrations intention was obviousThe language of these laws however only forbids explicit appeals fordonations Ickes apparently made calls to donors from his government officebut there is no evidence so far that anyone else solicited funds in a federalbuilding            Second campaignfinance and antibribery lawsprohibit granting government favors in exchange for political donations Thelaw specifically forbids favoritism in awarding government jobs and contractsMore ambiguously it proscribes special access to governmentofficials Like the Hatch Act however these laws have never been enforcedagainst the White House            Preferential treatment forbig donors is nothing new Eleven out of  plus donors to theRepublican National Committee received ambassadorships from the Bushadministration Team  donors also received special policy briefingsfrom administration officials and invitations to White House dinners Many ofthe members had matters pending before the administration            President Clintons responseto charges of selling special accessthat these donors are also his friendsand he has the right to have conversations with his friends and invite them tohis homeis disingenuous but might be hard to refute in court
