                                 More UnBubblish Behavior From the Market                        This is a strange time in the stock market On the one hand prevailingwisdom among the chattering classes has it that current stock pricesespecially on the Nasdaq represent a bubble and that the best we can hope foris for that bubble to lose slow air slowly rather than in one giant burst Istarted collecting examples of journalists saying things like this overvaluedmarket and Does anyone remember Japan in the s but I stopped becausewell I got bored At the same time though no one seems to be actuallyselling their stock perhaps because everyones succumbed to the siren song oflongterm investing or perhaps because everyone always thinks theyll be theones who can get out just before the crash                           Or it may be that people are staying invested because for a supposed bubblein which prices are driven ever higher by indiscriminate investors this marketis actually quite discriminating and its standards for corporate performanceremain quite high In an earliercolumn I wrote about the segmentation of Internet stocks into winners andlosers and in recent weeks weve seen a mediocre Christmas further segment theNet sector by taking a real toll on Internet retailers When Lucent recentlyannounced that its quarterly numbers would fall well short of expectations thestock dropped  percent And today Qualcomm saw its stock price drop percent in a few minutes of afterhours trading despite the fact that thecompany announced that it had grown profits by  percent in the latestquarter               Now one way of looking at these sharp turns in market sentiment is todismiss them by citing them as evidence of that muchdreaded volatility Buta more accurate way of looking at them is to see that investors are thinkinghard about what news means for a companys future earning prospects and are notinterested in rewarding companies that fail to live up to expectations Forfurther evidence of this look at the markets reaction to all the recentmerger announcements Its also the case that those expectations are veryhigh as the case of Qualcomm suggests               Of course the markets expectations should be very high what with theprices investors are paying Qualcomms profits grew by  percent but itsstock is up more than  percent in the past year so it may have a ways togo down that is before its fairly valued And Lucents quarterly numberswere more worthy of a slowgrowing consumerproducts company than of ahighpriced tech giant so the markets reaction was hardly surprising Butwhats interesting is that it isnt just stocks trading at stratospheric levelsthat are punished nor is it just stocks that fall well short ofexpectations               Take for instance SBC Communications the largest Baby Bell whichannounced earnings today right in line with analysts estimates SBCs profitand revenue growth werent staggering but they werent disappointing eitherThe company showed strong growth in its wireless business which remains one ofthe hottest sectors around and it issued a bullish forecast for the comingyear But Project Pronto SBCs  billion effort to roll out DSL Internetaccess to its local customers fell well short of expectations Sincehighspeed Internet access will soon be a crucial perhaps the crucialbusiness for local phone companies to dominate this was not good news On aday when the market rebounded sharply in the afternoon SBC finished the daydown  percent And this was not after a big runup On the contrary thestock had already been down  percent over the last  months                        The markets judgment was I think the right one Actually SBCs stockdeserves to drop just on the basis of naming the DSL initiative ProjectPronto but thats neither here nor there But the important point is thatthe judgment was made In a pure speculative market like the South Sea Bubbleit was enough to exist to coin money And even in the months leading up to theCrash of  or during the rapid rise of the Nikkei in the s corporateperformance seemed to matter less and less Say what you will about thismarket There are no byes for the teams that are playing in it
