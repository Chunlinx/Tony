                    Background        DNA microarrays have been widely adopted in genomics        because of the their ability to simultaneously examine the        expression levels of thousands of genes As a result the        scope of applications for microarrays has broadened        rapidly from drug discovery     to classification of        cancers      and analysis of splice variants            Novel analytical tools have been constructed to address        every component of the microarray experiment and optimize        performance     However ideal systems with maximized        sensitivity and data reproducibility have not been        achieved One approach to enhance sensitivity in        microarrays using a novel signal amplification technique        has recently been reported     Another approach is to        increase the affinity of a probe nucleic acid present on        the array for its target through modifications to the        length     chemistry     or physical structure           of the probe        Naturally occurring analogs of purine and pyrimidine        bases have been examined extensively for their ability to        increase the thermodynamic stability of DNADNA and DNARNA        duplexes         Among these are        aminoadenine also known as diaminopurine DAP which is        found in SL cyanophage DNA     methyl uracil        MeU and methyl cytidine MeC Previous studies have        shown the ribonucleoside triphosphate derivatives of        modified bases to be effectively incorporated by RNA        polymerases      which make them an excellent        substrate for use in microarray sample preparations        requiring amplification through         in vitro transcriptions IVTs        Due to their effects on duplex stability and secondary        structures and their lack of replication by DNA        polymerases modified nucleotides have recently been        exploited in a variety of technologies in molecular biology        and genomics For example Omethyl ribonucleotides and        propynylpyrimidines have been chemically incorporated        into oligonucleotides which were used to detect telomeric        repeat sequences in fluorescence         in situ hybridization FISH assays            Furthermore chimeric primers containing        deoxynucleotides and Omethyl ribonucleotides have been        used to eliminate artifacts produced by exponential        amplification of minor sideproducts in cycle sequencing                   Recently studies employing DNA arrays have also        examined the use of modified nucleotides such as DAP        bromodeoxyuridine and Omethylthymidine in the probe             An alternative method to increase the        probetarget affinity is to incorporate the modified        ribonucleotide as the triphosphate derivative during the        IVT process so that the cRNA produced has the desired level        of substitution of the corresponding unmodified nucleotide        Such an approach has been demonstrated in a study which        applied these modified cRNA products to high density        oligonucleotide arrays     However that study        measured the signal when amplifying a specific gene rather        than a genomewide approach A genomewide amplification        coupled with the incorporation of modified nucleotides        permits measurement of every transcript in the sample To        our knowledge no systematic studies have been performed        examining the incorporation of modified ribonucleotide        triphosphates into cRNA yield of amplified material        effects on hybridization intensities and reproducibility        and the impact on the differential expression ratios It        will not be possible to gauge the full potential        advantages and disadvantages until such studies have been        completed        In this study we investigated the possibility that        incorporation of modified nucleotides into complementary        RNA cRNA target samples could increase signal intensity        on the Motorola Codelink Expression microarray platform        The ratios of modified to unmodified nucleoside        triphosphates NTPs were varied in each target synthesis        in order to measure the range of effects on cRNA yield        specific activity of target sample hybridization signals        and differential expression ratios Our results suggest        that incorporation of aminoadenosine DAP triphosphate        into target cRNA samples may increase hybridization signal        intensity for a wide variety of RNADNA hybrid duplexes In        contrast methyluridine and methylcytidine had        detrimental effects on signal intensities Hybridization        specificity was dependent on both target sequence and        extent of substitution with the modified nucleotide        Concurrent incorporation of modified and unmodified ATP in        a  ratio resulted in significantly greater numbers of        abovethreshold ratio calls across tissues while        preserving ratio integrity and reproducibility                    Results                  Effect of modified nucleotides on cRNA yield and          assessment of their incorporation and biotinUTP          incorporation          Although DAP MeC and MeU were tolerated by T RNA          polymerase incorporation of these analogs into our IVT          reaction cocktails reduced the yields of amplified cRNA          The magnitude of the decrease was  and depended on          RNA tissue source and the NTP modification However          within the context of our preestablished assay          conditions a single color single sample per array          system using ten micrograms of cRNA enough cRNA was          generated from each IVT reaction to perform          hybridizations in triplicate Thus we were able to          normalize input amounts of cRNA for each condition tested          in order to quantitatively compare relative changes due          to each respective modification In these experiments we          generated cRNA from five micrograms of total RNA and did          not explore the impact on yield when smaller or larger          amounts of input total RNA are used          We next determined how well the modified NTPs were          incorporated by the T RNA polymerase and whether          incorporation of biotinylated UTP was altered due to the          presence of these modified NTPs To address these          questions we used an analytical method developed in our          laboratory and described in a previous study              Briefly the complex cRNA is digested with P nuclease          and calf intestinal phosphatase and applied to a high          performance liquid chromatography HPLC column to          separate the nucleosides followed by an absorbance          measurement at  nm As seen in Figure A when only          the unmodified NTPs are incorporated during the IVT          there is good separation of the individual nucleosides          Furthermore as reported earlier     using the          extinction coefficients and integrating the area under          these peaks there are approximately equal amounts of          each of the four nucleosides When DAP was added at a           molar ratio to the adenosine the chromatogram showed          incorporation of DAP into the cRNA and this level of          incorporation appeared to be equivalent to the level of          incorporation of adenosine Figure B Moreover when          the adenosine was fully substituted by the DAP in the IVT          reaction cocktail only a peak corresponding to the DAP          was detected Figure C and this peak was approximately          equal in area to that of the adenosine in the control          situation Similarly when MeC was fully substituted for          cytidine in the IVT reaction cocktail only a peak          corresponding to the MeC was detected Figure D and          this peak was approximately equal in area to that of the          cytidine in the control situation In contrast we were          unable to examine incorporation levels of the MeU because          the MeU peak was eluted at approximately the same time as          the guanosine peak data not shown It is important to          note that these analyses used the complex cRNA and          represent a global average view of the incorporation          Incorporation may differ somewhat depending on the          sequence structure or expression level of the nascent          RNA transcript We therefore incorporated each of these          modified nucleotides into a unique bacterial transcript          generated by run off transcription from a plasmid into          which the gene was cloned When this transcript was          digested and applied to the HPLC we found similar          results as seen with the complex cRNA data not shown          We conclude that these modified nucleotides are          incorporated during the IVT reaction at ratios which are          reflective of the input ratio to the unmodified          counterpart          Because the sensitivity and reproducibility of          microarrays depends on the specific activity of target          cRNA we also wanted to determine if adding modified NTPs          to the IVT changed the incorporation rate of          biotinUTP This biotinylated nucleotide is used in          our biotinstreptavidinAlexa conjugate detection          system We found that the level of biotinylated uridine          detected at  nm after digestion and application to the          HPLC was unaffected by the presence of any of the          modified NTPs in the IVT reaction cocktail data not          shown Moreover analysis of individual transcripts          which were enzymatically digested into mononucleosides          showed equivalent incorporation rates of biotinUTP          for both control samples and target samples containing          modified ATP          Lastly we examined what effect if any incorporation          of modified NTPs had on the length of the amplified cRNA          Transcript size was determined by running samples on an          Agilent  BioAnalyzer No difference was observed for          either individual transcripts or complex samples in          modified versus unmodified ATP samples data not          shown                          Effect of modified nucleotides on hybridization          signals and specificity          We next determined the effect of these modified NTPs          on hybridization intensities After hybridization          scatter plots of hybridization intensities were generated          comparing those intensities generated from unmodified          cRNA control to either the duplicate control          hybridization or to intensities generated from cRNA where          one of the modified NTPs was incorporated The comparison          of control versus control Figure A illustrates that          if hybridization intensities are equal in the two          conditions the points should lie on the diagonal          Complete substitution of unmodified ATP with DAP Figure          B produced greater increases overall in individual          probe signals than the target sample containing a           ratio of DAP to unmodified ATP Figure C as would be          expected if DAP incorporation increased the DNARNA          hybrid duplex stability A quantitative estimation of          assay performance increase can be derived from the median          probe signal on each microarray Although Figure Band          Cshow that increases in signal intensity are not linear          for all probe sequences median slide intensity across          sets of duplicate hybridizations for two different          tissues human embryonic kidney and Burkitts lymphoma          increased an average of    and    for the           DAPA and all DAP conditions respectively over the          unmodified control sample However Figure Balso shows          that full substitution of adenosine by DAP reduced the          hybridization signals for many of the probes generating          a bowing towards the unmodified control condition and          suggesting a duplex destabilizing effect of complete DAP          substitution in certain sequence contexts      On          a global scale such a high incidence of probes with          reduced hybridization signals may limit the usefulness of          the complete DAP substitution Of particular interest is          the observation that the number of probes which have          increased signal and the degree to which their signals          are increased are highest at the lower end of the signal          range In contrast both of the modified pyrimidine          triphosphates MeC and MeU tested resulted in a decrease          in overall signal intensities for nearly all of the          probes tested when compared against unmodified control          samples Figures D E However data points on the          right of the diagonal in figures Dand Ealso show that          for a fractional set of targetprobe pairs substitution          with MeC and MeU increased hybridization signal relative          to the unmodified control Those probes whose signal          intensities were increased at least twofold are          summarized in Table  As Table shows for a number of          transcripts substitution with MeC or MeU may potentially          augment hybridization signals more so than even DAP This          may prove useful for target samples containing very low          concentrations of these particular transcripts          Nevertheless because our goal was to utilize          modifications that would increase hybridization signals          for the vast majority of targetprobe duplexes we          subsequently focused our efforts on the samples          containing DAP          We next determined whether the increases in signal          intensity observed with DAP substitution were similar in          magnitude to those observed when the hybridization time          is increased We therefore hybridized two micrograms of          cRNA with no modifications or two micrograms with DAP at          a  molar ratio to adenosine for  hours and          hybridized two micrograms of cRNA with no modifications          for  hours We generated two scatterplot and overplayed          these scatterplot on each other Figure A The first          scatterplot compares the intensities of the  hour          control with those of the  hour control orange          signals The second scatterplot compares the intensities          of the  hour control with those of the DAPmodified          cRNA blue signals The longer hybridization time          increases the median signal intensity by    The          increase is more pronounced for the medium and high          signals As shown before the DAPmodified cRNA generated          hybridization signals which were also increased relative          to the  hour control hybridization However the          increase seemed more pronounced for the low and medium          signals We conclude that both DAP modification and an          increased hybridization time can affect the hybridization          reaction but in very different ways          Because of the differential effects of increased          hybridization time and DAP substitution on low and high          expressers we wanted determine whether the increases          seen of using both DAP modification and an extended          hybridization time could be additive We therefore          hybridized unmodified control cRNA for  hours and a          DAPmodified cRNA for  hours Figure B The median          slide intensity increased by    which is          approximately double the increase seen with either the           DAPA or the longer hybridization time by themselves          When all of the approximately  probes are divided          into three equally sized bins representing low medium          and high expressers according to their respective signal          intensities the effects of increased hybridization time          and DAP become very evident Figure C Figure Cshows          that the relative increases in signal intensities due to          increased hybridization time are biased towards the          medium and high expressers with signals increasing an          average of  and  respectively whereas increases          due to DAP substitution are more pronounced for low and          medium expressers  and  increase respectively          Together the two modifications of increased          hybridization time and DAP substitution can be used in          concert to amplify signal intensities for the entire          range of probe signals and as figure Cindicates these          boosts in signals are approximately additive for the           hour DAPcontaining samples          We next determined the effect of modified NTPs on          hybridization specificity the ability to distinguish          sequences up to a certain homology We addressed this          issue by designing probes which had one to four adjacent          centrally located mismatches and comparing hybridization          signals generated from these mismatched probes to signals          generated from their corresponding perfect matches In          the control situation hybridization of unmodified cRNA          the hybridization intensity decreased as the number of          mismatches increased with two mismatches generally          destabilizing the duplex sufficiently to reduce the          hybridization signal to  of the parent signal There          was one exception Figure C where even in the presence          of four mismatches the signal was not reduced below           of the parent signal This signal was low in the perfect          match and therefore this situation most likely reflects          a lowering to the noise levels In fact the signal was          lowered to below threshold levels in the presence of          mismatches When equimolar ratios of DAP and unmodified          ATP were incorporated into the cRNA target  DAPA          specificity was not significantly affected in two of the          four probe sequences Figure Aand B However in one          probe sequence Figure C specificity was enhanced For          this test probe the unmodified sample produced unusually          high signals for base mismatches Nevertheless other          groups have seen similar improvements in mismatch          discrimination with diaminopurinecontaining oligo mers          for different applications     A fourth probe          sequence demonstrated a smaller destabilizing effect of a          single mismatch with the partially modified cRNA compared          to the control Figure D In this sequence the          hybridization was reduced to the same extent with three          mismatches using either the control or partially modified          cRNA Full substitution of adenosine by DAP showed varied          effects on specificity in the four different probe          sequences In two of the probe sequences the fully          modified cRNA behaved similarly to the control cRNA          Figures Aand B In a third probe sequence the          specificity improved for the fully modified cRNA as it          did for the partially modified cRNA Figure C The          improvement in specificity for this probe depended on the          extent of DAP modification In a fourth probe sequence          the fully modified cRNA showed a dramatic decrease in          specificity with one or twobase mismatches although          three mismatches reduced the hybridization intensity to           of that of the perfect match The loss in          specificity for this probe sequence also depended on the          extent of DAP modification with one two or three          mismatches required to reduce the hybridization intensity          to   for the control partially modified and fully          modified respectively cRNA A fifth test probe showed          hybridization signal intensity below the negative control          threshold in both the control and modified ATP samples          suggesting either an absence of the transcript from the          target sample or abundance too low to quantify data not          shown Repeat experiments with cRNA containing modified          ATP supported the general specificity trend unmodified          ATP   DAPA  all DAP data not shown          Attempts to increase specificity in the all DAP condition          by raising the temperature during hybridization from C          to C or C were unsuccessful data not shown          Others have been able to distinguish sequences of up to           homology    using the same platform base          mismatch mer oligonucleotide signal near or below          negative control threshold and we support their          findings here with the control and  DAPA condition          The fully MeCsubstituted cRNA targets were examined with          respect to specificity in two test sequences Figures          Band D In one test sequence Figure B the fully          MeCsubstituted cRNA targets behaved nearly identically          to the partially DAPsubstituted targets In the other          test sequence Figure D the MeCsubstituted cRNA          behaved nearly identically to the unmodified cRNA target          and showed better specificity than that of the partially          DAPsubstituted cRNA target with respect to the effect of          one mismatch We conclude that the specificity of fully          MeCsubstituted cRNA and partially DAPsubstituted cRNA          targets are for the most part equivalent and          essentially no loss in specificity as determined by the          effect of two mismatches is observed with these modified          targets          An additional metric of specificity on the Codelink          bioarrays is the use of  negative control bacterial          probes spotted in X redundancy which were designed and          empirically shown not to cross hybridize to human          transcripts     While the all DAP condition resulted          in an increase in the hybridization intensity for three          of the negative control probes the  DAPA condition          produced lower background signals similar to those of the          unmodified control data not shown Thus increases in          hybridization signal intensities in the  DAPA          condition are attributable to specific modified cRNA          targetDNA probe interactions We conclude that partial          substitution of adenosine with DAP does not significantly          compromise specificity and was therefore investigated          further                          Effect of DAP incorporation on differential          expression ratios          Ultimately the goal of any global expression          profiling system measuring relative transcript abundance          is to accurately and reproducibly determine the changes          in expression levels between different target samples We          therefore determined if the increases in signal intensity          caused by DAP incorporation had an effect on differential          ratio calls Kidney and lymphoma cRNA samples containing          either no modified NTPs or  DAPA were hybridized in          duplicate to Human Uniset I arrays average kidney to          lymphoma ratios were calculated and plotted Figure           after removing signal outliers defined as a twofold          difference between replicates Differential expression          ratios demonstrate very good correlation between the          unmodified control sample and the  DAPA sample r            on the Human Uniset I microarray          In addition to investigating the correlation of the          differential expression ratios generated from modified          and unmodified targets we determined whether DAP          incorporation affected the variability of the ratio          calls One method to measure microarray reproducibility          is by calculating the coefficients of variation CVs for          each replicate probe across arrays Likewise CVs can          also be calculated for multiple ratio calculations across          different tissue samples Figure shows a plot of the CVs          of the ratios as a function of the mean ratios for all of          the data points           regardless of the intensity level of          the probe  Consistent with earlier findings              the majority of the CVs in the of the kidney to lymphoma          ratios are below  with an average of  and the          variability increases as the ratio approaches unity for          the unmodified targets Figure A Figure Bshows that          the  DAPA condition produces ratios with similar          overall variability average CV of  compared to the          unmodified control targets When the CVs in the ratios          generated using either the control or partially modified          cRNA are binned according to the magnitude of the CV the          partially modified cRNA generates more CVs in the less          than  bins Figure C These data demonstrate that          the low variability in ratio calls that we are able to          routinely obtain    are maintained during DAP          incorporation However a closer inspection of the ratios          in Figures Aand Breveals that a possible caveat of DAP          use is a slight compression of ratios along the entire          range of calls This compression is also observed when          the observed ratio is binned according to the magnitude          of the fold change Figure D The partially modified          cRNA generates more ratios in the one to  fold change          bin and fewer ratio changes in the other bins This          compression is not significant but also manifests itself          in the slope of the correlation line in Figure  The          slope of this line was found to be greater than          unity          The differential expression ratios calculated when          using DAP Figures and  suggest that incorporation of          DAP has little effect on correlation and reproducibility          of ratio calls between tissues However the ability to          accurately discriminate between signals due to true          hybridization events and what may be considered          background noise is paramount to making accurate          differential assessments A lower limit of detection was          previously defined using our platform by developing a          negative control threshold in order to assign a          confidence level to such signal or noise queries              Briefly this threshold was determined by taking the mean          signal of bacterial negative control probes mentioned          above minus a  trim to account for weak cross          hybridization of high expressers or for true          hybridization to sequences not in the database and          adding three standard deviations  confidence          Using only probes that were at or above the negative          control threshold in both tissues we observed a          significantly greater number of probes in the  DAPA          sample for which we could confidently assign a ratio          Figure  As Figure shows samples containing DAP          generated over  more abovethreshold ratios than the          control samples containing only unmodified NTPs Most of          these ratios identified only in the  DAPA sample were          small in magnitude with fold changes between  and                                      Discussion                  The effect of modified NTPs on hybridization          intensities          Two important issues for identifying differentially          expressed genes using DNA microarrays are  methods to          increase signal intensity and  the ability to          accurately separate true hybridization signals from          background noise at the low end of the signal dynamic          range In this study we utilized modified nucleoside          triphosphates with the aim of enhancing hybridization          signal intensity across a wide range of probe sequences          Modified ribo and deoxyribonucleoside analogs have been          used in a variety of applications       but          their use has been limited in the field of microarrays              We demonstrate that aminoadenosine or          diaminopurine DAP an analog of adenosine          significantly increases signal intensity for a wide range          of probe sequences whereas C methylated pyrimidine          analogs of cytosine and uridine decreased signal          intensities across the entire range of probe sequences on          our platform Figure           Although incorporation of DAP did not uniformly          increase the hybridization stability for all targetprobe          duplexes even moderate incorporation of DAP  DAPA          resulted in signal intensity increases up to fold          for the majority of probes on our platform More          importantly a significant number of probes that went          previously undetected ie below a negative control          threshold     in the control sample exhibited signal          intensities above this threshold in DAPmodified samples          Utilization of such a modification may prove especially          valuable for low abundant transcripts which may be          difficult to quantify because of weak hybridization          kinetics As shown in Figures Band C the largest          increases in signal intensities occurred for low and          medium expressers relative to the unmodified control          sample It is apparent that the effect of DAP depends not          only on the sequence compositions of target and probe          but also on the absolute abundance of specific          transcripts in the target sample          It is of interest to note that the results we report          here differ from those obtained by others     Those          studies reported increases in signal intensity for          targets containing methyl UTP while completely          substituted targets containing DAP had the opposite or no          effect Although we cannot completely account for the          disparity of the results one key difference in          methodology between the studies is that their group was          not able to normalize concentrations for modified and          unmodified ATP targets because of dramatic differences in          cRNA yield Therefore mass input of cRNA target samples          were much greater for unmodified samples compared to the          DAPcontaining samples Because the sample preparation          used in this protocol is highly robust and reproducible              we were able to use equivalent mass inputs of all          modified and unmodified targets during hybridization          allowing us to present our results quantitatively rather          than qualitatively However we agree that complete          substitution of DAP for adenosine may cause specificity          to decline in certain sequence contexts which may limit          its usefulness in microarray applications However we          have found that reducing the proportion of DAP          incorporated into target samples eg incorporating a           ratio of DAPadenosine is one approach to avoid such          decreases in specificity Other factors that may          contribute to the dissimilarity of the results include          differences in probe sequence and size microarray          fabricationchemistries labelingdetection methods and          the vigorous mixing that is employed in our microarray          experiments We have previously shown the dramatic impact          of mixing on hybridization signal intensities              Presumably this impact is due to the effect of three          dimensional diffusion of the target molecules and to the          effect on how many probes reach equilibrium in the          hybridization It is possible that the degree of mixing          during the hybridization can affect the number of probes          which show a difference in intensity with substitution of          DAP for adenosine as well as the magnitude of this          difference Given these differences it is not surprising          that our results are not in line with those previously          reported          The results in our study are in good agreement with          previous reports which include a wide variety of          interaction types including DNADNA DNARNA and          DNAPNA interactions        These studies          have shown that DAP substitution in oligonucleotide          probes can increase thermodynamic affinities as reported          directly by increases in T           m and indirectly through increases in          hybridization intensities                          Biophysical considerations in using modified          NTPs          Modified nucleotides appear to drive the equilibrium          particularly for low copy transcripts binding with their          targets towards duplex formation These findings suggest          that DAP use could be exploited in RNA samples that are          limited such as tumor biopsies Based on our experiments          with extended hybridization times Figure  use of DAP          may prove to be a useful alternative to increase array          sensitivity for studies that are unable to generate          enough target to hybridize or are unable to increase          hybridization times because of throughput          constraints          Why do we see differential effects of DAP MeC and          MeU on hybridization intensities The fact that DAP was          able to increase hybridization intensities while MeC and          MeU decreased hybridization intensities Figures Dand          E is interesting in light of the fact that DAP is a          purine incorporated into an RNA strand while MeC and MeU          are pyrimidines incorporated into an RNA strand Many          studies have shown that a ribopurine rich strand bound to          a deoxypyrimidine rich strand has a higher stability than          the corresponding all deoxy strands which in turn have          a higher stability than a deoxypurine rich strand bound          to a ribopyrimidine rich strand      These          differences also suggest that further studies examining          DAP or MeC incorporation into first strand cDNA followed          by formation of a DNADNA duplex may not necessarily          show the same effects as incorporation of these modified          nucleotides into cRNA Finally earlier studies have          noted that methylation of cytosines generating MeC in          ribopolynucleotides stabilizes duplexes to the same          extent as substitution of thymine MeU for uracil              Thus although it is still surprising that MeC and MeU          decrease hybridization intensities it is not surprising          that the magnitude of the effects generated by MeC and          MeU residues are similar          Could the differential effects of DAP versus MeC or          MeU or the differential effects of DAP on different probe          sequences also be related to structural consequences          Earlier studies have shown that DAP in DNA fragments          can widen the minor groove as detected by reactivity          towards uranyl nitrate or susceptibility to Dnase          cleavage     and can relieve compressions in the          minor groove associated with Atracts     In          contrast NMR and molecular modeling studies of an          oligonucleotide duplex containing MeC have demonstrated          that while this duplex still has a BDNA conformation          there are differences in the structural parameters and          thermal stability relative to the unmodified duplex              An earlier study also found in two closely related          octanucleotide duplexes that although the methylated          duplexes retained their BDNA conformation different          structural and thermal stability effects were seen              Although these studies have been carried out with          DNADNA and not DNARNA duplexes it is possible that MeC          substitution may have different structural consequences          than DAP substitution          We have shown that while complete substitution of DAP          for ATP may cause decreased base mismatch discrimination          in certain sequence contexts equimolar ratios of          adenosine and DAP in cRNA target samples did not have          significant detrimental effects on specificity Figure           Remarkably in one sequence context the DAP          modification enhanced specificity against mismatches          Enhanced specificity against mismatches has also been          observed by other groups when DAP is incorporated into          PNA oligomers    and after Cpropynylation of          pyrimidines in DNARNA duplexes                              The effect of modified NTPs on differential          expression ratios          The use of DAP to increase hybridization signals is          supported by the results that show equivalency of both          ratio calls and ratio variability in  DAPA and          control samples Figures and  When all data points          are considered in the differential expression ratio          analyses the two methods appear equivalent However          when only those data points which are above a threshold          value    are used ensuring a higher confidence that          these intensities represent true expression levels and          not noise or weak cross hybridization the DAPmodified          cRNA enabled an   increase in the number of ratios          that could be generated Figure  Such increases are          critical in order to sample as many genes as possible in          any given microarray experiment For example some          investigators have analyzed only data for which the          signal intensity is greater than approximately  of          the total signal range in both channels     Although          this method minimizes the variance associated with the          ratios many genes and their expression changes are          missed Other platforms use a minimal intensity level to          determine whether a gene is present or absent prior to          including this gene in expression analyses     It is          plausible that DAP modification by increasing intensity          levels particularly for low expressors could enable          wider coverage in genomewide expression analyses          In summary incorporation of modified nucleotides may          not only lead to discovery and better quantitation of          rare expressers in complex samples but also impact other          aspects of the microarray experiment such as probe design          prior to array fabrication and the statistical design of          microarray experiments The target preparation procedure          generation of amplified cRNA or of first strand cDNA          and the subsequent duplex formation may dictate the          choice of which modified nucleotide to use as we and          others have found differential effects with various          nucleotides We believe further investigation in this          area could be fruitful                            Methods                  Target preparation          Five gs of human embryonic kidney or Burkitts          lymphoma total RNA Ambion Inc Austin

minutes This typically resulted          in fragmented target with a size range between           bases                          Array hybridization          Two g of fragmented target cRNA was used

pixel intensity of the          area surrounding each spot Whole array data          normalization when used was performed independently for          each slide by dividing each spots intensity after          background subtraction by the median signal intensity of          all test probes All false positives determined by          visual inspection of the images which were greater than
