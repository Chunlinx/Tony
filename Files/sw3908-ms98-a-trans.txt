        Allen       uh the question is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know the in their in the society we live in what do you think has occurred there   well i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home thats probably even one of the major changes i see over the last period of time   umhum but uh are are they being given the full uh honor for the work theyre doing and for the um oh my gosh cant think of the word but for the what they have to accept well thats that theyre responsible for it absolutely responsibilities is what im trying to say   oh i dont think so i think its come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities but i still think in lots of job markets theyre not treated as equals in the words in some in some respects the other direction that in some job markets they really dont wanna be treated as equals   uhhuh by the same token most in in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who been there before but at lower lower salaries is is that right wrong   yes i think thats generally speaking pretty true and i think thats what we really ought to look at that going is if theyre gonna do equal work they ought to get equal pay   is that yes   and that uh they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions and i dont think weve gotten there yet   umhum yeah what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years any individual thing or is it just a general switch over   oh boy i think its generally that switch over and i and i think that switch over has been more in the work force i dont think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husbands having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home so they have one and three quarters jobs now   umhum   whereas the husbands have one and a quarter   i have a feeling that biness with a woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship in that uh   yeah   the the lady stand wants to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has every right to do so and this upsets the man because uh weve always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household so do you think that is gonna be uh difficult saying as far as uh marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years   yes yeah and i think also in terms of parenting i think theres gonna be some increasing problem because i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting and im not sure theyre becoming any more skilled at it   umhum   because i think it really has put some additional additional stresses on family units   well do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur occur in the next generation specifically     well i i think one of the things that always happens is i think well swing to one end whereas you know where were moving at to the end where a lot of women will be at work   umhum   and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at  mid thirties and so i was saying you know this career thing isnt all its cracked up to be and i wanna go back and do something else so i think well probably see this swind pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit   umhum   although so much of its driven by economics right now people have gotten out and gotten use to two incomes coming in   yes well i actually most lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can be brought in at lower salaries because thats what everybody else assumes theyre gonna get   yeah   and the people well how do you feel about women in uh armed services   well i think they ought to have the right i i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to combat and or my wife or my daughters going into combat but i have problems with men doing that and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it its nothing id be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for   yeah um yeah i somehow cant do that i well i was brought up in the ages when the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy and the men went out and took the responsibility of earning the money         bringing in whatever they needed and and protecting the household and it and it really still bothers me and i spent plenty of years in the service but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where theres two or three of them there and five hundred men around them and how are they gonna protect themselves so to speak   i agree   it puts them in a very bad situation i i i really dont go for that   well i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit and i think i see some change in attitudes there my wife happens to be a wife whos chosen to stay at home   umhum   and theres a a tendency has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didnt have much intelligence because if she did shed be out in the work force uh and fulfilling herself   yep well thats not fair because i tell i can tell you one thing stay home sometime and start uh doing some of those jobs that shes been handling and youre gonna learn theres a lot of responsibility in just keeping a home going   and i hope we reach the point where whatever women women chose to do thats acceptable if they chose to go into the work force thats okay if they choose not to thats acceptable     yeah yeah and if they go in the work force they should be treated as nicely as as well as a man or any other person and uh not   as equals
