                    Background        Nematodes are the most abundant and speciose metazoans        and account for up to  of the kingdoms members            Not surprisingly nematodes have evolved to occupy diverse        ecological niches Like the wellstudied         Caenorhabditis elegans  most are        freeliving and graze on microbes or detritus and as such        have no obvious direct impact on humans Others however        are adapted as parasites and are responsible for such        widespread problems as human disease debilitation of        livestock and crop damage Plantparasitic forms are        responsible for an estimated  billion in annual crop        damage worldwide     The most damaging family the        Heteroderidae includes the rootknot          Meloidogyne spp and the cyst          Globodera and         Heterodera spp nematodes Rootknot        nematodes penetrate plant hosts and migrate between the        cells in roots where they induce formation of large        multinucleate cells called giant cells Galls form around        the giant cells and the roots become distorted often        leading to compromised root function and retardation of        plant growth            It is not clear which genetic differences between the        plant parasitic and nonparasitic forms may be responsible        for conferring parasitic ability On the basis of        phylogenetic analysis    it appears that plant        parasitism arose independently at least three times over        the course of nematode evolution Consequently one cannot        be assured that any gene or set of genes that aid in the        parasitic lifestyle in one nematode species will also exist        in another Conceptually several mechanisms affecting        evolution to parasitism can be envisioned These include        adaptation of preexisting genes to encode new functions        changes in genes regulating metabolic or developmental        pathways gene duplication gene loss and acquisition of        genes from other species horizontal gene transfer HGT        HGT has become a widely accepted mechanism of rapid        evolution and diversification in prokaryotic populations              Recent genome analyses of primitive eukaryotes        such as the sea squirt          Ciona intestinalis     and        singlecelled parasitic diplomonads     implicate HGT        events in early eukaryotic evolution In contrast the        extent of horizontal transfer involving higher eukaryotes        has been controversial with many cases of hypothesized        horizontally transferred genes        having        been refuted by later studies             On the basis of biochemical and immunological criteria        genes have been identified in         Globodera rostochiensis and         Heterodera glycines that allow these        nematodes to endogenously produce enzymes that can degrade        cellulose and pectin the two major components of plant        cell walls A possible ancient bacterial origin of these        genes has been theorized       A bacterial origin        for a number of rootknot nematode RKN genes also has        been proposed although their possible role in parasitism        is less clear Some such as a gene encoding chorismate        mutase     were likewise identified on the basis of        biochemical properties whereas others including a        polygalacturonase gene     were identified from        expressed sequence tag EST datasets the latter from our        data    using a keyword search Veronico         et al     isolated a presumed        polyglutamate synthetase gene with bacterial homology by        sequencing neighboring regions of the         M artiellia chitin synthetase locus        We wished to determine whether other RKN genes might have        been acquired by horizontal gene transfer particularly as        such genes might potentially be related to parasitism        Claims of HGT have frequently pivoted on incongruencies        between a particular gene tree and the assumed underlying        species tree Acquisition of new sequence data has often        revealed that genes believed to be absent in a species were        merely missing in the database rather than missing from the        genome     Obviously because full genomes are not        available for all plant and animal species we are not able        to make definitive statements about the presence or absence        of a particular gene in every organism However with the        completed         C elegans genome available as a        reference model nematode it is now possible to examine        the emerging genetic resources for         Meloidogyne comprehensively to begin        to address the question of evolution of parasitism and in        particular a possible role for HGT        A similarity to a bacterial protein sequence is the        simplest criterion for considering a nematode protein and        thus the gene that encodes it as a possible HGT candidate        For that candidate truly to define an HGT event its        presence must be incongruent with nematode phylogeny        Figure  Nevertheless the presence of a gene in one        nematode species such as         Meloidogyne  but its absence in        another such as         C elegans  might merely reflect a        gene loss in the latter lineage In addition to         C elegans  several other        invertebrate genomes have been completely sequenced and at        the time of this study the best characterized of those was                Drosophila melanogaster         Consequently we chose this resource as a tool to identify        genes which may be present in nematodes but which are        absent in         C elegans  A bacterialike gene        present in         Meloidogyne and         Drosophila  but absent in         C elegans  is unlikely to have        experienced HGT but may rather reflect a gene loss in the         C elegans lineage We therefore        developed a phylogenetic filter based on these        relationships to rapidly reveal         Meloidogyne HGT candidates identified        by sequence similarity to bacterial proteins The intent of        this filter is to efficiently eliminate spurious HGT        candidates        Surprisingly the relationship between the invertebrate        phyla Nematoda and Arthropoda which includes         Drosophila  is controversial The        traditional view is that arthropods are more closely        related to annelids than to nematodes but some recent        molecular phylogenies place nematodes and arthropods        together in a highlevel taxon named Ecdysozoa which does        not include annelids      Other molecular studies        give conflicting results      Regardless of the        evolutionary relationship between Nematoda and Arthropoda         C elegans and         Drosophila remain useful and valid        models for our analyses and the relationships shown in        Figure are consistent with both hypotheses        Genes that were transferred from bacteria to nematodes        would pass through our phylogenetic filter if the transfer        event occurred subsequent to the divergence of the         C elegans and         Meloidogyne lineages Figure         Should a gene appear to be present in other closely related        plant parasites such as the cyst nematodes the transfer        event probably affected a common ancestor of the two        families of parasitic nematodes event a in Figure         Alternatively the transfer event may be more recent such        as to the progenitor of the         Meloidogyne lineage since its        divergence from the cyst nematodes event b in Figure         or in a lineage leading to a single         Meloidogyne species event c        Although bacterialike         Meloidogyne genes that are not        present in         C elegans and         Drosophila comprise a preliminary        pool of candidates multiple gene loss may be responsible        for the presenceabsence pattern revealed by the filter To        test this more thoroughly we established a screen to        compare the now small pool of preliminary candidates with        all other sequences in the public databases The most        parsimonious explanation to be drawn from candidates with        no significant matches to any metazoan genes is that they        arose by horizontal gene transfer from a nonmetazoan pool        as opposed to multiple independent gene losses in the        metazoan lineages Candidates thus identified were        subsequently validated through phylogenetic analysis of        relationships between the most similar matches from our        screening processes        We describe here a comprehensive twostep search for HGT        candidates in         M incognita M javanica and         M hapla using EST data              Genometogenome comparisons were made to discover        patterns of presence and absence that would indicate        horizontally acquired genes Second kingdomwide        comparisons further reduced the candidate pool these genes        were then examined from an evolutionary standpoint Twelve         Meloidogyne candidates were        discovered and their potential role in plant pathogenicity        is discussed                    Results and discussion                  Genometogenome comparisons act as a phylogenetic          filter in candidate searching          Given the large number of sequences to examine and the          expectation that most were not horizontally acquired we          developed a phylogenetic filter based on genometogenome          sequence comparisons Further because the available data          included raw ESTs from the National Center for          Biotechnology Information NCBI GenBank dbEST as well          as clustered ESTs from the Parasitic Nematode Sequencing          Project       for which the data can be presumed          to be significantly more reliable we wished to compare          the efficiency of reducing each dataset with this filter                    Meloidogyne sequences from NCBI          dbEST            M incognita            M javanica and           M hapla sequences named NMi NMj          and NMh respectively were translated in six frames and          individually compared to conceptual sixphase          translations of the           C elegans and           Drosophila genomes as well as all          available bacterial sequences This first filter which          makes no assumptions about gene annotation in the target          genomes and which employed the relatively errorprone          raw ESTs reduced the pool of HGT candidates by          eliminating more than  of the original ESTs for all          three species tested Table  Using clustered ESTs            M incognita and           M javanica sequences named WMi          and WMj as queries to the worm fly and bacterial          protein databases which are based on gene annotation          produced a similar degree of reduction Table           Importantly genes previously predicted to be the result          of HGT events were identified by and passed through the          phylogenetic filter see below          The main objective of the phylogenetic filter was to          reduce the computational load necessary to screen HGT          candidates against all metazoan proteins A second          filter consisting of a BLAST analysis against the          GenBank nonredundant nr protein database served to          eliminate genes that may have been independently lost in          the           C elegans and           Drosophila lineages but are still          representative of a more ancient animal gene Table           This filter eliminated four candidates from the WMi data          set Examination of these showed a putative copper          homeostatis protein and a protein of unknown function          both with significant matches to           Homo sapiens evalues of e          and e respectively one aldehyde dehydrogenase          with a significant match to           Mus musculus e  and one          asparaginyltRNA synthetase Three of the four had best          matches to bacteria Table  Interestingly manual          inspection revealed that all four sequences did have          significant matches to           C elegans  but passed through our          initial phylogenetic filter because the bacterial matches          were stronger than those for           C elegans or           Drosophila  The  final          candidates in WMi had no significant match to           C elegans or           Drosophila in the preliminary          screen The best eukaryotic matches to these candidates          from the BLAST search against nr are shown in Table           The second filter generated similar enrichment in WMj          reducing the number of candidates from eleven to          seven          The fact that more candidates from the raw datasets          were eliminated during secondround filtering for          example from  to  in NMi reflects the redundancy in          the datasets If multiple EST sequences representing a          single gene pass through the first filter each of those          EST sequences will be in the preliminary candidate pool          The second filter is likely to simultaneously remove more          than one of these homologous sequences if it removes any          at all Therefore searching with raw EST sequences is          likely to result in a larger absolute decrease in the          candidate number than will searching with clustered EST          sequences          The number of final candidates listed in Table are          candidate HGT genes after clustering A smaller number of          candidates was discovered from the raw EST datasets          compared with the clustered sequences which suggests          that our method of HGT candidate searching is partially          dependent on sequence quality The lower number of final          candidates obtained using raw EST data is principally due          to filtering of areas of low complexity and tandem          repeats and uncertainty of similarity matching for          shorter sequences during BLAST searches Similarly the          size of the dataset influences the number of final          candidates obtained Thus the absence of candidates in           M hapla is likely to be due to a          combination of the small number of unique ESTs analyzed          because of redundancy in the data and possibly overall          quality of the raw ESTs rather than to a lack of          laterally acquired genes in the genome Despite the          lowered efficiency of candidate discovery when using the          lowerquality raw EST sequences this tool was able to          recover five candidates from the NMi dataset compared to          the  candidates identified from the higherquality          clustered sequences in the WMi dataset The fact that          candidates were discovered across disparate          sequencequality conditions not only provides additional          validation of our methods but also suggests a high          degree of flexibility and robustness in the tool                          Identification of previously hypothesized HGT          candidates          The literature reports seven genes postulated to have          been horizontally acquired by           M incognita M hapla or           M javanica during evolution of          plantparasitic nematodes         our search          algorithm revealed six of these genes The notable          exception is           MjCM  which is postulated to          encode chorismate mutase in           M javanica     To examine why          this gene was not identified by our filtering process we          used both           MjCM sequences found in GenBank          AF AF in a series of BLASTX queries No          significant matches were found in the           Drosophila            C elegans or bacterial databases          nor in the           Meloidogyne datasets used in this          study Recent BLAST searches at nematodenet             against all           Meloidogyne ESTs including          sequences not available when our analyses were first          conducted confirm that the chorismate mutase gene is          absent from WMi and WMj although a single significant          match to an           M arenaria chorismate mutase EST          was revealed Another RKN gene also postulated to have          been acquired by HGT and which encodes polyglutamate          synthetase was previously identified in           M artiellia              Significantly hybridization data showed that this          particular gene is absent from both the           M javanica and           G rostochiensis genomes              We speculate that acquisition of this gene by           M artiellia is a recent HGT event          event c Figure  and thus it is truly absent from          the           Meloidogyne genomes from which our          datasets were derived In other words failure to          discover this gene was not a failure of our screening          process but is likely to be a correct reflection of the          biology          The most extensively studied HGT candidates are four          genes encoding endoglucanase initially identified          in the cyst nematodes           G rostochiensis and           H glycines      These four          genes NemaGene Contig IDs MI MI MI and          MI    appear to define two sets of paralogs          formed before divergence of the cyst and rootknot          nematodes As noted      endoglucanases          presumably equip these nematodes with the ability to          endogenously degrade the most abundant component of cell          walls namely cellulose Similarly the second most          abundant component of cell walls pectin is the assumed          target of nematodeencoded pectate lyase and          exopolygalacturonase both functions also postulated to          have been acquired by HGT The pectate lyase gene          MI was identified in           G rostochiensis and           H glycines    and the          exopolygalacturonase MI was identified in our           M incognita data               Because of the obvious role of nematode genes that allow          endogenous production of cellwall degrading enzymes in          attacking a plant host it has been hypothesized that          their acquisition by HGT may have been key steps in the          evolution of plantparasitic nematodes from ancestral          freeliving forms     In that model an intermediate          symbiotic association of a soildwelling but          freeliving nematode with a soil bacterium possessing          these enzymes is postulated before the HGT event It was          suggested    that acquisition of these new functions          either by symbiosis or HGT permitted previously          freeliving nematodes to expand their range into a new          ecological niche the plant as a prelude to speciation          into parasitic forms          Also revealed by our tool were six new HGT candidates          including homologs for glutamine synthetase Lthreonine          aldolase and           nodL  and three to which function          could not be unequivocally ascribed                          Rhizobial origin of Meloidogynegenes          Of the six newly identified HGT candidates four have          highest similarity to genes in the nitrogenfixing soil          bacteria that nodulate plant roots and which are          collectively termed rhizobia           Meloidogyne and rhizobia are          sympatric that is they share an ecological niche in the          soil     and arguably in the plant too              satisfying the minimal requirement for an HGT to occur          namely physical proximity Interestingly models of          bacterial evolution suggest HGT as a mechanism of          adaptation into either symbiosis or parasitism              This is specifically thought to be the case for divergent          species of rhizobia such as the symbiont           Sinorhizobium meliloti and the          pathogen           Rhizobium radiobacter formerly          known as           Agrobacterium tumefaciens  where          differential selection and gene maintenance is likely to          be responsible for different lifestyle strategies                       Two of the           Meloidogyne genes revealed by our          filters which encode an Lthreonine aldolase gene          MI and a deduced protein of unknown function          MI exhibit striking aminoacid identity to          rhizobial proteins  and  respectively but a          complete absence of meaningful homology with any          eukaryotic sequence Table  Consequently these genes          are strong candidates for having entered nematodes via          HGT presumably from a rhizobial ancestor          The deduced product of a third           M incognita gene MI has          striking sequence similarity to glutamine synthetase          GS Glutamine synthetases fall into two structurally          and functionally distinct classes GSI which to date          appears restricted to prokaryotes     is involved in          ammonium assimilation as part of the nitrogenfixation          pathway in rhizobia     The ability to be reversibly          adenylylated at Tyr of the active site is a          characteristic of GSI The second class GSII is found          in all eukaryotes and a small number of prokaryotes and          appears to be involved in purine synthesis              Unlike GSI GSII is not adenylylated and lacks the          conserved tyrosine On the basis of both aminoacid          sequence similarity Table  and a Pfam    HMM          search evalue e  it is clear that the RKN          glutamine synthetase is a GSI homolog implying a          prokaryotic origin Strikingly the nematode protein has          greatest similarity  aminoacid identity to GSI from          the rhizobial bacterium           Mesorhizobium loti  including          conservation of Tyr The best match to a eukaryotic          glutamine synthetase GSII is substantially lower Table           strongly implicating the RKN gene as a robust          candidate for an HGT event          The fourth rhizobiallike HGT candidate MI          identified by our filter has  aminoacid identity          e  to NodL from           Rhizobium leguminosarum Table           This protein encodes an           N acetyltransferase previously          thought to be present only in rhizobia     where it          functions in the biosynthesis of Nod factor Nod factors          are a rhizobial speciesspecific family of          lipochitooligosaccharides which function in signal          exchange between the bacterium and its symbiotic partner          plant     The first visible signs of nodule          formation roothair deformation as part of the          symbiotic pathway are triggered by Nod factors              and although the specific mechanisms of Nod factor          function remain unknown it is clear that it has a          central role in initiation of cell division and possibly          also nodule differentiation in the root     For most          rhizobia the product of           nodD acts as a transcriptional          activator and induces expression of a set of           nod genes Experimental evidence             shows that lack of either           nodABC or           nodD in rhizobia results in a Nod          phenotype that is a strain unable to initiate nodule          formation on the host plant By contrast           R radiobacter  which forms a          parasitic relationship with plants by producing a crown          gall rather than nodules lacks these genes and appears          to possess only           nodL            nodX and           nodN  suggesting these three           nod genes are sufficient to affect          root growth and are involved in a parasitic lifestyle          rather than being specific to symbiosis              To examine further the relationship between putative           nodL candidates found in           M incognita and           M javanica with the cognate genes          in rhizobia we undertook a phylogenetic analysis and          found that the two nematode genes fall squarely within          the rhizobial           nodL clade Figure  This          analysis further grouped other sequences with significant          similarity to the deduced           Meloidogyne NodL protein Not          surprisingly these enzymes clustered according to          specific enzymatic function of the different classes of          acetyltransferase Significantly the solitary          significant match of the           Meloidogyne NodL sequences to a          eukaryote is to a yeast serineacetyltransferase an          enzyme clearly separated from the RKN by function as well          as in our phylogeny Figure           Bayesian analysis of the aminoacid alignment confirms          this grouping The posterior probability of the two           Meloidogyne sequences being most          closely related to the one other eukaryotic sequence          from           Saccharomyces cerevisiae  is          estimated to be  Instead a group consisting of the two                    Meloidogyne sequences along with          the           Sinorhizobium meliloti and           Rhizobium leguminosarum sequences          is estimated to have a posterior probability of  For          the clade consisting solely of the four rhizobial and the          two           Meloidogyne sequences the          posterior probability is estimated to be about  and          almost all of the remaining posterior probability is          accounted for by adding the           Streptomyces coelicolor sequence to          this clade of rhizobial and           Meloidogyne sequences          Using polymerase chain reaction PCR primers designed          from the           Meloidogyne sequence we have          attempted to amplify           nodL from a range of nematode          species For each of the           Meloidogyne species tested          including           M hapla  we have been able to          confirm the presence of the gene However similar          experiments do not yield amplification products from the          cyst nematodes we tested Although other interpretations          can be made these results are consistent with           nodL being acquired by an event b          HGT see Figure                           Meloidogyne nodLtruly is a nematode gene          A question that arises in analyzing eukaryotic          sequences with strong matches to bacterial proteins          especially when the match is unique is whether the gene          in question truly was isolated from a eukaryote or          whether it represents a prokaryotic contaminant any          nucleic acid matches of ESTs to prokaryotes which          probably would be contaminants were removed before          database submission     Claims of nematode genes          having been acquired by HGT       have          addressed this issue in a number of ways To provide          experimental evidence that the           Meloidogyne nodL sequences          represent nematode loci we cloned and sequenced a          fulllength transcript from           M incognita            MiNodL  Identification of the          SL           trans splice leader at the  end          of the message     and a polyA tail at the  end          confirmed that this is a           bona fide nematode gene Figure           Analysis of genomic           MiNodL sequences revealed an          intron Figure  further reinforcing the notion that          this gene is integrated within the           M incognita genome          In cases of a recent HGT it has been suggested that          the nucleotide composition of the transferred gene might          reflect that of the donor species rather than the          recipient species     To establish a baseline          nucleotide composition of           M incognita transcripts we          calculated the average GC content for our entire           M incognita WMi sequence          dataset obtaining a value of  By contrast the          average GC content of rhizobial species ranges from           to      Consistent with the average for           M incognita  the GC content of           MiNodL is  This value is          strikingly different for the           nodL genes in           Rhizobium leguminosarum  GC          and           Mesorhizobium loti  GC We          similarly examined the GC content of all  HGT          candidates and found the values to be consistently          representative of           Meloidogyne           Another way to consider nucleotide composition is          through codon usage In particular we considered how          similar the           Meloidogyne codon usage is to that          of a typical rhizobial protein by using the codon          adaptation index CAI     From an           R leguminosarum codonusage table          we calculated the CAI for those amino acids precisely          conserved between MiNodL and the rhizobial NodL protein          to be  and  respectively To evaluate the null          hypothesis that the expected codon usage between the two           nodL genes is identical the          difference in CAI values was adopted as a test statistic          The observed value of this test statistic was  and          its null distribution was approximated by simulating           datasets as described in Materials and methods          Because the absolute value of the test statistic          calculated from the simulated datasets exceeded           only  of  times we reject the null hypothesis of          identical expected codon usage in the           M incognita and           R leguminosarum nodL genes and          conclude that codon usage in these genes is significantly          different between the species Collectively comparison          of the nematode and rhizobial           nodL genes suggests that each is          adapted for function in the organism in which it resides          and despite the high degree of similarity between the          aminoacid sequences of these genes the DNA sequences          are strikingly different          From the Lawrence and Ochman model     in which          differences in GC and codon bias are diagnostic for HGT          events it might be argued that our findings on the base          composition of bacterial and nematode sequences are          inconsistent with HGT However analyses in which synteny          and phylogenetic information were also considered suggest          that codon bias and GC content are poor indicators of          HGT     A role for amelioration whereby          structural characteristics of the foreign gene are          eventually homogenized to resemble those of the recipient          species has been assumed but the rate was postulated to          be the same as the rate of random forward mutation              In addition to alterations in codon usage as          reflected in GC content for a bacterial gene to          function efficiently in a nematode presumably requires          acquisition of regulatory elements including a promoter          and structural elements including a polyA tail and          optionally a           trans spliced leader Other          elements such as introns might also be acquired It is          possible that a careful phylogenetic analysis comparing          rates of evolution of           Meloidogyne genes acquired by HGT          with those present in the more ancient nematode lineage          might shed light on the rate of amelioration of gene          structure following interkingdom HGT                          Patterns of HGT from rhizobia          In the absence of an assembled genome sequence for           Meloidogyne  it is not yet          possible to examine conserved genomewide gene order of          HGT candidates between nematodes and the hypothesized          bacterial donor Nevertheless because the origin of many          of the nematode HGT candidates appeared to be rhizobial          we wished to investigate the organization of the          bacterial homologs Unlike many prokaryotes in which the          genome resides largely on a single circular chromosome          with varying numbers of small episomes rhizobial genomes          are typically organized in a manner conceptually more          like eukaryotes           Sinorhizobium meliloti  for          example has three large singlecopy plasmids              and the primary           Mesorhizobium loti chromosome is          linear Rhizobia have the ability to transfer genes          horizontally to other bacteria and           M loti carries a symbiosis          island which spans approximately  of its genome and          has been shown to have a role in rhizobial evolution via          HGT     This symbiosis island contains certain genes          involved in nodulation and nitrogenfixation functions          but none of these is a homolog of the nematode HGT          candidates we have identified However four of these          genes do map to the same           M loti linear chromosome Figure           including           nodL and the glutamine synthetase          gene both of which are involved in nodulationnitrogen          fixation in rhizobia Together with the Lthreonine          aldolase homolog candidate these three genes are found          within  kb of each other a distance that represents          only  of the           M loti chromosome which is less          than half the size of the symbiosis island The fourth          candidate of unknown function lies approximately  kb          from the opposite side of the symbiosis island from the          other three Figure  Interestingly examination of the          colinearity and gene arrangements between           S meliloti            R radiobacter and           M loti indicates that the location          of the genes in           M loti probably represents a more          primitive state    and is therefore more likely to          reflect the proximity of these genes in rhizobial          ancestral species Although it cannot be known if these          genes were acquired in a single transfer event between a          rhizobial ancestor and an ancestor to           Meloidogyne  remnants of the HGT          event other than the already identified genes may          remain and candidates are currently being mapped into          the           M incognita genome to examine          possible synteny with           M loti  BLAST analysis of the          genes in the intervening span of chromosome indicates          only three significant matches to the           M incognita WMi data set all          with significant matches to           C elegans  that is they are not          HGT candidates                            Conclusions        We have demonstrated that a highthroughput        bioinformatics approach based on EST sequences is an        efficient and effective way to identify possible HGT        candidates in plantparasitic nematodes Previous reports        of horizontally acquired genes have been based mainly on        biochemical or immunological criteria Using an informatics        approach we rediscovered previously identified candidates        thus validating our method and were able to identify new        candidates for HGT Strikingly a common theme underpinning        the HGT candidates is their apparent direct relationship to        the parasitic lifestyle of         Meloidogyne     Also striking was        our finding that phylogenetically rhizobia appear to be        the predominant group of donor bacteria This is        significant for two reasons First rootknot nematodes and        rhizobia occupy similar niches in the soil and in roots        and thus the opportunity for HGT may be omnipresent        Second both organisms establish intimate developmental        interactions with host plants and mounting evidence        suggests that the mechanisms for these interactions are        also shared     It seems a reasonable hypothesis that        the origin of parasitism in         Meloidogyne may have been facilitated        by acquisition of genetic material from soil bacteria        through horizontal transfer Indeed such events may have        represented key steps in speciation of plantparasitic        nematodes                    Materials and methods                  Available data          Sequences were obtained from the Parasitic Nematode          Sequencing Project PNSP    including clustered           Meloidogyne ESTs built with the          NemaGene approach     We analyzed            M incognita WMi sequences and                     M javanica WMj sequences from          these PNSP clusters Additional raw sequences were          extracted from the July   NCBI GenBank dbEST build          with the Entrez Search and Retrieval System Table                         Meloidogyne incognita and           M javanica datasets from NCBI NMi          and NMj respectively contain the individual ESTs          generated by the PNSP and from which the clusters for          the WMi and WMj datasets were generated In addition the          NMi and NMj datasets included some sequences from sources          other than the PNSP           M hapla

installation of WUBLAST      Each sequence          in WMi and WMj was extracted into individual FASTA format          files using Perl scripts and submitted for three          sixphase translated WUBLASTX searches once each          against the           C elegans            Drosophila and bacterial protein          databases WUBLASTX parameters were E   W   T            Evalues were extracted for the best match for each          query sequence in each of the three searches                    Meloidogyne sequences from NCBI          were analyzed using the TeraBLAST Hardware Accelerated          BLAST algorithm TimeLogic Crystal Bay NV Single          FASTA files were submitted for three sixphase translated          TeraTBLASTX queries against sixphase translated           C elegans and           Drosophila genomic databases          TeraTBLASTX parameters were Open Penalty   Extend          Penalty   Word Size   Query Increment   and          Neighborhood Threshold   Perl scripts were employed          to parse the query name and associated best evalue from          each of the nine analyses three each for NMi NMj and          NMh          As a first round of phylogenetic filtering automated          comparison of evalues for each sequence allowed us to          eliminate sequences with a best match to either           C elegans or           Drosophila from further analysis          The remaining sequences those with a best match to          bacteria of order e or better provided a          preliminary pool of candidates for each dataset A BLASTX          search was carried out for each candidate against the nr          database using the above parameters The results from          this second filter were examined and any sequence with a          significant match to a metazoan other than a closely          related plantparasitic nematode was removed from further          analysis An evalue of e was the threshold used to          declare a match The remaining sequences provided our          final set of candidates for horizontally transferred          genes Tables                            Codon usage analysis          The protein alignment of the           M incognita and           R leguminosarum nodL sequences was          trimmed such that only identical amino acids remained          and the sequences backtranslated retaining the correct          codon usage Ten thousand pairs of simulated sequences          were generated by independently permuting the homologous          codon pairs in the actual data In other words the          probability that the           i th codon in the first simulated          sequence was assigned the           i th codon from the actual           M incognita sequence and the           i th codon in the second simulated          sequence was assigned the           i th codon from the actual           R leguminosarum sequence was set          to  and the probability that the           i th codon assignments in the          simulated sequences were reversed was also set to           Codon adaptation indices were computed for each simulated          sequence using the EMBOSS suite of sequence analysis          tools                              Phylogenetic analysis of candidates          For each candidate the protein sequences for the top           matches with an evalue of e or less were          extracted from the BLASTX search against the nr database          If there were not  matches with an evalue meeting this          criterion all sequences with evalues lower than e          were selected Alignments of these sequences with the          translated candidate sequence were constructed with          CLUSTALX     improvements to the CLUSTALX alignments          were performed manually Sequences from the same species          with more than  identity after alignment were          considered possible paralogs and deemed redundant          information for this analysis Only one sequence from          each of these sets was used in further analysis Poorly          aligned sequences were also discarded          Distances between aligned proteins were estimated with          the Dayhoff aminoacid replacement model     Tree          topologies were then inferred from these distances via          neighborjoining    and  nonparametric          bootstrap replicates were used to estimate clade support              Maximum likelihood analysis produced topologies          consistent with the neighborjoining analysis All          phylogenetic reconstructions were performed with the          PHYLIP and PAML software packages               Additional analyses of the putative           nodL gene were conducted with          Version b of the MrBayes software     For these          analyses the JonesTaylorThornton model of aminoacid          replacement    was adopted and variation of          replacement rates among sites was incorporated by a          discretized gamma distribution with four rate categories              Each Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis used four          heated chains and employed a burnin period of           cycles followed by  additional cycles          Convergence of the Markov chain was diagnosed by          performing two different runs from different initial          parameter states Prior distributions for all parameters          were the default distributions incorporated in the          MrBayes software                            Additional data files        The following files are
