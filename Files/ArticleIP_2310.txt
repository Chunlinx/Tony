                                 Newt Lite            Try to remember if you canfor a moment the old Newt Gingrich He was a man who liked to talk verygrandly often describing his political program as renewing Americancivilization and replacing what he referred to as the bureaucratic welfarestate with a new kind of society The  election that brought him to powerwas a revolution that he cast in terms of Braveheart  a gory movieabout freedom fighters in medieval Scotland Republican traitors knew what toexpect Gingrich blamed liberals for sensational murders and called theClintons the enemies of normal Americans He drew cosmological charts withhimself at the center and got very fat            The newNewt by contrast is a humble fellow In his book Lessons Learned the HardWay  he presents himself as shorn of his old harshness and grandiosity aswell as of  or  pounds On the cover he appears in faded jeans hikingboots and a leather jacket smiling as he leans against a postandrail fencebathed in soft filtered sunlight The few specific proposals he makes arestunning in their modesty For instance Gingrich advocates diabetes screeningas a way to save Medicare money and thinks it is especially important forNative Americans who are highly susceptible to the disease to monitor theirblood pressure He admits to mistakes such as failing to keep his mouth shut atseveral points mismanaging the House Republicans and underestimating hisopponents He describes himself as tolerant of internal dissent evenidentifying with the GOP rebels who plotted a coup against him last summer            Seeing Newt so shrunken is somewhat disheartening Theresa poignant moment in his mostly very dull book when as his career is beingtorn apart by the House Ethics Committee investigation into his college coursehe describes visiting one of his favorite places the American Museum ofNatural History in New York Communing with dinosaurs revives his spirits Inthe old days Newt didnt need fossils to spur him on He had the courage ofhis convictions and of his boorish aggression Now he comes across like avictim of some Dale Carnegie reeducation campits as if hes constantlyreminding himself of his imageconsultants lessons in seeming nice Where theold Newt was a compelling meanie the new one offers anodyne platitudes andempty uplift He calls at one point in his book for a serious conversationabout our national future At another point he writes of the Republicanagenda What we have to offer people  is strength and adventure theexperience of a new level of lifeenhancing energy and love of a greatcountry This could be anyone talkingDick Gephardt Hillary Clinton orMarianne Williamson            Whathappened to transform the raging bull into Caspar Milquetoast There arevarious theories Some think Gingrich has modified his behavior because he isstill fighting for survival trying to appease the House Republicans whoplotted to overthrow him and might plot again Ive heard others suggest thathe is an undiagnosed manicdepressive coming off a threeyear spree Perhapsthe most common view is that Newt is merely positioning for  trying todiminish his stratospheric negatives in preparation for a presidentialrun            None of these explanations quite cuts itWhatever his past gaps in judgment Gingrich is too smart to think he has arealistic chance of being elected president His unpopularity is deep andindelible If he does run in the  primaries it will be as a way ofgracefully exiting his job as speaker He has to step down in  anywayaccording to the rule he set In fact I dont think Gingrichs transformationis all that calculated To be sure his book is disingenuous at points He saysthe coup plot was merely a cry for attention by the GOP freshman class of not a serious attempt at getting rid of him Thats ridiculous And nowheredoes he mention one of his biggest mistakesthe  million book dealGingrich returned the advance but he still wrote or caused to be written twobooks of which this is the second and more nearly readable But Gingrichsarrogance is genuinely diminished He truly seems a different person            I thinkthe new personalitymodified Newt is mainly the product of his shatteringexperiences in  and  Gingrich tried to lead a revolution and ended upwith his head in the guillotine In a way this catastrophe was the result of amisunderstanding Gingrich was never of the same mind as the radical freshmenBefore the Contract With America he was not notably antigovernment To thecontrary he thought the GOP had suffered as a result of its foolish oppositionto popular federal programs But Gingrich had a swollen ego He thought ofhimself as a world historical figure so when the election of  gave birthto a movement he stepped forward to lead it In fact it drove him He wasthus the person standing in the intersection when the wouldbe conservativerevolution smashed into the moderate reality of American politics            Gingrich is now picking himself up off the asphalt Hisplan for the future is to stay out of traffic Beyond that he proposes theRepublican Party support something he calls entrepreneurial government Hewould let the private sector act wherever possible and get the government toact more like a business This is probably what Republicans would advocate ifthey were smart Entrepreneurial government is compatible with tax cuts anddoes not demand an assault on purposes and programs that the voting majorityregards as essential It is a politics with great potential appeal to anelectorate increasingly dominated by an independent stockowning middle classThis kind of politics does not alienate women If the GOP could adopt it as ageneral approach while distancing itself from aggressive social conservatismDemocrats would have reason to fear at the presidential as well as thecongressional level            But Newts entrepreneurialidea which stresses flexibility and innovation in how government dischargesits role contradicts the libertarian urge to have government simply butt outAnd Gingrich still wants to have it both waysor at least to make the class of think he does According to his numbers government at all levels currentlyconsumes about  percent of personal income Gingrich proposes reducing it tojust  percent If you subtract the  percent that goes to state and localspending that means the federal government would defend the country pay forelectricity to light the Capitol dome and do not much else But thats not allGingrich intends to have it do He wants to protect Medicare dole outhundreds of billions in highway subsidies and fund research into diseases thataffect Republicans            Here Newt Lite has somethingin common with Newt Heavy His interesting ideas dont quite add up
