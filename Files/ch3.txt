threestyleWhen an architectural competition was announced for the New York Public Library on May   Dr John Shaw Billings the librarys executive director was determined that in his building design would not triumph over function He had in mind Bostons newly built public library a beautiful but in his opinion poorly functioning building Billings an exarmy physician was responsible for organizing the Surgeon Generals Library and a celebrated medical index He was also an expert in hospital design and was thus familiar with building construction He drafted a plan for the new library whose most unorthodox feature was the location of the main reading room It was not located near the main entrance as was common practice but on an upper floor above the book stacksThe terms of the architectural competition were strict and included detailed floor plans that the competitors were required to follow There were two stages intended to attract new talent as well as established firms First six architects were chosen from an open competition These six then advanced to a second stage where they competed against six invited firms that included not only McKim Mead  White the architects of the Boston Public Library but also such luminaries as Peabody  Stearns George B Post and an upandcoming young firm Carrre  Hastings The upandcomers carried the day McKim much to his chagrin not only lost but placed third behind Howard  Cauldwell It was his own fault since he imperiously ignored the suggested plan and substituted his own arrangement Carrre  Hastings conscientiously followed Billings requirementsThe projected budget for the new library was not large  million and Billings expected a relatively modest building That was not what he got All three designs were monumental Carrre  Hastings and Howard  Cauldwell used the Modern French style which was more ornate and allowed for more articulation to the faade than the austere Classical style that McKim opted for All incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floorsCorinthian in McKims case Ionic in the other two the completed building is Corinthian The compositional strategies were roughly similar a monumental stair led to an elevated main floor the entrance was placed in the center more understated in McKims elegant design statuary and urns adorned the attic All three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence dignity and of culture rooted in the pastI mentioned the New York Public Library competition when I gave a public lecture in connection with a recent architectural competition for the new Salt Lake City Public Library The library board had conducted a national search for an architect visited new libraries across the country and solicited proposals from prominent architects They had narrowed their list to four firms Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel are respected New York architects with a long record of university buildings and museums including a new library of science industry and business for the New York Public Library system Moshe Safdie had built major civic buildings in Israel Canada and the United States and recently completed the public library in Vancouver British Columbia Moore Ruble Yudell is a Los Angeles firm founded by the late Charles Moore with whom John Ruble and Buzz Yudell built several university libraries and a public library in Berlin Will Bruder the least wellknown of the four is a southwesterner and the architect of the new wellregarded Phoenix Public LibraryI told my audience that I thought that the Salt Lake City library board would have a more difficult choice than their nineteenthcentury New York counterparts It was not a question of function The Salt Lake City librarians had prepared an equally exhaustive program of requirements so whichever architect was chosen commodity probably would be well served As for firmness I was reasonably sure that any of these experienced firms would build soundly It was the consideration of delight that would make the selection harder Gwathmey and Siegel design crisply detailed understated buildings in a latterday version of the International Style Safdie too is a modernist but he follows in the footsteps of Pei and his buildings are frankly monumentalthe Vancouver library had been likened to the Roman Coliseum Moore Ruble Yudells work is different Informal and animated their eclectic Postmodern designs are likely to include ornament and architectural motifs drawn from their surroundings Bruder on the other hand designs chic buildings that incorporate exposed structural elements rough industrial materials and sleek details Building on the same site fulfilling the same functional requirements and using the same uptodate construction technology the four firms would produce libraries that would look differentThe library board awarded the commission to Moshe Safdie and a year later the plans for the new building were unveiled The new library will feature an unusual triangularshaped main building and a curving walllike structure that encloses a public square A hundred years ago it was taken for granted that the New York Public Library would be designed in some variant of the Classical style Today a public library can take many guises It can be relentlessly avantgarde like the new  billion national library in Paris where the books are housed in four Lshaped story glass towers and the readers are lodged in underground rooms which the London Times described as a series of rectangular salons identical of course where you can admire the ultrasmooth gray concrete steel grille ceilings and the expanses of African veneer A new library can be comfortably Modernist like the new British Library in London which the Independent humorously described as a giant municipal building that has made its way from Scandinavia having crashed headfirst through an English brickworks on the way Tom Beebys handsome Harold T Washington Library in Chicago on the other hand is distinctly oldfashioned with rusticated stone walls and carved brick ornaments that are a literal evocation of the citys nineteenthcentury architectural tradition Instead of trendy plastic or metal chairs the reading areas are equipped with solid wood tables and traditional courthouse chairs James Ingo Freeds Main Public Library in San Francisco on the other hand is both old and new the imposing granite and stainless steel exterior is more or less Classical on one faade and more or less Modernist on anotherThe coexistence of different architectural styles is nothing new In a  essay titled Style in American Architecture Ralph Adams Cram identified no less than seven contemporary styles although he called them tendencies Five were traditional McKims pure Classicism the BeauxArts French Modern Colonial which was associated with houses but was also appearing in larger buildings such as the Johns Hopkins University campus Crams own High Gothic and a looser interpretation of the medieval style as practiced by his partner Goodhue Two were new steelframe construction which Cram described as an enfant terrible and what he called the SecessionistsFrank Lloyd Wright in Chicago the Greene brothers in Pasadenawho exhibited a strongly developed enmity to archaeological forms of any kind Cram was not sanguine about the future but he nevertheless concluded Chaos then confronts us in that there is no single architectural following but legion and in that fact lies the honor of our art for neither is society one or ever at one with itselfCram is right most historical periods are marked by stylistic confusion it is stylistic consensus that is unusual There was such a brief consensus in the late s when both architects and the American public under the influence of the immensely popular Worlds Columbian Exposition embraced Classicism at least for public buildings That unanimity lasted long enough for the New York Public Library competition but it began to unravel shortly after as Crams essay makes clear There was also a consensus in the s at least among progressive architects That consensus did not last either After  Mies van der Rohe gave up the freeflowing plans and asymmetrical massing that had characterized the Barcelona Pavilion and the Tugendhat House and began designing buildings whose details and materials were Modern but whose layout and composition were distinctly Classical In the s Le Corbusier proclaimed the Five Points of a New Architecture the building raised on stilts the roof garden the frame structure that allowed a free plan the free faade and the horizontal ribbon window He too had second thoughts Thirty years later his wonderful chapel at Ronchamps had massive sculpted wall that concealed a concrete frame the roof far from being flat resembled a billowing nuns coif Le Corbusier who had coined the famous expression a house is a machine for living in now adopted distinctly unmachinelike building materials such as crudely finished concrete exposed brick roughened stucco and fieldstone This volte face gave rise to the socalled Brutalist style which had a worldwide influence shaping the work of architects as dissimilar as James Stirling and Paul Rudolph and ultimately opening the door to Postmodern stylistic experiments such as Charles Moores little house in the Berkeley hillsThe inconstancy of the International Style practitioners should have been expected The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules only to bend and break them Even Classicism which appears at first glance to be highly regimented is not immune As far as we know the ancient Greeks used only three orders Doric Ionic and Corinthian Vitruvius describes them and also refers to a Tuscan order which is a Roman invention Roman too is the socalled Composite order an ornate blend of Ionic and Corinthian The vault the arch and the dome unknown to the Greeks were other Roman additions to the Classic canon Architects have been stretching Classical rules ever since breaking pediments flattening pilasters magnifying and shrinking columns rusticating masonry A sixteenthcentury French architect Philibert de lOrme invented a French order Edwin Lutyens devised an order based on Mughal precedents for the Viceroys House in New Delhi more recently Allan Greenberg created an order for the offices of the Secretary of State that incorporated the Great Seal of the United States Michael Graves designed Classical caryatids columns carved in the shape of human figures to support the pedimented front of an office building for the Walt Disney Company in Burbank While the supports of the porch of the Erechtheon in Athens take the form of graceful maidens Graves caryatids are the Seven DwarfsThe headquarters of a company whose logo is a pair of mouse ears obviously demands a different decorum from a temple In the past religious buildings and palaces required a narrow stylistic range As architectural commissions grew to include civic and commercial buildings warehouses factories shops and cinemas houses and weekend housesevery sort of buildinga single style no longer sufficed Gothic is an evocative style for churches but despite Walpoles efforts it is illadapted to houses Romanesque makes imposing city halls but is too heavy to be applied to skyscrapers The International Style makes striking small buildings but monotonous large ones Shingle Style cottages are pleasing a Shingle Style Home Depot is ridiculous As Cram wisely observed Architecture is nothing unless it is intimately expressive and if utterly different things clamor for voicing different also must be their architectural manifestationThe great architectsBrunelleschi Palladio Wren Richardson Lutyensregularly looked to the past for inspiration In  Richard Meier built the Smith House which has been called the first International Style revival building Like all revivalists Meier picks and chooses At first glance the Smith House has all the stylistic hallmarks of a Le Corbusier villa of the s a free plan flat roof white walls pipe railings horizontal ribbon windows a ramp Yet it is built out of wood and steel not masonry The white walls are painted wood siding not stucco the details are more refined the plateglass sheets are larger the structure lighter The result is an International Style that is filtered through American consciousness and shaped by American technology It is like Thomas Jefferson building Classical columns out of woodthe same but differentAlthough art historians use terms like Gothic Revival and Greek Revival to distinguish later reincarnations of styles architects look at history differently For the serious architect the past exists not as a legacy to be possessed through a selfconscious act of the modern will writes Roger Scruton in The Aesthetics of Architecture but as an enduring fact an ineliminable part of an extended present That is why architects whether they are Inigo Jones or Louis Kahn make architectural pilgrimages to the Mediterranean roots of Western architecture Sketchbook in hand they plumb the secrets of the master builders of the past Consciousness of the past may also explain why architects tend to resist being categorized according to style they instinctively understand that the history of architectureincluding the presentis a continuity rather than a series of episodesStylistic consistency is much admired today but it was not always so In  Filippo Brunelleschi began the Foundling Hospital in Florence whose delicate arcade of Corinthian columns surmounted by pedimented windows is generally considered the first building of the Renaissance At the very same time he was building a great dome over the crossing of the cathedral of Florence in a style that was not Classical but distinctly Gothic pointed arches and all The German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel is best known for his severe Classical public buildings such as the superb Altes Museum in Berlin but he also worked in other styles Gothic in churches and picturesque Italianate in villas McKim Mead  White favored the Classical style for public buildings and palatial residences but built Norman parish churches Shingle Style summer retreats French Renaissance mansions and American Colonial country houses John Russell Pope an eclectic master designed beautiful picturesque Tudor Georgian and Colonial country estates Edwin Lutyens was another Classicist whose residential work was eclecticDomestic architects had to be adaptable because house styles changed according to fashion In the United States Tudor was popular in the s as was the Free Style Cotswold and French Provincial appeared in the s After the s influenced by the restoration of Williamsburg American Colonial returned to favor The Cotswold style with its relatively severe details and blunt forms created a very different setting from French Provincial which tended to have more delicate details from Free Style with its almost rustic atmosphere or from sturdy Colonial Since historic styles carry cultural overtones using different styles was also a way for architectsand clientsto say different thingsIf architectural style is a languagean analogy that is deeply flawedit is closer to slang than to grammatical prose Architectural styles are mutable unregulated improvised Architects break the rules and invent new ones In part this is simply the irrepressible urge of creative individuals In part architects break stylistic rules because they can After all most of the rules that govern building designfire codes building codes zoning laws budgets programmatic requirements engineering normsare outside the architects control stylistic rules are firmly within his purview Since architecture is so intensely competitive doing something unexpected unusual or just different is a way to be noticed to rise above the crowdIn addition to historical styles there have also been styles associated with individual architects The Palladian style made its way from Andrea Palladio to Inigo Jones from him to Colen Campbell and Lord Burlington and thence to Thomas Jefferson It reappears in the work of contemporary Classicists such as Allan Greenberg H H Richardsons influence was considerably shorterlived but for at least  years Richardsonian Romanesque rolled over the United States like an aesthetic Juggernaut in Crams colorful phrase Mies van der Rohes steelandglass style likewise prevailed for more than two decades and his characteristic Ibeam window mullion can still be seen in contemporary curtain wallsBuildings like Jones Palladian Queens House in Greenwich Adler  Sullivans Richardsonian Romanesque Auditorium Building in Chicago and Gordon Bunshafts Miesian Lever House are not copies but satisfying originals However most personal styles are not easily adaptable A building in Wrights unmistakable Prairie style for example simply looks like a knockoff Some personal styles are simply too obsessive which is probably why Frank Furness and the equally idiosyncratic Barcelona architect Antonio Gaud never attracted a followingInigo Jones consciously based his work on the architecture of Palladio but he did not think of himself as working in the Palladian style any more than Palladio would have referred to the Classical style Although Renaissance architects described their architecture as allanticain the antique mannerthey took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression the Romans improved on the Greeks and they would improved on the Romans According to the architecture historian Peter Collins the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late He cites James Stuart and Nicholas Revetts Antiquities of Athens published in  and credited with inaugurating the Classical Revival in England The authors both architects referred to the Grecian and Roman style of buildingThe Latin root of style is stilus A stilus was the sharppointed tool used to write on wax tablets and by inference stilus also referred to the way that something was written This sense of technique carried over to English and the original meaning of style was those features of literary composition that belonged to the form rather than to the substance of the matter being expressed The seventeenthcentury English musical composer Samuel Wesley put it neatly Style is the dress of thought JacquesFranois Blondel who was Louis XVs architect and who founded the first fulltime school of architecture in Europe in  adopted this literary meaning as a metaphor and described architectural style as a buildings characterfor example rustic regal or heroic Style in the organization of faades and in the decoration of rooms is the poetry of architecture he taught his students which alone makes all the architects compositions truly interestingLiterary style described the way that something was written expressed or performed Architectural style in Blondels sense describes the way that something was built Although architecture is often defined in terms of abstractions such as space light and volume buildings are above all physical artifacts The experience of architecture is palpable the grain of wood the veined surface of marble the cold precision of steel the textured pattern of brick But exactly what do we see when we look at brickwork We see the joints between the bricks and the mortar which can be flush or scraped out to create shadows the bonding patterns the way that the bricks turn the corner the surrounding of openings and the connection between the brick wall and the foundation or the eaves What we see are detailsDetails are a major preoccupation of the architect Once the overall form of a building is determinedthe masterly correct and magnificent play of masses brought together in lightthere remains the question not only of what materials are to be used and how these will be assembled but also of how the hundreds of parts of the building are to be designed from the door frames and the window sills to the railings and the baseboardsThe function of a baseboard is to cover the joint between the wall and the floor and secondarily to protect the wall from scuffing There are dozens of ways that this can be done Baseboards can be prominent or discreet a complicated assembly of board cap and base or a simple strip of hardwood Or nothingmany modern architects dispense with baseboards altogether The baseboards in my living room are twelve inches tall They are not wood but cast iron since they are really disguised radiators My house was built in  influenced by the British Free Style of Voysey and Baillie Scott and to further preserve a simple rustic atmosphere the architect had the baseboardsradiators painted to resemble woodRailings have a simple functionthey must be sturdy enough to support us if we lean on them and they must provide a secure handhold if railings are open the spaces between the supports and the rails should be small enough to prevent children from falling through Classical railings developed during the Renaissance consist of balusters supporting a handrail Balusterslittle columnscan have a single or a double swelling curve or a vase shape Fabricated in wood or masonry they can be round or square in crosssection and plain or highly ornamented Railings can be replaced by parapets with pierced screens These can be stone or metal bronze wrought or cast iron The screens can be simple Xshapes intertwining geometrical patterns or complicated floral figures as in Art Nouveau staircases Perhaps the simplest open railings are those of the great Adirondack camps whose builders mimicked Xshaped wroughtiron railings in unpeeled rustic tree trunksModern railings are usually metal In his early villas Le Corbusier used whitepainted pipe railings to create a nautical image in later buildings like the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard flat steel bars take the place of pipes The railings in Mies van der Rohes buildings usually have only a single intermediate rail located precisely halfway between the handrail and the floor the vertical stanchions the handrail and the rail are made of identical square steel bars The railings in Louis Kahn buildings tend to be parapets but where he is obliged to use an open railing the design is as simple as possible I have seen a short stair railing that consisted of a single bronze bar bent at each end to form the uprights Richard Meier uses metal railings too but because there are sometimes as many as six horizontal rails the visual effect is more pronouncedthey resemble staffs in sheet musicWhen Brutalism was in fashion railings were correspondingly heavy concrete beams wide enough to sit on but unpleasant to the touch or massive wood balustrades as solid as fenders on a truck dock The vogue among many younger architects today is toward lightness and exposed construction and railings reflect that fashion too The screens of the railings of Peter Roses Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal are industriallooking perforated sheets of anodized aluminum prominently bolted to the stanchions Bernard Tschumi substitutes steel cables complete with turnbuckles for the intermediate horizontal rails of the ramp railings of Lerner Hall at Columbia University another nautical reference but to a yacht rather than a steamship These solutions appear mannered compared to the simple railing that I M Pei designed for the East Building of the National Gallery The stainless steel handrail highlights the solidity of the rosecolored Tennessee marble by appearing to float in midair since it is supported by continuous sheets of tempered glass embedded in the floorThe transparent railings of I M Peis East Building are understated elegant and luxuriouslike the building Beauty will result from the form and correspondence of the whole with respect to the several parts taught Palladio of the parts with regard to each other and of these again to the whole The successful relationship of the details to each other and to the building is governed by the architects sense of style That is why the architect of my house painted the radiators to resemble wood a technologically inclined architect might have painted them silver a minimalist would dispense with baseboards and hide the radiators in the wall The role of details is not to complement architecture details are architecture The aesthetic understanding of architecture writes Roger Scruton is inseparable from a sense of detail Mies van der Rohe is supposed to have said God is in the details He did not mean that details are functionally important although they are or that good details prolong the life of a building although they do He meant that details are the soul of architecture That is why just as an archaeologist can reconstruct a pot from a few shards or a paleontologist can surmise the form of a prehistoric animal from bone fragments it is possible to divine the architects idea of a building by examining its detailsThe house that Robert Venturi built for his mother in  shook the foundations of the International Style much of this effect was the result of details Although Venturi obviously was working in a Modernist idiomthere is a strip window and a steelpipe railinghe also incorporated distinctly unModernist features such as trim both inside and out Classical architects use a large variety of moldingsfillet astragal egg and dart ogeethat can be combined and recombined to great decorative effect The International Style in its effort to do away with ornament outlawed trim Walls were flat planes Windows had no frames Joints between materials were simply hairline cracks The conspicuous exterior dado the baseboards and the chairrails in the Vanna Venturi House were hardly Classical moldingsthey were merely boards with chamfered edgesyet they challenged the assumption that trim and Modernism were incompatibleComing through the front door of the Vanna Venturi House one immediately senses that it is an unusual place A broad stair rises beside the fireplace then peters out to almost nothing The fireplace looks like an abstract sculpture but it has a traditional mantelpiece A freestanding column  la Corbusier stands beside a chairrail Then there is the furniture Ever since the Tugendhat Housefor which Mies had designed the furnitureit was taken for granted that modern houses required modern furniture Venturi has explained that I designed the house so my mothers old furniture c  plus some antiques would look good in it Instead of the iconic benttube Breuer chairs there are homely ladderback chairs around the dining table instead of an Eames lounge chair and ottoman a comfortable stuffed sofa It is a contradictory atmospherethe International Style willfully distorted through the lens of traditional bourgeois domesticityWhether one is looking up at the tall dome of the Pantheon descending the spiraling vortex of Wrights Guggenheim Museum or standing in the living room of Venturis small house the experience of architecture is above all the experience of being in a separate distinct world That is what distinguishes architecture from sculptureit is not an object but a place The sense of being in a special place that is a threedimensional expression of the architects imagination is one of the distinctive pleasures of architecture To create a strong sense of place the surroundings must be all of a piece space mass shapes and materials must reflect the same sensibility That is why details are so important A jarring detail or an inconsistencysomething out of placeand the fantasy begins to crumble Yes fantasy Illusion has been a part of architecture ever since the ancient Greeks made columns with a gently swelling taper to deceive the eye This is not to say that architecture is stage dcor When the wind blows the canvas scenery blows over the building resists the elements Architecture surrounds and shelters us It is the real world but it is also a visionThe Postmodern movement that followed the Vanna Venturi House was relatively shortlived but it had an important consequence it broke the stranglehold of Modernism leaving designers free to explore other forms of expression The profusion of styles that ensued is demonstrated by the work of three gifted but vastly different architects Allan Greenberg Hugh Newell Jacobsen and Enrique NortenAllan Greenberg is a confirmed Classicist He does not consider this an anomaly To be truly modern he writes means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present Classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed Although Greenberg looks to the past his is not the attitude of an archeologist Like Carrre  Hastings and generations of architects before them Greenberg approaches Classicism as a tradition to be studied absorbedthen extendedEarly in his career after emigrating to the United States from South Africa Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses which led to an unusual commission the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse He gave the commercial building in Manchester Connecticut a new faade dominated by a large arch overscaled voussoirs and a pediment Inside the barrelvaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order Greenberg had graduated from Yale in  and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism However unlike Venturi and Moore Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building he was returning to Classical roots From this modest beginning over the next two decades came a variety of commissions a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building several college and university buildings and a Roman Catholic church His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens Georgia a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills Greenberg is also known for large country houses both in the United States and in Europe Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential workusing Georgian and American Colonial styles One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon another by Palladios unfinished Villa Thiene Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim Mead  WhiteOne of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard Completed in  the lowlying building is shingled but it is not exactly Shingle Style Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts giving them a fussy and nervous appearance Such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away Greenbergs aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub The onestory Atlantic faade is almost perfectly symmetrical a large arched window flanked by two semicircular bays rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds The twostory landward side is more informal ringed by a sheltered porch Massivity informs the details sturdy Tuscan columns a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof rugged window frames The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves Inside the fireplace has a brick hearth a slate lintel and a wood surround whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough reused timbers Although most people would describe this house as traditional this is not an exercise in a particular historical style There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect  C F A Voysey and it is obvious that Greenberg has looked at Lutyens country houses But this is a modern house although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility It admirably fulfills Palladios call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the wholeHugh Newell Jacobsen studied at Yale under Louis Kahn worked for Philip Johnson and opened his own office in  He established himself as a premier residential architect winning commissions in the United States and abroad and receiving numerous design awards Several of the awards were for restoration of historic buildings notably the Renwick Gallery in Washington DC and the Htel Talleyrand in Paris A Modernist by training and inclination Jacobsen was nevertheless affected by the winds of change unleashed by Venturis little house Starting in  he evolved a hybrid style in which American regional forms and materials are combined with International Style precision spareness and simplicity A house on Nantucket in shingles and white trim looks vernacular until one notices the careful proportions and refined elegant details such as tall French doors in the living room that slide into wall pockets that also conceal shutters and screen doors A postandbeam Caribbean guest house with broad overhangs has the ingenuous simplicity of a beach shack The Palladian plan and templelike pavilions of an Ohio residence pay homage to the local Greek Revival An Ohio country house recalls a boardandbatten Gothic Revival farmhouse I endeavor to design buildings that express a sense of belonging Jacobsen says buildings that reflect or abstract the nearby architecture and the traditions dictated by the climate and local materialsThe Palmedo House built in  reinterprets the American Colonial architecture of its locationLong Island At first glance the six pavilions resemble a little village a little Amish village judging from the austere white wood siding the prim details and the identical pitched roofs Each pavilion is a perfect little house with identical square and vertical multipaned windows that open by sliding into cunning wall pockets This sounds precious but Jacobsen is not a romantic The central house contains the living room a threestory space open to the roof Although the multipaned windows are present at an upper level of the wall the corner of the room is glazed with large mullionless sheets of plate glass offering dramatic views of Long Island Sound This is an International Style device as is the economy of detail and the clean cool atmosphere of the interior On the other hand the fireplace which in an orthodox International Style house would be painted brick or bushhammered concrete is decorously built into the wall which gives the room a traditional civilized air The chief idea here is to highlight the tension between old and new between the traditional clapboarded architecture and the demands of modern life Whereas Greenberg seamlessly resolves this tension Jacobsen allows it to surface If this sounds like textbook Postmodernism it is not Jacobsen artlessly combines new and old without the slightest hint of ironyJacobsen reacts to the collapse of Modernism by seeking a compromise position while Greenberg anchors himself in the certainties of Classicism Enrique Norten the youngest of the three takes a different coursehe is trying to put Modernism back together again Norten who studied at Cornell established his office in his native Mexico City in  In a relatively short time he produced an impressive body of work that includes institutional commercial and residential buildings His major projects are a services building for the media giant TELEVISA and the National School of Theater Both incorporate bulging metal shellroofs that recall the s buildings of the French architectengineer Jean Prouv Prouv was intent on applying new methods of construction particularly industrialization and prefabrication His buildings extremely light and assembled from standardized elements were real machines for living Norten too is preoccupied with industrial building technologies the lighter the better Doubletensed glass curtain walls are mysteriously supported by a steelframe Roofs hang by steel cables from steel masts Slender canted columns brace a glassroofed portico Railings in a Norten design are almost always opportunities for structural legerdemain suspended sheets of glass stretched steel cables perforated metal screensIn  Norten built a house for himself and his family on a tight urban site in Mexico City The threestory street faade is mostly a blank concrete wall the wall facing the interior walled patio is entirely glass The main living floor is open except for the kitchen the upper bedroom floor is shaded and given privacy by a redwood louvered screen A functionalist style pervades the house The clinical cabinetwork is whitepainted wood A concrete wall in the dining room is bare save for the regular pattern of the formwork ties and the pour lines marks The windows are large sections of plate glass in simple aluminum frames a foot section slides aside to entirely open the dining room to the patio The sliding wall recalls the disappearing windows in Mies van der Rohes Tugendhat House but the resemblance ends here Mies spare interior is opulent and assertive Nortens is austere almost monastic a neutral background for family life This is an unsentimental idea of the home Not exactly a machine for living but certainly machinelike in its precision and rational layoutLike Greenberg and Jacobsen Norten reflects on the past Although his house has little to do formally with the International Style of the flatroofed stucco villas of the sexcept for the whitepainted circular steel columnsit shares that periods ambitions it is highly abstract idealistic technophile and lacking in applied ornament Decoration results not from trim but from the surface quality of the different materialsconcrete red oak flooring etched glassand from the relentless articulation of structural connections Nortens buildings exhibit another feature of the International Style they are placeless That is while they carefully respond to the specifics of the program and the site they do not explicitly acknowledge their immediate regional context Whether they are in Mexico or New Mexicowhere Norten is building a heritage centerthe style is the same understated coolly competent cosmopolitanWhether one prefers the work of Greenberg Jacobsen or Norten is a matter of taste I happen to like all three The buildings are different yet the three architects have something in common They are serious about what they are doing that is their buildings exhibit a strong sense of conviction They pay enormous attention to details They are disciplined but they understand their selfimposed rules well enough to occasionally break them Moreover while their architecture is built with a great sense of style it is never merely stylized That is because in their buildings stylethe manner of expressionis always in the service of contentthat which is being expressed Style without content quickly degenerates into caricature like a speaker who makes grand gestures and rhetorical flourishes but has nothing to say The buildings of Greenberg Jacobsen and Norten on the contrary have a great deal to tell us about our past our surroundings and ourselvesGreenberg Jacobsen and Norten do not describe what they do in terms of style I think that there are a number of reasons that architects are uncomfortable talking about the subject A suspicion of style is a heritage of the Modern Movement which preached against the arbitrary dictates of style and fashion while maintaining an unspoken but rigid stylistic consistency So deeprooted is this teaching that it remains a moral stricture on most architects whether or not they are Modernists Perhaps another reason for the reluctance to discuss style is fear Fear that being linked to a particular style is to be put in a boxlike most creative people architects dislike being categorized Also fear that talking about style will make architecturea serious businesssound frivolous Better to leave that to interior decorators and fashion designers professions that architects regard with a mixture of disdain and envy Finally there is an unspoken fear of style because it is subject to the whims and the fancies of fashion That fear at least seems to me to be illfounded An architecture that recognizes styleand fashionwould not be an architecture that is introspective and selfreferential as are so many contemporary buildings It would be part of the worldnot architecture for architects but architecture for the rest of us And that would not be a bad thingCodaRichard Morris Hunt was the most celebrated American architect of the late nineteenth century His preeminence is reflected by his appointment as the architect of two important national works the centerpiece building of the Chicago Worlds Columbian Exposition and the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty He was feted at home and abroad Hunt was the first architect to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard and the first American to receive a Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects and he was made an honorary member of the French Acadmie and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor A hundred years later his counterpart is Frank O Gehry Since being awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize in  Gehry has gone on to win more honors than any other living architect including such major arts awards as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize a nonarchitectural award of which he is the first recipient and the Japanese Praemium Imperiale the Nobel of the art world Even the staid American Institute of Architects which had previously shunned Gehry in lieu of more mainstream practitioners awarded him its top accolade the AIA Gold MedalNo pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica Yet they bear comparison They were both late bloomers Gehry was  when he gained national recognition Until then he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years building shopping centers suburban offices department stores and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of LA modern The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood corrugated metal and chainlink fencing The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick That was in  Unexpectedly he attracted a broad range of commissions not only residential clients but also museums public institutions universities corporations and developers and not only in the United States but around the worldHunt was  when he came into his own He had established an architectural practice in New York in  almost immediately on his return from the Ecole des BeauxArts He was moderately successful achieving local renown for the Tribune Building an early New York skyscraper Despite his Parisian background Hunt worked in the prevalent Ruskinian Gothic style Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote The building is of Gothic design with very red brick and very irregular stone dressings which it must be confessed regretfully are not pleasing to the eye For his next project the Lenox Library Hunt tried something different He borrowed from the French NeoGrec style popularized by Labrouste in the Bibliothque Sainte Genevive adding Renaissance details and his own characteristically vigorous surface modeling The result was a startling departure from convention a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity The Lenox Library which stood on Fifth Avenue on the site of the presentday Frick Collection marked a shift in architectural taste away from Ruskin to a grand and frankly aesthetic Classicism The s was a decade of great prosperity and newly wealthy New Yorkers eagerly sought out Hunts architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display He obliged them in a string of highprofile commissions magnificent mansions along Fifth Avenue country houses on Long Island and palatial cottages in Newport Rhode Island Hunt died in  but in the last seven years of his life he completed more than fifty projectsBiltmore House in Asheville North Carolina is a good example of his stylistic prowess Hunt modeled the design of this room residence on the Chteau de Blois whose style is not the severe Classicism of the Italian Renaissance favored by architects such as Charles McKim but the more ornate and picturesque French Renaissance To a modern visitor the spires turrets and steep slate roofs of Biltmore recall Disneylands Sleeping Beauty Castle which is not surprising since Disney also used a Loire Valley chateauthe Chteau dUssas his model But the comparison does Hunt an injustice for his design is neither prettified nor quaint His client George W Vanderbilt was a young bachelor he married soon after the house was finished and for him Hunt created an architecture that is robust masculine and immensely selfassured not in the least like a fairytaleVanderbilt was drawn to French chateaux which Hunt showed him during a whirlwind European tour since young George and his wealthy family imagined themselves American aristocrats There are coats of arms bearing Vs all over the house Hunt provides his client with an imagined regal setting but deals with the past in his own peculiar way Although he modeled the building on Blois he makes no attempt to create a replica of the sixteenthcentury chateau but draws details from other buildings of the period and recombines them into an original whole Nor does he try to create the illusion that this is a sixteenthcentury buildingthere is no artificial weathering no aging effect no simulated historicism The interior is modern bright and open The focus of the main floor is a glassroofed conservatory a common nineteenthcentury feature The stonework of the house is impeccable much crisper and more sharply defined than at Blois Hunt was no antiquarian and modern American technology abounds The floors of fireproof hollow tile are supported by steel Ibeams and the steep slate roofs by steel roof trusses Cast iron replaces wrought iron and highquality bricks fired in the estate brickworks backup the limestone walls Equally novel are the elevators and telephones electrical lighting hot and cold running water and forced air central heating There is no doubt that for Hunt Biltmore is an uptotheminute modern building That is part of its style tooLike Hunt Frank Gehry enlists novel materials in his buildings The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao Spain for example is clad in titanium previously used chiefly for building aircraft The metallic walls curve twist and turn One part of the building slides under an adjoining bridge another emerges from a reflecting pool Bilbainos refer to the museum as the artichoke which comes close to describing it if you can imagine a gleaming metallic artichoke more than two hundred feet high The seeming disordera chaotic collision of formshas no architectural precedent This is not sculptural architecture it is walkin sculptureThe plan is the generator preached Le Corbusier but with Gehry the plan is the result He appears to design from the outside in The building as a composition comes first the interior spaces follow This implies that he shoehorns functions into the building which is not the case The Guggenheim has three distinct types of gallery spaces traditional skylit rooms for displaying its permanent collection of early Modernist art a long boatlike space for temporary installations and  smaller galleries each with its own character each dedicated to the works of a selected living artist The artichoke accommodates them all The building may appear offhanded but there is nothing haphazard about the way it is organizedGehrys talent is his exceptional formal imagination his skill as an architect is to reconcile the forms he imagines with the functional demands of his client And of course to find ways to build those forms This is generally done without fuss The titanium sheets simply follow the churning surfaces like shingles on a Shingle Style roof limestone is used in a similarly unaffected fashion without articulated joints Gehry shares a minimalist approach to details with the early architects of the International Style but he deploys these details to different ends By removing familiar elements such as coping strips fascias and trim he accentuates the sculptural quality of his buildings There are no roofs or walls or windows in the Guggenheim there are only swirling and twisting planes of metal stone and glass An architecture critic once described Gehry as a smart man from Hollywood which nicely captures the architects blend of exuberant showmanship and canny behindthescenes savvyAlthough sophisticated building techniques and innovative materials play a major role in Gehrys buildings like Hunt he keeps technology off center stage In that regard he repudiates the mannered industrial style that pervades the work of many contemporary architects Neither is he nostalgic about the past Gehry rejects both the moralistic functionalism of the International Style and the traditions of Classicism Architects have broken rules in the past but rarely this unequivocally and totallyGehry like Hunt has changed the course of architecture That is he has made us look at our surroundings in a different way The world of Gehrys buildings is at first glance an odd place The line between order and disorder is a thin one and it is difficult to know what is intended and what is accidental But his colliding forms and agitated architecture are curiously unthreatening This is the way we live today Gehry seems to be saying why not enjoy it
