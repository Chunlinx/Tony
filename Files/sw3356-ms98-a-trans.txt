        um we our subject is golf     and thats a good subject that i like to talk about   well good because i thought my goodness im im a definitely a beginner at golf     oh are you do you play   um i took lessons a couple of not last spring but spring before last and uh   umhum   i really enjoyed it and i had taken years ago and i never could see that what i was doing was causing that little ball to do anything and so um but when went i took this time you know it actually went up in the air and       and i i mean i could see that what i was doing made a difference and so um my husband and i uh took together he had played some   yeah uhhuh   already and then we started playing some and and we played in the summer a few times and then i teach and i dont have time to during the school year much but um   oh thats the way to do it yeah umhum right well you got weekends   well it just seems like it just is all a it really does and then uh and in the spring weve weve been lucky enough to go to several of those tournaments around here the uh   it takes a lot of time yeah it does   one at Las Colinas and uh the Byron Byron Nelson and ive loved watching so im im definitely a good spectator for not so much on TV but you know for live   uhhuh uhhuh umhum well i even i enjoy it on TV uh it once you get into it a little more youll enjoy it on TV also   well now you know actually i have occasionally occasionally watched a little of it and i never did ever before i took these lessons my my son uh plays golf and hes oh he loves to watch it on TV so i guess if you play a lot you   uhhuh uhhuh yes the more you get into it you youll really enjoy it on TV too i think or or everybody i know that does   right well how about well well what about you   yeah i play all the time well not all the time but i try to get in at least we play where theres a little course go down East Texas and we go down there a lot in Mount Vernon   where is that uhhuh   and uh   that is that very far   no its a hundred miles im originally from there and we go down nearly every weekend my folks live there so we have a place to stay and uh its its just so much fun when you got a regular group of your buddies you play with   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh sure   so thats what i do and the wife took it up about two or three years ago and shes shes enjoyed it a lot but its hard to get the girls to play you know   uhhuh it is   and uh so she doesnt really get to play you know enough enough not nearly enough although what she does she and ill play sometimes you know and and she enjoys it but   uhhuh uhhuh right   and she enjoys playing with the girls but heck most of the time theyre not all playing you know   uhhuh   and course ive got a group that i play with   uhhuh   so it makes it a little bit difficult there but we enjoy it its a lot of fun and uh one of the best parts about it once she took it up was when wed go on a little trip somewhere not long trips or anything but just little trips you know well it was always real good to  to take our clubs and she could we could play golf   oh i know i think thats thats great   whereas before i probably wouldnt even get to play you know and now she enjoys playing with me and and we you know it it just makes the trips more enjoyable for me   uhhuh sure   so uh   so uh how long have you been playing   oh ive been playing probably twenty years or longer i didnt start it nearly as young as i should have i think i was about   oh wow uhhuh   twenty uh i dont know i guess ive been playing longer than that since im fifty ive probably been playing uh twenty five years   uhhuh well um that i mean thats what they all say is that you know thats one of those things that you just cant start young enough   yeah uhhuh well you most  well you think youd be better if you started early im not so sure thats true i see   especially i guess if you you start early and you just get get good lessons and you do it right i guess and   yeah some some people that helps but then some people are just good at it and some are not   i i guess so it really is interesting   uh now now youre gonna improve and it helps to take lessons and and play a lot youre going definitely gonna get better but im talking about the difference from being a   so   uh mid nineties to low uh high i mean a low nineties to a mid eighties shooter which thats what i am to being a guy that shoots in the low seventies   uhhuh oh my well youre doing real well   that doesnt sound like a lot of difference but believe me its a lot of difference       it really is   well um uh did and so do you play around here some   i used to play around here all the time but i dont any more since we just i just play down there now   uhhuh where would you play here   uh my favorite courses around here are uh Fire Wheel   uhhuh   and uh i i like Chase Oaks real well but its kind of expensive   oh so is Fire Wheel not as expensive   no its a its a municipal course Garland owns it city of Garland owns and thats how   oh well i i  course have you ever played at Plano   oh yeah Planos a good course ive played there oh gosh ever since its been there many many times   well well is it competitive well weve played thats where weve played mostly weve played at Chase Oaks too but um   its an excellent golf course Chase Oaks is difficult you really need to be a good golfer to play Chase Oaks   oh horrors i mean we just lose jillions of balls and   yeah if youre not a really good golfer dont waste your time at at Chase Oaks yeah its too   thats discouraging isnt it
