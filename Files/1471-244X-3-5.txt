                    Background        Between  and  of new mothers experience postpartum        depression within the first six months of delivery            It is a significant mood disorder that affects the        wellbeing of both the mother and her infant Depressed        mothers have been found to display negative behaviors        towards their infants which have been shown to adversely        affect the child during infancy and in later childhood             A more minor and transient condition known as        postpartum blues has a much higher incidence affecting         to  of new mothers     Its symptoms which include        weeping sadness irritability anxiety and confusion        often resolve by the second week of delivery     but        can still have a negative impact on postpartum mothers in        the precarious days following birth        There has been much speculation on possible causes for        mood alterations in the postpartum period Most research        has focused on hormonal changes previous history of        psychiatric disorders and social milieu as main risk        factors for postpartum depression Low postpartum estrogen        levels as well as increased peripartum testosterone levels        have been associated with increased depressive and anger        symptoms      Even lower levels of cholesterol have        been linked with symptoms of anxiety anger hostility and        depression in the postpartum period     As the        diversity of implicated risk factors suggests postpartum        mood disorders like many psychiatric entities most likely        have a multifactorial etiology which has not been well        delineated        Consequently effective therapy has been difficult to        define especially with the added complication of treatment        effects on the infant for nursing mothers So far the        mainstay of treatment for postpartum depression has rested        with oral antidepressants specifically the SSRIs This        option has frequently generated concern over the potential        effects of exposure to the infant through breastmilk        Thus there has been the drive to search for alternative        methods of treating postpartum mood disorders that minimize        the risk of infant exposure through breastfeeding Parry        et al demonstrated the beneficial effect latenight sleep        deprivation had on women who had met the DSMIV criteria        for major depressive disorder with onset within one year        postpartum     The efficacy of interpersonal        psychotherapy was demonstrated by OHara et al            Grigoriadis et al reviewed the role of estrogen in        treating reproductiverelated mood disorders            Exercise stressreduction techniques St Johns Wort and        acupuncture have been suggested as potential therapies        without definitive evidence for significant benefit            In  Corral et al reported cases of two postpartum        women suffering from a major depressive episode with        postpartum onset who each experienced a  reduction in        their Hamilton depression scale scores after four weeks of        morning bright light therapy via a lux light box                   Low levels of illumination at dawn or dusk are commonly        thought to be associated with seasonal affective disorder        popularizing the concept of light therapy Research in the        past two decades has demonstrated the usefulness of light        therapy in other forms of depression In a review by Kripke        in  light therapy was presented as significantly        expediting and improving the symptoms of nonseasonal        depression both when used alone and in combination with        other forms of antidepressant treatment     When        combined with antidepressant medications two European        studies from  and  demonstrated that bright light        therapy added a relative advantage of        In        another study by Neumeister et al in  light therapy        decreased symptoms by as much as  compared with placebo        when combined with antidepressant medication and latenight        sleep deprivation     These effects surpass that        demonstrated by antidepressant drugs alone over placebo        which recent metaanalyses have described as improving        symptoms by  to        Bright white light        therapy has been shown to significantly reduce depression        and premenstrual symptoms in women with late luteal phase        dysphoric disorder during their menstrual cycles              The lower cost shorter duration of treatment and lack        of overt transmission through breastmilk relative to        extensive interpersonal psychotherapy or antidepressant        pharmacotherapy makes light therapy a potentially viable        and appealing alternative treatment for postpartum mood        disorders        Espiritu et al showed that low levels of light exposure        were not necessarily reserved for patients already        diagnosed with a depressive disorder     Their survey        of randomly selected middleaged adults in San Diego        California revealed that it was common for a resident of        this sunny climate to only be exposed to illumination        levels greater than  lux for a mere average  minutes        per day     Subjects who spent less time in bright        illumination were also found to have scored higher on        atypical seasonal affective disorder mood questionnaire        items     Their results suggested that many Americans        in general may not be receiving sufficient light exposure        to maintain optimal mood            Likewise it is plausible that postpartum adult women        have an additional reason to be subject to less than        optimal levels of light This study examines the levels of        illumination experienced by postpartum mothers in their        ordinary daily routine and explores the nature of the        relationship between their light exposure levels and any        abnormal mood symptoms experienced during the postpartum        period We hypothesized that postpartum mothers who were        within one year since giving birth experience lower levels        of illumination than the average adult woman in San Diego        and that this may be due to more time spent indoors caring        for a new infant We also hypothesized that the more        depressive mood symptoms in these mothers are correlated        with decreasing levels of illumination                    Methods                  Recruitment          Subjects were recruited from a general outpatient          pediatric clinic at the Perlman Ambulatory Center of the          UCSD Medical Center La Jolla during July and August of           This clinic serves a population from the middle and          uppermiddle class suburbs of San Diego County Subjects          targeted were women who had brought infants under one          year of age for routine wellbaby examinations The          definition of postpartum as within one year of delivery          was implemented to expand the potential sample pool          Referrals came from the practices of four primary care          pediatricians at the clinic If interest was confirmed          the mother signed an Institutional Review Boardapproved          consent and was sent home with the necessary materials to          complete the study for the next three days A total of          fifteen women were eventually recruited for the          study                          Data Collection          Each subject was instructed to wear an Actillume wrist          device for  consecutive hours whether weekday or          weekend to record her daily exposure to light Light          recorded from the wrist is highly correlated with          measurements taken from the forehead above the eyes                       The women were encouraged to wear the Actillume at all          times with the exception of bathing and to carry on with          her normal daily activities during the recording period          At the end of the three days of light recording one of          the authors EW visited the mother at her home to          retrieve the Actillume and administered a written          onepage screening mood questionnaire to rate her mood          levels during the recording period      The          questionnaire asked the subject to rate the frequency she          experienced depressed feelings restless sleep enjoyment          of life crying spells sadness and dislike by others          during the past week Two additional questions asked if          the subject had ever experienced depressive symptoms for          two or more weeks in the past year and if she had ever          experienced two or more years of dysthymic mood in her          life                          Data Analysis          The Actillume Ambulatory Monitoring Inc Ardsley          NY is a tiny wrist monitor containing a photometer and a          linear accelerometer that measures activity Recordings          of light exposure and activity level were made every          minute twentyfour hours a day and stored inside the          computer memory A cosinefitting function was used to          convert the daily  hour data of lux measurements into          mesors means of fitted cosines of log            lux which correct for biases due          to the time of day that sampling began for each subject          and for missing data For example if some subjects          removed the recorder for bathing in the morning and          others bathed at night the simple means would be biased          by the time when the recorder was removed for bathing          but the cosinefitting would tend to correct partly for          the timeofday missing data The logarithmic transform          was used both because the biological response may be          approximately related to the logarithm of illumination          intensity and because the distribution of lux          measurements was highly skewed both within subjects and          between subjects Comparison was made by a ttest to see          if there was any significant difference in illumination          between postpartum women and the control sample          The control sample consisted of  women between the          ages of  and  mean age  SD  selected by          random telephone dialing who also had light exposure and          activity levels recorded with the Actillume in a manner          similar to the postpartum sample These recordings          occurred during the months of July and August between the          years  and  No effect of age or neighborhood on          amount of light exposure was found in this sample          providing an appropriate group to compare data with that          of the postpartum women Mood symptoms were not surveyed          in this group          Mood level ratings were plotted against each subjects          mean illumination level and the relationship between          light exposure and depressive symptoms among all subjects          was tested for correlation using the Spearman rankorder          test                            Results        Fifteen women between the ages of  and  and who        were between  and  weeks postpartum were recruited        mean age   SD  All of the women completed the        study One mother reported herself to be an adoptive rather        than biological mother of her child this woman was the        primary caregiver of the infant since birth and was not        excluded Ten out of the  mothers were under  weeks        postpartum median   weeks mean  SD  None of        the subjects had reported a previous diagnosis of        postpartum depression Four mothers reported a previous        history of crying spells not going out or depressed        mood after the birth of a previous but not the current        child None of the subjects specifically reported symptoms        consistent with a major depressive episode        From the sample of  control women the mean log          lux of light exposure for the group        as a whole was  SD  with a range of  to         Figure         From the sample of the fifteen postpartum women who        participated in the study the mean log          lux of light exposure for the group        as a whole was  SD  with a range of  to         Figure         There was no significant difference between the overall        mean illumination levels of postpartum women compared to        control women t   p   There was  power to        distinguish the mean log          lux of the control group from a        mean of  or less among postpartum women onetailed        ttest alpha   Of the fifteen postpartum women        sampled six experienced individual light exposure levels        that were lower than the mean level of  experienced by        control women        The postpartum samples mean mood score was  out of a        possible  A higher score implicated lower mood levels        The highest score was an   out of  women scored higher        than a  which is a screening criterion for depression        Lower mood levels were not correlated with decreasing        levels of mean light exposure in the postpartum sample        Figure  Rather the plot suggests a trend of higher        illumination correlating with lower mood levels but this        was not significant r   NS                    Discussion        In this postpartum sample the responsibilities and        lifestyle changes of caring for a new infant did not affect        the mothers normal propensity to expose herself to light        whether outdoors in areas of her home that receive natural        light through windows or under artificial lighting of an        indoor environment        The observations are limited to the environment studied        Specifically the light recordings took place during the        summer months of July and August in San Diego California        The climate especially during this time is predominantly        sunny with mild temperatures average  degrees        Centigrade providing an environment conducive to going        outdoors or opening the windows even with a new infant in        the home Under this environment the average postpartum        mother who does not have other reasons to avoid light is        able to carry on her daily activities including the care        of her infant without sacrificing her exposure to light        that regulates circadian rhythms responsible for many        normal biological functions Under a different environment        such as in communities of more extreme climate new factors        might be introduced that are sufficiently sensitive to the        infant to keep the mother away from natural light more        than it would if she did not have infant care        responsibilities        These results should not be interpreted to mean that        postpartum women receive optimal amounts of light exposure        In the study of light exposure experienced by San Diego        adults between the ages of  and  by Espiritu et al in         of which  of the sample were women the median        adult only spent  of his time in light that was greater        than  lux     a level that is akin to the light        found outdoors in the shade Full unobstructed sunlight        would be at least  lux and greater Although the        proportions of time that postpartum women spent in specific        levels of light were not analyzed here a mean exposure        level of  log          lux which equates to  lux would        not suggest that postpartum women spent a large proportion        of their day exposed to levels greater than  lux        either Plots of each subjects data also confirmed that        times when the mother was exposed to greater than  lux        were few and mostly during midday According to Espiritu        et al these illumination levels are well below the        representation of the outdoor photoperiod and it was in a        portion of those subjects who spent less time exposed to         lux who reported substantial depressive symptoms            Additionally these levels are well below that shown to        be of beneficial effect in bright light therapy            The postpartum sample in this study as a group was not any        better at obtaining optimal amounts of light however        postpartum status did not make it any worse        The demonstration that lower mood levels in the        postpartum sample did not correlate with lower light can be        attributed to several factors The health of this group was        generally good No woman was in the study sample who met        DSMIV criteria for major depression as determined by the        mood questionnaire although they were not excluded A few        women reported prior symptoms representative of maternity        blues but they did not experience these symptoms during        the study A summertime effect of the lack of postpartum        mood symptoms is possible but additional research is        needed to investigate the significance of seasonal        variation in postpartum mood symptoms Given their overall        low mean mood score the sample in this study might not be        truly representative of all postpartum mothers and        certainly did not include those with serious postpartum        depression        Postpartum mood alterations similar to mood changes        that occur in other contexts most likely have a        multifactorial etiology This phenomenon is especially        probable during a time when many other rapid changes are        occurring for the mother physiologically and socially It        is not likely that reduced light exposure alone could        explain why a postpartum mother develops the blues or more        serious depression In light of the observations that many        affective disorders can be explained by phaseshifts in        circadian rhythms that are correctable by light therapy            women with postpartum depression may benefit from        criticallytimed bright light regardless of their baseline        level of light exposure Circadian rhythms in postpartum        women are likely to suffer disturbances secondary to        significant changes in estrogen and progesterone which        have been shown to advance and delay rhythms respectively            and it is plausible that bright light can help        alleviate this More investigation is needed in the area of        light exposure or light therapy in those women who are        concurrently experiencing depressive symptoms or have a        history of psychiatric illness                    Conclusions        Postpartum women in San Diego were not exposed to        reduced light compared with nonpostpartum control women        nor was low mood correlated with low light Given the        studys limitations the results do not dismiss the ideas        that low levels of light could be a factor associated with        postpartum affective disorders or that bright light        therapy might be a beneficial treatment option
