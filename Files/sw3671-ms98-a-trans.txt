        what kind of a house do you live in is it typical of the area     the uh house i live in is fairly typical of the area its one that uh my wife and i designed ourselves   how neat   and weve been living in it now for thirty years so it must be okay     oh we moved into our home about thirty three years ago and at the time it was a small ranch style it had two bedrooms on the main floor and then the basement wasnt finished but we have since finished the basement weve added a car port and weve added a big family room   well in Texas we dont have basements very often im surprised you do in Utah   oh most most i would think most of the homes in Utah do we live uh up against up by the mountains   so its cold   yes we got about uh three inches of snow last night the snow plows have been out and my husbands been out shoveling the snow   ah   so uh but ours is is typical for the neighborhood but   it is it airconditioned   no i have arthritis   so youre cool enough you dont need the airconditioning   no in the summer time for about oh a month we could use airconditioning but i have arthritis and i dont i dont like airconditioning   uh   but we   well in Texas you cant hardly live without it   i know ive been to my sons in August and i hated it           yeah we designed our house so the western exposure has a minimum number of windows so that the airconditioning bill will be cheaper   uhhuh oh we had uh we have had six children and so our house was small to start with but uh we added three basement three bedrooms in the basement and like i say added on to it so uh its pretty typical did you have help designing it or was that part of what you do   no actually uh it we we just started and we didnt like any of the houses we saw uh built they tended to have at the time we were building very large uh bathrooms which i consider a waste of space since you spend so little time in the bathroom   uhhuh   and uh also too much hall uh space we saw a home plan in Better Homes and Gardens about five years before we built this house that we liked except uh we wanted it a little bigger than uh uh it had two bedrooms that you could add on another bedroom   uhhuh   and we wanted it arranged slightly differently i think if you looked at the floor plan now uh you probably wouldnt recognize where we started from     thats kind of the way ours is too   but uh my wife likes a lot of cabinets in the kitchen and the original architect tried to talk us out of that and thank goodness we didnt let him talk us out of that   umhum uhhuh   and uh we wanted an entry way so that the living room did not have to be walked through   uhhuh   the previous place we had lived in you always walked through the living room to get any place in the house and it was a traffic flow problem all the time   uhhuh uhhuh   so we have an entry way and i uh spend quite a little time in uh both when i was working and also even now retired in the study where i have a computer so we wanted a separate study and we have that   umhum   and it has uh three bedrooms and we wanted it since our son we raised my wifes sister as our daughter so in effect we had two children but uh   uhhuh   we wanted it so that we could leave the house to them uh when they had friends over and the normal noise that goes with such things so we have the   right   master bedroom is arranged so that it is basically basically a separate apartment in itself it has its own bath has its own patio porch type thing sliding doors and a very large room with   uhhuh   a TV set so you could live back there by itself if you wanted to uh   uhhuh uh that sounds lovely ive always wanted uh another bedroom upstairs and then i weve never had a bathroom off the master bedroom and i would like that   oh thats i dont know uh with our previous house didnt have it and uh now that weve got it we we think we couldnt live without it you know   yes       well those are two things that i would definitely i would add another bedroom on the main floor i quilt a lot but   yeah my wife does also   oh does she   yeah and now with the kids gone well she has a room reserved for her junk and i have one for my junk you know   well that would be the way to go   yeah   uh but like i say our children live a long way away and so our family room i quilt in there a lot   umhum   its big enough that uh we it was eighteen by twenty when we added it on   right   so uh its big enough for that but
