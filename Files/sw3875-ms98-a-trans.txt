use lures and   yeah   uh all kinds of different things i havent had a chance to go out fishing much here but i use to do a lot of fishing out in California   well i lived in Washington State for a while do you know do you know where Seattle is well its about thirty miles outside of Seattle there is a place called Westport   uhhuh oh yeah uhhuh   and it use to be the salmon capitol of the world and when i lived   wow they did a lot of salmon fishing up there then   yeah when i lived there i use to go deep sea fishing with my dad all the time and it was really it was really neat but when i went back to Arizona because that is where i am from well when i went back there to be with my mom   uhhuh uhhuh   it was like a totally different kind of fishing i was like ah what do i do   yeah it is and uh the bait that they use is uh is totally different in California than it is here in Texas and uh   yeah   um you know we uh use to use live bait in in California and they do use some live bait here but not a not uh whole lot not like you know you use to use in California and uh   yeah i havent i havent been fishing since ive been to California because i have been having my kids and   yeah how many kids do you have   two   two   two little boys   two little boys   ones three and ones one   wow you got two little ones then huh well i have got four i have got a twelve year old an eleven and uh   yeah   six and a three   sounds like fun     so   im stopping at two   you are oh     yes i only want to have to teach two of them how to fish i dont want to have to teach four   thats true       oh thats we use to have a lot of fun when i was actually my my two boys were born here in Texas but uh my two girls i use to take them with me when when uh we would go fishing you know and my wife and i use to like fishing off the pier and stuff and wed catch uh shoot one time she she caught a couple of sharks off the pier   oh   and uh you know we caught uh what do you call uh those flat things and we you know wed get crab and stuff off the pier and and uh   yeah   thats thats stuff that we that we miss being here in Texas we dont have much of a chance to get out to the coast and and uh   yeah its amazing how few women actually fish   yeah my wife loved to fish she didnt like to uh she doesnt like to put the bait on but       you know that was my job i just put the bait on and shed catch the fish  in fact we use to go out and and this was not really that funny at the time but   yeah     its funny now you know id we would get two poles   uhhuh   and i would you know i hook hers up she would be out there and i havent uh i i wouldnt even be able to tie my hook on shed catch a fish and she would yell at me to come and take the fish off so id take it off and walk back and put my hook on shed call again to get the fish off her hook       i mean it went like that for a whole hour   yeah my husband gets kind of upset because him and i have an agreement       i ill bait my own hook and ill catch the fish but hes the one cleaning them because i wont clean them thats the only thing i will not do   uhhuh uhhuh     and uh he gets really disgusted because he he says i i talk to the fish i dont talk to the fish they just jump on my hook   youd talk to the fish   thats what he says because im really lucky at catching them   uhhuh   no matter what kind of fishing we are doing i i seem to have really good luck and its like i dont talk to um and they just jump on my hook i dont know   yeah well uh thats my wife yeah thats my wife uh every time we go fishing shes the one that catches them and im the one that takes them off and baits the hook and  then it goes all over again so   yeah my mom got remarried and she got remarried to uh a commercial fisherman   oh is that right   and he was like women dont know how to fish and da da da da so him and i went out fishing one day   uhhuh   and i and he goes do you need me to bait your hook and i said no i can handle it   uhhuh   and so i baited my hook and by the time we left i had six and he had none he goes   oh my heck   he goes he goes tell you what why dont you do my job for a while       i said no thanks cause i dont clean them   oh thats funny   so he cleaned them all and i gave him and my mom four of them and i just took two of them   uhhuh   but he was just so disgusted because he had never seen anybody that had that good of luck   now do you like eating uh eating fish   oh yeah i love fish   is that right   i i grew up in Arizona so i guess thats why because   uhhuh
