        how do you get most of your news     well thats a a good question um i read the newspaper obviously and and watch TV and uh   what are your favorites on TV for for news programs   uh we have one here at at at six oclock in the evening to seven where we have local news  followed by uh and i i i cant name the  CBS i guess it is   umhum   who is who is the gentleman that uh MCs that program   uh  thats terrible i know i should know these but is Dan Rather C B S   yeah i think in fact i think its Dan Rather yeah i i i have uh been just retired recently so i have had very little time really to watch TV and uh to get the news so all of my time that was available was between about six and seven uh obviously i scan the newspaper   uhhuh umhum   and um i think   are you one of those people that tends to like to go through the paper first thing in the morning over coffee or breakfast or something or do you tend to like to read at the end of the day   no i get mine at the end of the day   yes thats the way i am     i at least i used to and now im beginning to read it about noon  since i just retired i i retired from Penn State and i just uh now i have some morning time available   oh thats nice   and it used to be that we got our newspapers in the evening which i liked because thats when i could read it and i felt like it was fresh   umhum right   and for the last two or three years our newspapers have been coming early in the morning and its been six or seven oclock at night before i got to read it   yeah   and i had already heard all kinds of conflicting things during the day before i read a newspaper   oh really   sometimes it feels as though what im reading in the newspaper is the old news its as if i heard it just the day before on the television and i wonder where they get a lot of their stories but i think that   yes   the one that im i feel like i get the most information from is is uh McNeil Lehrer and sometimes its on in the afternoon if im if im home but i work most the time so um   uh uhhuh   the program in San Francisco is on from six to seven which is ideal because   well thats my normal time six to seven for here   yes youre preparing dinner but you still have an opportunity to to look at it occasionally we have a little two year old so theres not a lot of time to for me i feel to spend as much time with the   umhum   updates as id like to i think i probably get more of it from Lee because he works out of our home and um can give me information about what mightve happened that day if he watched the afternoon McNeill Lehrer   how do you feel about the authenticity of these various uh methods of presenting of representing the news   it it seems to me that McNeil Lehrer spends more time with each issue therefore i can count on it being more accurate uh because theyve really spent more development of the story as well as research and and i get a better picture of what it is that im hearing about i i wonder about the authenticity of the others um i i have a feeling they get a lot from UPI and AP and maybe they count on what they get from those reporters and just give little spots to it and   yes  i always wonder about the accuracy of their source of information thats what bothers me particularly you know when were had this business of the of the war over there in Europe i mean i always wondered about   umhum umhum   it that they based what they said on whoever told them well whoever told them might not necessarily have the accurate news and know of the overall know the overall   right and certainly in that situation there was an effort to exclude the press from some activities because they didnt want to have a lot of political fall out i think but there was probably   story yeah   some repetition of of stories that didnt have complete um confirmation i wondered that about the whole Clinton thing recently um you know something coming out in the tabloids and being picked up by a major media uh one of the accusations obviously is that they didnt go down there and research it and and get enough information i dont have a preference or an opinion really on that story one way or the other but its uh   umhum   its clear that theres a lot of controversy about it   well then the the only thing that you can be sure of the uh has gotten it straight from the horse so to speak is did you hear uh President Bushs speech the other night      yes   well at least we know what he said     this is true   and we we dont have to to uh read in the newspaper what they think he said or what the Democrats think he said we know what we heard him say      uhhuh uhhuh  but it is always interesting to hear the follow ups you know on any kind of major presentation you always get the analysis   yes thats when you find out of all the disturbances that are in the background that know one else knows about thats the problem when youre in a politics     uhhuh   theres always somebody working behind your back and who just doesnt want you to get your way simply because youre on the other team well thats ridiculous really   well they all have their perceptions too you know they may have heard the exact same thing and thats just their   yeah yep
