Investor First Team All America analystnokiddingfive different times Kurlak is simply an extreme example of WallStreets new reality which is that no one has as much influence as the peoplewho supposedly know where a companys stock price is going to go            Securities analysts were relatively unimportant on WallStreet before the s but their rise to power has not been sudden As earlyas  when the stock market wallowed in the doldrums Wall Street chroniclerRobert Sobel observed that a successful analyst could become something of acelebrity called by New York Times and Wall Street Journalreporters  invited to seminars in resort areas and asked to submit articlesto trade and related publications By  when the bull market was justbeginning analysts were being called minigods and by the late s topanalysts were pulling down salaries in the high six figures although they werestill a long way from the Masters of the Universe terrain then reserved forbond traders and deal makers            Over the past few yearsthough the dramatic upsurge in money pouring into the market and the resultantpressure on institutional investors to improve their performance have sharplyincreased the value of anyone with a clue about whats going to happen to thepharmaceutical industryor to chemicals or to semiconductors At the sametime growth in the market for financial news has made analysts public figuresDaily newswires are filled with announcements of upgrades and downgrades frombrokerage houses while marketwrap articles often cite analysts reports notas commentary but as news in their own right            Finallyand perhaps most importantly the sharp expansion in the market for initialpublic offerings and secondary stock offerings has made it essential thatbrokerage houses have analysts who are well respected in their fieldCorporations sensibly enough do not want their stock offerings underwrittenby houses whose recommendations will carry little weight with investors            In  Wall Street firms took home nearly billion from underwriting IPOs which means that winning or losing two or threebig deals can be the difference between a great year and a bad one And thathas meant that analysts are now often valued as much for their rainmakingabilities as for their predictive expertise Top analysts now spend far moretime on the road trying to drum up business while much more of the actualanalytical work is being done by junior analysts back at the office Notsurprisingly since analysts are now crucial figures in the underwritingbusiness their compensation has tripled over the last three or four yearsAccording to Institutional Investor  top analysts who follow hot sectorsmake well over  million a year while most senior analysts bring home morethan half a million dollars Though analysts are still not as highly paid asinvestment bankers the gap is much narrower than it was in the earlys            As aresult the vaunted Chinese Wall between the underwriting and researchdepartments of Wall Street houses has become a fiction While theres noevidence that direct pressure is brought to bear on analysts to paint rosypictures of a companys prospects corporations expect whats calledaftermarket support from their underwriters This is a polite way of sayingthat they dont want to be hung out to dry by a neutral or sellrecommendation two months after they go public            Some conflict has always been inherent in the analystsrole Houses that are bearish are not houses that get a lot of underwritingbusiness And issuing a sell recommendation has a way of making a companysmanagement unfriendly which in turn may limit an analysts access toinformation in the future Its perhaps not surprising then that a recentstudy showed that analysts issue buy recommendations seven times as often assell recommendations            We are ofcourse in a bull market which means that analysts should have beenrecommending that clients buy more often than they sell Even so analystsrecommendations have manifested the Wall Street equivalent of grade inflationNeutral is generally understood to mean sell outperform to mean yourcall and accumulate to mean you might want to buy it if you have extramoney lying around I think buy still means buy but then some houses usestrong buy so who knows            This has had paradoxical consequences Even asanalysts have become more able to move stock prices their morecorporatecongenial language has probably diminished the longrangeimpact of their recommendationswith so many outperforms and accumulatesout there its hard to know which ones to take seriously In the shortterm  however the effect has been to increase price volatility especiallywhen analysts issue strong buy or sell recommendations Knowing thatanalysts can now move the market speculators jump in and out When Kurlak cutshis rating on Intel what matters is not that hes right or wrong about Intelsprospects but that his cut in the rating will drop the stock regardless            Why should this concernanyone outside Wall Street The first reason is that analysts are essentiallyunaccountable for their recommendations No one says We cant quote this guyHes been wrong four out of five times on this stock So their ability to movestock priceswhich in theory encourage efficient capital allocationistroubling The second more important answer is that analysts are crucialcontributors to shortterm thinking Their issuing of shortterm buy orshortterm hold recommendations obviously intensifies pressure on companiesto meet and beat earnings expectations at all costs When you couple thatreality with an overly narrow definition of shareholder value you end upwith a corporate world that must privilege the next quarter over the nextdecade Which somehow doesnt seem to be the best way to prepare for the nextdecade
