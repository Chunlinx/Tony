                                 Hong Kong                         The champagne has been drunkand the fireworks exploded Now Hong Kongs real test as a specialadministrative region of China begins            Politically the faade of the old colonial government structurea strongexecutive a weak legislature and an efficient but politically neutral civilservicewill continue Economically the stock market and property booms willcontinue in the short term if money still flows in from the mainland andelsewhere The road ahead though is bumpy Hong Kong needs to control risingcosts and create jobs quickly for a large number of unskilled immigrants            More clues about post Hong Kong will become evident atthe  th Congress of the Communist Party of China this autumn Ifthe Chinese leadership under President Jiang Zemin emerges moreconfident of its power this will give Hong Kong more leeway to run its ownaffairs If not the territorys autonomy will suffer More than ever HongKongs fate will be intertwined with that of China because the buffer providedby the United Kingdom for  years has been removed            Somerollback of democracy is inevitable as Beijing will not tolerate anindependent legislature run by outspoken lawyers and longtime humanrightsactivists like those in the last Legislative Council Legco elected in That is the main reason Beijing disbanded the  council and formed thesocalled provisional Legco which is dominated by appointed proChinapoliticians            Beijing has already ensured that it will havethe final say in important matters by appointing those with proven loyalty totop administrative positions Next it wants to make sure that it can influencethe outcome of the Legislative Council election promised by May  It coulddo so by arranging voters into small industrybased electoral groups Thiswould amount to a de facto shrinking of the franchise However it would bejustified internationally as being akin to the electoral system that existed inHong Kong prior to the democratic reforms introduced by the territorys lastBritish governor Chris Patten in the face of Chinese objections            Beijingwill further sideline independentminded politicians such as Democratic Partyleader Martin Lee and opposition activist Szeto Wah The danger is that thevoice of lowerincome groups will not be heard in a government machinerydominated by big business and mainland elites but Beijing will calculate thatthe historically shallow roots of popular political movements in Hong Kong willlimit the magnitude of this risk            Overall Hong Kong will still enjoy more politicalautonomy than the average Chinese city There will be open public debateof issues as well as civil disobedience by political activists ChiefExecutive Tung Cheehwa will also be able to negotiate with Beijing for adegree of administrative leeway unthinkable for his counterparts on themainland            Thejudiciary  run by respected judges should be able to remainindependent except when it is handling highly sensitive politicized cases inwhich Beijings central authority is at stake For the press there will beselfcensorship but heavyhanded interference from Beijing seems unlikely            One important check against any abuse of powerby Beijing toward Hong Kong is international attention Western countries haveurged China to conduct fair competitive elections next year There will alsobe annual reviews of Hong Kongs political and humanrights situation in theUK Parliament the US Congress the United Nations and other internationalforums            Forbusiness Hong Kong is still a good place to make money  an increasingamount of which will come from China The territorys gross domestic product isexpected to grow by

year  percent more than in  Part of thetorrent has moved into the local property market raising prices by as much as percent for prime residential blocks in the first half of this year            Tung has vowed to crack down on propertyspeculators  but many think his bark will be worse than his bite Thegovernment itself relies on revenue from land sales to finance its budgetwhile banks are too heavily exposed in property lending to allow any propertydownturn Still Tung is likely to impose some shortterm measures such as acapital gains tax to show that he is serious about tackling Hong Kongshousing shortage  which is its most visible economic problem In hisfirst policy speech following the handover Tung promised to accelerategovernment land sales with the ambitious aim of raising the proportion ofhomeowners to  percent within  years            Hong Kongs longtermprospects are mixed  Critics say the territory has not invested enough intechnology and developing human resources to meet the needs of its increasinglyservicebased economy Instead capital has gone to property investmentinflating asset prices and making the city the most expensive in the world Theissue will become more pressing as an estimated  to  Chinesemostly unskilled come to settle each year Others say Hong Kong has enoughvitality to adjust itself to the needs of the future and that the governmentdoes not need to intervene Tung however has indicated that he wishes tosupport manufacturing even though the sector accounts for a mere  percent to percent of the citys GDP depending on what definition is used Tungsfirst salvo as the territorys leader is likely to include the introduction ofpolicies to help develop longterm hightech industries a special challengein a place where shortterm financial
