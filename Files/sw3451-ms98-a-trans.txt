        okay       uh do you have young children   uhhuh i have got two one is uh two and the other ones four and um this is my first year of staying home ive always had them in child care   oh well then you are familiar with it   uhhuh   okay i uh i have grandchildren and i know uh one has gone to a well two of them have gone to preschool and i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that why dont you tell me what you have found   uhhuh well um it was our second sitter the first one didnt quite work out um there were some things going on that i wasnt really happy with and so i felt that that i need to move on with them and so i found another babysitter and she was wonderful except i thought that there were too many in the home and it just seemed like it was so hard to find uh really good child care she was wonderful its just that i felt that there were too many in the home it was in home child care   okay so you okay so it was in home child care you took them to someones home   uhhuh all right   well both times   uhhuh right   umhum   and um and then i worked in in a child care centers and i wasnt really happy with the particular one that i was working in so i just always had a fear about you know child care centers so thats why i put him in a in a in home day care   oh uhhuh   umhum  and then i just decided that i was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little and and i couldnt get off of work as often as i wanted to when they were ill so i just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more uh independent and uh i could go back to work   i know that in raising my children uh   hm   i was fortunate i didnt have to work we didnt necessarily have a lot of things  but uh i didnt and know my daughter because she has three and   yeah  thats how its going now   to have three in day care you know even though one of thems in school full time one of thems you know in kindergarten   uhhuh   that is a lot of money i mean its so expensive you have to really make a lot of money and im glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with whats going on in their life   oh yeah yeah yeah   uh bosses dont always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something and   oh no yeah   you know and i know that one of the day cares and its a a wellknown chain um she was not at all happy with it because was there was too many children per person they were just kind of left to play there was no structure to it and the middle grandson went there as a uh like a preschool thing she was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of of learning and training and stuff not just there you know so he went like uh   umhum umhum umhum   i think he went well five mornings a week if i remember correctly and um   wow   you know and it was supposed to be a basic you know starting to learn the colors and and learning to associate with children so that when he went to you know a school   umhum umhum   and stuff and uh she was most unhappy with it  there was no structure there was nothing to it  you know and uh she pulled him out of that one and put him in a another one that was excellent it was it was like a little kindergarten   hm umhum   and uh uh they had hot lunches and and they had classes that you know one class theyd do art they even familiarized the children with computers uh it was just it was really a very excellent one   oh uhhuh and how old is he   hes now five and a half hes in kindergarten this was last year   oh uhhuh   and uh so you know it helped him and and the first one uh he went to a uh church preschool that was very good the Methodist Church in Richardson the big one and it was a excellent they very good it   uhhuh umhum oh yes my little boy goes to the Methodist um in Garland umhum im real happy with that one   oh does he yeah they uh the church ones church ones seem to be very well run   i well ive ive heard that the Methodist ones are excellent even uhhuh   oh really   even the  even their Mothers Day Out programs i heard are really good   oh i had uh i just assumed that most churches going by you know experience there that you know that they were good i i didnt know that uh   yeah uhhuh   you know im not that familiar i just know that you know First United Methodist there at Richardson was just a great program   uhhuh yeah because this is First United Methodist in Garland that he goes to and im real happy with that   umhum yeah its a pretty good size church too isnt it   uhhuh   umhum   yeah well that a claim   so well are you enjoying staying home   yes i am  uh i taught for Richardson School District     oh uhhuh   and uh i taught early childhood and uh i really enjoyed it but it was just it was taking a lot of my time and i noticed i was spending less and less time with them and it just seemed like they were sick more often and i just couldnt get the time off to   umhum   so   well isnt it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children and have enthusiasm   yeah it is it really is yeah it really is and i felt
