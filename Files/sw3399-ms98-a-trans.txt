                uh well i guess social change takes in a a big category but uh i guess the the one aspect of it that i took in uh consideration uh is more economical   hm   i i know that the the amount of or or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has has greatly changed   yeah i agree   i know they they did a it was on a talk show uh they took uh uh the parents and then the uh the son and they compared income at different points in time when the when the father was you know was a little bit younger and more in his heyday and they and they compared to the sons that he was making now   umhum   and even though the son was probably more successful you know higher up in the the management ladder uh his he was actually making less money   right   and when you costs when you go by a costs of living   right umhum i guess depending on where you live though too   yeah i know just uh just with me ten years ago i i was comparing uh i think i i was living better ten years ago than i am now even though im making more money now but my dollar went a lot farther   yeah true uh ten years ago i was eleven so um i remember though like buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now and gas and i used to hear stories from my Grandpa and   yeah   you know he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that   yeah well i i know gas prices have definitely jumped uh from uh i know i used to pay twenty five cents a gallon and now its over a buck i dont know what its uh by you and around here Minnesota Wisconsin area its   yeah   uh its dropping but i think its about a dollar fifteen on an average   yeah im from Wisconsin yeah its about um yeah   okay yeah well thats uh thats unusual most of the people i talk to are Texas so   oh yeah i spoke to a person from Texas too   yeah   this is only my second phone call so im  just waiting for more   oh i suppose this will be one of my towards my last one pretty soon im sure theyll stop me but uh im uh im pretty much out of things say to say   oh about like social changes   yeah   hum um i i dont think this would have anything to do with it but like clothing and styles lot of those changed   okay yeah i i i dont think they they consider       like i said its a broad category its just uh not economical but yeah   yeah   uh even attitudes   umhum definitely   on on clothing and stuff uh i know   towards each other   yeah i i i know a lot of the things that that we wear men wear now a days were wouldve been considered uh feminine uh many years ago   umhum yeah   but the uh i know its been it was hard for me at first but now i kind of like you know a lot of the bright colors   yeah   i mean like i think i used to be more uh conservative and just your basic colors but now i i do like some of these uh brighter fluorescent colors   yeah but they styles come and go all the time though its just ridiculous fads in and out and even um clothing from the sixties came back i see a lot of um girls wearing sixties clothes   yeah yeah i i i guess uh the best thing i like to see from the sixties and seventies is of course is the mini skirt of course   oh yeah   one of the nice things but uh yeah i i i dont think that theres anything as original its its all based on uh one of the past styles they just uh make their uh circle and come back again   yeah   so if you hang onto your clothes long enough uh theyll theyll be back in style in a few years   yeah thats true  maybe some day i probably wont be alive to see it but prices might go down lot more i dont know though doesnt look good   yeah well i think like thinking back i think the only style i hope doesnt come back is bell bottoms   yeah i remember that i do   i guess when i look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms i say God     yeah i didnt really care for them either uh or now i wont
