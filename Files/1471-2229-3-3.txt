                    Background        Microsatellites also known as simple sequence repeats        or SSRs are a small array of tandemly arranged bases one        to six spread throughout the genomes Microsatellites as        DNA markers are advantageous over many other markers as        they are highly polymorphic highly abundant codominant        inheritance analytical simple and readily transferable            Microsatellites are reported to be more variable than        RFLPs or RAPDs and have been widely utilized in plant        genomic studies            The advantages of        microsatellite over other types of genetic markers will        become more important and more obvious when they are used        to track desirable traits in largescale breeding programs        and as anchor points for mapbased gene cloning strategies                   There are a number of ways to obtain microsatellite        markers Screening genomic libraries by hybridizing with        SSR probes and sequencing the hybridized positive clones is        traditional but a laborious and costly approach While        screening the SSRenriched smallinsert libraries can        significantly reduce time and cost     Enrichment can        be realized by hybridizing SSRcontaining fragments with        biotinlabeled probes that are either captured by magnetic        beads coated with streptavidin or fixed on a nitrate filter            The eluted portion after removing nonhybridized        DNA was highly enriched for microsatellites with        enrichment efficiency between             Cultivated peanut or groundnut          Arachis hypogaea L is an important        crop for oil and protein source While China USA and India        are the biggest producers it is grown throughout the        world Despite the existence of substantial diversity among        cultivated peanut genotypes for various morphological        physiological and agronomic traits very little DNA        variations had been detected by using protein or DNAbased        markers         Because of the lack of        polymorphism at DNA level this crop has lagged behind in        genetic mapping markerassisted selection resistance gene        cloning and crop evolutionary study compared with other        crops This problem has hindered the improvement of        cultivated peanut by molecular techniques Although        microsatellites present in peanut             microsatellites have not been fully identified developed        or utilized and detailed information on the abundance of        microsatellites still remains blank        The objectives of this study were  to identify        microsatellites from the cultivated peanut genome and         to detect the polymorphisms using these novel        microsatellites in a collection of peanut accessions with        diversified origins                    Results        The microsatelliteenriched libraries were constructed        using the enrichment procedure with some modification Four        hundred one colonies were randomly picked from primary        transformation plates and sequenced The length of most        inserts was between  bp   bp About   of the        colonies were found to contain SSR sequences of which most        were GACT repeats Among these SSRcontaining fragments         were unique  while the rest were redundant         We could design primer pairs for  out of  unique        fragments see Additional File  The remaining sequences        had too short flanking region to design primers From         primer pairs  could detect a polymorphism among         peanut genotypes see Table  The average number of        alleles per locus was  see Table  Because the        highest number of alleles was found using primer pair PM         more genotypes including one genotype from a wild        species          A monticola  were used to search        more alleles at this particular locus Up to  alleles        were identified at PM locus when  genotypes were        surveyed see Figure  This is the first time that such a        large number of alleles were identified in cultivated        peanut Using five such highly polymorphic markers         cultivated genotypes could be differentiated data not        showed We believe that microsatellite markers in peanut        might be abundant like other legume species such as        soybean These primary results suggest that this system is        a promising one for isolation and characterization of        microsatellites in peanut

has been detected by molecular markers such as        RFLPs isozymes and RAPDs     Only a few molecular        markers have been identified to link with resistance genes        in peanut     and thus genetic improvement through        marker assisted breeding is limited Although a        considerable number of AFLP markers have been identified            substantially more DNA markers are needed to        saturate the existing peanut linkage map and to initiate        genetic studies for this plant species        Microsatellites have become one of the most widely used        molecular markers for genetic studies in recent years        Enriching the AFLP or specific adaptoramplified DNA        fragments is a simple and efficient approach for SSR        isolation and has been successfully applied to a number of        plant genomes          By employing the        modified procedures from other plant species corresponding        isolating protocols were established in peanut for        development of microsatellites through this study When the        genomic DNA was converted into AFLP fragment assembly the        different set of AFLP fragments could be amplified using        selective primers and then used for hybridizing with SSR        probes By optimizing the hybridization and washing steps        most of the AFLP fragments were found to harbor        microsatellites after cloning and sequencing In order to        enrich SSRcontaining fragments efficiently several        researchers      combined several SSR probes to        hybridize with DNA fragments However some types of repeat        were lost due to improper temperature during hybridization        followed by washing     The probes were separately        hybridized with fragments to prevent some probes from        washing out in this study However the fragments        containing GACT repeats were found most using three probes        separately A few GTCA or ATTA repeats were identified in        some fragments The results indicated that GACT repeats        are the most abundant microsatellites in peanut genome        Compared to the previous report of Hopkins et al on        peanut microsatellites     in which five polymorphic        markers from  primer pairs  were identified using        library screening method our enrichment procedure was more        efficient in identifying SSR markers where  of  primer        pairs  showed a polymorphism Although the percentage        of detection of SSR markers based on total number of clones        used was almost same   clones from previous        report and   clones from our results the        enrichment procedure is faster and less cost than library        screening        The rate of redundancy was high in peanut while it was        very low in cotton     It decreased the efficacy of        development of microsatellites in peanut Therefore a        bigger library is needed to identify more microsatellite        markers Libraries could be constructed by hybridization of        SSR probes with different set of AFLP fragments resulted        from changing different onebase at  end of AFLP primers        which should have  possible primer combinations or with        different set of restriction fragments resulted from using        different restriction enzyme combinations        No correlation was found in cultivated peanut between        the number of repeat and the informativeness of the SSR        although a positive correlation has been reported for        grapevine and tomato     The locus PM contains only        nineteen GA motifs but is highly polymorphic Other loci        eg PM GA           and PM GA           harbor much more uniform repeat        units but showed no DNA variations among diversified        peanut genotypes studied No polymorphism was detected with        the repeat number over         With highthroughput technologies and facilities such        as robotic imaging and computational sequencing and        genotyping facilities more reliable polymorphic markers        will be used to construct a high resolution genetic map and        markerassisted selection or even mapbased cloning will be        realized before long in cultivated peanut                    Conclusions        The results provided by the present study highlight a        simple and reliable way in obtaining polymorphic        microsatellite markers from the cultivated peanut A        significance of the results is that development of        microsatellite markers is important not only for peanut        researchers but also for peanut industry as the paucity of        DNA markers in cultivated peanut has so far precluded        detailed genetic research on this crop                    Methods        Peanut plant genomic DNA was extracted using MasterPure        Plant Leaf DNA Purification kit Epicentre Madison WI        and digested by two restriction enzymes          Hind III

standard AFLP        protocol     Three biotinylated SSR probes AT           GT           GA           which were reported being rich in        other plant species were separately hybridized with        amplified AFLPs Approximately  ng of the preamplified        AFLP fragments length range from  bp   bp were        added to a single reaction mixture containing   SSC        SalineSodium Citrate pH   SDS sodium dodecyl        sulfate and  pmol biotinylated probe The mix was        incubated at C for  minutes and chilled quickly on ice        for  minutes It was then kept at proper temperature        depending on the melting temperature of each probe for        one hour to perform annealing for probe GT          at C AT          at C and GA          at C Meanwhile Dynabeads M        Streptavidin  gl was prepared by gently shaking the        vial to obtain homogenous slurry About  l of the beads        slurry was transferred to a  ml tube then washed         times with  l bead washing buffer   TE   mM        NaCl The beads were resuspended with  l of the same        buffer and added into the fragmentprobe mix and incubated        at room temperature for  minutes with constant gentle        agitation After immobilization the supernatant was        removed by applying a magnetic field to precipitate the        beads which attached the SSR containing fragments that        hybridized to biotinylated probe The beadprobefragment        complex was washed three times each for  minutes with         l nonstringency washing buffer   TE   M NaCl at        room temperature The complex was further washed with         l stringency buffer   SSC   SDS for three times        each for  minutes at room temperature After the final        wash the washing buffer was completely removed  l of        sterile water added taped gently and incubated at C for         minutes The eluted solution containing single strand        SSRenriched fragments was cloned into the pCRTOPO
