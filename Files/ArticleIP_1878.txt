                                 Killer Air Bags            Is nothing sacred Worseyet is nothing safe            Last week we learned thatair bags air bags  once the Holy Grail of consumer activists the fondhope of every worried parentare dangerous to your health Not only are theyno surefire protection against the hazards of driving but they may even bekid killers Automakers rushed warnings to owners of airbagequipped cars Thetort bar has no doubt been placed on Red Alert            Who is to blame for theairbag debacle            We areof course We the American public tireless in our pursuit of the costlessbenefit loath to accept the randomly aimed slings and arrows of outrageousfortune ever ready to shift the blame for our own laziness or carelessness tosomeone elsepreferably someone with deep pockets We were easy prey for thesafety crusaders who argued in the s and s that drivers and theirpassengers could not be expected to buckle their seat belts and shoulder beltsand that the recalcitrant car companies should be required to install passiverestraints            The economics profession lent strength to the activistsarguments One widely quoted  study emanating from the BrookingsInstitution proclaimed that seat beltsto all appearances a lowcost andeffective way to keep people from flying through the windshieldactuallyfailed the test of costbenefit analysis What all appearances neglected toconsider but the Brookings study did not was the  seconds that it takeson average to fasten a seat belt For an instructive sample of theseeconomists arcane divinations             Adding upall these precious seconds and a few other minor costs over the life of thecar the economists concluded that the total cost of using seat belts exceedsthe benefits by some  By contrast the authors stated the relativelyexpensive and unproven air bags would net annual benefits of  billion to billion From this they concluded that mandatory seatbelt laws wereilladvised            Meanwhile the automakers grew tired of beinglabeled liars and killers as one company spokesperson puts it Aware thatconsumers didnt like the automated seat belts that were the only alternativefor meeting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations passiverestraint standards the companies finally jumped on the airbag bandwagon By the air bag was a staple of the industry four years before federal lawmakes dual air bags mandatory in all new cars The car companies had longargued that air bags were only effective if the hated seat belts were also wornthe bags are already marked SR for supplemental restraint if anyonebothers to look But somehow those warnings grew fainter as airbagenthusiasm mounted            So now wehave several years of actual experience with air bags And what does the recordshow Since  more than  air bag deployments have occurred and byNHTSA count  lives have been saved But at what price The industry putsthe cost of an air bag installed in a new car at about  not includingengineering spillovers such as dashboard and steeringwheel redesign At a car the total cost to the consumernot the car companies who passthe cost along of installing even one air bag in each of the  millionpluscars now so equipped is about  billion to date and the cost per life savedis close to  million            Of course as car menno less than consumer advocatesnowhasten to add the value of a human life is infinite which makes  million abargain But what then about the value of the lives that air bags have takenAs many as  children in just the last yearare reported to have beenkilled by air bags in accidents that otherwise would not have been fatalNineteen adults as well most of whom were  feet  inches or shorter a factthat hits this writer close to home Surely these lives were of infinite valuetoo which means that by the peculiar arithmetic of infinity the costs aswell as the benefits of air bags are beyond measure Of course if we trulybelieved the value of human life was limitless wed ban motor vehicleswhichaccount for about  deaths a yearaltogether            Quiteapart from their costs however theres a real question whether air bags onbalance save any lives at all Two economists at Virginia CommonwealthUniversityyes here are the economists again but this time making a moreplausible argumentstudied millions of autoaccident claims filed between and  They found that drivers of airbagequipped cars initiate adisproportionate number of crashes involving fatalities and that as a resultthe occupants of such cars are at considerably higher risk than those in carswithout air bags Its not that air bags dont work Its that when people feelthat their chances of being injured are reduced they drive more recklesslyIts called offset behavior            Reducing drunken driving by  or  percent forthat matter could save more lives in one year than have been saved by air bagsin their neardecade of deployment But that of course would require aconsiderable sacrifice from a substantial part of the citizenry Which bringsus back to where we began Human natureor at least human nature as it hasevolved in our American times            To be fair the public doesseem to have wised up a lot While consumer activists pump for anothertechnological fixsmart air bags that can adjust their behavior to thestature of frontseat passengersmore and more of us perhaps influenced inpart by mandatory seatbelt laws in  states are squandering those precious seconds and buckling up The industry now plans to strengthen warningsthat children should be kept appropriately harnessed in the back seat wherethey will be neither helped nor harmed by air bags The car companies also hopeto convince NHTSA that slowerinflating air bags would provide almost as muchprotection and far less risk than posed by the current standardas long asseat belts are also worn            There is a lesson here forpolicymakers who hope that the public will be easily led to make modestsacrifices for the common good or even for their individual goodsuch asaccepting controls on medical usage to limit the runaway costs of
