          okay uh could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution   well its hard to say i mean while its certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot um if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh its certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all what do you think   um well you talked about uh volcanos im not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do uh put into the atmosphere  i think probably the greatest cause is uh vehicles   umhum   especially around cities um uh do you live right in the city itself   uh no im more out in the suburbs but i certainly work near a city   uh okay so can can you notice well its its i live in a rural area   how about you umhum   uh its mainly farms and  uh no heavy industry uh Attleboro itself i live in Rhode Island   umhum oh i see   and its in the north i live up in the uh northeast corner  and Attleboro sits in just over the line   umhum   where TIs plant is but there isnt a lot of heavy industry theres the freeways and we get an occasional well it depends which way the winds blowing from Boston because were only like about forty miles south of Boston so well pick up that   umhum   and uh ive noticed over the past say maybe five or six years uh we live about twenty miles away from the state airport and i notice the fly patterns now of the jets are they getting bigger theyre swinging wider so that now theyre coming over the over the our homes   umhum   and it seems like uh um were catching all their residue im not sure if its kerosene or what thats dropping but other than that you know we dont have the unless were catching it from the midwest the emissions  yeah from the power plants   yeah   um   dont you mean like from the coal   yeah yeah we generate one of our our biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to uh generate electricity um   hm   there doesnt seem to be much emission from them but im not sure about the rest of the country   yeah ive noticed locally a major problem is Kodak um its interesting because in order to uh keep with the EPA standards which which tend to be visible uh whats coming out of your  smokestack they do all their emissions at night uh so people get up   is that right   yeah people get up in the morning in that neighborhood and theyve got this black ash on their cars  which you know seems to be   yeah yeah yeah yeah surprise surprise   yeah i mean i really think if the EPA had anything on the ball theyd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh   yeah them there must be uh um some of the some of the uh   you know   uh larger plants up around up around one twenty eight  um weve got reports that uh during the night too like they blow off their their stacks from uh the   umhum right   the boilerhouse for powerhouses and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them   umhum right yeah yeah   so youre right they could do something about about that i guess   yeah that seems a little ridiculous   how are your uh your lakes and uh   oh theyve been getting cleaner   they have   sure but um yeah im not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain yeah   acid rain yeah thats thats what i was uh   i mean the stuff ive read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit um overstated that a lot of the die off theyve seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all um yeah im not an expert   yeah no didnt they just have an article oh on uh  they were dumping lime up upstate New York somewhere   hm   um over over huge areas and and they thought that was more beneficial because you know and it some of it does soak in and some of it runs off right away into the into the streams and rivers and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback   i havent read that oh yeah umhum   i cant remember where i i read that recently somewhere and i cant remember where but i thought it was up there  so thats interesting because New Hampshire   you know its interesting umhum   and parts of Vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain  um   hm   do you kind of think its something else then   well thats what the environmentalists were claiming in this article so that   oh they didnt say they didnt say what though they just said they thought it was   they didnt say what they just said they thought acid rains contribution may be less than was previously suspected um but it may be other natural things at work um   hm natural disease   yeah so its its less than clear like i said i dont remember the article that well   yeah yeah   but um i dont know i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution   uh we can demand uh more efficient automobiles for one thing i still think thats thats uh one of our major causes of pollutants   umhum   uh how we go about that its uh uh its a little bit difficult   so you think its just up to individuals to ask automakers for uh  less polluting vehicles   yeah you need you need i think you need a a uh vehicle something like uh uh Ralph Nader uh Naders Raiders or uh where uh  or uh  uh AARP   yeah   which has a lot of members uh if you can get those types of groups   umhum do you really think new vehicles though is a big problem i mean i remember reading an article that said like its the older polluters the the twelve and the fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution and the new cars its hardly its hardly anything   yeah theyre better but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there uh when when was the last time you saw a truck that didnt belch smoke or uh or   yeah but doesnt that just mean theyre out of tune   uh im not really sure you think that that the uh the trucking industry uh industry is that uh incompetent that they wouldnt you know fuel is is one of their biggest costs   right   so you would   but diesel engines   yeah diesel engines   it you know its it i mean they do generate a lot of soot but that at least you know that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly   yeah yeah we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems uh this country seems to be a little behind on that   yeah on the other hand most people dont use rapid transit because its so inconvenient   hm yeah but only because we got used to  uh single person single car driving a lot of people dont even like to carpool   umhum umhum   but we could do that thatll help   umhum   pollution air pollution the uh United States and Canada are i guess is is uh it going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh whats being given out by power plants   umhum   i guess Canadas quite concerned that were sending a lot of our stuff up there   yeah sure   so thats helping   well what do you think about like a device a meter on right on a tailpipe and you paid a tax based on how much you polluted   now thats an idea dont say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your  tailpipe generate  generate revenue   well it just means that if you dont pollute right or you pollute very little you dont have to pay any tax or you just buy one of these things and it it um i mean you could you could probably devise them so that it slowly closed off your tail pipe and uh the less you pollute the longer the device lasts and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tailpipe and you couldnt start your car anymore   thats a thats an interesting concept is that your idea   yeah but uh you know  its uh i guess the difficulty would be to  somebody could obviously just take it right off the tailpipe again so youd probably have to build it right into the muffler or something   well i was gonna to say right you could put it in you could you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter i mean i guess you could take those off too but   right you could take catalytic but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off   yeah if you can take a muffler off and only replace well not unless it was built into every muffler   right   and thats   but if you were just talking about something which was more or less universal that uh buses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax       um this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters   thats a thats quite a concept you should uh pursue that i think or patent it  you know     yeah patent it thats a good idea   if you could come up with a device thats the thing   right   but it shouldnt be too hard to do something like that but thats a thats a thought no youre right and that will solve uh a lot of problems i dont know if you uh   umhum umhum   if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that   umhum   uh but you know a proposal to uh uh i guess the proper authorities well you might uh generate some   umhum yeah the automobile regulatory agencies or something   yeah you might generate some interest in it but thats a thats a good idea other than that im not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization   umhum
