        okay     why dont you go ahead and start   okay well we subscribe to People magazine and to Time and course i like the People magazine because its gossipy   umhum   and its fast reading and uh the Time of course is uh you know more newsworthy and and uh it has more world affair type things of course and then i will purchase a Good Housekeeping occasionally especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and   umhum   and things like that and uh do you subscribe to any magazines   umhum yeah i well i have in a while for a while i havent gotten any because i just find that im not reading what im getting because uh i have so much going on in my life that seems to be the last thing i pick up so i found that i was wasting my money as much as i enjoy them uh when i do subscribe i ive gotten in the past the Parents magazine and uh  the Housekeeping magazine and uh   uhhuh you probably have smaller children younger children my children are our children are grown   yes yeah yeah yeah   and uh im letting their mother read on the grandchildren   right well i found that after a couple of years of having a Parents magazine it was getting repetitious so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason uh the Housekeeping magazines i do like because they like you say they have nice  uh recipes in them and ideas but uh lately they just been piling up on me so i figured it wasnt uh something i needed at this point in time   well do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to     i dont know i i well my husband would love to have more now hes the type who will get the uh Inc magazine and Money magazine and all the financial type magazines   yes now my husband does that and you know and of course uh naturally Wall Street Journal you know and or Sports Illustrated but i dont know i know i see people leafing through them at the store   yeah uhhuh yes umhum   but you just dont hear people talk about them and i know years ago when uh my children were young and stuff i just loved Ladies Home Journal McCalls Good Housekeeping and i took them all and um   umhum   then oh i dont know what in the seventies maybe late seventies they changed their format and i havent   umhum   i dont think there as good a magazine as they used to be even Good Housekeeping i dont   well yeah and and some of those that have what what i consider or what i get the idea that theyre maybe the the more pricier type magazines as far as womens magazines they seem to be just so chocked full of of ads   oh they are my sister uh takes uh Town and Country and Vogue   uhhuh   and she sends them to me and theres really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes very expensive jewelry   yeah yeah yes   things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing   right  yeah   you know and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living   yes yeah   you know then i can i look through them and i do i just what i do is i flip through them and and pitch them then you know theyre not something i  you know take any length of time over   yes umhum umhum   i have discovered that you know with my available time i would rather actually read a book than a magazine   yes i enjoy books a lot more thats true   yes and um so but   well yeah i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to other than my children have gotten you know they get tons of magazines it seems they theyre always getting something in the mail   yes   and uh so between reading to them and uh reading the newspaper and then i have a book that im occasionally reading when i get a chance but i just dont get a chance for those uh newsy magazines the ones that are full of ads unless you just want to skim through while youre i i read them when im at a doctors office or you know waiting on something like that   yes yes i will read them in a doctors office too as i said i i subscribe to uh to People and to Time and uh   yeah   and i will go through the Time but usually not to cover to cover you know ill glance through it ill like reading uh you know the Passage of People or something you know and uh but i do like the People magazine it it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young   umhum umhum oh uhhuh   and uh thats one and you know i really like that i enjoy that its quick reading   umhum   you know it doesnt require a lot of thinking and sometimes after ive worked all day and have things to do at night   yeah   i just i want fluff  i dont want a lot of thinking   umhum umhum thats true that kind of is a good way to do it   it uh you know its its much more relaxing sometimes when i read Time Time magazine after ive read an article im real depressed over the situation of the world       so well it seems like we both kind of agree on on the subject of magazines   yeah yeah   and uh so uh i think that probably i will end the call ive enjoyed   okay
