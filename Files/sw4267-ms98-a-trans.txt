        all right so what do you think about gun control or what how do you rate on a one to ten scale your feelings about gun control     well i guess id probably put myself on about a five im kind of in the middle on that i think that theres uh there are some guns that i just cant think of any reason why anybody would want to have them unless they just want to go shoot somebody   umhum   but on the other hand i think theres a lot of legitimate use for guns too and i dont see any reason why we should do any sort of control or uh certainly no sort of you know serious restrictions on those for example hunting and things like that and even some selfdefense things so how do you feel about it   id probably be closer to uh on the one side   okay   i dont really see the need for it um typically only thing that ever gets produced you know that occurs when you have one is you end up shooting some family member or some kid in the house   umhum   thats about the only good that ever comes from it   i dont know i know some people who hunt and uh you know   well i yeah you could i mean but do they necessarily have to keep them at home to do that   uh   i mean maybe theres a way they can be uh maintained in a a certain location i dont know but i dont know if individual ownership is necessary   umhum yeah well it seems like most of the people who get hurt from them get hurt from handguns     umhum   and so i look at somebody like you know whos got a you know maybe a a twenty two caliber rifle or something like that if you know good for for you know maybe hunting some small you know animal or something like that you know i never i never hear a reports of people you know shooting each other with things like that unless theyre out in the woods and drunk and then of course thats a thats another problem   right but   thats true right thats true   but   yeah mostly i guess handguns are are create the problems but a lot of people would come back and say well uh you they need it for shooting range and that sort of thing but   umhum   once again i think it it may be better to keep the guns uh there and let they can go there and and use them if thats all they need it for   yeah umhum yeah i agree that theres a real problem with uh with injuries and things like that uh sound like we both agree on the fact that things like semiautomatic rifles and and things like that i mean they uh   sure   i think we both agree that theres theres no uh at least use that i legitimate use that i can think of for a semiautomatic rifle except to kill people i mean thats what they were designed for and thats what theyre good for   yes umhum right umhum   now you know i suppose if if there was some way that we could render them unusable   well they can always be tweaked around and made deadly once again   then yeah yeah i guess if there were some absolute definite way that you could you could make something like that unusable then i  then i probably wouldnt have a problem with a collector having one   right   but i dont know how to do that uh without you know even pouring cement down the barrels probably way to get around that   yeah i dont i dont openly i dont i think any gun any gun can be modified to to certain a certain extent to be used as a weapon   yeah umhum   so without a total ban theres always going to be guns available but   yeah and i think even with a total ban therell always be guns available   right   but at that point you know i guess i dont realistically think theres anything you can do about that   right   you know you you can certainly make the possession of of of of such weapons you know you know the penalties for that very very very strict   umhum   but i i guess i feel like you know just like anything else you know you know theres lots of illegal things out there that people that people are you know still getting   right   but i also ascribe to the theory that you know you know guns guns dont kill people people kill people i mean that that seems to me to be wrong   yeah   i think i think guns do kill people and that you know you know lets face it i mean if you got a gun   thats right   its so much easier in the heat of an argument or something to to hurt somebody than it is with a knife or   exactly right thats yeah for example what happened just the other evening uh Evander Holyfields brother   umhum   uh you know they had some kind of disagreement or whatever and next thing you knew he was shot and dead   thats right thats right but you know its interesting there was an incident here in Rochester a a few days ago where uh some people were having a real heavy argument and the guy pulled out a knife and killed the other two people   umhum   so you know it it it goes to show it it does prove that even even you know gun gun control certainly has a place but its not going to be the the cure all of all societys ills   sure sure but i guess uh if you look at the NRAs position on it they tend to say that they dont want they really dont want to have any restrictions because they feel that once you get one and its starts it be gets easier and it may snowball into more restrictions i dont really respect that position   yeah umhum   and i think theyre kind of getting out of touch with reality in some of their stances   no i i think thats an extremist position and i and i dont really subscribe to it either        i think on the you know like i said i think there are some legitimate you know uses for guns and thats why i kind of put myself at a five but   umhum
