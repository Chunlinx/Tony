                    Background        The normal human ocular lens exhibits a steady increase        in size due to growth throughout life harboring some the        oldest cells in the body       Overall from birth to         years of age the human lens will increase  in        equatorial diameter while increasing only  in AP axial        thickness     Cell growth dramatically influences the        contours of the anterior and posterior lens surfaces but        is not the sole factor affecting lens form        Previous studies investigating the hydration of        transparent human lenses revealed an agerelated dependence        between water content and lens region     With        advancing age the human lens cortex shows a slight        increase in water composition year whereas the        nucleus decreases its total water content year        setting up a gradient of hydration     Studies of human        diabetic lenses have revealed greater total water content        in comparison to transparent nondiabetic lenses with        swelling reported to extend into the adult and perhaps the        fetal nuclei      The result is a characteristically        larger lens in comparison to transparent agematched        nondiabetic lenses Previous documentation by Scheimpflug        analysis demonstrated that the annual expansion rate of the        lenticular AP length is accelerated  in earlyonset        diabetics     Steepening of the anterior and posterior        surface curvatures was detected but little difference in        lens nuclear size was found The osmotic imbalance observed        in the diabetic lens may be responsible for the pronounced        influx of water into the epithelial and cortical areas        swelling and damaging the cells            In our previous morphological study of nondiabetic        aging human lenses by SEM it was concluded that the        innermost nuclear fibers of the human lens significantly        decrease in size and change shape with age and        cataractogenesis     a process termed compaction In        concordance with previous investigations     it was        found that the rate of lens compaction was not constant        over time and that the majority of compaction was observed        before middle age Changes in the AP length of the        embryonic nucleus impact the curvature angles of the inner        fetal nuclear fibers at the equator possibly affecting the        overall lenticular form Employing transmission electron        microscopy TEM in an additional study     extensive        fiber cell damage was noted in the outer adult nucleus of        lateonset diabetic cataractous lenses with minimal        morphological disturbances in the inner nuclei        In this study SEM was used to search for evidence of        osmotic swelling andor fiber cell compaction in the        nucleus of noncataractous and clinically diagnosed nuclear        cataractous human lenses from persons with diabetes Due to        the manner in which we receive our specimens the nature        and medical history of the donors diabetes are unknown        This study aims to compare the transparent lenses of        diabetic patients to those of with nuclear cataract        without conclusions based on disease type or treatment For        further comparisons previously documented nondiabetic        compaction data was utilized                        Methods                  Specimens          Six diabetic human lenses  to  years of age were          obtained from the National Disease and Research          Interchange Philadelphia PA Lenses were enucleated          and placed in primary fixative detailed below between           to  hours post mortem Specimens were shipped by          overnight courier at room temperature to our laboratories          for further processing IRB requirements do not allow the          distribution of detailed patient information age          gender and the diabetic state of the tissue are known          but the type and treatment of diabetes remains unknown          Lenses with obvious nuclear scattering history of          cataract or cortical or posterior subcapsular scattering          were excluded from the study The transparency of each          lens was evaluated on a backlit calibrated reticle          Transparent lenses caused little distortion of the          underlying grid          Six human nuclear cataractous lens nuclei from          patients with diabetes ranging in age from  to           years were obtained following extracapsular extraction          from Duke Eye Center Durham NC These lenses exhibited          significant nuclear light scattering diagnosed as          cataract by slit lamp and warranted removal by an          ophthalmologist grade  on a  scale     The          extractions were performed by the same surgeon using          consistent techniques Nuclei were transported to our          laboratories in vials with gauze moistened with balanced          salt solution at room temperature and were placed in          primary fixative within  hours of extraction As in the          case of the noncataractous diabetic lenses detailed          information concerning the diabetic type disease          duration and treatment was not distributed Potential          variations in morphology between post mortem and          surgically extracted lenses were minimized by using          identical preparation techniques All donated lenses had          no history of laser or intraocular surgery and were          obtained according to the tenets of the Declaration of          Helsinki                          Sample preparation          Lenses were preserved in a primary fixative of           buffered formalin in  M phosphate buffer pH  for           hours at room temperature with slight agitation              This was followed by five days of fixation in an          osmotically balanced solution of  gluteraldehyde in           M sodium cacodylate buffer pH  at room          temperature with daily fix exchanges Each lens was          washed overnight in  M sodium cacodylate and the          nuclei dissected as previously described     In          brief a  mm trephine was used to extract the core of          the lens around the optic axis The anterior and          posterior disks of tissue overlying the inner nuclei were          removed with forceps and the process repeated until the          distinct Ysuture pattern could be resolved on the lens          surface indicative of the FN Each lens core was split          along the optic axis with forceps Fig  and postfixed          in  aqueous osmium tetroxide for  hours at C          Following several washes in  M sodium cacodylate          buffer the lens portions were dehydrated in a graded          ethanol series Samples were critical point dried in          liquid CO            using the

anterior and posterior angles for each          sample The axial length measurements of the EN were made          along the optical axis from the initiation of the fetal          suture planes at the anterior and posterior poles To          determine the mean number of membrane compaction folds on          the surface of EN fiber cells over a  m distance five          to ten measurements per sample were compiled and          averaged Due to the variation in separation planes from          sample to sample it was not always possible to measure          every parameter in each lens                          Statistical analysis          Lenses were compiled into transparent diabetic or          nuclear cataractous diabetic groups for statistical          analysis Limited knowledge of the multiple population          distributions comprising each group and the relatively          small sample sizes     could undermine the power of          most standard parametric statistical tests For these          reasons the twosided nonparametric MannWhitney           U test was chosen for the          comparisons Any significant results of these tests were          interpreted as trends

diabetics with          cataracts          Examination of the peeled and split lens nuclei by SEM          revealed an ideal and reproducible dissection procedure          for the exposure of FN and EN fibers along their length          near the midsagittal plane Unlike the cells of the          outer nuclei and cortex as described by TEM     no          noticeable cell damage could be detected by SEM at low          magnification in the diabetic fetal and embryonic nuclei          As in nondiabetic tissues little morphological          difference could be resolved by superficial observation          between transparent and cataractous diabetic lenses                Detailed analysis at higher magnifications          however demonstrated the differences between specimens          A

Comparisons between diabetic and nondiabetic            lenses            To detect any changes in compaction due to diabetes            itself morphometric data from nondiabetic aged            transparent human lenses ages  and nondiabetic            agerelated nuclear cataracts ages  were            utilized for additional statistical comparisons                Parameter measurement comparisons between transparent            nondiabetic lenses and those from transparent            diabetics did not reveal any statistically significant            differences between the groups Table  The average            anterior FN elliptical angles of the transparent            diabetic lenses were  larger than that of            nondiabetic transparent lenses              p   and the

Discussion        Comparisons of transparent diabetic and diabetic lenses        with nuclear cataract yielded statistically significant        differences in each measured parameter indicating a        detectable and real difference in inner nuclear size        between the groups Based on the strengths of the        statistical tests used these results should be interpreted        as trends between the tissues As observed in nondiabetic        aged transparent and agerelated human cataractous lenses        it appears that nuclear fiber cell compaction is        responsible for these differences        It should be noted that any study that utilizes tissue        processing for electron microscopy is subject to potential        morphological artifacts due to fixation Every effort has        been made in this study to minimize the potential        occurrences of such artifacts by utilizing proven        preservation methods for lens tissue      It is        possible that the processing may dehydrate the presbyopic        lens nuclei however the potential structural changes may        occur on too small a scale to significantly affect the        gross measurements made here        To relate these variations in compaction to diabetes        andor cataractogenesis statistical testing was performed        using previously collected nondiabetic data In Brown and        Hungerfords review of the size of the lens in ocular        disease he comments that the rise in overall lens growth        rate observed in the diabetic lens can be almost entirely        attributed to increased cortical thickness with relatively        insignificant width changes in the nucleus     Later        postulations concerning the mechanism of this growth        included increased fiber formation enlarged fiber cell        volume and decreased nuclear compaction             Parameter comparisons of transparent aged human lenses to        those of diabetics did not yield statistically significant        results indicating little difference in average nuclear        compaction between the tissues Our previous study        demonstrated a  average decrease in elliptical angle and        AP axis measurements between aged transparent lenses and        those of agerelated nuclear cataracts     this is        roughly the same amount of change reported here between        transparent and nuclear cataractous diabetic lenses         decrease This suggests that the compaction changes        observed in this study are not necessarily a direct effect        of diabetes itself but are perhaps due to morphological        changes in the nuclei undergoing cataractogenesis The role        that diabetes does appear to play however involves the        onset age of cataract Though we cannot deduce the age of        cataract onset in our samples we do know the age at which        the cataract was considered advanced and removed by an        ophthalmologist In our comparisons the average age for        the agerelated nuclear cataract group was  years           whereas that for the cataractous diabetic group in this        study was only  years old These results suggest an        agerelated acceleration of cataract formation in persons        with diabetes Several population studies have documented a        link between diabetes and senile cataract formation in        persons aged  years and younger                 Conversely a number of studies have shown little        association of nuclear cataracts with diabetes              Though this relationship continues to be debated as are        the underlying physiological mechanisms premature        opacification may occur due to an increased susceptibility        to oxidative damage        Although the exact details concerning the cause of        compaction remain unknown some features of the        multifactorial process are understood The morphological        changes described in the inner nuclear areas are a direct        result of the change in AP axis length This change in        length has an observable effect on the reduction of both        anterior and posterior FN elliptical angles and manifests        itself in the EN as accordionlike membrane folds along the        straight fibers This phenomenon suggests a loss of        cytoplasmic water and a decrease in nuclear cytoplasmic        osmolarity      The tendency of lens proteins to        selfassociate and the release of bound water to the bulk        water pool can lead to greater cellular dehydration             The end result is a decrease in cell volume without the        loss of cell surface area producing an EN with measurably        shorter fiber cells with increased membrane complexity        In conclusion this study is in agreement with our        earlier finding that nuclear fiber cell compaction in the        lens is a normal and measurable process with advancing age        the process of cataractogenesis appears to have a profound        effect on the extent and severity of compaction in the        nucleus The osmotic swelling of the cortex in typical        diabetic lenses is not matched by comparable water uptake        in the nucleus in fact compaction occurs in similar        fashion to that observed in nondiabetic lenses Diabetes        may elicit an increased compaction rate as well as an        earlier onset of cataract formation though there may be        multiple mechanisms of action dependent on disease type        duration or treatment strategy Further investigations        employing a broad population of samples with extensive        medical histories will yield additional more conclusive        results about the relationship of diabetes and nuclear        cataract
