                                 Clintons Final  Escape                                             Slate                has brought back its Clintometer and onceagain skeptics are complaining that our estimate of President Clintonspolitical peril is too low For the latest update click  The new gutlessconventional wisdom is that Clintons fate is uncertain Pundits observegrimly that he has refused to offer the necessary confession or contritionthat his impeachment by the House has put him within one step of expulsion andthat the resignation of incoming Speaker Bob Livingston over his newlydisclosed adultery has turned up the pressure on Clinton to follow suit Butonce again the pundits are wrong The threat to Clinton is over To understandhow he will get out of his latest predicament consider how he got into it                                           Catharsis The chiefreason moderate congressional Republicans voted to impeach Clinton is that hegot cocky after the election Emboldened by what he perceived as a popularmandate to end the impeachment inquiry he infuriated ambivalent lawmakers byrefusing to admit that he had lied He answered the House Judiciary Committees questions with maddening evasions and in remarks at the White House Dec when everyone was expecting a definitive apology he failed to acknowledgehis public lies as opposed to his private sexual misconduct            Many Republicans decidedto impeach Clinton to send a message that the law must be obeyed and that theunrepentant president must be punished We must draw a line between right andwrong  so every kid in America can see it said one Another said he wasvoting to impeach because Clinton was acting as though he were above the lawBut if delivering that message was the motive for impeachment then theres noneed to go further and expel Clinton from office Republicans have joined themedia in portraying his impeachment as a devastating permanent scar on hispresidency In so doing they have vented the outrage against him and haverelieved the pressure to convict him Already Republican senators havestipulated that the House has scarred Clinton that the Senate will nevermuster the  votes to convict him and that a censure deal should be workedout instead             Partisanship The next reason Clinton was impeachedis that the elections didnt change the congressional math There were still Republicans in the House enough to pass two articles of impeachment Butthese partyline victories came at a price The more Republicans pushedimpeachment the more Democrats resisted A Democratic congressional aideadmitted that many Democrats dislike Clinton but the Republicans have done agood job at uniting usand driving us into his arms And the more tenuous theRepublicans majority became the more they resorted to behavior that waseasily portrayed as partisan The final straw was House GOP leaderssuppression of a resolution of censure White House aides promptly went on theSunday talk shows to call the impeachment vote partisan and unfair            The partisanshipmessage has destroyed public faith in the legitimacy of Clintons impeachmentNearly twothirds of respondents in the latest New York Times poll saythe GOP pursued the case for purely partisan reasons Moreover by failing topersuade more than a handful of Democrats to vote for impeachment the GOPfailed to trigger the kind of bipartisan collapse necessary to bring down apresident Democrats have gleefully used the partyline House vote todistinguish Clintons situation from that of President Nixon in  And mostimportant a partisan split in Congress guarantees that Clinton can survive inthe Senate where Democrats have more than enough votes to save him             Backlash Pundits think another reason forClintons impeachment was that Republicans ignored the polls Actually thepolls conveyed two opposite threats House Republicans faced a backlash frommany independent and Democratic voters if they voted to impeach Clinton Butthey also faced a backlash from conservative voters if they voted not toimpeach him Several Republican consultants pointed out that the greaterpolitical threat to moderate House Republicans in  was a primary challengefrom proimpeachment forces So the Republicans played it both ways Theyescaped the first backlash by voting to impeach Clinton and they counted onthe Senate to spare them the second backlash by refusing to convict him            Polls suggest thatClintons expulsion would shock and infuriate much of the electorate BySunday only  percent of respondents in the Times poll expected theSenate to remove Clinton from office In the latest Washington Postpoll only  percent said the Senate should remove him whereas approximately percent said they would be angry or dissatisfied if he were ousted TheRepublicans arent stupid They know that if they go all the way and deposeClinton all hell will break loose on them in  In voting to impeach himthey shot to wound not to kill Already four House Republicans who voted forimpeachment have written a letter asking the Senate to censure Clinton ratherthan remove him             Personal Destruction Realizing that theycouldnt get away with shooting Clinton fatally Republicans sensibly deducedthat the only other way to extinguish him was to make him commit suicide Theyhave pursued this strategy in two ways The clever premeditated way was topush the impeachment process so far forward that Clintons resignation becamethe quickest way out The bizarre unpremeditated way was to oust their ownleaders and demand that Clinton take the same exit First Speaker Newt Gingrichresigned and Republicans held him up to Clinton as a model Then incomingSpeaker Bob Livingston resigned declaring I must set the example that I hopePresident Clinton will follow            Both these tactics were illadvised Clintonsimpeachment makes it less likely than ever that he will resign The point ofresignation was to escape the humiliation of impeachment Now that he has beenhumiliated his only hope is to seek redemption in the Senate            Furthermore the GOPsresignationbyexample argument has backfired Clinton and congressionalDemocrats have hijacked Livingstons resignation and turned it into a moralargument against Clintons resignation We must stop the politics ofpersonal destruction Clinton declared at the White House after theimpeachment vote When reporters asked whether Clinton should resign WhiteHouse Press Secretary Joe Lockhart replied He believes it would be wrong togive in to the politics of personal destruction            Livingstons resignation has also backfired by divertingpublic attention from perjury back to sex For months Clintons defenders hadsuccessfully dismissed the scandal as being just about sex After theelection Clinton squandered this victory by continuing to deny that he hadlied about the affair The more he lied about his lies the more people focusedon his lying and forgot what the original lies were about            But since Livingstonssins were about sex not perjury his assertion that he was setting anexample suggested that Clinton should resign not for lying but for adulteryDemocrats persuasively called Livingstons resignation a surrender to adeveloping sexual McCarthyism portrayed Clinton as a fellow victim of thisMcCarthyism and argued that Clinton should be spared expulsion as a first steptoward ending the madness            The personal destruction spin is a big winnerFourfifths of respondents in the Post poll disapproved of the currentscrutiny of politicians adultery In the Times poll  percent saidClinton should complete his term rather than resign Even Republicans aresusceptible to this spin Since they blame Democrats for outing Livingston andthey dont think his adultery should have ended his career they agreed on theSunday talk shows that personal destruction has run amok and that politiciansshouldnt be judged by their past indiscretions Both these conclusions play toClintons advantage            The ultimate perverseconsequence of Livingstons resignation is that it has allowed Clinton toappear magnanimous He has joined congressional Democrats in urging Livingstonto reconsider his decision Once upon a time Republicans derided Clinton forfantasizing that in order to win forgiveness he first had to find a way toforgive his enemies Now they have made that fantasy come true                           Recent FrameGames
