                    Background        The results of lifedetection experiments performed        almost three decades ago on Mars by the Viking lander have        long been subject to controversy       Many        scientists though certainly not all      have        concluded that results of Viking biological experiments can        be interpreted as an indication of the presence of strong        oxidants in the Martian soil       rather than        biological activity They suggest that these oxidants are        capable of oxidizing organic materials causing release of        carbon dioxide as seen in the Viking experiments Since        oxygen was also released after humidifying a sample of        Martian soil these proposed oxidants would also oxidize        water The spontaneous reduction of FerrateVI in water        forms molecular oxygen and FeIII     The rate of this        reaction is strongly pH dependent     Other        observations by Viking have complicated data        interpretation including the transient absorption of        generated carbon dioxide perhaps indicating an alkaline        soil Also different thermal sensitivity of carbon dioxide        and oxygen released implied that more than one oxidant        might have been involved in the observed processes or that        biology might indeed have been responsible for the observed        results            Goldfield et al    and Tsapin et al           suggested that the actual source of oxidative power of        Martian soil could be highly redox active oxygen species        formed in the atmosphere by ultraviolet UV irradiation        and Hunten    examined this hypothesis much earlier        Further these oxidative equivalents may then be stabilized        in the form of high oxidation states of some elements that        are particularly abundant in Martian soil The most likely        element is iron which is thought to represent a major        fraction of the Martian soil matrix      Iron has a        set of oxidation states between  and  with the higher        oxidation states being very strong oxidants The reduction        potential of FeO          in acidic conditions has been        determined to be         E   V and in alkaline        conditions         E   V     Thus these        authors     proposed that FeVI as ferrate dianion        FeO           which is more stable under        alkaline rather than acidic conditions might be an        important component of the pool of Martian oxidants They        demonstrated that FeVI displays the essential features of        organic oxidation to carbon dioxide and water decomposition        to oxygen that were found with Martian soil during the        Viking biology experiments Goldfield et al    further        propose that the presence of a strong oxidant such as        ferrate would make the Martian surface selfsterilizing        eliminating the possibility for detection of life or its        remnants on that planet In support of their hypothesis        they conducted spectral and polymerase chain reaction PCR        experiments with FeVI finding that it destroys DNA        nucleotides proteins and amino acids        It is quite possible that iron in the  andor         oxidation states is present in the soil of Mars However        recent observations by the Mars Odyssey orbiter indicate        that significant amounts of water ice exist at or near the        surface of Mars     Since transient temperatures above        freezing occur at some locations on Mars     this        water likely would be present at least briefly in the        liquid form Under slightly alkaline conditions as found        on Mars and in the presence of liquid water FeVI reacts        quickly with water and is oxidized to FeIII Thus in        regions where liquid water forms even briefly FeVI is        less likely to exist However Mars is a relatively large        planet and conditions across its surface vary We cannot        assume that iron exists in the same oxidation states        everywhere on Mars It is possible that some regions of        Mars might harbor FeV and FeVI while regions with a        frequent occurrence of liquid water might be dominated by        FeIII Also it is possible the FeVI if removed might        be reformed in a continuing cycle through interactions with        the planets atmosphere        Stoker and Bullock    examined the oxidation of        glycine under simulated Martian conditions and concluded        that any organic matter brought to the Mars surface by        meteorites likely would be destroyed by UV radiation faster        than it might be delivered They further suggested that no        organic compounds found on Mars by the Viking Lander Gas        Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer experiment could be        explained without invoking the presence of strong oxidants        in the surface soils They felt their estimates of the        organic destruction rate caused by irradiation at the Mars        surface were an upper limit for a globally averaged biomass        production rate that might be comparable to the        slowgrowing cryptoendolithic microbial communities found        in dry Antarctica deserts            An alternative hypothesis is that given the possible        presence of ferrate in the soil the present environmental        conditions on Mars are not highly conducive to        ferratebased oxidation reactions including those        potentially affecting dormant and        hostileenvironmentresistant life forms Mars is exposed        to high fluxes of UV radiation and is very dry atmospheric        water   ppm and cold average temperature is about         K C F with only traces of oxygen and with an        atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide CO            N            Ar   O            CO   H          O   ppm NO   ppm Ne          ppm HDO   ppm Kr   ppm and Xe   ppm            Thus in this work experiments were performed to        further examine the possibility that a Martian soil        containing significant amounts of ferrate might be        selfsterilizing due to the highly reactive nature of        FeVI        Here synthetic K          FeO          was prepared and added to dry silica        sand at a concentration of  by weight Dry endospores of        the bacterium         Bacillus subtilis were then added and        the mixture incubated under a simulated Mars environment        carbon dioxide atmosphere at C for a period of weeks        Results were examined for indications of whether or not the        presence of ferrate in and of itself was sufficient to make        the Martian surrogate soil selfsterilizing over a        nongeologic time frame The potential sporocidal activity        of a combination of a powerful soil oxidant permanganate        and high fluxes of UV light was also examined Finally our        data were discussed in light of published literature        regarding the possible survival of ancient bacteria in        earthly environments        The United States and other spacefaring nations are        required by treaty to protect Mars and other nonearthly        planetary systems from contamination by earthly        microorganisms From work reported here it appears that        environmentally robust endospores if delivered to Mars on        spacecraft could survive for extended periods of time in        the cold dry preserving environment of Mars despite the        presence of strong oxidants in the soil                    Results        Under ambient environmental conditions synthetic        ferrateVI degraded some organic molecules mixed into        sand For example five mg of ferrate removed about  mg        of trinitrotoluene TNT from the reaction mixture        Figure  However a mixture of dodecane and hexadecane        was not degraded in the ferrateVIsoil mixture Figure         The degradative activity toward TNT was dependent on        the addition of water All the organic moieties were stable        in the dry sandferrate mixture        Results of spore survival over time in the control and        ferrateVIenriched or permanganateenriched Mars        surrogate soils under simulated Martian environmental        conditions are shown in Figure  The endospores survived        exposure to high levels of ferrate under the imposed        conditions for the duration of the experiment up to six        weeks At the times of sampling the surrogate soil        suspensions contained the characteristic crimson color of        ferrateVI Figure  or similar color of permanganate        After spreading on the agar medium the ferrate present in        the inoculum was reduced over  minutes to give a        characteristic brown oxyhydroxy polymer precipitate of        FeIII residue on the plate surface indicating that        ferrateVI was stable under the simulated Mars conditions        and had been available as a potential biocide for the        duration of the experiment Spore survival was similarly        high in a surrogate soil containing permanganate in place        of ferrate An important observation relevant to the Mars        environment was that transient exposure of spores to K          FeO          in the presence of liquid water was        not sporocidal Once FeVI is reduced to FeIII a rapid        process it becomes nontoxic to the spores        Spores placed into a dry permanganateenriched surrogate        soil and exposed within a column to a sterilizing flux of        UV light at the column surface were killed within only the        first  mm of the column Figure  This was in the        presence of air and at a temperature of C                    Discussion        FerrateVI is a very strong oxidizing agent and will        readily oxidize many organic molecules in aqueous solution              High oxidation power selectivity and        byproduction of nontoxic FeIII make potassium        ferrateVI an environmentally friendly oxidant for removal        of industrial contaminants from natural waters     We        confirmed this degradative activity of ferrate using        trinitrotoluene TNT though a mixture of dodecane        and hexadecane as might be found within microbial        membranes was not degraded by ferrateVI Figures and                FeVI is known to be highly active in water as a        biocide For example the kinetics of inactivation of a        bacteriophage by potassium ferrate was studied with the        Fspecific RNAcoliphage Q beta Inactivation in phosphate        buffer pH   and  containing ferrate was effective        and could be described by Homs model     The        effectiveness of ferrateVI in wastewater treatment has        been studied and it exhibits a strong bactericidal effect        on both coliforms and total bacteria     However the        conditions used in those prior experiments with ferrateVI        do not at all mimic the conditions that might be        encountered on the surface or in the subsurface of much of        Mars where there is thought to be essentially no available        water     there is a highly oxidized atmosphere of        mostly CO           and average temperatures are very        low typically  to C but sometimes reaching        temperatures near C in areas of sunlight These        Marslike conditions were used in the experiments reported        here        Certainly these conditions did not exactly duplicate the        Martian atmosphere which would have required use of a        vacuum chamber The pressure of CO          used was much higher than on Mars        However since CO          is unreactive the higher pressure        should not have significantly affected the results It is        of course possible that at very low CO          pressures endospores might be more        sensitive to their environmental conditions than at one        atmosphere This experiment will require a more        sophisticated apparatus than is presently available to us        though we hope to obtain such equipment soon in order to        further examine this question        It is likely that liquid water exists at least        transiently on the surface of some locations on Mars            Because of the high reactivity of ferrate with water        especially under alkaline conditions it is likely that        these locations on Mars contain iron mostly in the        nontoxic FeIIIoxyhydroxide state Also endospores were        not killed by transient exposure to ferrate in the presence        of water at room temperature Thus the transient        occurrence of liquid water in the soils of Mars is        insufficient reason to reject the general conclusion that        if ferrate is present in the soils of Mars it probably is                   not          a sporocidal agent In locations where other forms of        iron dominate spores would be even more stable However        additional experiments looking at spore survival that        involve additions of small amounts of water eg  ww        to a Mars surrogate ferrateenriched soil with brief        fluxes of temperature between C and about C would be        useful to further address this question        Though UV light is a potent biocide and is present at        high levels on the Mars surface beneath the surface or        under objects such as rocks even the natural high flux of        ultraviolet radiation on Mars will likely be greatly        attenuated We tested this hypothesis confirming that        spores are protected from the UV flux even in the presence        of a strong soil oxidant permanganate by a few mm of        soil cover The UV light provided by a mercury vapor lamp        was not filtered to exactly duplicate its passage through        the atmosphere of Mars though this might be accomplished        with the appropriate apparatus eg an irradiated vacuum        chamber The intervening gas was normal air at about         oxygen  CO           and  N           This clearly did not filter enough        of the lethal wavelengths eg  nm to significantly        affect the strongly sporocidal quality of the light On        Mars however the thinner atmosphere might allow better        passage of other shorter lethal wavelengths eg around         nm that might be filtered to some extent under the        conditions used here However the likely effect of the        difference in light wavelength filtration on Mars         versus the experiments described here        would be the ultimate soil cover depth needed to protect        spores from UV damage and this difference is likely not to        be very large less than an order of magnitude Also some        endospores are considerably more UVresistant than those we        employed     and substitution of such spores likely        would have changed the results survival vs depth to some        degree The important observation is the demonstrated        protective effect of soil materials        Earthly life forms can produce dormancy structures that        are highly resistant to adverse environmental conditions        including the presence of chemical oxidants and ionizing        radiation conditions that are thought to occur on Mars        Bacterial endospores are a prime example of resistant        dormancy structures and recent research indicates that        such dormant forms of bacteria can survive for even        millions of years under appropriate conditions Cano and        Borucki    revived a bacterial spore from the abdominal        contents of extinct bees preserved for  to  million        years in buried Dominican amber and cultured and identified        it Greenblatt et al    reported successful culture        of bacteria from Israeli Lebanese lode amber dated at         million years old Vreeland et al    reported the        isolation and growth of a previously unrecognized        sporeforming bacterium a         Bacillus species designated         from a brine inclusion within a  millionyearold salt        crystal from the Permian Salado Formation Due to the        difficulty in absolutely excluding modern contamination as        sources of these isolates these reports have been        controversial However to date these claims have not been        invalidated     Thus even studies of earthly systems        indicate that under environmental conditions possibly less        life preserving than those encountered on Mars dormant        life forms may have survived on Earth for very long        periods even of geological time scales The most important        factor for such survival appears to be desiccation a        defining characteristic of amber earthly brines and much        of the Mars environment Though there apparently is water        in the soil of the polar regions of Mars Mars Odyssey        mission observations it is thought to be present as ice        and probably is not biologically available        Little work has been done in the study of microbial        survival in the extraterrestrial environment Horneck et        al    did observe survival of a significant fraction        of         Bacillus subtilis spores after         months of exposure to the space environment on board the        European Retrievable Carrier EURECA They exposed spores        of         Bacillus subtilis to space for about        two weeks in the BIOPAN facility of the European Space        Agency onboard the Russian Earthorbiting FOTON satellite        The spores were exposed under a variety of conditions in        dry layers without any protecting agent mixed with clay        red sandstone Martian analogue soil or meteorite powder        or in artificial meteorites cubes filled with clay and        spores in naturally occurring concentrations Unprotected        spores in layers open to space or behind a quartz window        were completely or nearly completely inactivated and        similarly low survival was obtained behind a thin layer of        clay acting as an optical filter Survival was increased by        five or more orders of magnitude when the spores in the dry        layer were directly mixed with powder of clay rock or        meteorites Up to  survival was reached in soil        mixtures with spores comparable to the natural soil to        spore ratio These data confirm the deleterious effects of        extraterrestrial solar UV radiation but also confirm that        thin layers of clay rock or meteorite can successfully        shield spores from UV damage if they are in direct contact        with the spores        Mileikowsky et al    considered the probability of        natural transfer of viable microbes from Mars to Earth in        meteoroids ejected from Mars during the period  Ga BP to        the present and during the  Ma from Ga  to  They        used NASAs HZETRN transport code to calculate        probabilities examining many variables potentially        affecting microbe survival The species modeled used the        environmentally robust bacteria         Bacillus subtilis sporeformer and         Deinococcus radiodurans highly        radiation resistant Their modeling suggested that if        microbes existed or exist on Mars viable transfer to Earth        is not only possible but also highly probable due to these        microbes impressive resistance to the hazards of space        transfer and to the dense traffic of Martian meteorites        that have fallen to Earth since the dawn of our planetary        system                    Conclusions        Here the hypothesis was examined that if the surface        soil of Mars contains significant amounts of ferrateVI        it will be selfsterilizing Dried but living dormant        endospores of         Bacillus subtilis were incubated in a        Mars surrogate soil containing  by weight of K          FeO           Incubation conditions similar to        those now on Mars dry cold and a CO          enriched atmosphere were used Under        these conditions the endospores were not immediately killed        but in fact were resistant to inactivation by the        ferrateenriched or permanganateenriched soil Figure         Though some delay in colony formation compared to controls        was observed upon addition of water prior to plate        counting the         Bacillus spores survived both storage        in a ferraterich soil and the brief simultaneous presence        of ferrate and water during analysis This simple        experiment indicates that ferrate does not necessarily        provide an environment that is selfsterilizing on        nongeological time scale        It is possible that a thin coating of ferric hydroxide        on the surface of our ferrate crystals might have afforded        some protection to the spores from ferrate exposure since        small traces of water vapor might still have been present        despite our attempt to exclude it However this coating        would likely be only a few angstroms thick ferrate was of        very high purity at   pure and probably was        insignificant compared to the overall amount of ferrate        present This is supported by the observation that the        presence of an alternative strong oxidant that does not        have the potential for such a coating permanganate        crystals at  ww final concentration also did not kill        the endospores supports this Figure         The finding that organic molecules were degraded only        after the addition of water to the soil also supports the        inactivity of ferrate under Mars conditions Significant        amounts of liquid water are thus required for ferrates        degradative or biocidal activities Ferrate must be in        solution in order to act as an oxidant Assuming the soil        of Mars contains about  by weight of water mostly in the        form of ice        complete thawing would fail        to approach the slurry conditions used here to accomplish        oxidation of TNT  mg surrogate soil   mg liquid        water Even these saturated conditions did not promote the        oxidation of hydrocarbons The traces of water  ppm        in the Martian atmosphere    might also form thin        layers of rust on soil particles there making the        surrogate soil system used here even more like the proposed        ferrateenriched soil of Mars The data Figure  show        that below the immediate surface high fluxes of UV        radiation in the presence of strong oxidants are attenuated        and are not sporocidal        If dormancy structures similar to endospores were        produced at some point by life forms on Mars data reported        here suggest they could still be present and viable This        might actually be demonstrated as in the surrogate soil        experiments described here with Martian soil samples        Rejuvenation experiments could be performed remotely         in situ or in a contained laboratory        setting after return of samples to Earth The first such        experiment in fact was essentially performed in the        original biology experiments aboard Viking though the        results were inconclusive The experiments need to be        repeated with modifications based on all we have learned        in the succeeding years There are now improved ways to        monitor microbial signatures and metabolic processes that        are indicative of life in soil       The fact that        spores appear to survive for many decades and perhaps        hundreds of millions of years in earthly systems further        supports the possibility for survival of similar life forms        on Mars The conditions on Mars might actually be even more        conducive than those on Earth for longterm survival of        such living entities because of the unique combination of        cold dehydration lack of oxygen and protection from        direct UV exposure        In the original Viking experiments where investigators        searched for organic compounds in Martian soil            four samples were examined one surface and one subsurface        sample from each of two locations        Gaschromatographymassspectrometry at a sensitivity of        parts per billion ppb for some compounds yielded negative        results Presumably if microorganisms had been present        organic compounds would have been detected However these        results suffer from the limitations of all negative        results They cannot prove the absence of life since there        was the inherent limitation of analytical sensitivity and        only two locations close to the landing site on the Martian        surface were examined One endospore weighs approximately         g Assuming there were one such spore per gram of        Martian soil and one could detect  of the organic        matter in that spore this would require an analytical        sensitivity of  ppb In reality the organic matter in a        cell or spore contains many classes of compounds with few        classes representing more than a few percent of the total        and considerably less than  efficiency in extraction        and detection is possible Thus the actual sensitivity        required for Viking to detect  spore  g of soil would        have been in the ppt range Detection of  spores  g        would have required at least  ppb sensitivity These        requirements are well below the sensitivity of the GCMS        used aboard Viking However techniques based on growing of        cells from spores or measuring their physiological activity        after germination not performed by Viking could provide a        sensitivity as low as a few spores  g of soil            It has been suggested that the oxidizing nature of the        Martian soil is due to the photochemical reactions that        create hydrogen peroxide and superoxides in the surface        soil Using data obtained from the Viking gas exchange        experiment and assuming that all oxygen came from H          O           the concentration range of hydrogen        peroxide has been calculated to be  ppm     Some        soil bacteria survive at a concentration of  ppm of H                 O              suggesting that presence of        this peroxide alone on Mars surface would not make the soil        selfsterilizing        Mars of course has been dry and cold for a very long        time and it is not possible to run experiments such as        ours over geologic time scales It may be that an oxidant        like ferrateVI might be biocidal over periods lasting        millions of years even in the dry coldstorage environment        of Mars However we conclude that the occurrence of        ferrateVI in Mars soils if present will not necessarily        promote immediate selfsterilization of the soils        The United States and other spacefaring nations are        required by treaty to protect Mars and other nonearthly        planetary systems from contamination by earthly        microorganisms Bacterial endospores that are particularly        resistant to agents such as disinfectants eg        vaporphase hydrogen peroxide extreme desiccation and        even gamma radiation are the most common contaminants found        on surfaces of cleaned spacecraft assembled in spacecraft        assembly clean rooms     These survivors include        cultivable species such as         Bacillus licheniformis B pumilus B        cereus  and         B circulans  as well as other        strains that have not yet been cultivated but can be        observed through their DNA S rDNA fingerprints From work        reported here it appears that such robust spores if        delivered to Mars on spacecraft could survive for        extended if not indefinite periods of time in the cold        dry preserving environment of Mars despite the presence        of strong oxidants in the soil This might compromise later        experiments aimed at detecting life on the Red Planet        andor influence its future ecology over geologic time        scales                    Methods                  Synthesis of potassium ferrate          Crimsoncolored FeVI as potassium ferrate K            FeO            was prepared and stored dry          according to the method of Thompson et al     Its          purity and state of oxidation was confirmed by an          oxidimetric titration using arsenitecerate method              This method measures only FeVI and V leaving any          ferric ions in the preparation unreduced The fresh K            FeO            was  pure                          Ferrate oxidation of organic moieties within a sand          matrix          Two sets of reaction mixtures were prepared Treatment          mixtures contained  mg of pure silica sand as a soil          surrogate about  mg K            FeO             and different amounts of the          nitrated organic compound trinitrotoluene TNT          amounts of TNT were    or  mg A control set          contained only TNT and sand All experiments were          prepared using four replicates All samples were twice          mixed by vortexing and centrifuged for  min at  kG in          order to remove reagents from walls of vials There was          no detectable reaction at this step To every vial  ul          of deionized water were added Reactants were mixed          centrifuged and incubated for  min at room          temperature After  min  ml of methanol was added          about  mg of sodium sulfate were later added to          remove water from the mixture After vortexing the          reaction mixture was centrifuged for  min at  kG          Supernatant was diluted  in methanol for electrospray          tandem massspectrometric analysis ESMSMS or  in          acetonitrile for gas chromatographymass spectrometry          GCMS analysis Similar experiments were performed          using hexadecane and dodecane                          Gas ChromatographyMass Spectrometry          GCMS was used for quantitative measurement of TNT and          hydrocarbon concentrations in soil extracts Sample           ul was injected into the GC using a HP  series          injector splitless injection The mass spectrometers          Hewlett Packard A scan range was from  to  Da          Temperature of the source was held at C and of the          quadropole at C The ion source was set on positive          electron impact ionization mode The temperature of the          injector on the gas chromatograph Hewlett Packard           series II and the MS interface was C For          separations we used a Phenomenex ZB column  m            mm   m The initial oven temperature was          C held for  minute This was increased C per min          until the final temperature of C which was held for           min Perfluorotributylamine was used for autotuning          the MS                          Preparation of a Mars surrogate soil          Pure silica sand Fisher was dried by heating          overnight at C and then stored in desiccators          containing calcium chloride Potassium ferrate was added          see below to a level of  ww and mixed thoroughly          into the sand to form a Mars surrogate soil The soil was          used for microbiological experiments as soon as possible          after preparation always less than  hours The second          soil was prepared similarly substituting KMnO            for K            FeO             Control soil contained only          sand                          Preparation of bacterial cells and          endospores          Our own laboratory strain of           Bacillus subtilis was grown in a          simple yeast extractbased broth through late logarithmic          phase of growth and allowed to sporulate The spores were          collected by centrifugation washed twice with  mL of          sterile water freeze dried and stored under desiccation          until used The bacterial strain used is a typical           Bacillus subtilis strain and is          available from the corresponding author upon request                          Exposure of cells and spores to a simulated Martian          soil environment          Microbiological experiments were performed with data          points collected in triplicate using small microcosms          comprised of mL serum bottles Surrogate soil           mgmicrocosm and spores about    per gram of soil          were placed together into the bottles To ensure complete          mixing and uniform exposure of all cells or spores to the          ferrate component of the soil they were first suspended          in a small amount of sterile water This was thoroughly          mixed into the sand fraction of the surrogate soil which          was then lyophilized The ferrate component of the          surrogate soil was next thoroughly mixed into the          microbeenriched dry sand within a sterile laminarflow          hood and the bottles were flushed with pure CO            and sealed with sterile stoppers and          crimp seals The CO            was provided from a bottle of          reagentgrade carbon dioxide  purity as          compressed gas and was scrubbed to remove traces of          oxygen and water The microcosms were sparged with          multiple volumes of gas under normal atmospheric          pressure The sealed microcosms were immediately placed          in a freezer at C Periodically triplicate bottles          were removed and opened for analysis A small amount of          water  ml was added and  ml of the suspension was          quickly removed using an aseptic technique and spread          onto a plate of nutrient agar Difco The plates were          incubated at C and then examined periodically for          outgrowth of           Bacillus subtilis colonies Plates          were inoculated in triplicate and colonyforming units          determined after  hours and again after  hours of          incubation Controls without ferrate were run          simultaneously Similar experiments were performed after          replacing ferrate with an equal amount of potassium          permanganate                          Protection of spores in dry soil from killing by          surface UV irradiation in the presence of           permanganate          A surrogate soil containing  by weight          permanganate in sand was inoculated with spores of           Bacillus subtilis and placed within          a Forma Scientific UVilluminated laminarflow hood under          its full UV illumination and in the presence of air for           hours The open surface of the microcosm was placed          approximately  cm from the watt mercury vapor light          source The hood is calibrated annually for          effectiveness and under these conditions will produce           per cm spore kill on a metal surface within  hours          Then exposure samples were removed progressively from the          surface in  mm increments and plate counts performed for          surviving spores Data represent counts from three          replicates Error bars show one standard deviation          Untreated controls taken at time  contained about             spores in a similar size
