                                 Byrd Call            The papers lead with Sen Robert Byrds announcement that hell make amotion to dismiss President Clintons impeachment trial next week            Byrd described in the usual way as the silverhaired allbutmarbledrepository of Constitutional wisdom and defender of Senate prerogatives wasbasically just counting votes He said that there werent enough to convictand witnesses werent going to change anything But as the Washington Post puts it Byrd has been one of the Senatestoughest critics of Clintons behavior in the Lewinsky scandal and virtuallyevery scenario for convicting the president has included the yearold WestVirginian defecting from the Democratic camp Republicans were disappointedThe Post gave prominent play to Rep Henry Hydes frustrated ripostefrom the floor of the Senate Youre saying I guess that perjurys okay ifits about sex that obstruction is okay            The New YorkTimes and the Los Angeles Times put Byrds bombshell in the context ofmoves by members of both parties to get things over with Republican OrrinHatch the papers report said that the Senate should hear witnesses andadjourn the trial letting the House vote stand as the highest form ofcondemnation The LAT lead says that the impeachment case appeared tolose significant ground The NYT says the Senate appeared hungrierthan ever for a graceful exit from a potentially prolonged trial            No one predicts that Byrds motion will pass The LAT main story isthe clearest about how the surprise announcement was made in a press releasedistributed in the Senate gallery            There are two key subordinate trial stories The Post s second leadand the NYT s third story the LAT ran it inside details alegal subplot complete with a walkon by Ken Starr The House managers want ateteatete with Monica Lewinsky but she wont talk to them Lewinskyslawyers say she doesnt want to help either side The managers called inStarr to make her late yesterday Starr asked a US district court to revokeLewinskys immunity agreement if she doesnt play ball with Hyde and Co JudgeNorma Holloway Johnson will decide over the weekend            The other story addresses how the trial in the Senate progressed TheLAT and WP segue into it after the big Byrd news the NYToffers its usual RW Apple In the Chamber report All three papers enjoy theoddness of the proceeding wherein Senators forbidden to speak had to submitwritten queries to Chief Justice Rehnquist through their party leaders But allagree that the Senators used the opportunity almost exclusively to lob softballquestions some of them prearranged            Over the last few weeks a story about the Chief Justice has rarely beencomplete without a reference to the zeal with which he enforces time limits onoral arguments in the Supreme Court Hes often described as cutting attorneysoff mid syllable when the clock runs out The papers with perhaps a bit ofdisappointment note his uncharacteristic laxness on this point as he presidedover a day of questioning that was supposed to consist of fiveminuteresponses The first answer went on for nine minutes            The Post has a perhapstoofriendly story about the Pope whosvisiting Mexico To understand the significance of this pontiff it helps tosee him through his own eyes and measure him by the yardstick of churchhistory The LAT is more probing about his effect on the churchsinfrastructure in Latin America He wiped out the liberation theology movementwhich had enlivened the church particularly by attracting new clergy Nowtheyre low on priests and capitalism stands rampant with its attendant onuson the poor A gently critical NYT oped piece by a professor namedJorge G Castaneda makes the same point            The two Times see the Olympics scandal spreading past Salt Lake Cityand touching next summers games in Sydney The papers report that gifts fromthat city to two African International Olympic Committee members in  mayhave tipped the balance in a close vote that saw the Australians beat outBeijing by but two votes The WP limns the pampered lives of IOCofficials who jet around the world in firstclass comfort accumulatinglargess in the form of medical treatment college tuition and slick landdeals Most amusing example the case of the Koreans representativesdaughter a budding concert pianist with a knack for scoring highprofile gigsin upcoming sites for the Games            From the footnotetohistory department comes a WP story about theRichard Nixon estates campaign to be compensated for papers taken by thegovernment after Nixon resigned The estate is asking for  millioncounting accrued interest Specifically it wants  for a confiscatedfile of telegrams and letters sent in response to Nixons famous SilentMajority speech Alexander Butterfield the aide who stunned Watergateinvestigators with news of Nixons taping system a quarter of a century agoyesterday testified that the massive response to the speech was fabricatedThis was known already though the Post doesnt say so But Butterfieldnow  and sporting a watch with a picture of Nixon meeting Elvis Presley onit has the details He said he enlisted help before the speech from laborunions the VFW William Casey and even H Ross Perot who said hed bring alocomotive full of mail into Union Station He did generate a lot of mailButterfield is
