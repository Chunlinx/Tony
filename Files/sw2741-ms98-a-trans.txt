        okay   alrighty i think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that theyve changed from homemaker to the work market  and for several reasons probably some of that is divorce   umhum   and some is theyre more educated than they used to be i think   umhum   um i think sometimes uh leaders in government theyve become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time have more women in government   umhum umhum   and now ill let you say something     well uh i probably a little bit older than you are so what i see um is the change that i see the most is the is that um women have much more many more occupations and careers to choose from than when i went went to college when i went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary or but there were very few women in business at that time a few but they were the oddity and   very limited   yes and now i see and and i see for my daughter which is wonderful  shes thirteen and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from so many different jobs which i think is terrific because   uhhuh yes   im a teacher and i mean i love teaching but though i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better and um   umhum   not that i would give the career up because its its a safe career plus because i always have a job plus i am a single parent too and i and i need the income   umhum right   but uh and i think thats a reason why a lot of women have have started to work too is because economically its just a must   i think thats right   uh you just its very difficult to get along on one income unless uh the male uh has an extraordinarily good job   umhum   and especially men who teach school they dont make that much money and and most all they always either have theyre either moonlighting or else their their wife works too   right   um its just an economic need now   i really think women have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything   oh definitely   and like you said um one women today have so many uh the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head is just really um   umhum   so commonplace nowadays   oh yes exactly we have uh quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents and   uhhuh   uh the majority is uh married couple with children but still theres a lot more than there used to be and see you never picture yourself in a situation like this when i married i thought id be married the rest of my life   right right   and uh but im all im really grateful that i went to college my mother always said you know get an education in case you need one because my father died when we were i have a twin sister and we were eleven when he died she had a nursing degree and she was able to make it but she said in just you never know whats going to happen and i thank God that i did go to college and got a degree because otherwise i dont know how i would be able to raise my children   umhum you know isnt that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve and my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession and was isnt that funny   isnt that something yes   uh but just that they were able to do it you know and even today i think the chance for education is is so much uh better for all of our girls and and boys too but but the girls especially   yes oh yes yeah i do too but i think it needs to continue to change and i mean i think it theres still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women i think that the we still have a long way to go   a lot of things yeah   umhum and i think that uh uh i think by the year two thousand it were going to see  some a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs and hold positions that men   right   men do because they can do it just as well you know if they want to dedicate their uh most of their time to that theyre theyre they can do it   yeah and i also think that in the future that uh its gonna continue that were not gonna see a lax off of women in the work force i think theyre going to stay there and i think that theyre gonna   humum   uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be the top people in their in their field   exactly exactly and i think thats the way it should be i think it i mean not that i i think that im equal to men because theres a lot of things that men can do that i   oh i think so   could never do strengthwise and so forth but also theres some things women can do like have children that men cant do   right   right   so you know it it i dont want i dont want to be equal but i i want to be i want  to get what i deserve and i want to be able to be on the same level with them if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay you know   exactly exactly   yeah and i just im not a womens libber i really am not but i i think that well that we have just as many rights as they do and i feel like if theres a qualified woman to do the job and if shes good or better than a man then she they should get the job with the same pay   thats right and i think that is happening more and more i think its just gonna take a little bit longer   i do too oh i do too definitely definitely   well great okay   well it was good to talk to you   good to talk to you Sally thanks byebye   all right byebye
