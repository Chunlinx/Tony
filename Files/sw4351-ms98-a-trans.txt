        home  because im         leaving from work   yeah   okay well uh i dont know if i mentioned to you last time we talked but uh i just recently retired from the Army active duty twenty years and of course when youre active duty military you are required to not only to maintain a certain level of uh weight and physical fitness   um   but youre required to take a what we call a P T test physical uh physical training test uh twice a year   uhhuh   so we were constantly expected to exercise and be in shape and then we had specific standards we had to meet based on our age group   right   and if you didnt pass the test  then they put you on what they called remedial P T and every morning you have to go to the company and jog in formation  in which really did not prepare you for the next physical fitness test but was more a form of punishment   right   right         well so now that youre out of that what what sort of regime do you keep up with   what do i do now well as the result of that i really got to enjoy uh long uh distance running   uhhuh   and so i i trained quite regularly and i i raced quite often i tried to do like a ten kilometer foot race uh once a month or so   oh wow   now that i am out i pretty much kept with it until i got a job in Virginia and i live in Maryland   uhhuh   and so by the time i i get up early and drive and hour to an hour and a half here which is about fifty miles work all day  fifty miles back on the Capitol Beltway and of course its dark by the time i get home and   yeah yeah   so i have to admit  that i i have fallen off uh slightly         or maybe even considerably or maybe even completely       and uh so i am not doing much now which concerns me because i just had my forty ninth birthday   uhhuh   so i want to keep at it because i know that if you dont uh theres theres lots of problems that you can have   definitely   yeah and so uh i want to get back at it as soon as spring breaks and uh but what we have done is uh decreased considerably the amount of fat that we consume in our diet   right uhhuh   and uh how about yourself   well i i generally play tennis two or three times a week   um uhhuh   and thats thats by enlarge about the only form of exercise i get but when i go out and play i generally play for two or three hours at a time   uhhuh um so you have a good sustained work out   so yeah so that thats thats quite strenuous for that long of a period   yeah oh yeah yeah thats that is a long time to have  at it but thats of course uh uh theres a lot of sudden fast changes in direction and i dont know does that cause you any injuries or anything   um not not generally i i uh  the few times i try and play basketball it seems like i always always sprain an ankle or twist a finger or something   no uhhuh right either an elbow in the eye   uh but tennis is not quite as extreme and i dont seem to have any uh injuries like that   right uhhuh the nice thing i liked about foot racing was that uh for me it was pretty much non competitive uh i didnt have to worry so much about being a part of a team or anything and so i could just compete against myself or the clock or the next guy ahead of me   right   and uh that fulfilled my urge to compete while at the same time keeping me fit   right   but i did uh i had the privilege of going to what the Army calls our master fitness trainer course which was uh a month long course at Fort Ben Harrison Indiana and i learned a lot from that about uh the difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise   uhhuh   that sort of thing and so at least from that i  i realize the importance of it   right   and uh   have you noticed any changes since youve started reducing the fat content of your diet   uh not so much that but i have noticed a difference because i am not exercising as much anymore in the uh in my heart rate which slowly creeps up as you get less and less fit   uhhuh right   and uh i havent weighed myself in a good while  but uh uh i just had a recently had a physical and they said that my uh triglycerides and the cholesterol and all that were in in pretty good shape and my wife uh was keeping real close track of it because she uh wanted to see what effect it would have on her and it she showed a significant improvement   huh   through just simple things like youre going for low fat lunch meats for uh when we bring our lunches to work and uh   yeah   uh matter of fact ive very seldom uh use uh sugar or salt either uh it takes a little getting use to   yeah   but uh uh skim milk is what we drink now and that took a little getting use to   right   but uh we have well at least she has noticed a significant change in her in her cholesterol and uh and triglycerides which is which is good   yeah thats encouraging   yeah and uh so shes slowly working herself into a uh a moderate fitness program
