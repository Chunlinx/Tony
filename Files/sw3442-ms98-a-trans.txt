              okay   um they said to discuss the type of novels i read for enjoyment i like mysteries i i i really enjoy a good mystery i   uhhuh   im not into the gory bloody type murder things but  i like a mystery to curl up with at night and um do you enjoy mysteries   well i do i dont read much of them i i i tend to watch movie mysteries more than read mysteries i read other types of books but whos your favorite author in terms of mysteries   oh uhhuh uhhuh well i enjoy Victoria Holt i like you know that that era and that type of a a setting so i i that the the type of area that i read um what kind of books do you enjoy   uhhuh umhum well  my my books are a little bit more uh  different than that um i tend to um right now i i do a lot of um reading of the mystic um Catholic i do a lot of Catholic saints uh i do a lot of mystic um the   umhum umhum   the ancient um writings and ive been doing a lot of that kind of reading and um so like Saint Francis of Assisi and Teresa Viola um   oh oh uhhuh uhhuh   Teresa Saint John of the cross um those kinds of of writings uh sort sort of um old spiritual leaders um   oh thats oh thats great   its been real fascinating and   boy it sounds fascinating   that thats been a lot of my reading for the past number of years and then i read contemporary people um   umhum   who um combine religion and psychology and thats been an interest of mine and so   umhum oh   right now im currently reading a man named Morton Kelsey and uh his his a book on it called Transcend and its a story its about prayer and um and it sort of combines uh some of the old um with the new   uhhuh oh oh uhhuh   so uh i   well thats fascinating   yeah i do that kind of reading although i do do some uh casual reading my reading lately has been fairly heavy but um   that sounds heavy  in fact it   it is yes but i just read ive read Prince of Tides have you you know thats going to be a new movie and   uhhuh uhhuh yes   thats a good book if you yeah very good book   is it oh   i would highly recommend it um its not a mystery uh it it is of sorts and its its really its its fiction but its an excellent book i   uhhuh umhum uhhuh oh thats interesting i it sounds like my my novels that i read i dont do that real often im like you im more into the selfhelp help and the um of course child rearing i like to read about that i have four children and and i like religious books also and um you know that thats interesting that that you read those type things are they are they hard to understand   it depends i think ive ive learned through the years different books speak to different people and i say you know my recommendation is for people to try it and if if they can understand it theyre supposed to read it and if they cant you know then dont try   umhum put it away for another time umhum   umhum because i really do think it depends on on where people are at the particular time as to whether or not they can read it and for me on certain books speak to me and certain books do not so you know i i it   hm oh   and i just think not every book is for every person these are not like you know best sellers so um   uhhuh i agree uhhuh now when you go to the do you get them from the library or   i tend to buy them at a place here called Dallas Books and it has wonderful um   oh     wonderful books and i tend to get them there i have i have a fairly expensive library now of   boy   of things that i have read um another person whos wonderful whos more contemporary but who has recently died is Thomas Murtin and if youve read any of he was a Cistercian monk   uhhuh oh oh   and his writings are wonderful and he was a prolific writer and uh youll see if you know the name youll see it quoted often um and and he   huh     hes really quite good and i think his books are a a tad easier to read you know i think thats a good place to start   oh uhhuh   um have you read Scott Peck thats another good place   no i havent   he wrote this this is what started me on all of it was The Road Less Traveled that was a thats been a best seller   oh oh yes im familiar that now im familiar with the title i wasnt familiar with his with his name but   well he um hes wonderful and i recommend that book to anyone   umhum   um that is a great place to start and so its called The Road Less Traveled   oh oh ill have to do that   wonderful book if youre into religious reading um   uhhuh   and psychology it hes hes a psychiatrist and he was converted late kind of late in life and its sort of his story and its quite good um   oh oh huh now do you um when do you do your reading do you   at night i tend to read at night umhum i have i have two children but theyre eleven eleven eleven and fifteen so   at night thats when i do   oh theyre a little bit older   how old are your children   well six months and three years and six years and eight years  so thats the only time i have to read is late at night and sometimes im too tired to do that  but i do love to read yes i am uhhuh   oh goodness you dont have time to do anything i bet i bet now are you Mormon okay i i just assumed that because youre from Utah but uh   yes yes i
