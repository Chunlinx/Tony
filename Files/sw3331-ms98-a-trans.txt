        well what i believe is one of the major problems uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough       discipline and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh i agree with that     uh when i went to school i know i was scared to death   you were   about being disciplined and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school its just totally different   uhhuh uhhuh   you know you just you did not see i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom   yeah yeah yeah from what i understand they act up pretty bad   yeah  thats right thats right   what uh grade is your daughter in   my my daughters in the um fourth grade and um theres children in her classroom that just totally disrupt   umhum umhum umhum umhum   the classroom where the teacher cannot teach and when i went to school that just wasnt put up with   yeah oh no huhuh they always had paddle in our school   uhhuh well they they they just dont do that anymore the the school systems afraid of getting sued and um   i know umhum   all sorts of lawsuits im sure because of things like that and i also believe we dont   yeah yeah   even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid and we still dont have enough money towards putting toward public schools   umhum umhum umhum   and um i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that can solve some of our problems   yeah wasnt that what part of the lotterys gonna go for if we approve it uhhuh uhhuh   yes  supposedly thats what its suppose to go for and you know well just have to wait and see whether thats proved or not you know i dont know your feelings toward that i guess we shouldnt get into that but um  and what else um           i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire   umhum   i have heard stories um from other parents that i know of when their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs   umhum no really ooh   oh yeah oh ive ive heard some horrible horrible stories about high school high school teachers and you know to be more be more careful of the teachers that we place in our schools   umhum umhum hm   um thats basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school systems i think with what they have to work with i think theyre doing a pretty good job right now     oh i do too i think theyre doing real good job   uhhuh so   but then what do i know i dont have any kids  no none at all   you dont have any children in school you dont have any kids  yeah okay so this is probably a real hard subject for you   oh yeah  so   yeah  okay well i guess um we can discontinue our call now it was a joy in talking with you   okay well its good talking to you too well see you byebye   okay thanks byebye
