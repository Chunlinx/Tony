        how did you all get tied up with this uh TI system   oh did you already dial one   yeah i just dial one   were being recorded already   yeah   okay uh were supposed to be discussing our homes   yeah but what what uh what did you uh are you with TIer or how did you get tied up with this   oh its a uh long story but uh lets discuss about our homes um  what kind of home do you live in   uh i guess a typical home here is without a uh uh basement i guess thats the classical uh   raised style   yeah uh we have something here we have something here you may not have up there which is a well we we were phasing them out is the wood shingle roof i dont know if you had it when i first got here   uhhuh my parents live huh where did you got get there from   from New Jersey   all right   uh   i new you didnt have a Texas accent   right no i im my accents gone ive practiced a long time to get rid of it uh   uhhuh uhhuh   the the wood shingle roofs are phasing out here theyre very theyre good for airconditioning you know they they   i hear you   its you its very shocking when you look inside the attic and on a dry day and see a hundred little or thousands of little light wholes you know   i would imagine so   it its very strange and then when of course when it rains then it then it then it stretches   uhhuh   and does a pretty good job but uh the the fire hazard has is   uhhuh uhhuh i would imagine   phasing that kind of construction out it its so   so what kind of home do you live in   oh its a rent its a multistorey uh last year uh luckily   oh a colonial style two story   no colonial is not the word had they use here uh thats   multistorey is what they call them   a multilevel its called multilevel   okay   it it its not its not really that typical its a custom home   uhhuh   uh i live in Arlington actually this im working tonight actually in Dallas uh   uhhuh uhhuh   at TI here   oh you work at TI   oh yeah   so thats how you got hooked up to this   oh yeah   you know you know you can converse with the person for a while and get to know them before you punch the one you dont have to get started on the conversation right away   oh yeah your right your right   well anyway um well uh   how many calls have you made uh have you   oh i dont know several eleven twelve thirteen i guess   oh really everyone everyones higher than i am   well i havent made the calls mostly ive just uh i answered them i live in a two story type colonial here in Maryland   yeah that that i heard i know those words from the east when i was there but that they dont use that word here   yeah well most the homes here are two story because uh they stack them up since the property is so expensive at least in the Maryland area where i am   do you have a basement   yeah   oh yeah thats typical up there to you know   yeah well like i say the land here and depending on where you are and how crowded it is the land bays go up and here a little old measly quarter of an acre goes from anywhere from four to five thousand to a hundred and some odd thousand depending on where it is   oh yeah no the land is much cheaper here   and if youre in a fairly decent subdivision which i guess maybe im in a fairly middleclass subdivision then the general trend is to put as much house as you can on a quarter acre it took me a long time to get used to it coming from down south up here big big houses on little bitty postage stamp lots   yeah   but uh thats the general way they uh they build them here so you get about a twenty two hundred to three thousand square foot home depending on whether you include the basement or not   yeah   uh on about a quarter of an acre or less about ten thousand square feet   yeah the lots arent very big here either in the Dallas uh Fort Worth area   uhhuh uhhuh   uh but the basement there just arent any basements i dont know of anyone ever even thought of putting a basement in here   huh well they use slab foundations or do they use block foundations or the little   uh it used to be a pier and beam where they would drill piers and and the first you would have a crawl space underneath your house but thats phased out in the last twenty five years where its all slab   crawl space okay slabs are easier and quicker to pour and lay i guess   yeah and uh they they say that the the reason they dont put pier i think its cheaper like you say but uh the soil does move a lot here and they say that you just couldnt uh   uh uhhuh   put a basement in the soil but id think they just to me i dont know really know why it wouldnt work i think you can put a basement in anywhere its just not not popular   i see what to dig out for it   yeah really   do you have high water tables   no no its not very high some of the water here   so its just a matter they just dont do it   yeah this is Dallas there the waters down two thousand feet   uhhuh well of course down there you probably dont have land as quite as much a premium so you can sprawl a big rancher out   yeah i guess its the style i really dont have an answer here because of the tornado i always thought tornados uh i thought people would build a lot of storm cellars you know or shelters you know but even that is not uh popular at all i dont know i dont know of anyone doing that uh   yeah yeah uhhuh   uh i dont even see it in the newspaper where people advertise that they have storm cellars or anything they just dont have them period   uhhuh i understand well uh you say you live in a ranch style house yourself   yeah its its multilevel yeah like my garage i have uh uh a bedroom over   well now is it like a split level   split level yeah   in other words youve got some bedrooms above say a garage area and then the living room dining room area is halfway between both you go down steps to your garage and maybe a family room down there and you go up the steps to your bedroom   right right exactly right right right   okay thats what they call a split level up here and a split foyer is where all the steps are at the entrance way if you know what i mean   yeah yeah   thats a split foyer type and then uh a colonial is where they stack it on top of each other and you pretty well have most of your living space on the first floor like uh a family room or uh you know something like that and the dining room area and a living room and maybe a a kitchen with a possible little eat in area or somethi ng like that   whats your typical heating up there in Maryland gas or   well uh you  ive been through two or three different things of them first house i came up here had gas heat with electric stove then the second house i owned had gas heat and gas stove and uh   uhhuh   um even gas water heater whereas my previous home it had electric water heater anyway and then the house im in now is all   yeah   uh electric it even has a heat pump   oh really   yeah and uh   well heat pumps nice up there it would probably work pretty well   well heat pumps do work pretty well up here its taking them a few years to get the bugs out of them but uh   yeah thats true   they they finally seem to work quite well and i would imagine down where you all live heat pumps will work quite well or maybe down there all you need is just airconditioning thats all   well they should yeah because its warmer in the winter or you have less of a winter down here of course its a short winter but it does get down to five degrees uh occasionally   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   but uh i dont really know if heat pumps are that popular yet i guess uh i dont i havent been that close to it in the newer homes   well i would imagine all you need is just airconditioning   yeah we we have heat uh some have airconditioning units i i i have an all electric house but uh its fifty fifty theres a lot of gas houses here uh because its so popular   uhhuh oh thats right youre youre in the oil state so i would imagine theres plenty of gas around so thats the way to go for heat   oh yeah people i think probably prefer natural gas for for heating   yeah uhhuh i would too because me i like gas heat i love it   i dont im an engineer and i dont like the danger of it ive seen too many houses here blowup and i think yeah and i just think   oh really   when i had i had uh a gas uh uh fireplace you know i had and i saw the way it was constructed yeah it went over my daughters bedrooms you know over the garage i thought and theres theres just too many fittings in this thing to leak and so i just disconnected i never did hook that sucker up so i just took it out completely   uhhuh gas logs uhhuh uhhuh   although people love gas here but i im ultraconservative on safety and i just dont dont want it   uh umhum uhhuh well i dont mind electric heating and and the like its okay i mean i i like gas heat because its so nice and warm but when it comes to cooking i cook i just absolute think a gas stoves the best that money can buy   yeah well ive heard people   you just cant beat cooking on gas   yeah ive heard people say that i and i   that flame man is hard to beat because you can regulate it and i mean you you want to turn the flame down on the stove you turn it down right now you dont have to wait for a cool down time which you have to rely on with uh conventional stove or or a warmup time i mean its instantly there   yeah yeah right   and that kind of response is quite uh quite effective i think for cooking   oh yeah no i ive ive known people love it for years and uh but uh weve done without it for twenty years here and and uh   uhhuh yeah well ive done without it too but i sure prefer it my wife does too   yeah yeah no i i havent i havent really noticed uh i dont miss it you know with our of course im against im just im one of the   yeah uhhuh   a million people that uh is against uh gas   well do your houses down there have porches or are they just pretty much like just a front door and thats it   no no theres not much in front theres no sitting out front you know theres no like like in the east when i was young   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   of course it goes way back we used to sit out front i had a porch up front but no theres not a porch   yeah arent they nice   yeah yeah oh yeah   theyre sort of coming back up here in the east   i i i wish i had that you know   front porches are theyre not very big but theyre kind of coming back   right i i think the old ways in a lot of uh ways should come back uh   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh but i really love a screened in porch outback man i just eat that up   but no the yeah no that there its not popular here either screens in screen in is not that thats so thats uh   huh well dont you all have mosquitoes down there   not like not like you have up there no   really   its too dry its so dry that its uh   thats surprising   Dallas is super dry   hm how far are you guys from the coast down there where uh uh what is it uh   uh three hundred miles yeah   oh are you thats a pretty good piece then   yeah   i didnt know you were that far inland i knew it was a ways but   our our weather is like we have a we have a the warm raining season is now is April   uhhuh uhhuh   and a little bit of May an then it goes into super dry all summer then you summer with a hurricane season but   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh well tell me uh do your homes down there pretty much have garage disposals and things like that   yeah yeah they have everything   they do are yall on septic or yall have public sewage   no public theres essentially no septic not in Dallas Fort Worth though you have it in the out lying areas but uh   uhhuh oh they use one and two car garages or just one car garages or carports   two two no not carports uh its essentially garages   okay so they do go garage because i lived down south for a long time carports were real popular in certain areas where i   yeah not Dallas uh Fort Worth is you know the two car garage and certainly all airconditioned uh   used to live uhhuh uhhuh   uh uh two thousand square feet is probably i dont know if thats average or not   about how much floor space yeah that sounds about average i think all over the country   yeah uh i i think so too theres a lot of swimming pools here i dont have one uh   yeah oh really i dont either i hate to clean the rascals i had a i had a pool outback behind my previous house one of those
