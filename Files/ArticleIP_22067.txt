                                  Advise and Consent Also Obstruct Delay and Stymie            Five months ago the USSentencing Commission achieved something remarkable Chairman Richard Conaboyresigned leaving the sevenmember commission with exactly zero members Sincethen President Clinton has nominated no one to fill the empty seats Thecommission still has more than  employees  million to spend and noauthority at all over federal sentencing policy            Nor has the presidentnominated anyone to replace China Ambassador Jim Sasser who returns home inMay According to MSNBC and the New York Times  at least six grayeminences including former Rep Lee Hamilton former National Security AdviserAnthony Lake and former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John Shalikashvilihave turned down the job The president did manage to send the Senate RichardHolbrookes nomination as UN ambassador in February eight months after theprevious UN delegate left and eight months after Clinton announced he wouldnominate Holbrooke Not that Holbrooke will be taking office any time soonSen Jesse Helms RNC refuses to schedule a confirmation hearing for himtill the administration agrees to Helms UN reform package            Holbrooke at least will get a hearing someday InFebruary the president again nominated Bill Lann Lee as assistant attorneygeneral for civil rights a nomination the Senate has refused to consider forthe past two years Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah sayshe wont hold any hearing on Lees nomination            The appointments processis a perennial source of indignation for googoos Even so it seemsparticularly grim these days There are different explanations for the variousholdups abovethe sentencing commission is empty because Democratic andRepublican senators failed for months to compromise on a slate of nomineesHolbrookes nomination was delayed by an almostbutnotentirely meritlessethics charge the Beijing job is difficult to fill because no one wants todefend Clintons China policy to Senate Republicans etcbut together theysuggest a process that is astonishingly screwed up            The time it takes presidents to confirm nominees has soaredin recent years On average it took Clinton more than eight and a half monthsto confirm his initial appointees up from five months for Ronald Reagan andless than three for John Kennedy According to ranking Judiciary CommitteeDemocrat Sen Pat Leahy DVt it now takes more than  days for the Senateto confirm a federal judicial nominee up from  days in  and only days in  One judge waited more than three years for confirmation It takeseight to  months for the average ambassadorial nomination to be approved Theadministration is overflowing with unconfirmed acting officials A survey found that acting officials hold about  percent of jobs reserved forpresidential appointees            Some of this mess is to be expected Fillingpositions is always a hassle during the last years of a twoterm presidency Noone wants to chuck a good career for a lameduck job And a divided governmentinevitably slows confirmations Republican senators are more skeptical ofClinton appointees than Democrats are            But the screwiness ofthe process runs deeper and almost everyone in Washington deserves a share ofthe blame Clinton especially early in his term has taken endless months tonominate candidates for critical executive branch and judicial openings Theconfirmation process has become massively politicized Elections no longersettle anything says Colby College Professor G Calvin Mackenzie the leadingauthority on the appointments process What used to be the normthat thepresident wins the election and appoints his peopleis no longer Now thelosing party continues to fight through the appointments process            All Cabinetlevel appointees are now fair game for aconfirmation challenge The deference the Senate used to grant subCabinetnominees is vanishing too Senators have increasingly deployed secret holdsto delay confirmations often for reasons having nothing to do with a nomineesqualifications Helms for example held up numerous ambassadorial appointmentsto pressure Clinton to reorganize the State Department Committee chairs alsorefuse to schedule confirmation hearings Helms again derailed William Weldsnomination as ambassador to Mexico by refusing to let Weld testify Theconfirmation process is nasty and brutish without being short as AnthonyLake quipped after his nomination as CIA director went down in flames            The number ofpresidential appointees has multipliedincluding judges there are more than five times as many as in Kennedys timemaking it difficult for theSenate to find time to consider everyone Cumbersome ethics rules have madesimply accepting a nomination onerous Health and Human Services SecretaryDonna Shalala had to pay accountants  just to complete her financialdisclosure forms Nominees usually have to give up their lucrative lawpractices and businesses as they await confirmation a sacrifice that leavesthem without income for months or years            It was not always this way Until the late s the Senatewas deferential to the many fewer presidential nominees It did much moreconsenting than advising Abe Fortas  nomination as chief justice of theSupreme Court which Republicans delayed to death marked the first sign ofchange but Robert Borks  Supreme Court nomination truly ushered in theera of appointments warfare Since Bork partisan interest groups andgrandstanding senators have freely challenged even obscure nominees            You can make a case thatthe appointments mess is more aesthetic than substantive The Senate afterall is apparently nearing a compromise on the sentencing commission and thepresident will likely nominate seven new commissioners in the next few weeksHolbrookes UN nomination may be iced by Helms for a bit longer but everyoneagrees that he will be confirmed The administration will find a China envoyLee has already been serving as acting assistant attorney general for months If the Senate refuses to hold a confirmation hearing he will continuein that acting job till the end of Clintons presidency These are theexceptions Most nominees are confirmed smoothly And whether or not all theright jobs are filled with exactly the right people the United States stillmanages to negotiate with China and the United Nations the civil rightsdivision still manages to file cases and judges still manage to imposesentences            But the rising obstructionism does damage governmentPresidents who are elected to remake executive policy find themselveshamstrung Career civil servants act in place of unconfirmed presidentialappointees The career folks are unwilling and unable to impose the policychanges the president may want The president often skirts the law byappointing acting officials who act for years such as Lee depriving theSenate of its constitutional right to approve appointments The eternalshortage of judges means that some cases are adjudicated peremptorily Thepresidentand this has been especially true of Clintonfrequently nominatesthe least offensive nominee rather than the most qualified in order to pacifythe Senate The endless obstacles to confirmation deter the best candidatesAccording to Mackenzie the presidential personnel office must frequently offera job to its fourth or fifth choice because the top candidates dont want toendure the inconvenience            The googoos would cut the number of presidentialappointments by a third or more lessening the burden on the Senate andallowing the president to pick better candidates They would eliminatesenatorial holds They would simplify background investigations and financialdisclosures These are promising and admirable ideasmodest solutions to amodest problem Appointment and confirmation is a political process and likeany political process it will always be messy But it doesnt have to bethis messy
