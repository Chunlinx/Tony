                    Background        Regulation of DNAdependent processes such as        transcription replication and strand repair requires        bending and unwinding of compacted chromatin structure        Many of these structural changes are mediated by high        mobility group HMG proteins a diverse superfamily of        nonhistone chromosomal proteins that were originally        classified by their electrophoretic mobility     HMG        proteins contain DNAbinding domains that allow them to        produce specific changes in target DNA structure             Three structurally distinct classes of HMG proteins have        been defined the HMGnucleosomal binding family the        HMGAThook family and the HMGbox family whose canonical        members are referred to as HMGN HMGA and HMGB        respectively     In addition a large number of        proteins have been found that contain HMG protein related        motifs        All members of the HMGbox family possess a  amino        acid DNAbinding domain the HMGbox related to a motif        originally identified in HMGB     The HMGbox may also        be involved in proteinprotein interactions For example        RAG has been reported to interact with the tandem        HMGboxes of HMGB or HMGB     Where it has been        studied HMGboxes have been shown to be structurally        related forming three helices in a characteristic        Lshaped structure      The distortion of DNA by the        HMGbox is primarily mediated through contacts with the        minor groove of the DNA helix potentially allowing        simultaneous binding of other transcriptional regulators to        the DNA      The HMGbox family has often been        subdivided based on DNA binding properties One group of        HMGbox proteins recognizes structural features of DNA with        low or absent sequence specificity These proteins have        broad tissue distribution and typically contain multiple        HMGbox motifs The second group of HMGbox proteins        recognizes DNA in a sequencespecific manner akin to more        traditional transcription factors These proteins have a        restricted pattern of expression and typically contain only        one HMGbox     Members of both groups of HMGbox        proteins also bind altered nucleic acid structures such as        way junctions      and cisplatinated DNA                   HMGbox family proteins are found in a variety of        eukaryotic organisms and most are known or suspected        regulators of gene expression We recently identified a        gene designated         Tox for thymocyte        selectionassociated HMGbox gene encoding a novel        nuclear protein that shows a highly regulated pattern of        expression during thymocyte differentiation The TOX        protein is  amino acids with an acidic Nterminal        domain a bipartite nuclear localization signal sequence        and a single centrally located HMGbox motif            Forced expression of TOX in the thymus of transgenic mice        leads to changes in the differentiation program of        developing T cells These studies led us to propose that        TOX is involved in regulating gene expression during        critical developmental checkpoints in the thymus and        possibly elsewhere in the immune system For example TOX        may also be involved in germinal center B lymphocyte        development andor function            Several other HMGbox proteins also play important roles        in lymphocyte development     Mice doubly deficient in        lymphocyte enhancement factor LEF and T cell factor        TCF have a complete block in development of T cells             while deficiency of SRYbox containing protein         SOX in mice results in a lack of proB cell expansion        and mild perturbation of thymocyte development            Unlike these HMGbox proteins however we find that the        HMGbox of TOX is more closely related to the DNA binding        domain of sequenceindependent HMGbox proteins In        addition three other predicted proteins share almost        identical HMGbox domains with TOX defining a new        subfamily of HMGbox proteins The TOX subfamily is highly        conserved in mice and humans and is distributed on four        separate chromosomes Outside the HMGbox domain these        proteins are less well conserved suggesting that they may        have nonoverlapping functions Our analysis also suggests        that two exons encoding the HMGbox domain may be the        evolutionary unit of the TOX subfamily found as a single        copy in an invertebrate and replicated in early        vertebrates This expanded TOX subfamily likely took on new        functions including specific roles in the mammalian immune        system                    Results and Discussion                  TOX resembles sequenceindependent HMGbox family          members          Although there are few amino acid positions within the          HMGbox motif that are conserved throughout the HMGbox          protein superfamily there are highly conserved residues          within sequencedependent and sequenceindependent          subgroups     The vast majority of HMGboxes have a          tryptophan in helix  often as part of a GXXW motif          where X denotes any amino acid      Similarly TOX          has a tryptophan at this position although as part of          the less commonly found AXXW sequence Figure shows an          alignment of the HMGbox region of TOX with HMGbox          motifs found in seven other proteins representing the two          major subfamilies of HMGbox proteins Human SRY murine          SOX SOX and LEF contain single HMGbox motifs          and bind DNA in a sequencespecific fashion Murine HMGB          and yeast NHPA bind DNA in a sequenceindependent          fashion UBF specifically binds the ribosomal RNA gene          promoter although no particular recognition sequence can          be identified     HMGB and UBF contain multiple          HMGbox motifs although only one is shown indicated by          decimal in Fig           Positions    and  as numbered in Fig  are          included in regions that have previously been shown          together to be sufficient to confer sequence specificity          to an HMGbox protein     Positions  and  are          proline and serine respectively in the          sequenceindependent DNA binders as well as in TOX In          contrast the sequence specific HMGbox proteins have          hydrophobic V or I and asparagine residues present at          positions  and  respectively The asparagine at          position  makes contact with DNA in the hSRYDNA          complex     as does the serine at this position in          the NHPADNA complex     A hydrophobic residue at          position  that can partially intercalate into DNA plays          a role in DNA binding of some sequenceindependent          HMGbox proteins       Position  is the          hydrophobic residue phenylalanine in TOX in contrast to          the polar residues found at this position in SRY SOX          proteins and LEF Similarly TOX is more closely          aligned with the sequenceindependent HMGbox proteins          than the sequencespecific transcription factors at          position  The tyrosine at this position shared with          TOX is a DNA contact in the NHPADNA complex              Moreover there is a conserved proline at position  of          the sequencespecific DNA binding proteins that truncates          the third alpha helix of the HMGbox structure allowing          additional DNA contacts       This proline is          absent from TOX and the sequenceindependent HMGbox          proteins Based on these observations TOX appears to          best fit into the family of structuredependent but          sequence independent HMGbox DNA binding proteins          However this has yet to be determined empirically by DNA          binding studies                          TOX is a member of a fourprotein subfamily with          nearly identical HMGbox sequences                    Tox is the murine homologue of the          human gene KIAA previously isolated from brain          tissue     TOX and KIAA are approximately           identical at both the nucleotide and amino acid level              Using BLAST program searches     we have now          identified  other murine genes that are predicted to          encode proteins that have nearly identical HMGbox          sequences to TOX Fig AB Human homologues of the          three additional murine genes have also been identified          Fig AB A full length murine cDNA representing          Langerhans cell protein  LCP was originally cloned          from maturing epidermal Langerhans cells while its human          homologue KIAA was cloned from human brain    as          was a cDNA encoding TNRC also known as CAGF              Searches of the EST database confirm that all family          members are expressed at the level of mRNA and we have          shown that KIAA is expressed at the level of protein          using a crossreactive antiTOX antisera data not          shown           Tox gene family members are found          on four different chromosomes in human Fig A          Similarly the murine           Tox gene family is distributed          across four different chromosomes in regions of synteny          conserved between mouse and human Fig A          All murine and human TOX subfamily members have a          single centrally located HMGbox Fig AB Within the          first  amino acids of the HMGbox region only six          positions show any variation and of those six three are          shared between all family members except TOX KIAA          homologues while the remaining three changes are found in          the LOC CORF pair Despite high similarity in          overall structure between HMGboxes individual domains          exhibit distinct DNA binding characteristics as discussed          above and can interact with DNA in different          orientations The high degree of conservation of the          particular TOXtype HMGbox sequence is therefore likely          to reflect a specific DNA andor protein interaction that          is important for function of this protein subfamily          There is also complete identity of the HMGboxes          between murine and human homologues of a given family          member consistent with formation of the           Tox subfamily by gene duplication          prior to the rodentia and primate split This is further          supported by the genomic organization of the genes The           Tox gene has  exons spanning more          than  kb data not shown The HMGbox region of TOX          is encoded by two exons as is found in some SOX genes               although the exact intron break is unique to          TOX Interestingly the position of the intronexon          boundary encoding the HMGbox is precisely conserved          among all family members in mouse and human Fig B In          general the loss or gain of an intron represents a major          genetic rearrangement and is a relatively rare event when          compared with sequence changes     It is highly          unlikely that an intron would arise at the same sequence          position in different gene lineages further supporting          that the TOX family arose by gene duplication          In addition to the box itself the TOX family members          contain conserved lysine residues at the NH            terminus of the HMGbox motif          imbedded in the consensus sequence KRX            GKKXKXPKKKKK Fig C This          sequence is the likely nuclear localization signal NLS          for these proteins     similar to the bipartite NLS          found in nucleoplasmin     The one exception is the          Langerhans cell protein LCPKIAA pair which          lacks the second basic residue of the motif Nuclear          localization signals are also highly conserved in SRYbox          and other HMGbox proteins     Basic residues          outside of the HMG box motif may also function to          stabilize DNA binding by these proteins              Outside of the HMGbox and NLS the murine and human          homologues of the three additional pairs of proteins are          highly conserved as we reported for TOX and KIAA              LCP and KIAA proteins are approximately           identical while LOC and CORF share           identity Comparison of LOC and TNRC revealed that          these proteins were highly similar with the exception of          the Ctermini The Cterminal domain of TNRC contains an          expansion of trinucleotide repeats coding for glutamine          Long polyglutamine repeats have been found in a number of          transcription factors     Notably the Cterminus of          murine HMGbox protein SRY contains a large polyglutamine          repeat region that is responsible for the sexdetermining          function of this protein     However a number of          neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease          and spinobulbar muscular atrophy are also strongly          associated with proteins containing a polyglutamine          stretch     Conformational change and protein          misfolding in the expanded polyglutamine region is          believed to be the molecular basis of the pathogenesis              Whether the presence of polyglutamine repeats in          the Cterminus of human TNRC is important for function          or alternatively hinders its ability to form a functional          protein remains to be determined          TOX family members are approximately  identical          outside the NLSHMGbox region Table  A detailed          alignment of TOX and its close relative LCP is shown in          Fig A The HMGbox splits TOX family proteins into two          domains of approximately  amino acids The          Nterminal domains exclusive of the NLS and HMGbox are          acidic for all human and murine TOX family proteins pI          range of  In the context of the nucleus acidic          domains are often proteinprotein interaction domains          The Nterminal regions are also more similar than          Cterminal regions when comparing different TOX subfamily          members for example Fig A The Cterminal regions          tend to be enriched for the presence of proline and to a          lesser extent glutamine residues data not shown The          Cterminal domains of TOX KIAA and LOC TNRC          are mildly to strongly basic respectively while those of          LCP and KIAA are acidic Despite overall similarity          the Cterminal domain of LOC is acidic while its          human homologue is basic                          The Toxand LCP genes have unique patterns of          expression          Unlike other sequenceindependent HMGbox proteins          which show ubiquitous tissue expression we have          previously shown that TOX has a highly regulated tissue          and developmental expression profile The           Tox gene is most abundantly          expressed in the thymus followed by the liver and brain          it is poorly expressed or absent in other tissues          including heart kidney lung muscle skin intestine          spleen stomach and testis     LCP is also expressed          in thymus although whether expression is regulated          during different developmental stages remains to be          determined Fig B Unlike           Tox  however the LCP gene is          most highly expressed in testis Fig B In addition          LCP is more highly expressed than           Tox in skin consistent with          isolation of LCP from Langerhans cells LCP is also          expressed in most other tissues tested with the possible          exception of muscle and thus has a more widespread          pattern of expression than previously found for the           Tox gene                          The TOX subfamily is conserved in early vertebrates          and mosquito          It has been suggested that at various times throughout          metazoan evolution HMGbox containing sequences          duplicated in each case leaving one redundant copy          which was free to evolve a new function or be lost from          the genome     The spare HMGboxcontaining fragment          recruited preexisting functional domains and formed          mosaic proteins capable of rapidly taking on novel          function In this study we examined the evolutionary          history of the TOX HMG domain As discussed above data          suggest that duplication of genes encoding the TOXlike          HMGbox occurred prior to mammalian radiation Analysis          of the genome of           Fugu rubripes pufferfish revealed          that this duplication was even more ancient          It has been shown that although the           Fugu rubripes genome is only          oneeighth the size of the human genome it contains a          comparable complement of proteinencoding genes              We found five sequences on different scaffolds in the          pufferfish genome that encode predicted proteins          containing a TOXlike HMGbox Fig  The genes present          on Scaffold and Scaffold both encode  amino          acid proteins The gene present on Scaffold encodes a           amino acid protein while the Scaffold gene          encodes a protein of  amino acids The Fugu HMGbox          sequences are nearly identical to mammalian TOX          HMGboxes and the exonintron boundary encoding the box          is at the characteristic position Fig  It has          previously been shown that the intronexon structure of          most genes is conserved between Fugu and human              We also found an incomplete HMGbox encoded by a gene on          Scaffold  We could find no additional exons to          complete coding of the box but whether additional coding          sequence is present the sequence is a pseudogene or the          gene encodes a truncated protein is unclear In addition          the Fugu proteins we identified contain a lysinerich          region immediately Nterminal to the HMGbox Fig           similar to the putative NLS sequence previously          identified Fig B          Fugu proteins share regions of homology with each          other outside of the HMGbox domain Table shows a          crosscomparison between family members Interestingly          the proteins encoded by the genes on Scaffold and          Scaffold are  identical There is also clear          similarity between these pufferfish protein sequences and          the TOX subfamily in regions outside of the putative NLS          and HMGbox Table shows a comparison of the murine TOX          subfamily members and the predicted homologues in Fugu in          these regions The predicted protein encoded by          Scaffold is approximately  identical to murine          LOC while the protein encoded by Scaffold          shares  identity with murine LCP It should also be          noted that the predicted Fugu protein sequences we have          identified might not be full length Thus additional          protein encoding exons may be present at these loci          Zebrafish also contain multiple putative TOX family          members data not shown          Database searches of genomic sequences from           Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast           Caenorhabditis elegans roundworm          and           Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sea          urchin did not reveal genes encoding the TOX HMG          signature sequence data not shown However analysis of          the           Anopheles gambiae mosquito genome          revealed a gene EAA located on chromosome X that          encodes a  amino acid protein agCP containing a          TOXlike HMGbox motif Fig  This mosquito HMGbox is          approximately  identical to that found in the          mammalian TOX subfamily despite the considerable          evolutionary history separating the two In addition the          HMG domain of agCP is encoded by  exons with an          identical exon break as that found in mammalian TOX          family members Fig  The highly conserved position of          the intron in the TOX HMG domain coding sequence          indicates that this is an ancient intron that was present          before divergence of vertebrates          The Nterminal domain of the mosquito protein consists          almost entirely of a polyalanine stretch followed by a          lysinerich sequence similar to the putative NLS of the          TOX subfamily Fig  The Cterminal domain of agCP          is also short Analysis of the genomic sequence          surrounding this locus however revealed that the          computer predicted sequence ends at a consensus splice          donor and there is at least one possible additional exon          approximately  kb downstream This putative exon          encodes a protein region with some similarity to KIAA          data not shown Thus the agCP protein may have a          more extended Cterminal domain than has currently been          identified It seems likely that this mosquito protein          represents an ancestral form of a TOX HMGbox protein          that was subsequently duplicated and diversified during          evolution of vertebrates          Analysis of           Drosophila melanogaster fruitfly          sequences did not reveal a gene encoding the conserved          TOXtype HMGbox This is intriguing considering that          both mosquito and fly species belong to the same          taxonomic order Diptera and diverged approximately           million years ago as compared to the  million years          separating pufferfish and humans     It has been          noted that only half the genes in the Drosophila and          Anopheles genomes can be interpreted as homologues              We have identified a  amino acid protein          CGPA in the Drosophila database which contains a          partial HMGbox motif with weak similarity to the TOX          family The HMGbox of CGPA is encoded by a single          exon unlike other TOX family members However the          Drosophila genome is significantly smaller than that of          the mosquito at least in part due to loss of some          introns     Thus it is possible that the CGPA          protein originated from an ancestral TOX family member          but has significantly diverged in Drosophila In support          of this possibility CGPA also contains a region in          its Cterminus that shows some similarity to LCP          KIAA data not shown Given that the mosquito          protein may also have similarity in its Cterminal region          to KIAA it is possible that the latter human protein          is most like the ancestral TOX family protein          Understanding the function of the TOX family of proteins          should shed light on the evolutionary pressures that          would maintain the TOX HMGbox essentially unchanged from          mosquito to humans but allow such divergence in          Drosophila                            Conclusions        In this study we introduce a subfamily of three        additional mammalian proteins which share a common HMGbox        domain with TOX We include a detailed analysis of the TOX        subfamily members and show that the four family members are        highly conserved in both mouse and human Based on sequence        alignment comparison with other previously characterized        HMGbox proteins we predict that the TOX HMGbox subfamily        will likely fall into the sequenceindependent category of        HMGbox proteins In addition we identify TOXlike HMGbox        proteins in mosquito and pufferfish The identification of        these invertebrate and early vertebrate sequences provides        valuable insight into the evolution of the TOX subfamily        The documentation of this unique subfamily of HMG box        proteins is a necessary initial step in evaluation of their        biological function                    Methods                  Database and

predicted protein of  amino acids accession          XP Based on sequence comparison with human          CORF analysis of exon boundaries and EST evidence          we believe this sequence contains insertion of genomic          sequence in error In addition we have removed  amino          acids within the HMGbox motif from the database protein          This  amino acid insertion is not found in other TOX          subfamily members or the human homologue CORF and          can be explained by an error in the automated computer          prediction of the end of the relevant exon Our revised          exon boundary maintains a consensus splice donor site          Therefore a revised  amino acid protein based on          coding sequence from  exons is described in this study          see Additional File  revised sequence for LOC          We also note that there is a difference in length between          mouse CORF and its human homologue The mouse gene          in the database includes a  exon encoding  amino          acids Based on a lack of EST evidence and RTPCR data          not shown this putative coding region may not be part          of the expressed gene This change is not included in the          revised sequence  Additional File  LOC was          originally placed on murine chromosome  in a syntenic          region with human CORF However in Build  of the          mouse genome assembly LOC has not been placed          Additional File           Revised nucleic acid and predicted protein sequence          for LOC          Click here for file          Note that the existing database sequence for LOC          encodes a predicted protein of  amino acids Based on          sequence comparison with human TNRC we believe that          this represents an error generated by automated          computational analysis The correct sequence for          LOC which encodes a protein of  amino acids          can be located using gi Database entries for          these anomalous sequences are currently under review by          NCBI personal communication          We also note the presence of a nucleotide sequence on          chromosome  which is approximately  identical to LCP          LOC However this gene does not have an intron          in the HMGbox coding region that is shared with other          members of the TOX subfamily In addition expression of          this gene is not supported by EST evidence It is          possible that this is a retroprocessed pseudogene similar          to those seen within the GAPDH family                              Northern Analysis          A bp fragment of an LCP cDNA was radiolabeled          with  PdCTP using a random primer labeling kit          Roche Indianapolis IN This  LCP probe does not          include the HMGbox encoding region and will not detect          genes encoding other subfamily members The probe was          hybridized to a polyA RNA Northern blot of mouse          tissues Origene Technologies Rockville MD in ULTRAhyb          hybridization buffer Ambion Austin TX overnight at          C and washed according to the manufacturers          instructions Amounts of mRNA on this blot have been          normalized previously with a actin probe Origene          Technologies In addition we have performed an          independent normalization with a GAPDH probe Blots were
