                            There is a welldocumented relationship between short sleep duration and high body mass        index BMI In the largest study a survey on sleep duration and frequency of insomnia in        more than  million participants increasing BMI occurred for habitual sleep amounts        below  hours  A recent prospective study found an association between sleep        curtailment and future weight gain  The mechanism linking short sleep with weight gain        is unknown but Mignot and colleagues study in this months         PLoS Medicine  adds to the growing evidence implicating leptin and        ghrelin the two key opposing hormones involved in appetite regulation                    Hormones That Regulate Appetite        Leptin a peptide hormone secreted from white adipocytes is implicated in the        regulation of food intake and energy balance The hormone acts on the central nervous        system in particular the hypothalamus suppressing food intake and stimulating energy        expenditure Leptin production is primarily regulated by insulininduced changes in        adipocyte metabolismits secretion levels correlate with adipocyte mass and lipid        loads        Leptin promotes inflammation The hormone provides an interesting link between obesity        and pathophysiological processes such as insulin resistance and atherosclerosis and        disorders such as autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and the metabolic syndrome        Increased serum leptin levels in obesity and metabolic syndrome support the view that these        disorders are in fact lowgrade systemic inflammatory diseases characterized by increased        concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin tumor necrosis factor and        leptin Leptins proinflammatory role suggests that it may link energy homeostasis to the        immune system Ghrelin is a peptide hormone that stimulates appetite fat production        and body growthleading to increased food intake and body weight It is secreted into the        circulation from the stomach but is also synthesised in a number of other tissues        including the kidney pituitary and hypothalamus suggesting that the hormone has both        distant and local endocrine and paracrine effects These effects include stimulating the        secretion of growth hormone prolactin and adrenocorticotropic hormone and a diabetogenic        effect on carbohydrate metabolism                     The New Study        In this study of  participants in the populationbased Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study         Mignot and colleagues found that in persons sleeping less than  hours increased BMI        was proportional to decreased sleep  The researchers also found that shorter sleep        times were associated with increased circulating ghrelin and decreased leptin a hormonal        pattern that is consistent with decreased energy expenditure and increased appetite and        obesity        These findings confirm earlier clinical reports on the effects of sleep deprivation and        extend them to include naturalistic sleep in a large communitybased population The study        provides an exciting addition to the growing literature showing relationships between sleep        curtailment metabolic hormones and metabolic disorders including obesity The data have        important implications for our understanding of obesity and related disorders in the        general population with one caveat the study population was enriched with snorers making        the results less applicable to a general population        Mignot and colleagues data are in accord with human and animal studies that show that        experimental curtailment of sleep leads to lower levels of leptin  and increased        ghrelin  The new study therefore lends some support to the interpretation that reduced        sleep levels cause the hormonal changes        But there is also evidence of opposite effectsthat is that administration of leptin         and ghrelin can alter sleep Ghrelin administration has been found to increase nonREM        sleep in humans and mice possibly via its interactions with the sleepinducing peptide        growth hormone releasing hormone GHRH Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand of the growth        hormone secretagogue receptor making it a candidate for an endogenous sleeppromoting        factor  Mignot and colleagues study is congruent with the idea that inadequate sleep        enhances ghrelin secretion which in turn acts as an endogenous sleep factor in humans        This is an important new area of research that could conceivably lead to more physiological        sleep aids than are currently available with profound implications for improved public        health        Overall the available studies suggest the presence of reciprocal interactions between        metabolic hormones and sleep relationships that are poorly understood at present Does        sleep interact with metabolic hormones directly or via intervening factors such as        sleeprelated breathing disorders Patients with obstructive sleep apnea have impaired        sleep and higher ghrelin levels than BMImatched controls and treatment with continuous        positive airway pressure reduces ghrelin to control levels  Although sleepdisordered        breathing SDB was measured in the present study the SDB analyses were not shown making        it difficult to evaluate the influence of SDB on ghrelin and leptin in this population        There is a clear need for wellcontrolled populationbased studies that allow us to        examine multiple relevant factors simultaneously The present study highlights the        importance of shortened sleep in relation to obesity leptin and ghrelin a good start        toward this goal                    Sleep and Public Health        Many other important questions remain such as the roles that other hormones cytokines        and SDB play in obesity Many of the unanswered questions have important implications for        public health For example diabetes visceral obesity hypertension and hyperinsulinemia        commonly aggregate together in large populations and are considered a metabolic syndrome        that has been linked to SDB  and to inflammatory disorders  To what extent does        longterm sleep curtailment contribute to these and related public health issues        The possible role of sleep restriction in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders is of        particular interest in light of recent findings linking immune function with ghrelin and        leptin Ghrelin and its receptor are expressed in human Tlymphocytes where they can        inhibit cytokine activation including interleukins tumor necrosis factor and leptin         Conversely leptin stimulates cytokine activation and immunecell proliferation an        effect that predisposes to inflammatory conditions  Is it possible then that        sleeprelated changes in leptin and ghrelin influence the development of metabolic and        immune disorders Can biologically restorative sleep reverse disease progression Can        biologically restorative sleep be defined on the basis of metabolic hormone responses        Future research may answer some of these and other questions further elucidating the role        of sleep in public health
