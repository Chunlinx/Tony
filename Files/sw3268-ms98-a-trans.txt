        well the types of vacations that i usually take i usually come back more tired after my vacation then i do         you know before i take it um i need to definitely take a vacation where all all i do is rest and i i guess to do that id probably have to take it at home   oh   but um the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida i enjoy the beach   okay  i am after our last summers vacation i am antibeach  uhhuh we went to uh Cape Hatteras   antibeach uhhuh   well we we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland then we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days and uh uh the the waves were huge ive never quite seen waves like this one  and uh i was standing in water not more than   uhhuh umhum   in just barely above my ankles and uh you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden youre in sand above your ankles and i was standing there talking to my daughter and this really big wave came and totally threw me and one   uhhuh right   foot did not come out of the sand and it tore the ligaments in my knee so im never going to another beach again  im a more   uhhuh you might be like i am i enjoy i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas but i really dont like to get into water the water the ocean i prefer a swimming pool   well i I love to go and play around at least i always did but although actually my i like the mountains i uh i dont really like hot weather thats my biggest gripe about living here and i basically   uhhuh umhum   dont wanna go to a hot place on vacation  um i my dream vacation is Alaska   right i can understand that uhhuh that would be nice   this is just someplace ive always wanted to go and someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there   uhhuh i know ive taken several vacations to Colorado and i used to live in Colorado oh sometime ago for a couple of years and i really enjoyed that   umhum yeah id id like that uh i havent been to Yellowstone for a long long time and i would uh weve been talking about going there next summer  uh i dont know well have to to   uhhuh yeah  ive never been up to the Yellowstone area so   its been a long time but you know it seems when your family is is different places a lot of trips involved going to visit   thats right thats right you got that   oh im we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and i are both from and   umhum   my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here and uh   umhum umhum   weve got one of our our kids lives out on the East Coast and so we have to you know go to those   well you have you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then right   well i know but im tired of them i wanna go someplace different  up there uh my my idea i guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with uh money be no object   thats right right   you know so just absolutely you know first class fly where i want to rent a car if i want to   umhum   uh you know just really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says well lets take this little side trip you know and not have to sit there and figure out um   umhum   you know can we we fit that in there or now that uh that thats what i um   right uhhuh   yes thats what i would like to do i have no interest for example in taking a cruise to me why anybody wanna ride around on a boat for a few days is  mind boggling   umhum it would be sort of confining i feel like it would be confining   yeah   you know i would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself   umhum yeah i just uh that that does absolutely nothing for me   uhhuh   but uh i dont know i can say that i think my my favorite spots are still to go to go where theres mountains and and lot of trees and and wildlife to view and and uh i like that kind of stuff i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery   yes i i agree i can i can do that too and um you know i think if i had if i had the money i would probably go to Europe every year         because of you know i think that they have they have it all over there in just a a few tiny two two miles you know theres mountains and theres beaches and  its all right there so     umhum yeah uh i i guess ive never really thought about it that way our uh  we have our daughter whos almost thirteen but shes uh a very picky eater and our our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is   umhum   you know gee Holly would starve to death if we you know we took her to another country so   oh right   but i i would like if you know it was anywhere in the world to go i guess even though its hot i would like to go to Africa
