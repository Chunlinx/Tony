                yes   do you rely on newspapers or TV or what for your current events   well uh mostly the radio i listen to the radio im home during the day and so i have the radio going and listen to the news there and then uh i watch the news on TV at night we have a local newspaper that we subscribe to but thats um all the newspaper my husband and i used to take the the Wall Street Journal and that had a lot of good information   are you in Salt Lake City     were fifty miles north   so youre a suburb of it then   right right so we dont take the Salt Lake newspaper how about   okay we have we have in Dallas whats called talk radio   oh yes   and its news twenty four hours a day   uhhuh   you dont listen to it twenty four hours       if youre in the car for twenty minutes in traffic you sure get a bunch of news real quick   get caught up on it fast   so you primarily rely on on the radio   right right yes and we have um the station we listen to is out of Kansas or out of Salt Lake City and its an all news or an all talk station also it doesnt have the   right   the music and thing so   do you have where these people call in express their opinions and talk back   yes yeah   yeah same thing down here its uh really gets some really neat information that way dont we   uh right get a lot of different different viewpoints  have you   i definitely take the morning newspaper and read the headlines of every morning and uh   uhhuh and that helps keep up on too how about magazines do you take any magazines   i at the office nothing newsworthy uh uh National Geographic Readers Digest   oh oh   uh im afraid were probably reliant on newspapers and radio   right that   television news im not interested in their in them     right that you dont like the television news the television reports   uh no i dont uh especially in depth things like  Minutes   but oh uhhuh   or or whatever else they call i think theyre very biased   they are right presents one viewpoint and not the other   uh uh journalistic uh theyll go into some guys office with TV cameras rolling and   uhhuh   because he sticks up his hand doesnt want to be seen hes considered hes supposed to be considered guilty   uhhuh   theyre charging theyre making a man look guilty before hes even given a chance to hear his side of the story but   well you know i think theres a lot of that in the newspaper reporting too i  because a lot and i dont know how much of what we read is is really accurate a few of the stories that   definitely   that you know ive been personably person known whats going on and then you read whats in the newspaper about it and it doesnt always match up so   you really wonder what you hear from this Russia thing that going on is is Yeltsin all that great you know is he really going to   umhum   it sounds as more and more came out that he and whats his name is gone now   umhum Gorbachev yeah   Gorbachev Gorbachev got into a political quarrel about three years ago and uh   oh   Gorbachev just got beat to the punch politically   oh   and i mean even with a guy Gorbachev goes to his office to clean out his desk for the next day and Yeltsin is already there sitting there   uhhuh     oh thats ugly   uh it is and and like you say we really im really not sure how much of what we hear is reliable   umhum   we uh my family and i went out we have a golden spike um railroad monument oh its probably about fifty miles from here and   umhum   last Friday we went out there to watch the train come in the steam engine and there was uh there was a probably a group of oh maybe fifty to seventy five people out there and the newspaper reporter was there and he took a picture and it was in the paper the next day and it   hundreds   well just the opposite they probably had oh ten people in the picture and he said um just a small group had turned out to watch the steam engine come in and the way it was printed and the way the picture was it looked like that was all there was was right there when there was   ill be dad gummed   quite quite a few more there you know so   um   i think you have to be careful when when we take in the information what we take as truth and what we dont   we lost the second major newspaper in Dallas within this month   oh i read that   the Dallas Times Herald went under we were one of the few   yes     few cities remaining big cities that had two papers   uhhuh   and and were sorry now you got the Fort Worth Press and uh uh no Fort Worth Star Telegram The Press went years ago and the Dallas Mourning News and   oh   oh was it financial trouble thats what they went under for wasnt it   yep yep competition killed them and and then well the Morning News finally bought out the the Herald   oh oh yes oh well thats thats too bad which one did did you subscribe to that one   of course closed it down   but oh ive been with the Dallas Morning News for twenty years   oh ah   it is the conservative paper and im probably lean to being conservative as opposed to liberal so and the other was kind of the liberal paper so   uhhuh uhhuh oh oh huh well that   so i feel sorry for all the liberals in town they have to read the good stuff now     oh yes well thats i think Tom and i think um     the children
