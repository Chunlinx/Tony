                     This is Fannie Flono and she grew up in Ag Augusta GA and she is going to talk about some stories from her         childhood                     Ok         My grandmother used to tell me a lot of different stories about her growingup years and uh especially uh she used to talk about her family and what it was like during those times         She had this one story and uh we called my grandmother Granny uh because we had another grandmother we called something else but uh um Granny used to tell this story about her brother Joe         And it was a fascinating story because uh it kind of told a lot about uh what it was like being a uh uh closeknit black family during those those years in the South when uh you didnt have much         She grew up on a farm and um uh what it was like but um like a lot of black families during that time         uh uh if you had a large family uh and some of your relatives didnt have anybody in their family you would just kind of let some of the kids stay with that family         And my Gran my Granny and her brother um were among I think there were six kids in her family and they had a cousin uh who lived uh on a farm you know maybe about I dont know  miles away not that far         You know during that time people walked  miles and uh they needed somebody to help with some of the farm chores and all that sort of stuff and so they asked my my my Grannys parents if Joe could come and live with them         And you know they were a close family and they loved each other and all that kind of stuff but it was just down the road you know so they said fine and and you you know he came back on Sundays and he was with the family at church and all that sort of thing         Um but ah one day he didnt show up on Sunday uh for church and so they wondered what was going on and they went to this house ah down the road and the cousins had packed up and left         They had just gone         Nobody knew where they went         They took Joe with them and my Granny said she said it was such a sad time in the house because you know everybody was missing Joe and they didnt know what to do         And so you know eventually you know you know they kept asking people around and nobody knew where they were and eventually you know they just reconciled themselves that they just wouldnt see Joe again         And uh so uh Granny grew up she was like I think she told me this was when she was about  years old when this happened and her brother Joe was like  and uh so she grew up and uh she uh got married and uh thats another story         She got married when she was  to my grandfather who was  and she didnt know she had to go live with him but anyway thats another story         about ignorance among people but anyway they were sitting on the porch and she was back visiting uh her mother and they were sitting on the porch and it was like this long road it was like the house was like situated at the end of this long road and you could see all the way down the road a a long way         And she said it was just like one day and it was like maybe  years later cause she was like  and they were just sitting on the porch and they were and she said she said she could still remember because her mother had on you know this big straw hat that she used to have on         It was like her favorite hat and this big voluminous dress that she used to have on in the summertime         It was really cool and the dress kind of blew in the wind a little bit                     Uhhuh                     And they were just sitting out there on rocking chairs you know just kind of enjoying the afternoon and uh they could look down the road and they could see this dust kicking up         And and she said uh my Granny said she got up and she she looked up and she said You know wonder who that could be         And so she sat back down and you know they were still chatting and they could still see this person and this person was walking really really fast         And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person coming down that road she started thinking No that cant be that cant be         And she said but you know the closer he got she said she got up and she peered down the road and she looked at her mom and she said she said Mama you know I think thats Joe         And she said then her mama her mama leaned forward and she looked and she said         Walks like him                  Got that same walk         but she said It cant be         So Granny got up and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was walking up towards the road and she then just stood there         And then he was coming she said he was coming really fastshe said could still remember all that dust kicking up on the roadand here hes coming down the road and she turns around and she said Its Joe         Hes come home         And she said she started running toward him and they ran and they hugged and they hugged and she said her mama was sitting on the porch andthis is a true storyand her mama was sitting on the porch and she said her mama was just like dumbfounded         She didnt say a word                     Aw                     She said there were just tears coming down from her eyes and she said then she said Joe came up on the porch         And he said Mama Im home                     Where had he been                     He said that they had gone up North         They had wound up starting out to New York to visit some relatives of this this cousin and they just stayed and he didnt know how to get back so he just stayed with them         He didnt know how to get in touch with them and he said you know you know as he grew up you know he kept thinking about them and he said he wanted to come back home but he didnt have any way he didnt have any money         And he said finally he know you know once he got grown and started working he saved up his money and he said he was determined to come back and find them and he didnt even know if they were going to be in the same place                     Wow                     But he said he was going to find them and he came all the way back                     Do you have an idea what year that would be                     Oh         That would have to have been         lets see         My grandmother was born in  she was a little girl         No she was born in  because she was  and so it must have been like in   you know before before                      Wow                     Yeah yeah about that yeah                     So he stayed in Augusta after that                     Well I dont know         I dont know whether he stayed in Augusta after that         Cause they didnt actually live in Augusta they lived in well you know Augusta was still a citytown during that time even though to people in big cities like this Augusta isnt that big         But uh they lived in a little country town outside of Augusta called Evans and Evans still exists and thats where a lot of my relatives still still are too                     Hah                     So ah and um Granny she used to tell a lot of those stories I mean especially when talking about Augusta being the big city         Uh my grandmother Granny her greatgrandfather was a white man         and one of the the the things that just sticks in her craw is that and you know she she and her sister uh were lighter than some of the rest of the family         Her sister could pass for white and in fact did pass for white         And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sisters husband decided that they were going to move to the city to Augusta and pass for white         And they moved downtown                     So her sisters husband was lightskinned too                     Her sisters husband was lightskinned too         And uh they moved downtown and there was uh and its still like this in Augusta this big street downtown called Broad Street and it really was just this broad street in a downtown area         And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in and it was right on the edge of Broad Street         And uh they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just just determined that they were going to be white         They just didnt like what it was like being black in those days and that was you know I guess that that was probably you know in the early s uh when they did that         And they         they wanted to sever relationships with the rest of the family but the rest of the family didnt want to sever relationships with them even though they were mad at them because they had decided you know to do something they didnt think was right         My my grandmother was very adamant about you know people who try to be things that they arent and this whenever shed tell this story shed talk about people who try to be things that they arent         I mean that was the whole point         That was the lesson in the story people who try to be things that they arent         That they shouldnt do that that you should accept your lot in life although you should work to improve it you know you should be who you are and not try to be something else         Um but she used to visit her sister ah in in in Augusta and but she used to have to go in the back door and pretend she was the maid         Granny hated that                     I bet                     She hated that and she used to tell her sister every day she said that that You are doing wrong         You are doing wrong wrong wrong wrong treating your family this way         And so finally somebody apparently told that these people were passing for white and Granny came to visit them at their house and they were gone because they had to get out of town really quickly         And they couldnt stay in the Augusta area because people knew that they had tried to do something that was really taboo and try to pass for white         Um and so they just left town and she she never did see her sister again never saw her sister again                     Wow                     So it was just really interesting         And you know the one thing that my my grandmother my grandmother she was so funny about this uh         she uh she treated the children I mean her her her grandchildren differently based on the color of their skin         But she treated the ones like us who were darker better                     Huh                     Than the ones who were lighter         And actually when we we kind of began to understand what was going on because my cousins were a little lighter well they were somewhat lighter than we were and she would not treat them well and we couldnt figure it out what what was going on you know why you know we could get anything we wanted and she was very stern with them         And uh my mother eventually told us you know Well she has this thing         uh and you know just really and part of it has to do with her family and the fact that people you know uh when her sister tried to you know pass for white and thought she was better than everybody else and she kind of she thinks people who tried to pass for white think theyre better than everybody else and light people think theyre better than everybody else         And the fact is she was light         And that was the thing that was the thing that was so funny         She was a lightskinned black person         And it was like she was rejecting who she was in some ways by you know the way she treated you know the other grandchildren         Um but you know there were just a lot of mixed feelings involved and she had to deal with her feelings in her own but when I got older when I got to be an adult I actually talked to her about it         I told her Granny you know you are so sweet to us but you are wrong about this you shouldnt be treating people differently because of that                              What did she say                     And she said at first                     Did she really kind of know she was doing it                     Yes she did         Um and she said she said she said Baby she said You dont understand about life the way I understand about life         But as she got older um she never acknowledged that she was wrong but she did change her behavior         So                     Now this was the one who married at  and didnt                     Yeah yeah married my grandfather who who she was light and he was dark and I dont know whether that was the reason she married him although it was kind of like one of those arranged marriages                     Ah                     Where he was a          he was a ministers son so he had they had property and stuff and they were very wellconnected in the community and very held in high esteem         His father was like uh the guy who had been pastor of this big church for a long period of time and and and so I think her family the Tates really wanted to connect with the Keenes for that reason and so they just really just told her she was going to be marrying him         And she didnt really understand         She didnt even understand the marriage ceremony she didnt even know that she had gotten married really                     Wow                     And so when they told her she had to go home with this guy she said Go home with him                  Hes old enough to be my daddy                  Well he was almost old enough to be her daddy                     Oh no                     And he was my grandfather was not a nice man         He was nice enough to us         My sister keeps telling me she says Sometimes youre just like Granny you treat people wrong for the wrong reasons                  And I did because I thought he treated I thought he treated uh my mother and some of the siblings not well in the family because he had pets and that all sort of thing not based on color of skin or anything but just based on I dont know on whatever anyway         My my mother wound up not being one of his favorites early on and ah so she was relegated to working in the fields whereas some of the other kids didnt work in the fields         I mean they only had like they had five children one of them died         But they were divided about like who were the field hands and who were the house kids it was kind of                     Really                     Yeah it was almost like a plantation system                     Thats interesting                     Yeah it was operating within the family                     He would have been born                     He was born in  something like  I think it was  I think it was when he was born         No it was no he was older than that because my grandmother was born in  and he was born  years earlier                                           yeah                     Hum                     But he was you know in a lot of ways just like         a plantation owners son because he was the son of this guy who owned a lot of property                              He had property                              And it was he never really had to do anything for himself         And he was a philanderer an d oh yeah he was like out there                  And ah so you know I didnt like him but anyway those are my stories                     Thats interesting                     There are many stories in the naked city                              Youd be surprised                     All right                     Thank you                     Youre very welcome
