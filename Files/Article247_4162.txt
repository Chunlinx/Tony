                                 Present at the Creation            Among the many things Al Gore has claimed credit for introducing to theworld is apparently the Earned Income Tax Credit This is a refundable credit paidby the IRS to belowmedianincome workers that has over the last  yearsswelled both in size and in the esteem with which it is held by Republicans andDemocrats alike            Many politicians have wrapped their arms around this sturdy reinforcementfor the efforts of illpaid workers but few if any have been so fulsome intheir embrace as was the vice president in a November interview with Time                Magazine  In commenting upon hisrival Bill Bradleys proposed expansion of the EITC Gore asserted I was theauthor of that proposal I wrote that so I say welcome aboard That issomething for which I have been the principal proponent for a long time            Last week the Bradley forces jumped on the veeps claim of authorshippointing out in an ad that the EITC became law in  a year before Gore waselected to Congress            Who then can claim credit for this invention which this year distributedclose to  billion in refunds to some  million families and individualsChatterbox knows because Chatterbox really was thereor at least close by            Just for the record the EITC was the brainchild of the powerful SenateFinance Committee Chairman Russell Long Yes Russell Long the son of HueyLong the flamboyant populist governor of Louisiana immortalized in All theKings Men  In the s Russell Long was anathema to most liberals whoviewed him as the major roadblock in the way of a more generous welfare stateAnd indeed Long was an arch opponent of President Richard Nixons FamilyAssistance Plan which would have doubled the size of the welfare rolls byextending cash assistance to the working poor            Long didnt like the idea adding millions of people to the rolls but hewasnt at all adverse to the notion of giving poor people a helping handaslong as it was done in a way that would encourage rather than discourage workSo he asked one of his staffers Michael Stern to work out the details of aplan that would do just that Michael Stern in turn asked Chatterbox and afriend of hers from the Urban Institute to help out The final plan which theFinance Committee reported out in  was remarkably generouscertainly moregenerous than the welfare reform enacted a few years ago of which both Gore andhis boss the president brag It guaranteed a job to any family headneeding work True the wage in these public jobs was subminimum so as not toencourage people to abandon their private sector jobs for the perhaps lessdemanding public sector But to help out people working in poorly paid jobsLong came up with the idea of rebating their Social Security taxes as a workbonus            Although Mike Stern was assigned to work out the details of how the EITCwould be computed he insists the idea really was Sen Longs He liked theidea because it rewarded work says Stern who is now with the InvestmentCompany Institute            The net cost of the plan was about  billion including  billion forthe EITCbig big money in those days and more than a  percent increase overwhat the feds were then spending on welfare for families As former FederalReserve governor OMB director and CBO director Alice Rivlin noted at thetime when she and Chatterbox were on a panel together if someone other thanRussell Long had proposed this they would have been acclaimed as a hero Butbecause it was a Long product it was branded by the press as slavefare andwent nowhere in Congress But Long continued to press for the EITC part of hisplan and in  while the fight over welfare reform was still raging itquietly passed into law So quietly that Al Gore apparently didnt noticeit
