                                 Jews vs Spooks            President Clinton has madea career of wriggling out of problems of his own making but he may finallyhave trapped himself During last years Wye peace talks Clinton apparentlyhinted to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would freeconvicted spy Jonathan Pollardnow serving a life sentenceif Israel signedthe peace deal After CIA Director George Tenet protested Clinton backed offslightly agreeing only to reconsider Pollards clemency in exchange forNetanyahus signature            Clinton was expected toannounce in January whether he would free Pollard That month passed with noannouncement Another six weeks have come and gone and still there is nodecision in sight The president will decide when he decides says NationalSecurity Council spokesman PJ Crowley            Its no wonder Clinton is so dilatory Pollard presents adilemma with no satisfactory political solution The entire national securityapparatus from Tenet to the FBI to the Defense Department to the StateDepartment to the heads of House and Senate intelligence committees adamantlyopposes Pollards release And virtually the entire American Jewish communityfavors it The spooks or the Jews Which should he choose            Clinton finds himself inthis swamp because the dynamics of the case have vastly changed during the pastfew years A civilian Navy intelligence analyst Pollard was arrested in and quickly pleaded guilty to selling secrets to Israel In  he hadgiven  or more pages of highly classified documents to his Israelihandlers In the plea agreement prosecutors promised not to seek a lifesentence but the judge after reading a secret account of the damage Pollardhad done sentenced him to life anyway            Until recently Pollards cause had been championed mostlyby a small vocal paranoid inflammatory dishonest group of supportersprincipally extremely proIsrael rightwing American Jewish groups Theirprimary claims are that  Pollard did no real harm to national security he was well intentioned in spying for our friend Israel  he was unfairlydeprived of a trial  he never saw the evidence against him and  thegovernment broke his plea agreement by asking for a life sentence            All these assertionswhich are made incessantly and at high volume are false Pollard did enormousdamage to US national security thoroughly compromisingintelligencegathering in the Middle East and elsewhere more on this belowHe also spied or tried to for several countries besides Israel He had notrial because he chose to plead guilty He did see the evidenceagainst him and so on Pollards perfervid supporters repeat these canardsdespite all evidence Morton Klein national president of the ZionistOrganization of America told me that prosecutors promised they would be verylenient on him  then asked for a life sentence In fact prosecutors toldPollard they would ask for a substantial sentence and then didnt askfor a life sentence            Pollard devotees also demagogically appeal to Jewishsentiment They liken the Pollard Affair to the Dreyfus Affair and assertthat Pollard was sentenced to life because he is Jewish They claim thatPollards arrest caused an outpouring of Jewish bloodletting in nationalsecurity agencies quoting top national security officials as saying theydont need any more Jewboys like Pollard They have portrayed antiPollardJewish groups as lapdogs trying to ingratiate themselves with mainstreamAmerica            As long as these kookswere Pollards principal support it was easy for Presidents Bush and Clintonto ignore him But then Pollard got lucky In the early s the Israeligovernment which had distanced itself from Pollard embraced him And duringthe past three years mainstream Jewish groups have started coming aroundAlmost every significant Jewish organization now supports Pollards releasefrom the World Jewish Congress to Bnai Brith to the Conference of Presidentsof Major Jewish Organizations Elie Wiesel Edgar Bronfman Sr and AlanDershowitza holy trinity of North American Jewsrecently implored thepresident to grant Pollard clemency            Mainstream Jewish groups had ignored Pollard in the sand early s because they concluded that antiSemitism had nothing to do withhis arrest or sentencing Their new Pollard advocacy is moderate andmutedlowkey constituent service They have given Pollards cause newcredibility by avoiding the preposterous claims of his loyalists They insistthat his behavior was loathsome They dont question the legality of his pleaor his sentence They dont claim that an Israeli spy deserves specialtreatment But they say Pollard has shown remorse for his wrongdoing Hedeserves freedom on humanitarian grounds He has served far longer thananyone else convicted of spying for an ally Other such spies spend  to years in prison Pollard is closing in on  years            But the mainstreamarguments too are wrong Pollard does not in fact seem to be terriblyremorseful He took Israeli citizenship in  and he recently called theUnited States a foreign country He has said I would rather be rotting inprison than sitting shiva for the hundreds of thousands of Israelis whocould have died had he not spied In  he was caught trying to smuggleclassified information out in his prison letters            More important the mainstream groups are downplaying whatPollard did Pollard is not just some confused wellmeaning basicallyharmless spy who was railroaded by an overzealous judge In the Jan  NewYorker  Seymour Hersh assessed the damage caused by Pollard to Americasnational security It is vast arguably as much as allstar snoop Aldrich Amesdid in his spying for the Soviet Union According to Hersh who was leakedinformation that had been kept secret since Pollards arrest Pollard not onlycompromised Americas Middle East operations he also gave away tons ofAmerican classified data about the Soviet Union Pollard handed overinformation about how the United States tracked Soviet subs He gave theIsraelis the bible of American signals intelligence a manual that showsexactly what foreign that is Soviet signals the United States hasintercepted He gave away documents that could have helped the Soviets identifyAmerican moles He may have even given away the United States attack plan fora war with the USSR This information was probably traded to the USSR byIsrael in exchange for Soviet Jewish migrs Pollard may have spied for afriendly country but he did a traitors work            Pollards supporters have reacted to theserevelations with skepticism None of the Jewish groups has reversed its supportfor Pollards release His absolutist followers smear Hersh as a fabricatorMainstream groups not unreasonably question the timing of Hershs story For years the intelligence community has refused to release this damageassessment on the grounds that it would harm national security The only reasonto release it now is political and national security officials shouldnt playpolitics Hershs information may be damning they say but it is unverifiableand irrefutable            Pollards supporters can cling to that excuseClinton has no such out He knows whether the charges in the Hersh story aretrue and thats why hes in such a quandary Usually Clinton finds a way toreconcile the presidential and the political Here he cannot If Pollard isguilty of all that Hersh charges him with Clinton the president knows thatfreeing him is a terrible wrong a slap at Americas national securityguardians and an invitation to our allies to spy on us But even if Pollard isguilty of all that Hersh charges him with Clinton the politician knows thatfreeing him is a political win a present to some of his dearest supportersThere is only one way for Clinton to extricate himself from this dilemma Hecan commute Pollards sentence so that the spy cant go free until  Thatwould be the perfect Clintonian solution Leave the mess for someone else toclean up
