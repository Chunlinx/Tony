                                 iGreen Mileiage                        Hi Elvis            Regarding your ideas about other avenues that The Green Mile couldhave explored Yes yours would be a better braver picture The way popculture works I think is that the themes of small cuttingedge pictures getwatered down over years into large cuttingboard pictures and we can see thatprocess happening here I have no doubt that the films portrait of racerelations in Louisiana prisons in the s is a fantasy although no less afantasy than the sentimentalized view of the Eddie MurphyMartin Lawrencefriendship in Ted Demmes Life  Since all pictures are fantasies somemore than most I think it is useful to look at The Green Mile in termsof what its viewers will see Many of them will see not clichs and stereotypesbut an enormously good black man whose fate they mourn These viewers will beuninformed and unsophisticated in terms of the actual conditions in the Souththat your father described to you but that is the nature of a societysmemory            I had an interesting talk a few months ago with Peter Mayer the formerchairman of VikingPenguin who has published just about everyone I asked himfor the name of the best novelist on his list Saul Bellow he said And thenhe mused that he wouldnt call Stephen King a great writer in the same sensebut would call him a great storyteller in the Dickens tradition I am not usingquotation marks because I cannot claim to remember verbatim King is scornedby those who do not read him he said but is underrated and sometimes verygood he suggested I start with the short stories In India recently I wentto every bookstore I could find and even in stores the size of a broom closetin back alleys where the proprietors surely stocked no book they were notcertain they could sell Stephen King was the secondmoststocked author Themost popular was Wodehouse These were book stalls catering to Indians I sawfew tourists in Calcutta Why do they read Stephen King in Calcutta Becausethey want to            No filmgoer attends a movie to support it They choose a movie in the hopethat for a period of time they will be more entertained or interested orhappier than otherwise Our job as critics is to encourage them to choose filmsthat we think will be less a waste of their time than those they might chooseon their own This is a relative and inexact process but worth doing If we donot get up to our elbows in the real mix of real movies real audiences andreal motives for going to the movies what function do we serve            In insular mediaobsessed buzzdriven markets like New York I wonderwhether some critics especially newcomers on the make dont position theirreviews primarily to position themselves The real reason Pauline Kael wasrevolutionary was that she wrote for actual moviegoers like herself and evokedtheir needs and desires No one who seriously believes Taste of Cherryor Ulysses Gaze is a great movie believes that being able to enjoy amovie is necessary to make that movie great Oh the admirers of those moviesenjoy them I suppose but in a way so specialized and evolved that it hasnothing to do with moviegoing as it is generally understood            Many of the films on our best lists will play only in the larger citiesI get email from moviegoers who complain that Being John Malkovich Boys Dont Cry  Princess Mononoke  and American Beautyhave not played in their towns TopsyTurvy certainly wont andprobably not Magnolia  Subtitled films and documentaries may not play intheir states  Dan Talbott of New Yorker Films told me the averagesubtitled film makes  percent of its North American gross in ninetheaters             Movies like The Green Mile are progressive compared with the moviesmost of America sees most weekends The Green Mile is an important andworthy fact of popular culturenot sophisticated not as hardedged oraccurate or courageous as it could be but more a part of the solution than apart of the problem Here is an obviously unprovable guess For  percent ofthe people who see it it will be the best movie they see all year even fromyour point of view            BestRoger
