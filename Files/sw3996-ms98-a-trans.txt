        okay       well i think that i think it should be done   you think that that spot testing for drugs is is well like it said you think it should be done permissible and where do they draw the lines   yeah uh well i think at some places like not necessarily at McDonalds but   yeah   at plants at bigger companies   whats really bad is you know that i work for TI and TI does it thats no problem im i dont take drugs anyway i dont have any problem with that but our own defense system doesnt do it the government doesnt do spot testing for not only for you know the FBI and defense systems and everything else but they impose it upon the on the     yeah   standard public and i i really dont care one way or the other i think it it prevents a lot i think guys arent so willing to take drugs at work anymore or do drugs and go to work but   but theres a lot that do   yeah yeah there well there even at TI there was there was quite a change when they come out with drug testing i think its a great deterrent and uh   yeah   i know a girl that works for Town and Country and she had they just they go around and they just pick a store one store in the city a month and they go down and do drug testing on all of its employees from the manager all the way down       so theres no discriminating there you know theyre not theyre and even like TI now TI if you go out   yeah   and they test you positive for drugs first they send you to drug rehab they dont just throw you out the door and fire you so you know theyre not out hunting heads   yeah   but i think it should be done across the work spectrum i dont i dont disagree with it i think its a good thing to have but i think it should be done across the whole work spectrum i dont think that one company should do it and the other company not i dont think that TI should necessarily need to do it when the federal government doesnt you know it it it ought to be standardized somewhere somebody has to   yeah   you know and and they we got into a big discussion about it at work about against being against unconstitutional and against somebodys privacy rights but that you know i dont want some guy hopped up on drugs next to me working on a machine i might get my head cut off   true yep   you know   thats why i think its good to do  testing not only when they get hired but also  along the line sometimes   yeah   because a lot of people will have have ways of like faking the test or you know they just dont do it for a while to take the test to get the job and then theyll start up again   yeah yeah i seen that too but i agree with it   yeah   you know i think it should be done i think it should be done everywhere i dont think it should just be done at one company or another you know like you said not at McDonalds but you know theres nothing at McDonalds except a deep fat fryer full of grease that somebody can stick their hand into or you know   yeah   i dont think drugs have if if i have no qualms if they wanna take drugs thats their problem its not mine but i dont want them around me or near me or working with me or   yeah yeah   you know not while theyre hopped up i dont want a drunk there either   yeah   i dont want some guy in there thats drunk working next to me either so and theyre all drugs so   yep   i agree i think it should be done i think it should be done all the everywhere i dont think it should be done in one place and not another i think it should be done i think it should be done every time a person needs to well you know changing jobs you have to to get into TI you have to take a urines urine test anyway and they wont hire you if you test positive but once youre there   yeah   and they they they test you positive theyll at least send you to drug rehab or some kind of counseling anyway and i think its working i think its doing pretty good job   yeah   so   i went down to WalMart a couple of years ago to try to see about a job and they wanted me to take a drug test   umhum yeah most of your major companies do now       well thats good you know i it prevents a lot its a great deterrent whether or not it   hm   helps in the long run nobody knows but   yep   it works pretty good   okay   all right   well thanks for talking sorry to wake you up it sounds like i did   uhhuh nice to talk to you yeah it woke me up but thats okay     yep okay   see you later bye bye   bye bye
