                                 WinniethePooh            The British whose twoprincipal hobbies seem to be slobbering over small animals and waxing nostalgicabout their past found a way to do both last week They demanded therepatriation of WinniethePooh            Thesideshow to last weeks Bill ClintonTony Blair summit the Pooh flap wastouched off when British MP Gwyneth Dunwoody a Pol of Very Little Brainvisited the displayed in the New York Public Library Dunwoody beseeched theUnited States to liberate the Pooh Five from their glass prison and sendthem home The dolls she said were Americas Elgin marbles a culturaltreasure stolen from overseas            Within  hours Pooh had made the front page of the NewYork Post  New York Gov George Pataki had told Dunwoody to buzz off RepNita Lowey DNY had introduced a congressional resolution declaring thatthe Brits have their head in a honey jar if they think they are taking Poohout of New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani had brought Pooh a jar of honey andpraised him as the very best in immigration and Clinton spokesman MichaelMcCurry had called the idea of Poohs repatriation un bear able Thiswas believe it or not one of the weeks better puns Blair recognizing thatdiscretion is the better part of absurdity relented and withdrew Dunwoodysdemand The special relationship between the United States and the UnitedKingdom was saved            Theres nodoubt that the law favors the American side in the Pooh flap Pooh and friendshave been here since  when author AA Milne loaned them to his Americanpublisher EP Dutton for a publicity tour When Milne died in  Duttonbought the dolls from his estate for  Pooh heroMilne sonChristopher Robin Milne expressed his satisfaction with Poohs American homebefore his own death in             The law favors the Americans but does justiceTo whom does WinniethePooh belong Who is WinniethePooh really            There aretwo camps in the Pooh feud nativist and internationalist The nativistDunwoody logic Pooh was born in Britain in  his creator AA Milne wasBritish his owner Christopher Robin was British he was raised in BritainsHundred Acre Wood and he played Poohsticks in a British river Ergo Pooh isan Englishman Englishbear whatever Americans counter with aninternationalist view Pooh is a citizen of the world as Giuliani put itHundred Acre Wood is not identifiably British What kind of English forest hasa wild kangaroo and a tiger Besides say the internationalists Milneslanguage is universally charming a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness and hismoral lessons are universally applicable if you visit a friend and gorgeyourself on honey you are likely to end up stuck in his doorway for a weekwhile he uses your legs as a towel rackhow true            But there is a third view of Pooh that he is neitherBritish nor global He is American If you could summarize what an American isor a Brits idea of what an American is it would be Pooh He is a VeryAmerican Sort of Bear a bear without a single English quality Like thepioneers of the Old West Pooh is endlessly greedy and he is cunning inpursuit of that greed WinniethePooh is at bottom the story ofPoohs quest for honey honey  money His appetite cannot be sated He eatsRabbits honey he eats the honey meant for the Heffalump trap he eats thehoney that is Eeyores birthday present he tries to eat a beehives honeyPooh is naive and ignorant He spells poorly honey is hunny and he isimpressed by the pretentious wisdom of Owl But when it comes to avarice Poohhas a native intelligence He cant reach a beehive by climbing so hejuryrigs a balloon to raid the hive from the air Owl and Eeyore the two mostobviously British characters are talkers Pooh is a doer            Poohsgreed is tempered by an allAmerican friendliness Of Britains most memorablechildrensbook charactersToad and Badger in The Wind in the Willows Aslan in the Narnia books Alice and the Mad Hatter in Alices Adventuresin Wonderland Pooh is by far the sunniest There is no dark side to Poohno complicated European soul Pooh is guileless blithe goodnatureddemocratic He is the best friend to all There is also a brashselfconfidence to Pooh He composes to himself that would have done Whitmanproud            Poohs world too is far more American thanBritish Hundred Acre Wood resembles an idealized vision of Americas pioneerpast a wild empty land populated by a few hardy pioneers who band togetherwhen danger threatens Heffalumps            And Pooh belongs to Americafor economic reasons as well as literary ones Where would he be today
