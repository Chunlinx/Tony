                                 Bill Bradleys Vietnamnbsp            A yearago Bill Bradley and John McCain faced a daunting challenge in Iowa Each manwas up against a wellfinanced frontrunner who could marshal interest groupsand local politicians to bring out a big vote on caucus night Each man hadtaken a principled position during his Senate careerMcCain against ethanolsubsidies Bradley against Midwestern flood relief funded by federalborrowingthat could be used against him in Iowa Bradley decided to go intoIowa anyway McCain decided to stay out That difference says a great dealabout where each man comes from and where he goes from here            Bradley is an idealist Unlike the technocrats party hacks and angrypopulists who have contended for the Democratic presidential nomination overthe past three decades he echoes the valor and innocence of the early sThe class warfare of Rep Dick Gephardt and Sen Tom Harkin is as foreign tohim as the incrementalism of Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton Bradleylooks instead to the programs and principles of the New Frontier and the GreatSociety He preaches faith boldness and big solutions to national problemsHe sees distrust of government not as educated skepticism but as uneducatedcynicism He calls for a new war on poverty He wants to outlaw antigaydiscrimination by reopening the  Civil Rights Act He speaks constantly ofracial unity without defining it as though the very concept were ascontroversial today as it was then His campaign slogan distills the idealismof that era It can happen            Thecase against that idealism is that it didnt happenthat big governmentsolutions failed or backfired that the War on Poverty was lost and that theracial equality that liberals promised in law remained frustrated by culturaland economic factors they had thought government could easily overcome Thesesetbacks brought discredit to the whole idea of government activism convertingpractical failure into political failure Liberalism became a dirty wordDemocrats banished from the White House learned to temper their ambitionsThe courage of Al Gore Sr who lost his Senate seat to a liberalbashingcampaign in  gave way to the caution of Al Gore Jr            Butcaution can be frustrating Why not guarantee health insurance for allAmericans Why not outlaw all cheap handguns Why not ban soft money and fundelections publicly This is Bradleys inspiration and message Hes tired oftimid Democrats who nibble around the edges With confidence and principlehe argues Americans can create a world of new possibilities guided bygoodness in which all obstacles can be surmounted Gores entrenched assetsin Iowa seemed just another obstacle Bradley didnt flinch He joined thebattle on Gores terrain He poured millions of dollars into the state Heoffered a vision of a better world confident that he could win over the heartsand minds of Iowans            JohnMcCain witnessed that kind of confidence in Vietnam the courage to fight onunfamiliar terrain the will to spend freely the faith in hearts and minds Hespent years in a prison camp paying the price of those ambitions He learnedthe skepticism of the soldier Like Bradley McCain is an idealist But unlikeBradley he came away from the s chastened by nobilitys limits McCainsees a world not of new possibilities guided by goodness but of threatsabroad and hubris at home To those who believe gun control will cure schoolviolence he replies that the Internet is full of Web sites illustrating how tobuild pipe bombs To those who promise big tax cuts based on projectedsurpluses he replies that the government must first pay off its debts andtrust funds            Havingexperienced war firsthand McCain respects prudence more than bravado He seesthe battles before him as tests not of manhood but of strategy and disciplineHis objective is to get the job done He saw that Iowa was a quagmire He sawthat New Hampshire with its open primary and penchant for mavericks was morefavorable terrain The book on presidential politics says a candidate mustcompete in Iowa to be taken seriously But soldiers throw out the book all thetime So McCain spurned Iowa He gambled that he could raise enough money anddrum up enough support in the New Hampshire polls to guarantee his credibilityuntil the primary            McCains mantra is that hes willing to fight I am not afraid he repeatedover and over in his announcement speech last fall But his strategic advantageis the opposite Having proved his courage as a soldier he can get away withducking fights as a candidate No one who avoided the Vietnam draft by signingup as an Army journalist or Texas Air Guardsman can call a POW a coward SoMcCains fellow candidates gave him a bye on Iowa And just in case anyone inthe press corps thought of accusing McCain of chickening out he framed hisevasion of Iowa as a sacrifice he had to endure for his principled oppositionto ethanol subsidies            McCaingot  percent of the Republican vote in Iowa last night Bradley got  percentof the Democratic vote Yet the media consensus is that McCain is ready forBush in New Hampshire while Bradley has suffered a grievous blow and faces thelikelihood of a conclusive defeat next week Front pages and TV pundits nowspeak of Bradley in the past tense while bubbling with excitement over aGranite State showdown for George W Bush Steve Forbes and McCain TonightI have a little more humility but no less confidence that I can win and do thejob Bradley conceded as the unhappy returns came in The confidence may wellbe warranted But the humility may have come too late
