Abuse penalties questionedFines the same for beating a dog in countyBy Maria HerneTuesday December  If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County youll probably get a fineIf you repeatedly beat a woman youll probably get the samefineIn  county judges heard  Protection From Abuse casesfinding the defendant guilty in  percent of those cases eitherafter a hearing or through a technical violation or pleaOf those found guilty the majority were ordered to pay courtcosts plus a  fine No defendants were ordered to pay morethan a  fine for violating the court order In  percent ofthe cases the charges were dismissed or the defendant was foundnot guilty In the rest of the cases charges were withdrawn or thematter is not yet resolved Sarah T Casey executive director ofSchuylkill Women in Crisis finds it disturbing that in most casesthe fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someonewould get for cruelty and abuse toward an animalIn most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County thepenalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stifferthan those in Schuylkill County Casey said What kind of messageare we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuseorders That its OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County becauseyoull only get a slap on the wristUnder state law the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is the maximum fine is  and up to six months in jailLike others who are familiar with how the countys legal systemdoes and doesnt work for victims of domestic violence Caseybelieves some changes are in orderValerie West a managerattorney with MidPenn Legal Serviceswith offices in Pottsville and Reading regularly handles domesticviolence casesShe finds fault with the local requirement that a custody ordermust be established within  days after a PFA is filedWest said she feels a custody order should be allowed to standfor the full term of the PFA  up to  months  as it does in manyother counties in the stateIt places an undue burden on the plaintiff in terms of costfinding legal representation and facing their abuser  not tomention a further burden on the system to provide those servicesWest said It may be difficult for the parties to reach anagreement so soon after violence has occurred ItscounterproductiveThe lack of supervised custody visitation in the county  aneutral safe supervised place where children can be exchangedfrom one parent to another for the purposes of visitation is also a concernRight now we dont have any agency in the county willing tohandle supervised custody visits West said Obviously indomestic violence cases this is a major concern to us Theres apotential for further incidents of abuse to occur during thesemeetings without some sort of outside supervisionMarsha Chwastiak an attorney in the Pottsville office ofMidPenn Legal Services said she would like to see more funds madeavailable to provide social services for troubled familiesgrappling with domestic violence issuesIf I had one wish for Christmas it would be to have moreresources available to help these families so they can try and sortout their problems Chwastiak said In the majority of domesticviolence cases I see alcohol drug and mental health problems areat the heart of the problem I feel these are more social problemsthan legal cases she saidOther problems targeted by SWIC include a need for moreexpedient service of PFAs the need for free or affordable legalrepresentation and assistance with PFA and contempt hearings andother civil matters related to abuse including custody andsupport and the lack of proper training by law enforcementofficials in handling domestic violence cases Casey saidA recent  federal grant from the US Department ofJustice Violence Against Women Office may be the answer to some ofthese problemsThrough the collaborative efforts of Schuylkill Women In Crisisthe Schuylkill County Sheriffs Department and county grant writerLorraine A Bennick the Pathways to Safety program wasinitiatedThe twoyear program is fully funded under the JusticeDepartments Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcementof Protection Orders initiative Some of the ways the funds willbe spent
