AcademyAwards ceremony saw a streaker charge across the stage and brought the housedown with an adlib about the fellow showing off his shortcomings Nivenwouldnt get a laugh here Myers has rendered himself invulnerable to theincinerating oneliners of prudes and sniggerers Austin might be oblivious tohis own ridiculousness but Myers isnt He has made Austins shortcomingsthe mans strongest suit and the act of showing them off both smashingly funnyandyesattractive Forget about defeating Dr Evil Austin Powers representsthe exuberant conquest of shame                           The Spy Who ShaggedMe is better than anyone dared hope bigger more inventive and morefrolicsome than its predecessor with a grab bag of scatological gags that arealmost as riotous when you think back on them Im laughing now The moviegives infantilism a good name Let me add that I wasnt a fan of the firstinstallment Austin Powers International Man of Mystery  whichtanked after a lively opening It was rife with overextended jokesand thestrange thing was that the joke wasnt the joke the joke was the overextensionof the joke The terrible flaccid timing was what was supposed to be funny Iwondered What does it say when a gifted performer such as Myers sets out tomake a bad movie the kind of cheeseball s Bond imitation that untalentedpeople made by accident But I underestimated Myers connection to thematerial As a youth he evidently fantasized about living in Londonsswinging s portrayed in movies as an era when ugly posturing little guyscould routinely make it with longhaired shortskirted

Hisresulting alter ego Austin Powers is Man before the Fallprovided you seethe Fall as the mids when embarrassment returned to the culture with avengeance            It helps that in The Spy Who

MindySterling but postcoitus cannot maintain a guiltless hedonism It gotweird didnt it he murmurs            The director Jay Roach keeps the picture bumping alongrefusing to give the gags more weight than they warrant Actually he rarelygives them any weight The bad jokes dont fall flat so much as blowaway like onion skins The commercial tieinsfor Starbucks Virgin AtlanticAirlines and Heinekenarent as oppressive as one might fear althoughAustins AOL email address is a cybernetic badge of uncool You go to a movielike this for the cameos and injokes for Tim Robbins popping up as a harriedUS

that Elizabeth Hurley brought to the first Austin Powers More than that I wish that Myers had it in him to cultivate his counterpart asa comic actress and then let her ripan actress who could be nerdy andalluring at once whod have a comeback for I put the grrrrr inswinger baby I nominate Lisa Kudrow but there are probably others You justhave to be brave enough to look For all Myers fearlessness he has yet toprove his manhood by letting an equal into his bed            L imbo  the latest effort from John Sayles strainsto be a great movie to the point where it breaks into two differentmoviesneither fully successful but both with huge compensations The firstis a grimly sardonic portrait of Alaska as a kind of Third World meltingpotfull of desperate poverty and crime and on the verge of a transition to atouristbased economy in which the interior will be cleared of timber but anillusion of wildness maintained Alaska were promised will turn into agiant neoDisney theme park The other story is the love affair between aluckless torch singer Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and a luckless exfishermanDavid Strathairn in which the twothrough a series of melodramaticcontrivances that testify to Sayles lack of ingenuity as a storytellerend uptogether with the singers brilliant desperately unhappy daughter VanessaMartinez on a remote island where theyre prey to cold starvation and drugsmugglers with shotguns            Plotting was never Sayles forte What he did havefrom the start was an actors insight into how people dramatize themselves anda novelists insight into how they actually appear He can write sharp funnyspiels and interlocking monologues in which people misrepresent themselves butsomehowmiraculouslycommunicate their essence At some point though hedecided to become a saint of leftist independent filmmaking to turn away fromhis real gifts suppress his craftiness and make movies about ordinary peoplecrushed by an economic system that sets brother against brother or sister Hecultivated a wanness in himself he labored to locate the Canadian within            At its worst Limbo is about when bad thingshappen to good people and its ending is cruelly abrupt although maybemerciful if it means what I think it does But its best is really good Imnot sure I totally buy Strathairn as a diffident loner with an achingconscience over a tragedy that wasnt his faultthe quintessential guiltlesssinner But Sayles has written some gorgeously tender and funny encountersbetween him and Mastrantonio And she is simply extraordinary Always a superbactress who never quite had the stature for a leap to stardomMastrantoniolike Diane Lane in A Walk on the Moon has developedlayers and an edge Her Donna De Angelo I hate that tartangel name is bothdesperate to grab onto a man and smart enough to watch in horror as shesgrabbing She has a torch singers simultaneous immersion and distanceatalent for watching herself fall and for commenting on it exquisitely This isa major performance one of the comebacks of the decade
