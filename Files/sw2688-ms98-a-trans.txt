            i uh i have not like i was saying i havent i have not had to make the decision for uh regarding uh care for anyone of my family members however ive had quite a few friends that have had to make that decision   well see i dont have a relative thats made it over sixty one uhhuh   oh really   but my childrens on their fathers side have them up into the nineties   man yeah   but uh   the only time we came close and we started looking into it was when my grandmother became senile she start senile at fifty   huh   and at that time the homes that we were looking for when i was a kid uh my mother i can remember them arguing they couldnt find one that it was either clean enough or they took enough care or there was one thing or another that continuously arguing about it   uhhuh   and they ended up keeping her from relative to relative and of course she died when she was fifty nine so it wasnt that long   uhhuh its a     the few ive been in they have varied tremendous   uhhuh yeah i think theres theres so many that are uh that are you know retirement homes   so uh   that are geared toward the ambulatory person you know the ambulatory person that is still extremely active and just wishes not to have to live alone you know separate any longer and then there are the uh the nursing homes which actually provide you know nursing care i guess it goes theres a wide range   oh well we were talking about it the other day because a girl at work has got that problem right now   uhhuh   and uh she keeps saying shes never going to put her mother in one and i says hey look go around look at them theyre totally different than your concept concept of what it was years ago   uhhuh   and i says i dont know what condition your mothers in which i didnt   uhhuh   but you do have the choice now and i says what is your mother going to do all day long while youre out here at work   uhhuh   i says think about what she would like to have because a lot of them hey they might be bedridden but at least theyve got company and people their own age to talk to   uhhuh   to keep them home what do youve got   thats right   theyre sitting there like theyre they vegetate is what happens   thats true thats thats what i would be afraid of i would rather personally i would rather be in a community of other people with a greater chance of having similar interest with them rather than being stuck in a home where i mean if you if you couldnt drive i guess i mean if youre no longer have the the freedom of driving   uhhuh   then it it changes it so drastically because you cant go someplace to do something when you want to you have you are totally dependent on someone else to provide all your entertainment for you and that would i dont think i would like that i think i would rather if i where in that situation i think i would rather live in a in a nursing home situation   see youre not aware of the the horror stories and things like that that ive grown up with   uhhuh   and i mean im talking about horror stories and theyre still out there i mean its its not something thats eliminated eliminated been eliminated     no   there are lots of homes out there that just literally people drop them off forget about them and they change hands i mean im not saying they dont investigate they investigate its great when theyre there but unless they keep current with it and they changes hands it goes either direction   uhhuh   because   yeah thats true   theyre relying on a lot of people that hey theyre like any other business if you lose a lot of your customers they get into a financial bind   thats true   and people say well you know theyre a nursing home but the hey it doesnt work that way theyre a business   thats true and and the the nurses that they hire are frequently not um the most qualified in their field and uh   well like my neighbor she runs down here to this nursing home down here   umhum   and she just point blanks tired the pressure and responsibility of working as a nurse in a hospital   uhhuh   she admits it shes tired of it so she works down here shes a nurse shes qualified   uhhuh   but shes fifty oh shes in her fifties early fifties somewhere and working down here at the nursing home keeps her hand in there she gets good money for it and she enjoys the old people you know its its just that simple for her   uhhuh yeah   but uh she says its hard they get cranky they get obstinate but she feels the same way i do i would rather depending on the situation i would rather be able to put myself or anybody else in a nursing home if i was able to get close enough to them   right   so they dont feel lost   right i think   now see my grandmother she wouldnt go in a nursing home besides being scared and everybody else didnt want her she was terrified of one literally and positively terrified   yeah   because she remembers the old stuff   uhhuh my great grandmother was and she was she was terrified that some day someone might try to put her in a nursing home she even wrote a song about it she used to sing but   uhhuh uhhuh   i mean she she died when she was ninety six and uh from a fall i mean she didnt die of natural causes she died from a fall she uh you know had she been younger it would not she would not have died from the fall but she uh you know and she was still she was still  household independent she was independent in the household you know in the home and she couldnt drive but heck but shed never learned to drive to begin with so i mean it wasnt um her age that had prevented her but she was she was very afraid that someone would try to put her in a nursing home and she lived with her daughter my grandmother until she died and uh my grandmother still at seventy uh shes seventy nine this year uh is living independently and she drives  just to church and back and to and to the store you know all there right in just a block or two but shes still real independent so     oh she drives yeah   i think that for so many people that uh the nursing home represent obviously different uh different things and depending on the level of function whereas my you know my grandmother doesnt need need any extra uh camaraderie or anything like that because she gets it from her church or from her friends that come by but uh ive seen a lot of people that dont live near their family or dont have you know significant roots in this in their little community theyve been uprooted for some reason or another and they i i think that it would be good for them to be into a situation that would offer them uh oh activities to maintain an active mind because like you say if you just put them in the house and keep them there all day long and they they become they vegetate  and thats   oh yeah theyve got nothing or they get on the telephone all day long       but i mean this is one area where id like to see social security or the government step in an d take people over a certain age or with handicaps or something and take their social security away from them i mean give them you know money at a certain point and putting them in homes to where they can get something fed back to them in other words people talk to and become still human beings   uhhuh   because you see people down in south Dallas and every where else sitting in a house they dont know anybody theyre scared to death of robbers theyre scared to death of everything   uhhuh   they hardly have enough food to even eat on i meant theyre not living   and thats not living right right exactly exactly   yeah i mean hey im putting all this money out to the government why cant they put it out there rather than in the federal prisons um   yeah they         but you know you see pictures on TV i mean i wish i had enough money to go down there and do something but you know i dont know they if they can have day care why cant they put elderly people care and put them in a home to where its regulated   yeah   i mean its its a shame that we have this to where its we dont think of our older people we really dont   oh no i mean look at the uh Orientals  they protect respect uh they conserve their elderly for for what they are theyre a true natural resource and they cherish them and uh yet i mean we as Americans are such a throw away society that weve basically done that with generations of people that have so called outlived their usefulness you know i i think thats uh an atrocity and im fortunate enough that ive had uh my relatives have lived very long full lives and uh or most of them have and as a result i have uh ive been you know
