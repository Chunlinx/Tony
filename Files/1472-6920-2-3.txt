                    Background        The geographical distribution of publications as an        indicator of the research productivity of individual        countries regions or institutions has recently become a        field of interest It has been investigated for the members        of the European Union     the USA     the Gulf        Cooperation Council countries     Colombia            South Korea    and for a Turkish medical school            The research output of individual    and selected        countries     for single specialties as well as the        contribution of individual countries to selected journals           has also been reviewed To the best of our knowledge        such an investigation was not carried out in the field of        medical education But would it not be important to find        out which countries are the most influential concerning the        future of medical education Who are the opinion formers        and who does not take part in this important discussion        One way to answer these questions is to investigate which        countries contribute to the most prestigious journals in        this field Therefore a study of the geographical        distribution of publications in the two leading medical        education journals determined by their impact factor was        carried out The number of countries that contributed to        Academic Medicine and Medical Education and the amount of        their contribution was examined with the help of the        Internet provider PubMed the Medlinedatabase of the        National Library of Medicine                        Methods                  Medical education journals and their impact          factor          In the  Journal Citation ReportsScience Edition              journals were listed in the subject category          education scientific disciplines Academic Medicine          had the highest impact factor with  followed by          Medical Education with  All the remaining journals           not only those ones dealing with medical education but          also journals like the Journal of Biological Education           had an impact factor below  Six of the remaining          eleven had an impact factor below  The third ranked          medical education periodical was Medical Teacher with an          IF of  Out of these  journals only Academic          Medicine and Medical Education were listed in PubMed in          each of the years from  to           Nineteen journals were listed in PubMed under the MeSH          heading education medical     Five of these          journals were predecessors of some of the remaining           journals eg the British Journal of Medical Education          as the predecessor of Medical Education Only four          journals were listed in PubMed throughout the whole          investigated period of time These are Academic Medicine          Comprehensive Therapy Health Policy and Medical          Education Out of this four only Academic Medicine and          Medical Education were also listed in the subject          category education scientific disciplines of the           Journal Citation ReportsScience Edition                              Journal selection          Although science is a discipline that prides itself on          precision quantification standards and controls there          is no absolute gold standard for the quality of          scientific publications     Only the two leading          journals with the highest impact factor in the field of          medical education category education scientific          disciplines    were investigated in this study to          introduce some quality assessment No measure of quality          is perfect or even close to it but the citation index          does provide some indication of how reliable important          and useful investigators find the work that is published          in a given journal     The impact factor is not          valid for the assessment of the quality of individual          papers but it is a valid tool for the quality assessment          of scientific journals                              Search methodology          PubMed was used to search Medline in December           PreviewIndex was selected from the features bar          Academic Medicine or Medical Education was entered into          the Journal field The search included the years from           to  which were entered into the Publication          Date field respectively Finally journal article was          selected as Publication Type to exclude letters          editorials news etc     The search results were          displayed in the MEDLINE format and the affiliation for          each entry was retrieved for each journal in each year          If the affiliation of an entry could not be obtained from          PubMed it was looked up in the paper version of the          journal If more than one country was listed in the          affiliation each of them was rewarded with a count                            Results        From  to   journal articles were published        in Academic Medicine and  journal articles were        published in Medical Education The number of published        articles per year increased for both journals Fig  The        affiliation could not be retrieved for  entries  of        all articles from Academic Medicine and for  entries         of all articles from Medical Education        Academic Medicine published articles from  different        countries between  and  whereas Medical Education        had contributions from  countries in the same period of        time Table         Three countries contributed at least one article in each        year of the investigated period of time to the journal        Academic Medicine These countries are the USA Canada and        the Netherlands        Eight countries contributed at least one article in each        of the six years to Medical Education These countries are        Australia Canada Hong Kong New Zealand Sweden the        Netherlands the UK and the USA        Authors from the USA were responsible for  and        their colleagues from Canada for  of all articles in        Academic Medicine Table  Fig  In Medical Education        authors from the United Kingdom Australia the USA Canada        and the Netherlands together contributed approximately         of all articles Table  Fig                     Discussion        In this investigation the geographical distribution of        publications in the two leading medical education journals        and the contribution of individual countries to both        journals were studied Authors from all over the world        published articles in Medical Education and to a lesser        extent in Academic Medicine but both journals were        dominated by authors from a few Englishspeaking countries        with the exception of the Netherlands Most of the articles        in Academic Medicine were written by US and to a lesser        extent Canadian researchers whereas authors from the UK        Australia Canada and the USA were the main contributors to        Medical Education        Recently Kremer et al investigated the geographical        distribution of publications in reproductive medicine            They compared the number of publications in the two        leading journals of this field and found that the UK was        the most productive country in one journal and that the USA        was the most productive country in the other as well as in        both journals together This is in accordance with our        results that show the UK as the leading nation in Medical        Education  of all articles whereas authors from the        United States were the most productive contributors to        Academic Medicine  and both journals together                It was reported that the proportion of authorship by        investigators from US institutions has declined for        critical care research publications from  of all authors        in  to  in      This is in contrast to our        findings that the proportion of authorship by investigators        from US institutions remained fairly constant in both        journals with minor fluctuations        Our search method differed from the previously described        method     of using the Affiliation field to enter        country names for good reason First it was noted that        spelling mistakes occur in Medline     These could        have an influence if the Affiliation Field would have        been used to enter country names When we look at the        search strategy used in our study it seems unlikely that        the results could have been affected by misspelling The        use of the Affiliation field is also limited by the fact        that the name of a country can be dropped from the        affiliation if the publisher is located in the same country            Further such a search strategy would be        questionable because country names can appear in street        names of other countries     Therefore the use of the        Affiliation Field was avoided right at the beginning and        the affiliation for each single entry was retrieved from        the MEDLINE format        This study is limited by the fact that the affiliation        in PubMed only includes the institutional affiliation and        address of the first author     Therefore some        articles may have authors from more than one country but        only the country of the leading author was detected with        the applied search strategy To our surprise a few entries        had two countries listed in their affiliation field Hence        some of the articles resulting from international        cooperation were found Besides it seems unlikely that this        limitation had a significant influence on the results of        this study when we consider the nature of most journal        articles dealing with the topic of medical education        Further we have to remind us that publications about        medical education are not only found in journals dedicated        to this field but also in other journals eg general and        internal medicine journals Also contributions about the        education in special fields can regularly be found in        specialty journals for example articles about the teaching        of anatomy in the Journal of Anatomy Moreover some        countries have journals of medical education in their own        language eg the German Medizinische Ausbildung which        are often not indexed in Medline and are not evaluated for        their impact factor by the Institute of Scientific        Information Some journals are included in other        international databases but not in Medline Furthermore it        should be emphasized that many research papers originating        from developing world countries and from nonEnglish        speaking countries are published in reputable peerreviewed        local or regional journals that are not listed in Medline        What makes things worse is that the already low        representation of these journals in Medline is further        vanishing eg it is known that there is a progressive        disappearance of Latin American journals from Medline            On the other hand researchers striving for the broadest        possible exposure and recognition of their work generally        prefer to publish their findings in highly cited        international journals     For biomedical disciplines        these highly cited international journals are probably        those which are covered by Medline            As emphasized by its editor     Medical Education        is the official journal of the World Federation for Medical        Education and has therefore an important international        role In contrast Academic Medicine is the official        journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges        Hence the organizations represented by both journals could        explain the difference in the number of contributing        countries and the domination of Academic Medicine by North        American authors especially when remembering that journals        which represent a national society tend to publish to a        certain extent more papers coming from the country of        origin of the journal itself than from elsewhere                   British authors were the main contributors to the        UKbased Medical Education This is in accordance with        previous results from the field of gastroenterology and        hepatology showing that a large proportion of papers        originating from the UK appeared in British journals            The reasons for this observation remain to be elucidated        One could argue that a journal is more likely to accept        manuscripts submitted from within the country of its own        origin But as stated before    the equal opportunity        policy and the scientific rigor of these journals cant be        questioned Further there is data from a major British        medical journal showing that the acceptance rate for        submitted manuscripts from the different parts of the world        was approximately the same while the number of submissions        from the UK was around fifteen times as high as the numbers        from Africa Asia South and Central America combined            Accordingly a lower number of submissions from the        developing world could be a reason for the geographical        distribution in the two investigated journals On the other        hand an investigation assessing if US reviewersnonUS        reviewers evaluated manuscripts differently depending on        whether the manuscripts were submitted from outside the USA        or from the USA showed that reviewers from the USA and        outside the USA evaluated nonUS papers similarly and        evaluated papers submitted by US authors more favorably        with US reviewers having a significant preference for US        papers     This would indicate that a selection bias        must not be ruled out In the case of Academic Medicine and        Medical Education we can only speculate because the        native versus foreign manuscript submissionacceptance        rates of these two journals are not known to us Further we        do not know the quality of the submitted manuscripts The        only information available is that Medical Education        published around  of unsolicited papers in                    In a recent survey investigators in the less developed        world were asked what complicated publication in US or        European based journals     They repeatedly referred        to the same topics English as a language barrier        constitutes a huge problem     Further the capability        of selecting the right journal has an influence It was        stated that some researchers were unfamiliar with the range        of journals open to them     Therefore manuscripts        that are not accepted for publication in one of the        internationally known general medical journals like the BMJ        or JAMA are frequently send to local periodicals while        overlooking the speciality journals     In the case of        medical education this would suggest that papers are only        send to general medical journals while researchers are not        aware of the speciality journals in this field like        Academic Medicine But we have to be cautious with this        argument because some researchers deliberately publish        their work in the local journals to reach the audience in        their home country If they would publish their paper in an        international journal it could happen that their results        never reach the majority of medical professionals in their        home country for the same reasons like the language barrier        and also scarce library resources Some journals have        supplied evidence against the perception of an editorial        bias against work submitted from the developing world But        there seems to be something true about the argument that to        secure the maximum number of subscribers who can afford to        pay an annual subscription as well as increasingly        discriminating advertisers journals always have to work        hard to appeal to the developed world audience            Therefore the filling of scarce pages with research from        the developing world makes no commercial sense and        publishers are unlikely to support editors who take their        journals in such a direction     This hindrance should        be swept away by the appearance of ejournals like the        BioMed Central periodicals which theoretically have no        page limitations        Providing free access to journals for the poorer        countries in the world    may help to solve some of the        other problems For example developing world researchers        which are not aware of the variety of journals open to        their research have now a possibility to inform        themselves The opportunity of submitting a manuscript via        the Internet excludes possible obstacles caused by poor        postal services Further journals should try to remove        remaining doubts about their manuscript selection process        This could be achieved by publishing the acceptance and        submission rates for each region of the world The        inclusion of more investigators from the developing world        on the editorial boards should also be considered            Additionally researchers from the developing world should        be encouraged to submit more of their research to the        leading international medical journals                    Conclusions        The geographical distribution of publications in the two        leading medical education journals was investigated        Authors from all over the world published articles in        Medical Education and to a lesser extent in Academic        Medicine But while there is a wide distribution of the        contributing countries both journals are dominated by        authors from a few Englishspeaking countries with the        exception of the Netherlands        This study is to the best of our knowledge the first        that provides some facts for a discussion about the        engagement of single countries on the topic of medical        education measured by the amount of their contribution to        these two journals
