                                 A Good Year for the Roses            Early in AmericanBeauty  Lester Burnham Kevin Spacey a weary reporter for a mediamagazine masturbates in the shower while informing us in voiceover that werewitnessing the highlight of his day He peers through tired eyes out the windowat his manicured suburban tracthouse lawn where his wife Carolyn AnnetteBeningwhose gardening clogs he points out are colorcoordinated with thehandles of her shearssnips roses American beauties and twitters aboutMiracleGro to a gay yuppie Scott Bakula on the other side of a white picketfence I have lost something says Lester Im not exactly sure what it isbut I know I didnt always feel this  sedated Apparently Lester doesntrealize that snipped roses are gardenvariety symbols of castration or hedknow what he has lost But the makers of American Beauty are about togive Lester his roses back At a highschool basketball game Lester istransfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela Mena Suvari who is twirlingalongside his daughter Jane Thora Burch Ambient noise falls away the crowddisappears and there she is Lesters angel writhing in slow motionjust forhim She opens her jacket shes naked underneath and red rose petals driftout Later Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals then immersed in abath of red petals Back in the roses for the first time in years hes soonpumping iron smoking pot and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bossesconvinced that whatever he has lost hes getting back baby            The movie is convincedtoowhich is odd since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making amiddleaged mans wilted roses bloom is a tad  primitive But AmericanBeauty doesnt feel primitive It feels lustrously hip and awareand a lot of critics are making big claims for it The script by Alan Ball aplaywright and former sitcom writer carries an invigorating blast ofcounterculture righteousness along with the kind of pithily vicious maritalbickering that makes some viewers especially male say Yeah Tell that bitchoff More important it has a vein of metaphysical yearning which thedirector Sam Mendes mines brilliantly A hotshot English theater directorhis Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York Mendes givesthe film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony Themovies surface is velvety and immaculateuntil the action is abruptly viewedthrough the video camera of the teenage voyeur next door Wes Bentley andthe graininess of the video image along with the plangent music suggests howunstable the molecules that constitute our reality really are Mendes candistend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs Aided by hiscinematographer Conrad Hall and editors Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury hecreates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of ameltdown            A merican                Beauty is so wittily written andgorgeously directed that you might think youre seeing somethingarchetypalmaybe even the Great American Movie But when you stop and smellthe roses  Well that scent isnt MiracleGro The hairpin turns from farceto melodrama from satire to bathos are fresh and deftly navigated but almostevery one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy from the corporateflunky named Brad to the interchangeable gay neighbors theyre both calledJim to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door an exMarine colonelChris Cooper who has reduced his wife the normally exuberant Allison Janneyto a catatonic mummy and his son Ricky Bentley to a life of subterraneandeception The colonels idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reaganmilitary picture on television Hows that for subtle Lesters wife Carolynis even more stridently caricatured A realestate broker who fails to sell abig house her only potential customers are blankfaced AfricanAmericansIndianAmericans and surly lesbians she wears a mask of perky efficiency andinsists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat hernutritious yet savory dinners Its amazing that Mendes and Ball get awaywith recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the allpurpose rubricof black comedy            But its also possiblethat those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively Several months agoDaniel Menaker in                   Slate                in contemporary film in which theprotagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technologicalanesthetization into the real Thats the theme here too and itsextraordinarily potent at times even heartbreaking The symbols however havebeen cunningly reversed In movies like sex lies and videotape the protagonist has to put away the video camera to get real in AmericanBeauty  its Ricky Fitts the damaged stoner videomaker next door who seesbeauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness In the films mostselfconsciously poetic set piece Ricky shows Lesters dour daughter Janeinwhom he recognizes a kindred spirita video of a plastic bag fluttering updown and around on invisible currents of wind Ricky speaks of glimpsing inthe bags trajectory an entire life behind thingsa benevolent force thatholds the universe together The teenager who likes to train his lenses ondead bodies of animals and people sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lesterand somehow passes on this notion of beauty By the end Lester is mouthingthe same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance That must besome really good shit theyre smoking            Its not the druggy philosophizing however that makesAmerican Beauty an emotional workout Its that the caricatures aregrounded in sympathy instead of derision Everyone on screen is in seriouspain The manipulative sexpot Angela who taunts her friend Jane with the ideaof seducing her dad acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary As themilitary martinet Cooper goes against the grain turning Col Fitts into asour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over hisinability to reach out When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end thedeluge completes him The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute alibel on the female sex but there isnt a second when Bening sends the womanup She doesnt transcend the part she fills it to the brim anatomizes itYou cant hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hardto appearconfident composed in control When she fails to sell that house she closesthe shades and lets go with a naked wailits the sound of a vacuum crying tobe filledthen furiously slaps herself while sputtering Shut upyoureweakshut up  Then she breathes regains her gogetem poise replacesher mask Carolyn isnt a complicated dramatic construction but Bening givesher a primal force An actress who packs more psychological detail into asingle gesture than others get into whole scenes Bening was barreling down theroad to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren Its a joy toobserve herboth here and in Neil Jordans In Dreams back atfull throttle                           American Beauty is Spaceys movie thoughHe gives ithow weird to write this about Spacey who made his name playingflamboyantly selfinvolved psychopathsa heart Early on he lets his face andposture go slack and his eyes blurry He mugs like crazy telegraphing Lestersloserness But Spaceys genius is for mugging in character He makes usbelieve that its Lester whos caricaturing himself  and that bitteredge paves the way for the characters later more comfortably Spaceylikescenes of insult and mockery He even makes us take Lesters final improbablyrhapsodic moments straight            But do the filmmakerstake them straight If I read it correctly the movie is saying that Americansociety is unjust and absurd and lovelessfull of people so afraid of seemingordinary that they lose their capacity to see Its saying that our only hopeis to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man withhis brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a HigherPower But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it got thatwayor if theres anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the bodycountstrikes me as either moronic or insane or both The kind of detachmentthe movie is peddling isnt artistic it isnt lifeits nihilism at its mostfatuous In the end American Beauty is New Age Nihilism            Kevin Costner is  years older than he was as Crash Davisthe overthehill minorleague catcher in Bull Durham  but he canstill get away with playing a professional ballplayer He moves and acts like acelebrity jock and he can make his narcissistic selfcontainment look as ifhes keeping something in reserveto protect his instrument as it were InFor Love of the Game  hes a ish Detroit Tigers pitcher having hislast hurrah The team has been sold and the new owners dont necessarily wanthim back For about half an hour its a great sports movie Costner stands onthe mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher John C Reilly heforces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd the background blursbefore our eyes and the sound drops out and he mutters darkly at a successionof batters some old nemeses some old buddies            He also thinks about his Manhattanbasedexgirlfriend Kelly Preston who tearfully told him that morning that thingswere absolutely over and she was moving to London Theres an appealingflashback to how they met he stopped to fix her car while on the way to YankeeStadium then its back to the game for more nailbiting at bats But prettysoon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast and the balanceof the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can committo Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and thediamond and the game            Maybe its because Im a baseball nut that I hatedto leave the mound But maybe its also because the relationships scenes aresoftfocus generic and woozily drawnout whereas the stuff in the stadium issharply edited and full of texture The rhythms of the game feel right therhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin and the picture drags onfor over two hours I cant believe that the director Sam Raimi  The EvilDead   last years A Simple Plan  thought that all those scenesof Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end upin the final cut but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for thesake of making his first real mainstream picture He might as well have stuckhis head over the plate and said Bean me
