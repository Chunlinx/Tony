        i guess we get started now     yeah     i dont know i you know ive always  was interested in in woodworking i i watch a lot of the PBS stations where they have uh you know the woodworking   umhum   uh shows and that but ive never really done anything myself because i dont really have the tools for it     is that right   but uh someday when i can get up uh enough of the tools i  i wanna try and make a lot of the stuff uh i got books on it and everything and it shows you step by step on how to do it   yeah   but uh   yeah ive never made made much myself i guess uh  do they count uh uh lets see i guess tree houses and things like that dont count as woodworking woodworking do they   well i think anything from you know building a house uh to cabinetry would be woodworking i mean i i think that would be classified that you built a tree house  pretty good     yeah oh yeah you know  hold on a second  you cant pull up  hold on  you cant pull up on it it will disconnect um yeah ive done tree houses and crafts you know craft type of things you know out of plywood and  things of that so i have a a few saws i mean a few a few tools   yeah yeah   that you need for that kind of stuff just not a not like for uh book shelves well i can make bookshelves too i guess nothing like for cabinets or tables or things like that you know you have to have special some special things for that   umhum   yeah but i mean i do household repairs i guess that counts as woodworking doesnt it   yeah i think so i mean   yeah uh   you get skills in that and it helps you in almost anything you do so   yeah   yeah thats fine yeah i wanted a uh maybe i might try and uh even though i dont have too much tools but i dont think it takes too much to build a bookshelf i know i i need one so  maybe   yeah no it doesnt take too much for that my dad does a lot of woodworking i mean he makes like furniture   yeah well it sounds like both our dads are good my dad made a a whole wall cabinet uh closet type thing uh and all he did was he hired someone once to build it and then he watched him and  and he uh built it himself and he did   yeah now what did he make a a cabinet   yeah its kind of a a a closet cabinet um built on a whole wall took up the whole wall and its got uh the for hanging up shirts and pants area and drawers and all sorts of things in there its pretty pretty yeah pretty fancy   uhhuh uhhuh takes up a whole wall huh yeah ive always wanted to make furniture and stuff but  the uh the tools and uh you know after watching my dad do it but the tools have gotten me in uh seems like it very time consuming ive never never with all my kids ive never had much time for that for the time consuming things   yeah yeah i know uh i know watching these programs with some of the fancy tools they have   yeah     it it makes it so easy that i think almost anyone one could do it if they could afford the probably four or five thousand dollars for each item they got uh it just about everything it does um       you know different things for for different cuts and that and uh i think it would make it so much easier but   uhhuh   i think thatd be more for the professional if youre gonna do it as a business uh those types of tools are fine   yeah yeah  well my dad doesnt do it as business and hes and hes got thousands of dollars worth of we got disconnected  we talked for a pretty good while it was here it was on this end here   yeah yeah are we still im still here hello hello hey what happened what what do they do when youre done do they just disconnect you yeah well i just got disconnected thats it you hang i think its hes got a kid there it mustve been
