with a lot of different people from a lot of different sides of the you know what Im saying of the spectrum         Thats why I know that this little that right there is void you know it should be         Revised at least at the bare minimum because I done dealt with people and you cant cant put them in you cant box them         You cant were individuals         And they always sit there and try to say because they want to make a link or make a point and then they want to box us         Other than that were individuals you know         Everybody is everybody         Thats what makes us special         Theres only one of you know what Im saying                     Not really                     Now but you hear what I Im saying though                     I understand what youre saying                     But anyway that was my story you know what Im saying and it was just it was just crazy         But that was our first lesson you know what Im saying to let us know we wasnt home you know wasnt home anymore         We got to bite the bullet         We dont have no uh no no uh refuge         This is it know what Im saying         We jumped in both hands and feet jumped in you know what Im saying         We here         Four years four and a half years later we got a accounting degree you know what Im saying two vehicles you know what Im saying all later models than that that you know what Im saying uh uh than the Maxima was so fuck Dean         you know what Im saying         Im serious you know so but it let us you know where we at I dealt with shit like that to the present day you know what Im saying from different people different sides of the spectrum         People that when I came in I guess I had them boxed and they let me know that they not contained they just a wild unit you know what Im saying         Thats why you know thats why I said what I said about that         Thats it         I forgot another thing         Since Im talking about it Im going to get it off my chest too         I got to get it off completely though         After after that you know what Im saying after I witnessed that that happened you know what Im saying after I witnessed what had happened I sit up there and confronted you know I didnt confront well I did         I kind of confronted him like you know Whats up with the car         You know what Im saying         The man still didnt know that I seen the transaction then         He didnt know that his wife came to me         I just so happened to be the worker she actually talk to you know what Im saying         Told me what she was there for you know what Im saying         He trying to act like he still got the car they still got the car here you know         They still waiting for this that and the third and his wife so after that I just wasnt feeling him no more you know         I I I hated him you know what Im saying         I like I mean because he just he smack then I felt like he you know what Im saying like he violated you know         So he just and then I had to work underneath of him         Then he was smug about it trying to lie about it trying to act like you know nothing happened you know anyway two what two days later he he fired me         Yeah talking about he dont like my attitude because when I come in now I dont smile at him you know what Im saying I dont carry on a conversation with him         I just go on and do my job do a good job and you know and I go         That wasnt good enough for him         He too came to the side told me you know actually he pull me in the back said Can I talk to you         I said Sure         No he didnt         He sent that fat whats that whats the girl name         Rhonda Shasta I hated her         Shasta the kind of female just thought that the sun rose when she opened her eyes         The sun rose you know what Im saying bottom line she was ugly         She was piggish                  And I dont mean I dont mean I dont mean it as in her personality Im talking that but including her her physical         When you looked you get kind of like a piggish          you get a piggish vibe from her for real         And she she was very animated you know very animated real country country         And she just thought that she was the shit         She was there first whatever whatever         Im supposed I dont know Im supposed to tip tap         you know I dont know but you know but Im sure they assumed when they seen a black guy thats it         And they assumed OK well hes this hes that         And they said Hold up shes white         So thats a black guy with a white so that changes everything now         So now they got to try to make a different analysis of OK so hes like this and like that and she got to be like that you know what Im saying and thats the way it is         And then we got to work in them within them compounds         We got to work and we got to survive know what Im saying like thats what I was saying before         People automatically want to make up these these you know these groups but its not true not for each and every one of us         And then the ones that those uh uh particular things that uh uh classify that group soon as I get know what Im saying uh affected by it or have to go through Im either caught off guard or it hurts me or shit sometimes it could destroy people         I mean because thats not me and Im caught off I wasnt expecting that you know what Im saying but anyway he fired me fired me         Because he didnt I wasnt smiling and laughing and all that stuff like that         Told me he didnt like my attitude didnt think my attitude you know he think itd be best if uh uh uh thats the first time I heard its not working out not working cant stand that shit         That shit make you want to put a pin in they fucking eye for real                        All right now dont make me stop this tape                      You know what Im saying                                Would you hurry up                              No you want to hear the voice this is for real Im  years old         I been dealing with this since I was  years old         Never never in my wildest dreams         I dont know its crazy         Its crazy because all you ever heard of was southern hospitality         Thats all you ever heard up north         Classifying         We classified a whole South         We just said OK this is how they are         They just they love you to pieces you know what Im saying         Everything is laid back         They feed the hell out of you you know what Im saying         Everything is just you know the weathers beautiful you know what Im saying         You on farms you see chicken or some kind of fucking animal or something you know what Im saying that you can eat you know what Im saying running around the house or whatever         Dog stuff like that old grandma cooking everything early in the morning         But it wasnt like that         I come to realize when I came down mind you you got to think this is the last place that held on to slavery as long as they could possibly hold on to it         Just about you know what Im saying you know what Im saying         So you got to remember that thats still here thats here         Its the foundation its the essence its the essence         Right now they in the process of trying to you know perfect the masch but Im looking past the masch Im looking at at the entity or what have you you know classify         Im looking at it like that you know it gave me all new meaning to uh uh southern hospitality         Now I understand that         I its just crazy its crazy its crazy         Thats why when I do go to school here Im going to go to school here for dirt cheap because I been living here since they robbed us with Angie and everything so Im going to go for cheap hurt them and then Im Im gone         Im leaving         Im not going to put no money into
