                                 Mr Pot Meet Mr Kettle                           HyperlinkedHypocrisy                        I write this with regard to Ron Rosenbaumsdispatch  Frankly I would have responded directly to him if he were alittle more open to the cyberworld and had provided an address of any kind torespond to He says cyberculture brings out the worst in people Well theresno convincing him otherwise if hes not accepting debate on the issue Then helaunches into a tirade about the arrogance and ignorance of the ChatroomPoseur based on a single email he received questioning his honesty as ajournalistcolumnist            If Rosenbaum wants to be an objective observerfine but he enters with too many preconceptions Two email messages and onetrip to a chat room by his own admission may give him room to give hisinitial reactions but not to cast judgment on an entire culture Rosenbaumwrites Im not unwilling to listen to criticism but a critique clothed insuch an invincible armor of arrogance and ignorance is well typical ofcyberchat rhetoric            You dont think yourrespondent had any real logic or an equitable argument but your posting haseven less You take potshots at him in public as he did to you in private youcalled him a dimwit Thats hypocritical             Dan OBrien                        Meriden Conn                                             Ron Rosenbaum replies                               This letter whileunusually lucid for email is based on a misconception While Ive onlyvisited a chat room once Ive read numerous transcripts excerpts printoutsetc Enough to characterize the typical snide tone I should point out that Iomitted the name of the respondent I critiqued                                       Down onDowd                        What on earth makes Chatterbox  think that thecognoscenti of New York like the recent work of Maureen Dowd any better thentheir counterparts in Washington do The last line I heard from a cognoscentewas Isnt it too bad about Maureen and that was some time ago What seems tohave happened is that Dowd has been playing to a small gallery ofClintonphobes at the New York Times who laugh and applaud wildly as herreputation sinks at about equal speed in all major cities at once            And what makes Chatterbox think he knows all aboutthe Clintons chilly business deal either Surely a kinder and sadder storycan be whittled from the same evidence to wit that Hillary a bluestockingin love with a glamorpuss had too eagerly bought Bills Gladstonelike talesof helping troubled young women to find peace enough so anyway to make apotential laughingstock of herself by repeating them on television and enoughalso to give Bill some terrible legal advice in the specific matter of MonicaSurely a chilly business partner would at least have known about a case thatwas about to go on legal record and would never have urged her husband tobrazen it out with the grand jury and start the whole miserable ballrolling            At any rate when Billwas finally cornered by the school bully and forced to blurt the truth Hillarywas revealed to be not just a wronged woman but a lousy lawyerand she wasmost gratifyingly furious Hillarys rage that night was surely one of the mostauthentic sights ever shown on television prompting the thought that unlikethe absurd Linda Tripp both Clintons really are us in our various phasesandincidentally that Hillary may be the only first lady in my lifetime which goesback a bit that one can even imagine being friends with And since then shehas played her part just fine establishing herself as a separate unit and notjust standing by her man like Dowds failed feminist but standing by herfamily like a grownupa condition that Dowd herself curiously never seems toget any closer to as the years go by In a column airily damning the wholeyounger generation of Kennedys she makes it clear that she has probably neverraised a child herself and worried herself sick about how it would turn outand in another gleefully jumping on James Fallows the day after he was firedfrom U S News  World Report  she indicates that job tenure hasnot been a problem either Good job tenure that isbecause in yet anothercolumn she sneers at Sara Davidson for working on Dr Quinn MedicineWoman  Why cant the silly creature get a perfect job like hers So long asthe pets patriarchs at the Times continue to give her unlimited freedomto write exactly what they like to hear she is sitting prettythough notperhaps in an ideal position to judge anyone else anywhere             WilfridSheed                        SagHarbor NY            PSI have it on the word of a neutral party in a position to know that in herfamous bakeoff with Barbara Bush Hillary undoubtedly made her own cookiesfrom her own recipe and they were excellent No big deal of coursethesethings happen all the time in real life But both Dowd and Chatterbox mightlike to stick it in their stereotypes anyway and smoke it for a whilepreferably in silence                           SUVs Dont KillPeoplePeople Kill People                        Gregg Easterbrook really needs to educate himselfabout SUV owners  Many people I know that own a SUV live and work in ruralareas where they need the offroad and carrying capability of a SUV Nowthose who live in the suburbs who dont use an SUV except for pure streetdriving may be the ones to whom youre referring I own a Jeep Cherokee Yesit does consume more fuel than an econocar But it is a justification I haveaccepted in order to get the performance that I need to earn a living Much ofmy time is spent working in the field as a biologist I do a lot of offroadwork where fourwheel drive is an absolute There really is no option for mebut to own a SUV I am proud to say that I am one of the few who use thesevehicles for how they were really intended to be used            You on the other hand are part of a growingnumber of people that like to target people on the basis of association Yourpetty antics of coalraking put those of us who are sincere and considerate SUVowners at risk You are generating waves that are being heard in Washingtonwhere laws may be drafted that make it harder for someone to own a SUV            I and the many of usthat are the responsible SUV users would appreciate it if you would take yourbrowbashing energy and channel it not to the SUV but to those who abuse theprivilege of driving one Like guns and gun control its not the gun thatneeds to be removed from society its the ass behind the trigger             Tim Mallow                        Cocoa Fla
