                    Background                Bacillus anthracis contains a  kb        plasmid pXO that is required to cause the disease        anthrax     Complete sequencing and annotation        GeneMarkhmm of pXO predicted  open reading frames        ORFs Genbank accession NC Little is known about        the identity and function of pXO ORFs beyond the virulence        genes associated with the         B anthracis capsule          dep capACB acpA         The        goal of this study was to determine if many of the novel        pXO ORFs were unique to         B anthracis  or were conserved in        other closely related         Bacillus cereus and         Bacillus thuringiensis isolates        Conservation of plasmid sequences can provide clues about        the origin of the pXO plasmid and about potentially        conserved gene functions Identification of ORFs that are        specific to         B anthracis are potentially useful        as markers for detection of the pathogen in clinical and        forensic applications                B anthracis is a member of the         B cereusB        thuringiensis phylogenetic group     The members of        this group are nearly indistinguishable by S rDNA        analysis      Plasmids in the         B cereusB thuringiensis isolates        vary greatly in number and size and many of the phenotypic        differences among         B cereus          B thuringiensis  and         B anthracis isolates are conferred        by plasmid encoded genes        Horizontal        plasmid transfer among bacteria including isolates of the         B cereusthuringiensis group has        been documented                Amplified fragment length polymorphism AFLP analysis        of over          B cereus B thuringiensis  and         B anthracis isolates identified        several distinct isolate groups      Eight of the         B cereusB thuringiensis isolates        were found to be very closely related to all         B anthracis isolates and formed a        distinct cluster In the present study         B cereus and         B thuringiensis isolates that vary        in AFLPbased genomic relatedness to         B anthracis were examined for the        presence of DNA sequence similar to pXO to determine        whether portions of this plasmid are conserved in closely        related         Bacillus isolates and to determine        whether the conservation of pXO sequences correlated with        genomic relatedness established by AFLP comparisons                                Results and Discussion        PCR was performed using template DNA from          Bacillus isolates that vary in        relatedness to         B anthracis with primer sets        designed to amplify DNA fragments from  different pXO        ORFs This method was chosen to detect sequences with        potential similarity to pXO because it is rapid and the        reaction products can be readily sequenced Table lists        the isolates tested their genomic relatedness to         B anthracis as determined by Jaccard        distances calculated from AFLP profile comparisons             and the number of positive PCR reactions obtained for        each isolate DNA sequencing of the amplified PCR products        revealed a high degree of sequence similarity to pXO ORFs        Genbank accession numbers AFAF BLAST        blastn evalues were    or less for each ORF        fragment detected which corresponded to sequence        similarity of  or greater In a previous study a        similar approach was used to demonstrate that many of the        ORFs from pXO the toxinencoding plasmid of         B anthracis  were highly conserved        in other isolates from the         B cereusB thuringiensis group                   The number of plasmid ORFs detected in a         Bacillus isolate did not correlate        directly with phylogenetic relationship to         B anthracis as determined by AFLP        The isolates most closely related to         B anthracis as determined by AFLP        produced no more than two PCR products each However two        of the more distantly related isolates         B thuringiensis  and         B thuringiensis AWO produced         and  positive PCR reactions respectively Neither of        these isolates is known to be a human or animal        pathogen        Table lists the  pXO ORFs that were tested in the        PCR assay their putative functions or similarities to        other genes blastp and the PCR results obtained in this        experiment Nineteen different pXO ORF fragments were        detected among the          Bacillus isolates Eight of the        conserved ORFs were similar to sequences contained in        public databases  were unidentified The only pXO ORFs        found in common with the isolates most closely related to         B anthracis Jaccard distance of         or less were ORFs  and  These ORFs have sequence        similarity to a conserved hypothetical protein found in        several bacterial genera and the         tetR family of transcriptional        repressors respectively        A  kb region that contains the capsuleassociated        genes has sequence characteristics that are different from        the rest of the plasmid This region of pXO spans        nucleotides  and includes ORFs  through          ORFs In comparison to the rest of pXO this region has a        larger average gene size  bases         vs  bases a lower gene density         gene         vs  gene per kb of sequence and        larger average intergenic spaces  bases         vs  bases The region also has a        slightly lower percent GC  than the rest of the        plasmid  Although the region is not bracketed by         IS elements or tRNAs that are        characteristic of pathogenicity islands PAIs it bears        features that are similar to the putative PAI identified in        the         B anthracis plasmid pXO            Bacterial sequences with similarity to the         B anthracis cap genes are present in        sequence databases However the capsuleassociated genes                 capABC dep acpA  were not detected        by PCR in the tested         Bacillus isolates The pXO ORF        sequences detected in         B thuringiensis  and         B thuringiensis AWO were        distributed across the entire plasmid sequence except in        the  kb         cap genecontaining region which        appeared to be unique to         B anthracis                 B thuringiensis strain AWO produced        the most products in the PCR assay A hybridization assay        was performed using total genomic DNA from this isolate as        a probe against pXO DNA targets amplified using the         primer sets from the PCR assay Table  The hybridization        assay complimented the PCR analysis by identifying nine        additional conserved ORF sequences that might not have had        exact matches to the PCR primer sequences Total genomic        DNA from         B thuringiensis strain AWO        hybridized with  pXO ORF fragments including all ORFs        tested in the region between ORF  and ORF  Table         ORFs in the  kb pXO         cap genecontaining region did not        hybridize with         B thuringiensis strain AWO DNA                B thuringiensis AWO is a strain        containing a  kb plasmid designated pAW             This strain was derived from         B thuringiensis HD by curing of        its crystal toxin bearing plasmid pHT      The        pAW plasmid contains a replication complex that is        classified as a member of the pAMB family of theta        replicating plasmids that are present in a broad range of        Gram positive species     Plasmid pXO also appears to        be a pAMBlike theta replicating plasmid    and        elements surrounding the replication complex are present in        both pXO and pAW see pXO ORFs     in Tables        and  ORFs   and  were sufficiently conserved        between pXO and pAW to allow detection by PCR or        hybridization see Tables and         Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was used to separate        plasmid and chromosomal DNA in         B thuringiensis AWO and a Southern        hybridization blot using a mixed pool of pXOderived        probes ORFs       was performed to        determine if any of the ORFs were present on the pAW        plasmid Figure A DNA fragment estimated to be  kb in        size hybridized to the mixed pXO probe which is slightly        larger but within  of the reported size of pAW         kb This same PFGE protocol produced a similarly accurate        measurement of the size of the         B anthracis plasmid pXO as        determined by complete DNA sequencing     The        detection of sequences similar to pXO ORFs on pAW        suggests that other pXO genes in addition to those        involved with replication are also located on the pAW        plasmid                    Conclusions        The presence of pXO ORF sequences in          Bacillus isolates did not correlate        with their genomic relatedness to         B anthracis as determined by AFLP        comparisons A similar observation was made in previous        work that examined the conservation of the         B anthracis plasmid pXO among        closely related bacteria            This study explored the extent of sequence conservation        between pXO ORFs and total DNA from other         Bacillus isolates and detected        similar sequences that may be located on the chromosome or        any of several plasmids in each isolate The two isolates        with the most sequence conservation with pXO ORFs         B thuringiensis isolates  and        AWO are known to contain large plasmids      Four        ORFs with high sequence similarity to         B thuringiensis AWO plasmid pAW        were detected     and a mixed pXO ORF probe        hybridized with a PFGE fragment similar in size to pAW        The presence of considerable sequence conservation in more        distantly related isolates rather than among close        relatives combined with the observations stated above is        a pattern consistent with the potential plasmid location of        these sequences Comparative sequence analysis of these        large plasmids with pXO could determine if the observed        sequence conservation was located on these plasmids                    Methods                  Bacterial isolates and DNA isolation          The genomes of the            Bacillus isolates selected for          study were found by AFLP analysis to vary in relatedness          to           B anthracis  Isolates with          Jaccard distances of less than  formed a distinct          cluster with all of the           B anthracis isolates PJ          Jackson unpublished data while the other  isolates          were present in less closely related clusters Table

    pXO PCR primer sets          Oligonucleotide primer sets were identified for           pXO ORFs PCR primer sets were typically positioned           to  bases from ORF termini unless AT richness of the          DNA sequence prohibited the design of primers in that          region Primer sequences are located at          httpbdivlanlgovdatabasesdatabaseshtml The          remaining  pXO ORFs were not included in the present          survey due to suboptimal AT richness amplicon size          and thermodynamic characteristics of the candidate primer          sets                          PCR
