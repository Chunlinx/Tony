                okay uh what do you feel about the nursing homes would you put an elderly relative in one   um only if i had to   thats the way i feel right now im uh concerned with both the sisterinlaw and the and the mother that im uh uh you know one of them will said if anything happens send me there and the other one says please dont send me there   yeah its real hard on both the family and the people i mean   yes yes it is its hard my mother uh well i have four sisters or three sisters and my mother takes turn staying with us and you know shes getting to the point that that im worried about her needing more care than we can offer her   yeah   so uh she cant she its hard for her to get up and down stairs and everything and i just think what are we going to do   yeah well how old is she   uh eighty five   i see yeah well um would like if do you think youre gonna have to its gonna come to that   so i hope not i we will we will do everything in our power not for it to happen so i im hoping that we can take care of her till you know   yeah i went through this with both my grandmothers we had to get someone to look after them but we were lucky and we found someone to look after them in their home we didnt have to put them in a home   well mother uh mother lived about fifty miles from me and a hundred miles and five hundred miles from the other sisters and so if she if someone couldve stayed close by she couldve stayed in her home longer   yeah   but as it was uh she had to come and start living with us and and she gets more dependent all the time   yeah well my great grandmother that we had to put in a nursing home because it got to where my grandmother couldnt take care of her she after they put her in there with i mean she deteriorated i mean her health really got worse after   uhhuh oh i think that happens yeah i think they just give up then   after she would yeah   uh and another thing what  what would you do if you had to what would you look for   well thats um i guess references or whatever from other people first of all and then   well   i mean all the youd have to check i think all the licensing that they go through   umhum and i would check on cleanliness and another thing id check on is the food   yeah   my sisterinlaw was in in one and uh she just just had her hip replaced and so she just went to one you know for the little time for it to exercise and thing   umhum   and theyd feed them really weird things like  uh salad for breakfast and broccoli and she was she had her facilities about her and she didnt i mean she knew that they were doing it wrong   umhum   so i think theyre   yeah see thats what it is is most of the people are so old in there that they dont really know whats going on   yes uhhuh   and i think that they can get away with that   yeah i think thats a problem too so   you have to i think you have to really check into them real closely and then even after you put someone in there then you would wanna   i do too and i   be you know be able to check up on them on a weekly basis just to make sure that they were treating them properly   umhum umhum well the one that i that i we would put my mother in would be about three miles from my home   oh that wouldnt be too bad   and so i would check her to i mean she was in there when she had her her hip replaced too and so i would check on her two or three times a day   yeah its a scary thought   they it is it is and you just you know well it comes right down to it i think itd be heartbreaking how old was your grandmother when you put her in   yeah i think she was like my great grandmother was about she was i think ninety two   your great grandmother oh my word and how old you have a longevity dont you in your family   yeah one of my girlfriends her her great grandmother is a hundred and two but she still lives at home with her with her family or whatever   uhhuh oh thats great yeah   yeah no its a its a tough decision its a tough decision to put to put them in there and then     what oh it is and it and it you know its a tough decision to take them into your home when youre used to your freedom   umhum but just its a lot of responsibility   yeah it is and and uh you know uh well its just like having a child again do you have children oh   no maam   oh youre just a youngster then   yeah   oh oh well i dont think weve solved any great problems but i wish  what   no what um trying to think what else we went through oh and then the medication if they have to have medication thats another thing that that i mean   uhhuh   you never really know and you never really feel confident with anything unless youre actually doing it yourself and if theyre at a home you dont know that theyre being given their medicine   right right and not and uh my mothers on insulin and i think you know just giving her the right amount checking her blood and giving her the right amount   they   and then again back to the food i think that they have uh if they dont eat if they dont eat by themselves or if they dont want like whats that served that day they dont eat it and i think a lot of them starve to death   umhum yeah   they just wither away and   well its kind of like you know you put them in there someone else so someone else can take care of them and then you really wonder you cant feel really confident that theyre being taken care of   no no i dont i i just think the solution if every  but a lot of people cant either cant take care of them at home   what humum   you know if youre working and i i think the ideal situation is like with your grandmother have someone come into their home and live with them and take care of them and a lot of people like to do that   yeah yeah
