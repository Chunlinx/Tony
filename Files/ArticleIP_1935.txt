                                 Setting Sun            In an earlysDilbert  an excessively trendy manager exhorted his team to search forexcellence in the total quality chaos or whatever the Japanese are doing thismonth Only a few years ago the business sections of airport bookstores werelargely given over to tracts revealing the supposed secrets of Japanesemanagement and the menace Japan posed to the United States Then it turned outthe Japanese were human after all and everyone lost interest Westernpundits having once placed Japan on a pedestal now either prefer not todiscuss the subject or see Japans failures mainly as an occasion for smugselfcongratulation            But thenew story is much more interesting than the old one How could a wealthyproductive sophisticated country have gone from enviable growth in the sto stagnation in the s and now be slipping into a downward spiral ofrecession and deflation True Japan is not a country on the edge of chaosasIndonesia or Russia isbut that only adds to the mystery Japan isnt a placewhere the state is weak unable to collect taxes or convince investors thattheir property rights are secure Nor is it a country at the mercy of skittishforeign investors who must be persuaded to roll over its debt Japan is stillthe worlds largest creditor So whats the explanation            Inefficiency Japan has many inefficiencies that limit itsproductive capacitytoo many momandpop stores not enough computerization inthe office and so onbut inefficiency per se is not the immediate problemWhat Japan lacks right now is not supply but demand Japans consumers andinvestors just arent spending enough to keep the countrys shops and factoriesbusy            And theusual remedies for inadequate demand arent working Interest rates have beenpushed down almost as far as they can go Like the Fed the Bank of Japannormally targets the interest rate on overnight loans that banks make to eachother The difference is that this rate is more than  percent here butbasically zero there The big public spending projects the Japanese governmentlaunches every now and then do create some jobs but they never seem to yieldenough bang for the yen The economy keeps relapsing while government debtkeeps mounting            There are three common explanations for Japansplight            Explanation  is that it ismainly a financial problem Japans corporations are too burdened with debtits banks too burdened with bad loans that have never been acknowledged Onthis view what Japan needs is a long painful financial housecleaning            Explanation  is that the problem is mainly psychological When the bubbleeconomy of the s remember when the square mile under the Imperial Palacewas supposedly worth more than all California burst goes the storyconsumers and investors went into a funk that has depressed the economy andthe depressed economy has perpetuated the funk On this view what Japan needsis a jumpstartsay a massive but temporary round of tax cuts and publicspending programs that will restore confidence and get people spending againAlthough it is tactless to say this the model everyone privately has in mindis the way wartime spending jolted the United States out of the GreatDepression Thank you Adm Yamamoto            Explanation  doesnt make sense to me If Japans problemis demand not supply how do corporate debt and bad loans cause that problemYou might say that the answer is obvious Overindebted companies cant borrowmore and the banks are in no position to lend anyway But Japans investmentas a percentage of gross domestic product is the highest among major advancedeconomies And banks have been lending tooafter all where do you thinkthose excessive debts and bad loans came from The problem is that even thesehigh rates of investment arent enough to absorb the huge sums that consumersapparently want to save            Untilrecently I was more sympathetic to Explanation  But lately I have started towonder whether the stubborn unwillingness of Japans economic engine to catchis as many foreigners seem to think merely because the jumpstart hasnt beenbig enough or sustained enough And so like a small but growing number ofpeople including at least one  I have started paying attention to Explanationthat Japans troubles really stem from a subtle but deadly interactionbetween demography and ideology            Heres the story Japan like the United Statesonly much more so is an aging society Thanks to a declining birth rate andnegligible immigration it faces a steady decline in its workingage populationfor at least the next several decades while retirees increase Given thisprospect the country should save heavily to make provision for thefutureand lacking the kind of payasyougo Social Security system thatallows Americans to ignore such realities it does But investmentopportunities in Japan are limited so that businesses will not invest allthose savings even at a zero interest rate And as anyone who has read JohnMaynard Keynes can tell you when desired savings consistently exceed willinginvestment the result is a permanent recession            If thisis the problem there is in principle a simple if unsettling solution WhatJapan needs to do is promise borrowers that there will be inflation in thefuture If it can do that then the effective real interest rate on borrowingwill be negative Borrowers will expect to repay less in real terms than theamount they borrow As a result they will be willing to spend more which iswhat Japan needs In short this explanation suggests that inflationor moreprecisely the promise of future inflationis the medicine that will cureJapans ills The troublethe other half of the Japanese trapis that whilethe conclusion that Japan needs inflation emerges from what looks likeimpeccable economic logic we live in an era in which central bankers believeand are believed to believe in price stability as an overriding goal Thepeculiar result of the credibility of modern central bankers as inflation hawksis that no matter how much money the Bank of Japan prints now  itdoesnt matter It cant lower the nominal interest rate because thatrate is already zero and because people dont believe that it will allowinflation to break out any time in the future it cant lower the realinterest rate either            This theory is offensive to many people Deep economicproblems are supposed to be a punishment for deep economic sins not anaccidental byproduct of swings in the birth rate Inflation is supposed to be adeadly poison not a useful medicine Above all it seems implausible that theproposed solution to such severe difficulties could involve so little pain Andwhile I think logic and evidence are on my sidethat demography not cronycapitalism is the villain and inflation is the answerit is certainlypossible that I am wrong            But Japan worries me Itsnot just that we are talking about a huge economy here an economy whose woescan drag down a lot of smaller countries with it What really disturbs me isthis If we dont really understand what has gone wrong in Japan whos to saythe same thing cant happen to us
