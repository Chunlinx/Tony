                okay its what movies have you seen lately and which   well uh we just saw JFK uh like yesterday   oh did you   yeah and   did you like it   yeah um im a big Oliver Stone fan i mean so anything he does i mean i like but yeah have you seen it yet   no i havent   i mean you know its just about the assassination and everything so   is it just more or less the things that weve seen and heard before   well what some of you have heard some of you havent i think its just its its pretty much every its the most plausible theory that i guess um theories that they kind of pulled together in kind of a um pretty much an order pretty much i dont know its kind of hard to describe i mean its kind uh you have to kind of see it because it wasnt what i expected because i was thinking its going to be just kind of a typical rundown of what you know youve heard the past you know ten years but um   yeah   i think its a great movie because uh you leave the uh movie thinking that you know the government actually was   involved in it   they they yeah i mean they you know they did theres always that cover up and that was in sixty you know sixty three so i mean uh twenty eight years later theres been   uhhuh   theres so much more that theyve done i mean that screw the American people around so its its a great movie   uhhuh   and my familys in actually my familys here tonight um and theyre wanting to see it so im probably going to go see it again and im not one i usually dont like to see a movie you know twice but if its   i   gee thats a three hour and like twenty minute movie and i mean i want to see it again its a great movie   oh uhhuh   its really good   oh well we we uh most of our movies are we rent them   yeah   because uh my husband and i are the only ones left home so we just rent the movies and the last one we saw was Home Alone   uhhuh   and i just loved it   yeah thats a good movie i saw that last year   yeah well my my even my grandchildren like it   when it came out yeah   so it its been a good movie and weve weve really uh weve in fact we bought the video   umhum   so uh is there any others that you especially stand out that you like   yeah ive seen uh saw Bugsy and uh   oh was that good   thats a good movie yeah   that was on the the racketeers wasnt it   whats that   that was on the racketeering   yeah yeah thats um   and the twenties   right its about uh Bugsy Siegel who pretty much started Flamingo out in Vegas he had like the vision of you know Vegas what it could be what it is today   thats right uhhuh   at the time it was you know just a complete desert and pretty much   they built it on a   yeah he had he was given a budget of like a million dollars to go out and build this Flamingo and they thought he was crazy it was a stupid idea and you know he built it but it cost like six million dollars because he had so many overruns and uh   uhhuh uhhuh   i mean there was nothing out there and they thought you know it was stupid so he got killed for it because you know he   he never did live to see the   right and you know the the great thing is you know his six million dollar investment turned out to be a two hundred billion dollar return so   uhhuh uhhuh   and they killed him because they didnt think it was going to work out but its a great movie its a good movie Warren Beatty did a good job and   uhhuh   ive seen uh God what else oh im trying to think   do you go to a lot of movies   uh lately ive just seen this past week or so because im uh i had a couple past couple weeks off so i saw couple of movies we just saw Bugsy and JFK like in a two day period so that was one thing and i cant think of anything else ive seen lately i mean i i im a big movie fan so i mean i usually rent them too but   uhhuh well we we really   Cape Fear that was another movie i saw Cape Fear is real good     oh have you seen that one youve see a lot of the latest ones havent you   yeah thats a great movie yeah im a big Martin  fan so   oh did you see uh Beauty and the Beast   no i hadnt seen that yet but uh im probably i guess i probably i probably will these at first you know you think of animation as a cartoon thats kind of a kid film but   uhhuh   but the more ive heard im might have had a couple of friends actually saw it and says its a pretty good film but um i you know ill probably get around to seeing it   do you have children   no im im twenty three but i got a girl friend shes big time   oh oh   shes been begging me to go you know i want to Beauty and the Beast so   uhhuh so youll probably take her and go   i
