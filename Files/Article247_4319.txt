                                 Were the YK Preparations in Vain                        During the past five years governments and companies across the planetspent between  billion and  billion fixing the YK computer bug Wasthis money spent in vain            Because no major YK incidents occurred skeptics chargethat it was They suggest that the few minor glitchessuch as the  latefee on a New York mans video rentalwere easily corrected without spendingbillions And countries such as Italy and Paraguay which spent little on YKappear to have fared as well as the United States which spent  billion             However while the jury is still out the emergingconsensus of computer experts is that the expenditures were worthwhile Herestheir reasoning               A lack of preparation would have cost more If criticalsystemssuch as power grids defense computers and hospital equipmenthadnot been fixed disaster might have followed To prove this thesis one stateapplied no YK fixes to three of its computers The machines shut down whenthey encountered Jan   Even in noncritical systems fixing errorsafter the fact would have been expensive For example the cost of correcting acouple thousand incorrect bills at a video store would far outweigh the cost ofprevention And many computer system managers liken YK preparation to autoinsurance Just because you didnt have a car accident last year it doesntmean your insurance payments were a waste               Countries and companies spent money in proportion to their reliance oncomputers Italy and Paraguay got away with spending less because they hadfewer machines to fix Paraguays water and electric systems are largelymanual its capital city has only one phone line per  people In the USsmaller companies avoided major YK expense because they were less likely thanlarge corporations to have mainframe computers running outdated code               The YK spending will have other positive results Many companiessolved their YK problems by buying and installing new equipment and softwareSome of these upgrades would have been warranted regardless of YK Otherupgrades will yield longterm benefits through improved computerinfrastructure And in the developing world the technology upgrades provideda vital advance into the computer age according to the Washington Post                Problems could still occur Significant YK disruptionsmay appear well into the new year Many errors wont be revealed until softwareprocesses data which could be as late as the next quarterly billing cycleAlso some computers dont recognize  as a leap year which means Feb could bring new problems            Next question
