                                  The American Teenager            They are ardent environmentalists They adoretechnology and understand it as no generation before them did They practicallyinvented the Internet They dont vote They distrust politics and prefervoluntarism Theyre skeptical of corporations and impervious to traditionaladvertising Theyre less racist and more multiracial than any group ofAmericans in history            They are of course Generation Y as trendmongersdescribe them today But they are also Generation X as trendmongers describedthem six years ago And no doubt they are Generation Z as trendmongers willdescribe them in  Generalizing about a generation is always bogusespecially when most of its members arent out of short pants yet But nomatter Fiftyfive million Gen Xers once hailed for their iconoclasm havebeen discarded as cynical and sour Supplanting them are the  millionsunny children of Gen Y Generation Ya ridiculous includes those bornsince  Gen Xers were in their s when they became media darlings Theoldest members of Gen Y have just entered college which means that for thefirst time since the baby boom America is obsessed with teenagers            Teens and yearoldsmasquerading as teens have kidnapped pop culture Their moviesfromTitanic to Scream to Cruel Intentions have swallowedmultiplexes Their melodramas own the networks and have turned theirnymphs Dawsons Creek s Katie Holmes Party of Five s JenniferLove Hewitt Felicity s Keri Russellinto superstars Their musicrules from Kid Rock to Eminem to Backstreet Boys Even adults have beenbewitched by the teen invasion The New York Times Magazine is frettingabout teenage boys body image problems US News just ran a coverstory on The Teen Brain Why are your teenagers sullen and irrationalBecause the parts of the brain that develop last are those that regulatejudgment and emotion Also because they hate you            The United States is global HQ for teendom but Americanshave not always fixated on teens or even been aware of them As Thomas Hinereports in his new book The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager  theteen was invented in the  th century For most of American historyadolescents also a modern creation inhabited the adult world as laborers andapprentices No one claimed that teens were incapacitated by raging hormones orneeded an eightyear respite to find themselves The Great Depression mintedthe American teen by exiling kids from the labor force to high schools Onlyafter World War II did high school become the universal defining experience ofyouth For the first time adolescents were artificially segregated fromadults and developed their own culture of cars dating and rock n rollAmerica was fascinated by teenage boomers not only because there were so manyof them but also because they were so alien The country had never seenteenagers before            We however have seenand been teenagers So what explains our tyromania Demography is part of itGeneration Y is huge  percent larger than Generation X By   millionteenagers will haunt malls and chat rooms more teens than there ever wereduring the baby boom The media cycle has also boosted Generation YTrendspotters need trends Yuppies were the stereotype of the s The bleakearly s were defined by the allegedly darker and less materialistic GenXers Now the media need a new plot line and Gen Y is providing it            Generation Y is also booming because it is a cheerful storyfor a cheerful age Just as the slump of the s has been replaced by theeternal boom the cynical pessimists of Gen X have been vanquished by thecheery Ys In the s writing about teenagers meant writing about risingpregnancy rates drug use and crime Today teen pregnancy drug use crimedropout rates and sexual activity are down Churchgoing is up Racism is outThe New Earnestness and the New Familism are in Rebellion is pass Atlast commentators gloat kids are having real childhoods again The schoolmassacres in Littleton Colo and Jonesboro Ark have barely soured themood The media have focused on kids passionate unified response to thekillings            This incessant cheer isinspiring inane predictions about what magnificent adults these Gen Yers willbe Commentators opine that their childhood prosperity will make them generousand idealistic According to polls teens are optimistic Pop prophets WilliamStrauss and Neil Howe call them a Hero generation But young peopleespecially teens have always registered optimism Even Gen Xers wereoptimistic when they were polled five years ago Of course Gen Yers are peppynow Who wouldnt be Lets see what they say when the economy dives the yearthey graduate from college And lets wait until most Gen Yers are capable ofrational thought Most of them havent reached puberty yet and many are indiapers            The most important reason for todays tyromania iseconomic America seems obsessed with youth because corporations are obsessedwith youth If they catch kids early enough they can cement their brandpreferences for life Networks are producing teen dramas so that theiradvertisers can reach this impressionable audience Movies are pitched toteenage sensibilities because only teenagers go to movies again and again andagain As far as marketers are concerned Gen X is over It has aged out of theconsumption game But Generation Y kids are up for grabs They are young theyhave monstrous amounts of cash to spendthe average teen has  a week ofdisposable incomeand theyll be even richer when they grow up            Its unsurprising therefore that the peoplepushing the Gen Y boom hardest are not sociologists journalists or activistsbut market researchers The most quoted Gen Y pundits are folks who work atcompanies such as Youth Information Network and Teenage Research Unlimitedwhich collect data on trendy brands TRU is the Ford Foundation of Gen Yanalysis Stories about Gen Y tend to shortchange kids views on familyschool and politics and dwell instead on their favorite clothing stores            To cynical Gen Xers suchas myself this marketing talk seems both contradictory and fatuous The marketresearchers instruct that Gen Yers are brandconscious yet skeptical ofestablished brands independentminded yet conformist They say things likeThis is the coolest generation ever If you can use viral marketing andAbercrombie  Fitch in the same sentence you too can be a Gen Y punditThen again if you could use grunge and Social Security reform in the samesentence you could have been a Gen X pundit            The final reason for the teen renaissance is boomerselfobsession A pervasive theme of Generation Y is that it is growing up justas the boomers did prosperous happy welladjusted If you consume teenculture at all you have surely noticed the remarkable number of sympatheticparents around Todays TV parents are wisdom figures not the adult buffoonswe have grown accustomed to Similarly articles about Gen Ymany written byboomer parentsare fulsome about how well boomers are raising their tots howintimately parents and kids communicate and how much kids admire mom and dadThe surprising fact that pops up in almost every Gen Y story is a survey inwhich teens named parents as their favorite role models I would bet thatevery survey of teens taken since Cain and Abel found that they named parentsas their favorite role models            Boomers whose selfabsorption has long beenridiculed have finally managed to get over themselves They have found a newobject of their affection They dont need selflove anymore
