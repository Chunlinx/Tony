                    Background        Hypertension is a common medical problem in the United        States occurring in as many as  million individuals            While endstage renal failure represents the second        most common cause of endstage renal disease            perhaps only  in  hypertensive patients develops        clinically important hypertensive nephrosclerosis This low        frequency of endorgan renal damage suggests a potential        predisposition to this complication The inbred DahlRapp        rat is a genetic model of saltsensitive hypertension             On a diet containing  NaCl young DahlRapp        saltsensitive S rats rapidly and uniformly manifest        lowrenin hypertension and die from hypertensive        nephrosclerosis within weeks of institution of the        highsalt diet     The pathology is identical to human        hypertensive renal disease and consists of        arteriolosclerosis glomerulosclerosis and interstitial        scarring with tubular cell dropout While other animal        models of hypertension can be employed to study the        pathogenesis of hypertension because of the rapid and        reproducible development of renal failure S rats provide a        unique means to investigate the pathogenesis of        hypertensive nephrosclerosis In this respect this model        is very useful in understanding hypertensive        nephrosclerosis that occurs in human lowrenin        hypertension especially in defined more homogeneous        populations such as the black patients described by Grim        and associates            Recent studies have shown that apoptosis was accentuated        in kidneys of S rats during development of nephrosclerosis            These studies demonstrated increased numbers of        TUNELpositive cells increased cytoplasmic nucleosome        content and caspase activation in kidneys of hypertensive        S rats compared to normotensive SpragueDawley control        rats on the same highsalt diet An increase in apoptosis        rates in glomeruli and tubules was observed confirming a        process that involved several different cell types in the        kidney Apoptotic bodies were noted particularly in areas        of glomerular sclerosis and in dilated tubules An increase        in the number of PCNAstained cells was also demonstrated        during the day time frame but because renal function        deteriorated renal failure correlated therefore positively        with apoptosis and inversely with proliferation rates        Thus the apoptotic process appeared to be a strong        determinant of outcome in this model        The FasFasL system transmits apoptotic signals from the        surrounding environment into the cell Fas contains a        single transmembrane domain and belongs to the tumor        necrosis factor TNFnerve growth factor family            FasL contains a single transmembrane domain and is also a        member of the same TNF family     A soluble form of        FasL has been described but appears to be less capable of        inducing apoptosis when compared with the bound form             The binding of FasL with Fas initiates receptor        oligomerization which recruits Fasassociated death domain        FADD     FADD binds procaspase and permits        activation of caspase through selfcleavage            Caspase activates the effector caspases which commits        the cell to the orderly process of apoptosis      In        addition caspase cleaves Bclinteractivedeathagonist        Bid     Truncated Bid localizes to the mitochondria        and promotes cytochrome c release this process also serves        as a major apoptoticsignaling pathway for Fas              Depending upon the amount of caspase that is activated        the predominant pathway can be either Bid cleavage with        subsequent mitochondrial release of cytochrome c or        activation of the effector caspase pathway            Resident cells of the kidney express both Fas and FasL and        FasFasL signaling is functional in these cells                 A recent review by Ortiz and associates           noted that the combined literature demonstrating        participation of FasFasL pathway in renal injury        essentially fulfilled Kochs postulates        In kidneys of S rats associated with apoptosis was a        temporal increase in expression of Fas which was        demonstrated using Western analysis of lysates of kidney        cortex     The purpose of the present study was to        demonstrate the site of expression and potential functional        significance of Fas and FasL in the kidneys of S rats        during development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis                    Materials and Methods                  Animal preparation          Studies were conducted using  male DahlRapp          saltsensitive SSJr termed S and  male          SpragueDawley SD rats initially

in situ through the aorta with cold          heparinized  NaCl solution until blanching occurred          which generally required infusion of  to  ml saline          over  min Both kidneys were

responses to dietary salt intake of the DahlRapp S rat an        experimental model of hypertensive nephrosclerosis and of        the SD strain of rat have been published After seven days        on the high salt diet S rats were hypertensive    mm        Hg but had preserved renal morphology     By day  on        the  NaCl diet the mean blood pressure increased to           mm Hg       Mean blood pressures of SD rats        were not influenced by intake of salt over this time frame        of study    mm Hg on the  NaCl diet compared to           mm Hg on the  NaCl diet In addition SD        animals were healthy the intake of either diet was        similar and they demonstrated no renal abnormalities              In the present study by day  the kidneys of S        rats demonstrated significant vascular glomerular and        tubulointerstitial injury TUNEL demonstrated apoptosis in        glomerular and tubular compartments Fig  SD rats on        both diets and S rats on  NaCl diet demonstrated by        light microscopy no renal morphological alterations over        the same period of study These findings were similar to        previous publications from this laboratory             Using immunohistochemistry expression of Fas was        increased specifically in kidneys of S rats on  NaCl        diet by day  Fig  Staining was inhibited when the        antiFas antibody was preincubated with recombinant        soluble Fas Fig Eand J Quantification analysis        comparing the four groups of rats in the study showed that        expression of Fas in glomerular and tubular cells was        greatest P   in kidneys of S rats exposed to the         NaCl diet for  and  days Fig  Comparing        animals on the two diets for the same duration dietary        salt did not alter Fas expression in kidneys of SD rats        The increase in Fas expression in kidneys of S rats on the         NaCl diet was observed in cells in the glomeruli        tubules and arteries Fig ABC Cytoplasmic staining        was particularly apparent in these samples        Over the same time period FasL expression was also        examined Fig ABCDEFGHIJ The antiFasL        antibody labeled cells in both glomerular and tubular        compartments but expression was more subtle than Fas        particularly in the glomeruli Quantification of these        observations showed an increase in expression of FasL in        both glomerular and tubular compartments of kidneys of S        rats on the  NaCl diet compared with the other three        groups Fig  Again dietary salt did not alter        glomerular and tubular expression of FasL in kidneys of SD        rats Tubular epithelial cell expression of FasL appeared        to be predominantly apical Fig Dand E although        cytoplasmic staining was also observed particularly in        cells of S rats on the  NaCl diet In addition some        tubular epithelial cells of kidneys from S rats on         NaCl diet for  days appeared to express both Fas and FasL        Fig FGand H        To determine whether the FasFasL apoptotic pathway was        active Western blotting of renal cortical lysates was        performed using an antibody that recognized both        procaspase and the active form of caspase In these        experiments active caspase was demonstrated in lysates        from renal cortex of S rats on  NaCl diet for three        weeks Fig  Active caspase was not demonstrated in        samples from rats on the diet for  days data not shown        Tissue was also examined for cleavage of Bid which was        identified specifically in lysates from renal cortex        obtained from S rats on  NaCl diet for three weeks        Fig                     Discussion        Recent evidence suggests that apoptosis is involved in        several pathological processes in the lung      and        kidney         Using the DahlRapp        saltsensitive S rat which develops hypertensive        nephrosclerosis that resembles the human disease process            this laboratory demonstrated an early and        inappropriate apoptotic process that occurred in both        glomerular and tubular compartments of the kidneys and        correlated with the decline in glomerular filtration rate        Apoptosis can be significant particularly three weeks into        the course of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in this model        Figure  A previous study used RNase protection assay        and Western blotting to demonstrate an increase in Fas        expression in kidney cortex of hypertensive S rats These        findings were observed by day  of study     The        present series of experiments demonstrated the diffuse        sites of expression of Fas and FasL in the kidney and        explored further the possibility that the FasFasL pathway        was active during the development of hypertensive renal        disease in this rodent model of hypertension Expression of        both Fas and FasL was observed in kidneys of both SD and S        rats but specifically increased over time in hypertensive        S rats Associated with the increased expression was        cleavage of procaspase to produce the active enzyme and        cleavage of Bid indicating activation of the FasFasL        apoptotic pathway in the course of progressive renal        failure These data along with the previous studies that        confirmed morphological evidence of apoptosis and        biochemical evidence of caspase activation in these        kidneys     showed a role for the FasFasL pathway in        promoting the loss of kidney function that develops in the        setting of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in this model        The mechanism of augmented Fas and FasL expression in        kidneys of hypertensive S rats is uncertain In addition to        apoptotic signaling the FasFasL system may also be        involved in proliferation Hueber et al showed that Fas        might promote Tcell proliferation by modulating release of        calcium from intracellular stores     FasL is        antiproliferative by regulating cellcycle progression            Previous studies demonstrated an increase in cell        proliferation rates in kidneys of S rats on the highsalt        diet     so it is possible that Fas and FasL may play a        role in control of proliferation Another potential        explanation is tissue hypoxia which has been suggested to        upregulate Fas in the kidney      MDCK cells in        culture demonstrated increased expression of Fas FasL and        FADD in response to partial ATP depletion     Fas and        FasL expression in the kidney may serve as indicators of        cellular stress Tissue hypoxia therefore remains a        possible mechanism of increased expression of Fas and FasL        although it seems less likely that the arteriolosclerosis        that developed in S kidneys was severe enough to produce        hypoxic conditions sufficient to upregulate Fas until the        third week of study        Increased expression of Fas and FasL appeared to        increase the propensity to undergo apoptosis but was not        the sole determinant of this process Despite the increase        in expression of Fas and FasL at day  of study caspase        activation and Bid cleavage were not observed        FasFasLmediated apoptotic signaling is modulated by other        intracellular factors Induction of inhibitor of apoptosis        proteins IAP is one such mechanism       In        vascular smooth muscle cells surface expression of Fas           and molecules involved in signaling the apoptotic        process such as caspase and caspase appear to be        regulated and provide another level of cellular control of        apoptosis     However the potential antiapoptotic        mechanisms present early in the course were ineffective by        day  when caspase activation was evident A previous        study suggested that the apoptotic process occurred early        in the development of hypertension in this model            so the data suggested that an apoptotic mechanism in        addition to activation of the FasFasL pathway is also        involved in development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in        S rats        In conclusion kidneys of S rats have been shown to be        very sensitive to hypertensive injury which is mediated at        least in part by the apoptotic mechanism controlled by Fas        Augmented expression of both Fas and FasL by glomerular and        tubular cells resulted in caspase activation The        pronounced increases in Fas and FasL expression and        activation of this pathway by the third week of study also        correlated with previous evidence that documented        irreversibility of the renal injury if the hypertension was        not corrected by this time     These data supported the        view that the FasFasL pathway promoted nephrosclerosis in        this model Activation of the FasFasL pathway may also        serve as a mechanism of tubular epithelial cell loss and        interstitial fibrosis which are also prominent renal        features of hypertension The role of the FasFasL pathway        in human hypertensive nephrosclerosis remains to be        determined                    Abbreviations        SD
