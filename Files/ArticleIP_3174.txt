conceptual Trojan horse is to attach the wordstealth to it as a modifier The relatively recent term stealthcandidate has had two meanings One refers simply to a candidate who seemsnot to show up on the political radar screenGeorge Bush used the term thisway in speaking of his opponent Michael Dukakis in  The other now morecommon meaning harbors an element of deviousness Stealth candidates in
