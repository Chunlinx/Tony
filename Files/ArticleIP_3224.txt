                                 Fetal Attraction            Everyone knows that alienslook like giant fetuses Just think of Roswell NM or the glowing eggheadsin Close Encounters of the Third Kind  But in Contact  theclosest thing to a fetus is the adult woman whos tracking the aliens downShes Ellie Jodie Foster a brilliant idealistic scientist who when thingsgo wrong hugs her knees to her chest Shes been searching for signs ofextraterrestrial life ever since she was a little girl Why Because her motherdied in childbirth and a few years later her father died of a heart attackNow in her loneliness she spends day and night listening for signals fromlittle green men She knows that when she finds them theyll be sweet andloving and helpful like the parents she never had            RobertZemeckis ought to have been the ideal director for this film After all hesthe leading explorer of the child in American adults In the goofy Backto                the Future  he regressed Michael J Fox to a s highschoolstudent and had him strike up an incestuous flirtation with his then teenagemother In the whimsicalponderous epic Forrest Gump  Zemeckis made asaint out of a simpleton who was essentially a yearold in a mans bodyContact opens in much the same vein with a series of calm lovingemblematic scenes from childhood Ellies white clapboard house even lookssuspiciously like Forrests house even though shes from Wisconsin and helived in Alabama            So fond of iconic childhood is Zemeckis in fact that hetakes a good half hour to inch toward anything that looks like a plot Elliefinally grows up to run a facility in New Mexico that listens for signals fromouter space and one day as shes sitting in the desert her headphones pickup a noise Instantly she knows its aliens the audience could be excused forthinking it sounds like a garbage truck backing up With remarkable speed sheand her team figure out that the noise is actually a code a blueprint for amachine to carry a human being to the faraway solar system of Vega Thegovernment casually comes up with half a trillion dollars to build it and inwhat seems like a weekend a launching pad as big as a mountain is ready togo            But beforeshe can fly to Vega Ellie has to face down some earthly obstacles Theres aselfish scientist Tom Skerritt trying to take credit for her discoveries anda national security adviser James Woods scheming to be elected to CongressTheres also a contest to see wholl get to fly the machine Of course by nowwe know that Ellies lonely childhood has given her a unique gift forlistening and that shes the only one who can go to Vega and that everythingthat happens up until her trip is a mere distraction Even Zemeckis seemsimpatient to get to the magic throughout the middle of this movie he simplychecks out like the directorial equivalent of a deadbeat dad This isunfortunate because in his negligence he has allowed into his film dialogueby James V Hart and Michael Goldenberg based on Carl Sagans novel thatfalls far beneath the standards of your average corporate memo TearfullyEllie announces that her discovery represents a profoundly impactful momentfor humanity Matthew McConaugheywho plays Ellies love interest theridiculously named Palmer Joss a former priest who is now the respected authorof a bestselling book about faith and meaning and who though still inhis s is a trusted adviser to the presidentthrusts out his lower jaw likea calendar pinup while delivering such lines as Im not against technologyIm against the men who deify it at the expense of human truth CharltonHeston couldnt have said it better            Occasionally Zemeckis stops nodding off andsprinkles in some flashy Gumpian touches Refining Gump s mix of realand fictional footage he makes truly shameless use of two long clips fromClinton press conferences and invites hordes of journalists to stop by forcameos Talk about selfplagiarism What were waiting for is the trip to Vegaand indeed this minute sequence turns out to be pure joy Ellie getsstrapped into a metal ball and hurtles through a tunnel of space Instead ofthe massive gray meticulously detailed scifi city weve come to expect shefloats through weird puddly red and blue atmospheres She speeds up and slowsdown and she has no idea why She reaches out to touch the wall of the machineand it ripples the way the highway seems to flutter on a hot day The scene isgrave scary and beautiful It dawns on us that shes heading into somethingcompletely unknown something she cant even fully perceive Also that for thefirst time in the movie Jodie Foster is getting to act            Then shelands on the alien planet and the pat speechifying takes up where it left offI wont reveal the details of her encounter with the aliens except to say thatthey are most unfetuslikein fact they distinctly resemble parents Couldmarket research be to blame Close Encounters of the Third Kind came out years ago when the audience largely consisted of trailend baby boomerslikely to groove to Richard Dreyfuss desire to throw off the shackles ofadulthood and play Contact comes out at a time when were obsessed withrole models and nurturing and making sure our children grow up to be healthyresponsible adults Alas this is not the premise of a great movie WhenContact finally comes alive it leaves you frightened and thrilled andemotionally overwrought as only a child can be The rest is pandering            On a brighter note Shall We Dance is being hypedas a throwaway feelgood movie but it has moments of genuine depth At first Iresisted the plot which has a depressed Japanese accountant secretly attendingdance lessons Havent we had enough of dance as therapy Besides its stockedwith factorymade eccentrics Theres your requisite bawdy spinster and thecoworker whos a systems analyst by day and a wigwearing rumba dancer bynight            What themovie does have going for it is an amazingly moving performance by KojiYakusho the actor who plays the accountant Hes a handsome but humbleEverymana Japanese Joel McCrea Another strength of the film is that itssurprises have little to do with the plot They occur at random whenever onecharacter discovers that another character has feelings The accountant startsdancing because he has a crush on his frail beautiful teacher and for much ofthe movie we watch her through his longing eyes But quite late in the day shereveals a cluster of emotions we couldnt have guessed atshe is for exampledeeply absorbed in her failure to win a quickstep contest And she too hasto correct a few unfair assumptions about him            Abrupt shifts in sympathy like this result inchoppy filmmaking  Shall We Dance has neither the style of StrictlyBallroom nor the cheap catharsis of Dirty                Dancing  But theclunkiness is director Masayuki Suos way of stopping to make sure that hesemotionally accurate Shall We Dance isnt quite art and it doesntqualify as mass entertainment either But its alert to its charactersconstantly evolving desires in ways that high and lowculture movies withtheir strict aesthetics or their massmarket formulas tend not to be Maybethis movie will be the first in a modest new genrethe inquiry into adulthappiness Unlike Contact  and however doggedly Shall We Dancesincerely wants people to grow up
