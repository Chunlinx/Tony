                                 Headline                        Hi Katha                   Yes my morning ablutions are complete and I know its noon Ivejust caffeinated taken three viracepts one combivir four rescriptors onezantac one immodium one zoloft and one propecia Who needs oatmeal But thegood news is Im alive and my hair is growing back       In fact I was so zippy I missed Charlie Moskos letter Whenever Ivedealt with him he has seemed an extremely reasonable fellow he wrote a goodpiece for me at TNR on race in the ranks but like many military typeshe just seems to lose it when it comes to the obvious fact that homosexualshave been happily murdering and killing in uniform for generations At least hedidnt push the offtherecord spin that these nellies just cant hack itwhich is what Pentagon flunkies were whispering to gullible journalists Healso misses a very basic point The  violations were by commanders notsoldiers Its rather like holding turkeys responsible for Thanksgiving As tothe notion that gay soldiers disproportionately leave early this only appliesto new discharges How does Moskos explain the enormous increase Could itpossibly be that bigoted commanders who hate the idea that they might have totolerate discreet homosexuals in the ranks now try to flush them out early andfast by massive amounts of intimidation In Italy a Marine first sergeant isreported by the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network to greet new unit memberswith the declaration There are three things I hate liars thieves andfaggots Nice to meet you too       A final thought Its interesting that Moskos is aware as someone inhis position would never have been a generation ago that young people do comeout at an earlier and earlier age Society has changed enormously So all thepolicy is doing it seems if he is correct is successfully flushing out awhole swath of young men and women who have the selfrespect not to be ashamedof being gay Should the military be happy its getting rid of all these peopleand becoming less rather than more like the society its supposed to defendAnd is the presence of these peoplewho are often disproportionately committedto their jobssuch a threat to the effectiveness of the military as a wholeOr are we better off with a bunch of conflicted repressed neurotics       As to welfare mothers I share your abhorrence of the guy who demeanedmotherhood although I am probably uniquely unqualified to talk about itsonerous responsibilities My sister has two small children though and sheworks harder than I ever have in my life Or ever will But the appositequestion it seems to me is not simply whether day care is adequate it almostcertainly isnt but whether as a whole it is better that whatever thecurrent problems the old system has been shaken up and reformed in thedirection of work Of course welfare bureaucracies being what they are a lackof support in health care and day care is hardly surprising But the answer tothat is to fix the health care and day care with some of the large amounts ofmoney being sent back to the states rather than to return to what happenedbefore Or am I wrong Is your position that welfare mothers were better off independency and close to their kids rather than in work and distant for some ofthe time from their kids Id be crazy to believe the new system is perfect orwithout its injustices But isnt it an improvement on what went on before Andisnt it at least a more constructive place from which to improve policy thanoldstyle entitlement       My nomination for the most boring story of the day bank mergers Andanything to do with Mike Ovitz Who really gives a damn about Hollywood mogulsAnd doesnt The New Yorker fellate them enough for the Times tostop covering them I loved the story on Kathy Bates though What a babe Ithought the Primary Colors movie was unconvincingly crudecan anyonebelieve for a moment that George Stephanopoulos was ever deeply morallyconflicted about anythingbut Bates was great Along with George Michaelshes my newly discovered icon            CheersAndrew
