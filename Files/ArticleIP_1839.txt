                                 Barry Scheck            If there is a special cornerof hell reserved for OJ Simpsons lawyersand Im sure there isBarryScheck has spent the last week roasting in it Scheck had conducted amagnificent defense of accused baby killer Louise Woodward complete with histrademark sneering speeches windmilling arms and devastatingcrossexaminations Then Scheck watched stunned as his client was convictedof seconddegree murder and sentenced to life in prison            What doesthis have to do with OJ Well one alternate juror hinted that one factor inthe verdict might be an OJ backlash The alternate says he heard other panelmembers talk about getting Scheckabout punishing him for his courtroomhistrionics  la the Simpson trial his sarcastic attacks on prosecutionwitnesses  la the Simpson trial his hocus pocus medical evidence  lathe Simpson trial            This is Barry Schecks torture to be forever yoked to theSimpson case Not just yoked to the Simpson case but yoked to the worstof the Simpson case Scheck and fellow OJ attorneys did the impossible Theymanaged to lower the publics estimation of criminal defense lawyers JohnnieCochran racebaited and spun wild conspiracies Scheck badgered witnesses andsplit hairs His destruction of the prosecutions heralded DNA evidence wasmeticulous obnoxious and unforgettable Many lawyers consider Scheckseightday evisceration of criminalist Dennis Fung Where is it Mr Fungthe greatest crossexamination since the Scopes trial The verbs to Scheckand to Schecktify entered the legal vocabulary Scheck came to personify thegrotesque defense attorney bullying selfrighteous melodramatic In apriceless moment during the Woodward trial OJ himself phoned Court TV todefend Scheck against charges of obnoxiousness For more on this click             And yetof all OJs lawyers Scheck is the one who least deserves public disapprovalHe is in fact the very model of what a celebrity defense attorney should beScheck has spent his entire professional life in pursuit of usually worthycauses His motto could be always righteous often right As an undergraduateat Yale in the late s for example Scheck was a fervent antiwarprotestor Big dealso was everyone else But Schecks protest was inspiredand brave He fought to abolish all student deferments figuring that the warwould end only when white middleclass parents saw their white middleclasskids like him die in Vietnam            The same creative skepticism toward authoritydefines his legal career After law school Scheck worked for several yearstrying to expose grand jury abuse and then spent five years as a Legal Aidlawyer in the Bronx Eventually Schecks vigor and intelligence landed him ajob as a clinical law professor at New Yorks Cardozo Law School The job gavehim the freedom to pursue cases that interested him In  Scheckrepresented Hedda Nussbaum adoptive mother of the murdered Lisa SteinbergPaid only  an hour Scheck helped Nussbaum escape prosecution for Lisasdeath and shifted blame to her companion Joel Steinberg who had battered andabused Nussbaum            Scheckfound his forte in the mids He and his law partner an equally pugnaciouslawyer named Peter Neufeld handled a case where prosecutors carelessly usedDNA evidence to railroad a suspect He and Neufeld made themselves thelegal experts on DNA testing It became a cause for Scheck He was convincedthat prosecutors would overstate their DNA evidence to secure conviction Sofive years ago Scheck and Neufeld launched the Innocence Project You would behardpressed to find a more admirable enterprise Scheck Neufeld and theirlaw students use DNA evidence to spring wrongly convicted criminalsfrequentlyrapists and murderers So far the Innocence Project has cleared more than inmates including a dozen on death row Scheck is not perfectly consistentabout DNA He uses genetic fingerprinting when it exonerates his clients andcriticizes the technique when it implicates them But defense lawyering is arough trade            The OJ case was Schecks Faustian bargain It gave himuseful fame but it tarnished him as someone who had helped OJ get away withmurder Scheck doesnt see it that way For him the OJ case was as muchabout the misuse of medical evidence as about murder His devotion to hiscausescientific evidenceallowed him to avoid larger questions such assay Did he kill em Within that narrowed framework Scheck couldconstruct an intellectually honest defense There was reasonable doubt becausepolice forensic work was shameful            Scheckbegan the case on the periphery of the defense team and ended it in the centerThere are very good reasons for this Scheck was probably the smartest of thedefense lawyers and he was certainly the hardestworking he spent weeksporing over complex evidence that other defense lawyers didnt bother with InJeffrey Toobins OJ book The Run of His Life  the chapter aboutScheck is titled The Best Trial Lawyer            OJ made Scheck one of the most famous lawyersin the world and Scheck doesnt seem to mind He writes for Newsweekand comments for NBC on big trials He did the OJ civil case and wassurprisingly evenhanded But mostly he has used his celebrity to advance hiscauses Scheck is constantly in court for Project Innocence He has spoken outagainst the new restrictions on federal habeas corpus He serves on the NewYork State Commission on Forensic Science and he lectures to police departmentsand prosecutors across the country about proper use of genetic fingerprintingHe is representing Abner Louima the Haitian immigrant who allegedly wassodomized with a toilet plunger by New York City cops The defense attorney iseven advising Colorado investigators prosecutors on the medical evidence inthe JonBenet Ramsey case            Estimates of Schecks fee inthe nanny trial range from  to  But the Woodward casehissecond Trial of the Decadereflects Schecks highmindedness as much as hisgreed After all Scheck earns a pittance compared with what he could if hewere a fulltime criminal defense attorney The nanny case jibes perfectlywith Schecks obsession The case turns on questionable medical testimony aboutinjuries to monthold victim Matthew Eappen Scheck commentators agreepoked huge holes in the prosecutions claim that Woodward shook the baby andthen dashed his head against a hard object If the wound to Eappens skull wasnew asked Scheck why had scar tissue formed around it If Woodward had shakenthe baby why did his neck show no signs of damage Schecks questions didntconvince the jury but they may well persuade the judge to toss out Woodwardsconviction or reduce her conviction to manslaughter The judge will not makethat decision until Nov  at the earliest            During the Woodward trialJohnnie Cochran has occasionally devoted his daily Court TV show Cochran Company  to the case He has interviewed other lawyers alternatejurors experts Tuesday night Scheck himself was billed as a guest but henever appeared There was something fitting about this Cochran pontificatedwindily for the camera Scheck was too busy being a lawyer too busy trying toredeem a possibly innocent client to join him
