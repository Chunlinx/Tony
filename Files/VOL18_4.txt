                              Politically Correct Nomenclatureor How to Win at Trivial Pursuit and Lose Friends            As a child of the s I remember starting aschool year learning the names of countries acertain way in geography class only to end the yearwith the old names scratched out replaced by newones as scores of former colonies became independentwith usually new names  Bechuanalandbecame Botwana the Gold Coast became GhanaBritish Guiana became Guyana and so on  Now ageneration later we seem to be going through anotherperiod when names are changing  As frustratingas this might be it does have one advantage ofproviding plenty of ammunition for games of oneupmanship  Personally I like to keep my friends andassociates properly informed and up to date and donot hesitate to correct them when they refer to forinstance Ivory Coast it is now PC to say CtedIvoire even in English or Burma which is ofcourse Myanmar capital city Yangon not RangoonMy friendsthose who remainrarely failto thank me for this service            Why do names change and why do differentpeople refer to the same place by different namesIn spite of this neoPuritan trends towards PC politicallycorrect nomenclature with all the presure toconform that it brings there are still sometimes perfectlygood reasons for changing the name of a placeIt is when the trend is carried to sanctimonious extremesthat it becomes irritating            The most widelyknown example of PC namechangingin the US is not that of a placename butof an ethnic or racial group Black Americans  Inmy youth the acceptable term for Blacks was Negroesor Coloureds   Coloured seems to have come toNorth America from South Africa where it actuallyrefers to mulattoes or descendants of mixed raceNegro from the SpanishPortuguese word for blackseems to have been a euphemism a softer term andreplaced the earlier term Black   With the rise ofBlack consciousness and Black pride Blacks challengedthe need for a euphemism the very use ofwhich implies of course something bad or negativewhich has to be rendered pleasant or acceptable  Ican sympathize therefore with their rejection ofthe term Negro as a racist term  Lately the termsAfricanAmerican and AfroAmerican seem to begaining wider acceptance although according to arecent poll most US Blacks prefer the term Blackperhaps AfricanAmerican is still too avant garde            Just to add another wrinkle the stylebook of theUKbased international news magazine The Economistmakes the eminently sensible observation thatnot all Africans are black Africans may be black orwhite  If you mean blacks write blacks  Strictlyspeaking then according to The Economist would awhite refugee from Ian Smiths Rhodesia now livingin the US be justified in calling himself an AfricanAmericanSomehow I do not think that that iswhat most Americans have in mind when they hearor read the term            As another example the indigenous people ofthe Arctic are as far as I know still commonly referredto in the United States as Eskimos but forsome time now the PC term in Canada has been Inuita term which affords great scope for PC snobberyas it can be fairly complicated the people areInuit the language is Inuitituk and an individual isan Inuk  This attention to detail is however devotionto PCness above and beyond the call of dutyand in usual practice most educated or academicCanadians now use Inuit as a comprehensive adjectiveand noun  The reason Canada has made thischange is fairly complex but has to do with a finepoint of anthropology  According to The CanadianEncyclopedia Inuit simply means people  Inuitwere earlier known by Europeans as Eskimosapejorative roughly meaning eaters of raw meatapplied to them by INDIAN groups  The language iscalled Inuktitut or Inttituut which is divided intosix different dialects  I suppose that no one wouldwant to be known by a term that means eaters ofraw meat  However that does not explain why thechange seems confined to Canada  In fact the termEskimo is still popularly used  Two of Canadas bestknownpopular history writers Peter C Newmanand Pierre Berton use the term almost exclusivelyin works they have written on Canadas North  Thepublisher of The Canadian Encyclopedia Mel Hurtigis a wellknown Canadian nationalist with leftwingpolitical views and probably intends that hispublication lead public opinion  There is also anacademic distinction between Inuit and Eskimo asexplained by Alan D Macmillan a British Columbiaprofessor of anthropologyinhabitants of the Arctic are the Inuit whoare distinct from all other Canadian native peoplesThey belong to a linguistic stock termedEskimoAleut or Eskaleut named for its twomajor branches  The Aleuts on the Aleutian Islandsof Alaska are the most divergent  Thelarger branch Eskimo has a major division nearBering Strait  On one side the Yupik comprise atleast five separate languages in eastern Siberiaand central and southern Alaska  On the otherthe Inuit extend from northern Alaska to Greenlandincluding all of Arctic Canada  In Canadathe word Inuit meaning people the singular isInuk has now almost totally replaced Eskimogenerally although perhaps erroneously believedto be derived from a derogatory Algonkianterm meaning eaters of raw meat  However itmust be remembered that not all Eskimos areInuit  Throughout their vast distribution the Inuitspeak a single language Inuktitut although anumber of dialects are knownNative Peoples and Cultures of Canada anAnthropological Overview Douglas  McIntyre p                         One could therefore simplify matters by saying thatCanadian and Greenlandbut not Alaskan or Siberian Eskimosare Inuit   Although as it so happensaccording to Macmillan at the first Inuit CircumpolarConference held in Barrow Alaska in  Inuitfrom Alaska Canada and Greenland officiallyadopted the term Inuit for all peoples formerlyknown as Eskimo despite linguistic differencesSiberians were prevented from attending at thattime for political reasons  These two examples ofname changes arose out of demands made by theethnic groups themselves for both Blacks and Inuitobjected to previous terms because they consideredthem derogatory            Two examples of name changes which I findharder to accept are the new names for what used tobe called Ivory Coast and Burma   Cte dIvoire ofcourse is the literal French equivalent of IvoryCoast and in other European languages that countryhas traditionally been called by a name which is theliteral translation of the term eg Elfenbeinkste inGerman  So why insist on using the French termwhen its literal meaning is identical to the traditionalEnglish name  It seems that the PresidentforLifeof Cte dIvoire son Excellence Flix HouphouetBoignyis a confirmed and impassioned francophileand seems intent on converting his agricultural nationinto a sort of ParisontheGuinea  He haserected at enormous expense a Europeanstylecapital city Yamoussoukro in the interior of thecountry and furnished it with among other thingsan embarrassingly gauche oversized Roman Catholicbasilica rumored to be larger even than St Petersin Vatican Cityall this supposedly to servethe spiritual needs of the countrys francisizedCatholics who constitute no more than  of thecountrys  to  million people  To make a longstory short I am convinced that the PCness of CtedIvoire arises out of President HouphouetBoignysdesire to be seen as the leader of a linguistically andculturally French nation  Whether one chooses touse this term or the traditional term depends I supposeon how sensitive one is to the wishes of peopleor of their leaders regarding the way they arenamed            Likewise with Myanmar the name now usedat least in the nonUSEnglishspeaking worldforwhat used to be called Burma   The official name ofthe country in Burmese has since independencefrom Britain been Pyidaungsu Socialist ThammadaMyanma Naingngandaw  so Myanmar it seems issimply Burmese for Burma   This is the same phenomenonas Cte dIvoire   But the current Myanmaresedo I venture where angels fear to tread bycoining the adjective regime is a repressive onethat liberal Western democrats view with distasteone could say that they could give Paradise a badname had that been the new name chosen for theirsad little country            In the case of Cte dIvoire and Myanmar wellread individuals and others who pride themselves onbeing up to date and informed and therefore especiallysusceptible to PCitis will use the newterms but with a certain amount of distaste  Thedegree to which they show their ambivalence showstheir ability to walk the trendy pseudoliberal tightropeof PCness  I use this term but knowinglywith reluctance shows a certain intellectual virtuositywhich is an entrance requirement for thosewho aspire to beatitude within neoPuritanism                              The Gremlins of ET            No I am not referring to the ExtraTerrestrialbut to Errors Typographical also called typosfor short or in Britain literals            During the hearings before the Senate JudiciaryCommittee Judge Clarence Thomas read a categoricalstatement denying flatly and absolutely thecharges of sexual harassment against him but heused the adverbial uncategorically thus negatingthe very essence of his statement  For a man of hisintelligence and lifelong habit of writing such a slipof the penor tonguereadily suggests to a psychoanalyticallytrained eye or ear an ambivalence ifnot a mental conflict about the denial            This episode reminded me of the Wicked Bibleso called because the word not was omittedfrom the Seventh Commandment which read Thoushalt commit adultery  Would it not be PC nonot politically correct but psychoanalytically correctto assume that the typesetters unconsciousplayed a role in such a significant error  TheWicked Bible was published in  by the officialprinter of the King of England and hetheprinter not the Kingwas fined  pounds an exorbitantamount of money in those days  The finedrove him to ruin  Was the punishment particularlyharsh because the affair reminded everyone includingthe King himself that his Majesty behaved accordingto the Revised Commandment            Of course not every typographical error shouldbe ascribed to a hidden unconscious motive on thepart of the typesetter or typist  Sometimes it istotally innocent and does not interfere even for asecond with the flow of reading or comprehensionA plea on groups of insanity in a newspaper reportof a criminal trial is promptly dismissed by the mindand substituted with grounds  Newspapers particularlyare bound to have such innocent typographicalerrors because of the constant pressure ofdeadlines            Sometimes a simple transposition of letters maymake things more complicated  When a sentence ina research report read the results of the experimentwere nuclear I stopped to reread it andsmiled when I quickly discovered that it should haveread unclear  Similarly density in place ofdestiny  is initially confusing until one deciphersfrom the context the true intent of the sentence  Alecture of mine was once described in a newspaperas lightheaded instead of lighthearted unlessthe reporter was being meanspirited            Some typos might be said to be errors of similarityor familiarity when similar or more familiarwords are substituted for the words in the manuscriptI should include in this category the correctedwords are in brackets graduation recessionprocession Gamblers Anonymouse anonymousThird Rights Reich American Protective DrawingInstitute Projective Postal Doctoral InstitutePost End Quiry Inquiry Clinical and CounterEncounter and similar misprintes  All these typographicalerrors could easily have been avoided by acareful reading of the galley proofs            One group of typographical errors is muchmore serious than a single misspelled word  This occurswhen a line or more from the original text isunintentionally skipped altogether resulting in anincomprehensible mangled style  I call it the propinquityerror because if often happens when thetypesetters eyes make an inadvertent visual jumpfrom one line to a line or two below in the manuscriptbecause the same word appears in bothplaces            On rare occasions a typographical error is uncannyThe obituary in The New York Times of thefamous psychoanalyst Theodor Reik ended with thesentence His body was created  Reik who lovedlanguage would have greatly enjoyed such a parapraxis            At times a typographical error is made on purposeas in advertisements or signs to catch the eyeof the reader or passerby  If it is a good one itmay even become a conversation topic the veryhope of the intentional misspeller            The nationally famous stores Toys  Us usea childs reversal of the letter R Similarly the titleof the movie The ussians Are Coming The ussiansAre Coming  which plays games with a letter in theCyrillic alphabet which is not an r            During the  presidential elections theHudson County Democratic Committee in NewYork erected a huge billboard sign high atop a gasolinestation near the Holland Tunnel which peopledriving into and out of Manhattan could not helpseeing  The sign intentionally misspelled the nameof the Democratic candidate and read On November vote for Adlai E Steviesion  The caption underthe picture of the billboard in The New YorkTimes read Think  Sign atop a gas station nearentrance to Holland Tunnel in Jersey City bears anintentional misspelling  A Committee memberstated the planned mistake paid off wonderfullyand got more attention than if the name werespelled correctly  Stevensons reaction is notknown  Being a master of the English language andcertainly a careful speller he most likely would haveshaken his head at this kind of childish electioneering            During the  presidential campaign bothcandidates reading from prepared notes made interestingslips of the eye Governor Dukakis spokeof equipping aircraft carriers with modern musiciansmunitions and Vice President Bush said Ihope I stand for antibigotry antiSemitism antiracismThese slips were essentially due to the similarityof the initial letters or part of the word likethe typographical errors of similarity or familiaritycited above but probably also due to the immensefatigue and exhaustion brought on by a presidentialcampaign            When ones name is deliberately or even unconsciouslymisspelled or when it is knowingly mispronounceda person perceives it as a slap at his prideOne does not have to be psychologically sophisticatedto see in it a deliberate discourtesy an intendedinjury to his dignity            Missing or misplaced punctuation marks naturallyfall within the net of the ET gremlins  Readthe sentence Lets eat children without thecomma and see the difference it makes  There aremany examples of how sentences with improperpunctuation marks sound ludicrous  For example aprogram chairman prepared in longhand a few laudatoryintroductory remarks about a lecturer I bring you a man

Mardon me padam but you areoccupewing the wrong pie  May I sew you to anothersheet   Slips allegedly uttered by Spoonerhimself bring a smile Who has not felt in his hearta halfwarmed fish to live a nobler life  Transpositionscome to mind that appear daily in the thoughtsof every dedicated spoonerist darking bogs a lanelylone the lissing mink  Each of these metathesesevokes a chuckle of delight            The good Dr Spooner a kind man with whitehair and cherubic face served New College for ahalf century as distinguished scholar and able administratorHe denied having made the slips of thetongue that made him famous and his contemporariesagreed that most legendary spoonerisms were inventedby imaginative New College undergraduatesEyewitnesses claim however that the concept beganwith Spooners twicespoken chapel announcementThe next hymn will be Kinkering KongsTheir Titles Take   Others claim he once actuallysaid in a dark glassly  A colleague recalled adiscussion in which Dr Spooner referred severaltimes to Dr Friends child when he meant DrChildes friend  Equally famous though as an Irishbull is his question of a former student shortly afterWorld War I Was it you or your brother who waskilled in the war            Spooner admitted occasional infelicities in verbaldiction but became openly irritated when hisname was associated with oral transpositions  Whenintroduced as the Dean of Kew Knowledge at acollege social function he responded with outspokendispleasure            In the six decades since Dr Spooners deaththe phenomenon of transposed sounds has found afirm place both in spoken and written language  Aspoonerism or more technically a methathesis is thetransposition of letters syllables or sounds in aword or phrase  More often they take an oral ratherthan a written form  Writers employ them howeveras a useful comedic device and accidental fauxpas occasionally appear in printed material            Following exhaustive research and practice Idivide spoonerisms into two general categoriesbased upon their structure and their functionStructural categories depend upon changes in thesound of words or upon their appearance in writtenform particularly the effect upon spelling  Functionalgroupings deal with meaning either overt orimplied both before and after transposition  Analysisof these groups enables one to determine whatmight be called good as opposed to bad spoonerismsMany critics maintain all are bad            Perfect or true spoonerisms are correct in bothsound and spelling when transposed  Laborers aretons of soil in place of sons of toil not only soundsright and spells right but has meaning in its revisedform  The best spoonerisms produce an element ofhumor or irony as this one does  Sound spellingmeaning and humor all combine to make greatspoonerisms            Partial spoonerisms occur when transpositionproduces only one meaningful word  A treckledspout in the lake for speckled trout is interestingperhaps even amusing but it lacks the satisfactionand punch of a true spoonerism  As one plays thetransposition game many partial spoonerisms cometo mind but they must be discarded quickly if youme what I seen            Auditory spoonerisms preserve the right soundwhen transposed but require varied spelling whenwritten  Thus a spoonerized looseleaf note bookbecomes boat nook not bote nook when writtenDr Spooners proverbial halfwarmed fish for halfformedwish has a totally different sound and meaningif written as halfwormed fish requiring thespelling to be changed  Since sound and mental imageare the keys to good spoonerisms auditory typesare most acceptable            Visual spoonerisms appear to be correct in writtenform but transposition produces the wrongsound  For example when warm food becomes farmwood the result is neither meaningful nor pleasingto the ear  Farm does not rhyme with warm and thesound of wood differs greatly from food  While theterm form wooed has good sound it loses its effectivenessbecause there is no real meaning in thephrase  Strictly visual spoonerisms must be rejected            Meaningless spoonerisms may be amusing insound but do not create real words  Spooners originalKinkering Kongs for Conquering Kings falls intothis category along with the comment attributed tohim that the story of the flood was barrowed fromBobylon  His apochryphal statement of compassionfor the duff and demb brings a smile but createsno new meaning in the transposed words  Becausethey give great pleasure both to ear and mind howevermeaningless transpositions are acceptableeven relished by all spoonerists            Mirror spoonerisms occur when transpositionsimply reverses word order usually with littlechange in meaning  In this phenomenon the wordsrhyme  Thus a great date becomes a date great Mirror types are somewhat rare seldom have newmeaning and usually are uninteresting  I recall acollege dean who was addressed as Dean Greene tohis face  Behind his back however irreverent juniorfaculty referred to him as the Green Dean             Spoonerisms can be classified on a functional basisas either useless or useful  Useless spoonerismsproduce correct words which unfortunately neitheramuse not have current meaning  If a stack ofplates is changed to a plaque of states  the result is tosay the least puzzling  Plaque is a word and states isa word but no meaning attaches to the term sincethere is no mental connection  Useless spoonerismsmust be avoided and characterize their creators asrank novices or amateurs            Useful spoonerisms substitute a common ormeaningful phrase for another when transpositionoccurs as when the movement was dealt a crushingblow becomes the movement was dealt a blushingcrow   Changing theres a cozy nook

uponboth speaker and listener            A gratifying subset of the useful category includesthe obscene spoonerism either intentional oraccidental  Transposition produces a vulgar term orphrase  Think

Thy chatter is butshowful wit   Obscene spoonerisms represent thepinnacle of spoonertype wit or is that woonertypespit             Making up spoonerisms is a pleasant form of addictionThe malady is similar to that of the cleverlittle tune that becomes imbedded in the mind anddemands to be hummed the more one tries to forgetthe stronger is the sense of impulsive and involuntaryrecall  Unlike

two are so dark the young mothersaid laughing but thats just the way it turned outI told Joe I said Honey honest I didnt jump thefence   Most of us with our British visitors had justcome down off the

fried up            The what the lady visitor from Sheffield inquired            The huevos You know the balls the hungryAmerican lady interpreted giving up her attemptat delicacy            I lived on a ranch in my formative years and theterms the jargon at least in the Southwest of theUnited States is not unfamiliar to me  But I amaware that stockmens vocabulary varies considerablyaround the Englishspeaking world much more Iimagine than say nautical or culinary or musicalterms do  Once while my wife and I were spendinga few weeks on my fathers ranch in Oklahoma weleft our Virginia house in the care of a former ForeignService colleague who had just been fired formarrying an Australian woman without Departmentalpermission  Another friend an Americanphoned me at home then and was answered by theAustralian bride  Bill isnt here she said hes ona station in the bush  Now the Australian wasquite angry over the firing of her husband and probablyshe was being deliberately unAmerican on thephone to confound yet another stupid Yank  If soshe succeeded as my American friend later told meand more interestingly to me revealed by examplehow much terms in the same language for the samethings  station  ranch bush  country sticks  in thesame occupation can vary from place to place atleast when it comes to stock raising            Most of what youve just seen goes on in theUK too I remarked to our British visitors as wedrove down off the mesa to which the lady fromSheffield rejoined Oh no I dont think so  I thinkwe mark cattle with little tags in their ears  Wedont rope the calves either and throw them downOn second thought I had to agree that she wasprobably right  But the most repugnant part of themultiple operation we had just witnessed was thecastration and I remained sure that bull calves aremade steer calves in Britain and are vaccinated  Iwondered whether on British farms the commonword for castrate was the same as here cut   Presumablythe other terms we had heard in use on themesa flank for heave the roped calf onto theground and hogtie for truss it up with a pickinstring  while the welltrained roping horse keeps theketch rope taut are not used as the practices arenot in Britain  In fact on many if not most Americanranches nowadays all of these operations areperformed in chutes rather than by roping calvesfrom horseback and flanking and hogtying themAlso increasingly brands are painlessly frozen notburned into the calves hide  Even in the relativelyprimitive procedure we had witnessed though Joehad been so brisk and deft and the calves so nonchalantas soon as they got back on their feet that thebusiness had not seemed so atrocious as one mightthink            Here in the Western States just as worldwideranch terminology varies from area to area  Everywherein North America ranch vocabulary hasdrawn heavily from Mexican Spanish since the industrylargely evolved in Mexico and the borderstates especially Texas  But even though as a boy Ilived on a ranch right on the Mexican border I rememberbeing mystified by ranching terms thatcrept into Western songs from north of us cayusefor example  I wondered about the word coulee inthe old song they feed in the coulees and waterin the draws            Ranch words of Mexican origin besides ranchitself are rodeo latigo a long strap to fasten thecinch to a Western saddle corral a word I couldnot find in an English dictionary except in its Afrikaansform kraal when I needed to know how tospell it some sixty years ago bronco palominobuckeroo which I have heard used only in fun andchaps to list a few that come to mind  But mostranching terms including such essential ones ascowboy grass pasture fence heifer beef boots saddleand so on are obviously common English wordsof long standing  Some of the English words havetaken on a special application in ranching usageTake the verb cut which in common ranch parlancehas two meanings the first as stated above beingcastrate  The second meaning not exclusive toranch talk is separate as in Cut the deck ofcards  On a ranch you might hear someone sayToday weve got to cut those penned steersmeaning perhaps separate out the ones to beshipped  A cutting horse is a mount trained to separatecertain cattle out from the herd or bunch            What on most ranches in the Southwest is calleda ketch catch rope is a reata in Mexican SpanishOur word lariat comes from this Mexican word withthe definite article prefixed and the final voweldropped  In the northern Mexican states especiallySonora these ropes used to lasso animals from onhorseback sometimes areor anyway werewoven of strands of rawhide which is elastic  If abig calf or steer was roped with one of these rawhidelariats attached solidly to the saddle horn Americanstyle and the roping horse came to an abrupt halt orsat back so that the roped animal hit the rope at arun the lasso tended to stretch like a rubber bandand then snap possibly springing back to knock aneye out of the cowboy  Monolongual Mexican vaqueroswitnessing the folly of such misuse of their implementwould shout at the Gringos in excellentDesert Latin as Spanish has been called Daledale  Literally this means simply Give to him butactually the advice offered was more like Play himlike a fish  The idea was that you had to hold therope in your hand and reduce the tension to whatthe elasticity would tolerate  American cowboysperhaps confusing the Spanish dale with Englishdally began to understand maybe at the cost of aneye or two and in their own lingo called the rawhidelariats dally ropes   That at least was the etymologycurrent in Southern Arizona which wasplausible enough to convince me  I have heardother explanations of dally rope in New Mexico thatwere too implausible to remember            Another interesting word that American cowhandshave taken from their Mexican predecessorsalong with the thing itself is chaps typically truncatedfrom the Mexican chaparreras the word forprotective leather leggings worn mainly by cowboyson horseback in thorny brush  The only time I haveheard the American word pronounced with theusual English or for that matter Spanish ch soundwas in a perfume ad on TV  By the people who wearchaps the article is invariably called as if spelledshaps   Two linguistic forces have shaped this wordthe Englishlanguage tendency to reduce words to asingle syllable eg pram sync perk MissMs etcand the law of open syllables that causes the first oftwo consonants that come together in a Spanishword to be dropped most commonly in the case ofll which prescriptively should be pronounced as lybut is much more often pronounced as y alone  Thet element of the tsh combination represented by chin Spanish as in English is not so commonly skippedas the first l of the double l combination but it isoften dropped at least in northern Mexico so whatthe Gringo cowboys heard was shaparreras whichthey trimmed down to what was spelled chaps butpronounced shaps             Drawing on occupational jargon for metaphorsto enliven communication is a common way to colorand illustrate language  And where a basic occupationcenters on livestock as in Biblical Judea or partsof the American West or the Australian bush thestockmans jargon is bound to be a main source ofmetaphors whether the subject be marital transgressionas in the banter at our picnic or the Lordsproviding for His flock as in the Twentythird Psalmor national character as in Waltzing Matilda                              A Dictionary of English PlaceNames            Placenames have many different meaningsWe could all write down a list of names which arepersonally meaningful recalling places where wehave lived and loved  If ever I write an autobiographyit will be in dictionary form names of places andpeople defined in terms of private significance  Forpoets humorists and those blessed with fertileimagination placenames can have other meaningsYes I remember AdlestropThe name because one afternoonOf heat the expresstrain drew up thereUnwontedly  It was late June                        Thus Edward Thomas begins the poem which enablesus to join him in his railway compartment atthe turn of the century  He goes on to fix that summerafternoon and the name Adlestrop forever inour consciousness  Poets as Stephen Vincent Bentreminded us can fall in love with placenames            Humorists respond to them differently  I hopeeveryone is familiar with The Meaning of Liff byDouglas Adams and John Lloyd   The authorsdecided that placenames spent too much timeloafing about on signposts  They assigned definitionsto the names which allowed them to startearning their keep in everyday conversation  Adlestropto them was that part of a suitcase which isdesigned to get snarled up on conveyor belts at airportsSome of the more modern Adlestrop designshave a special quick release feature which enablesthe case to fly open at this point and fling your underclothesinto the conveyor belts gearing mechanism            Reluctantly I have to admit that the reader hasno right to expect poetry or wit in this latest Oxfordplacename dictionary  The author is a highly reputableacademic toponymist and he is dealing withEnglish not American placenames  Those whostudy New World placenaming are at a distinct advantageThey are mainly social historians withmany an anecdote to relate about why settlers fromEurope transferred existing names  Scholars likeAD Mills have to shift back several centuries andbe linguistic archaeologists  They then have the difficultjob of explaining the results of their researchesto laymen            What then has Mills made of Adlestrop  Forhim it is a place in Gloucestershire which had itsname recorded in  as Titlestrop   By Domesdayin  it had become Tedestrop   He therefore explainsthe name as outlying farmstead or hamlet ofa man called Ttel  In other words as he says itis an OE personal name plus the element throp   Headds The initial T disappeared from the th centurydue to confusion with the preposition at             I think we should consider for a moment towhom Mills is explaining all this  I imagine that it islikely to be someone who happens to live in Adlestropa chap who has woken up one day and said tohimself Adlestropthats a queer sort of nameWhy Adlestrop  Having popped into his local referencelibrary and taken this dictionary from theshelf has all become clear to him  Is this entry asclear and concise as the blurb claims            If our enquirer had at least some formal trainingin philology it will have been crystal clear  He willhave had no need to consult the Introduction to discoverthat Ttels name is preceded by because itis inferred from comparative placename evidenceand postulated to occur  He will not have neededto consult the list of abbreviations to learn that OEstands for Old English and that old in that contexthas a fairly specific meaning  He will have understoodwhy the at confusion occurred  Though hewould probably talk of living in Adlestrop he knowsthat that he gets off the train at Adlestrop  Not thathe would think in such simplistic terms his historicalknowledge of prepositional usage would havemade such reasoning unnecessary            My point is that a more normal reader will haveextracted far less from the entryprobably no morethan that Adlestrop originally meant someonesfarm  My further point is that to be totally successfula dictionary of this kind requires far more thanthe academic skills of a placename specialist  Ifsuch a work is really to do its jobtell the story of aplacename in simple terms to an average readeragreat deal of further thinking needs to be done bythe editorial team about how the information is presentedand for whom  Imagination on their part isrequired even if it is not the imagination of the poetor humorist            The information in this book would have beenbetter presented in an entirely different form  Hadit remained a traditional book there would havebeen a strong case for listing separately the hundredsof names that consist of a personal name andcommon placename element  Various other listscould have given the essential information aboutnames based on words with meanings such as fordand wood   An index would have allowed names tobe traced in alphabetical order  Separate articlescould have dealt with the meaning of elements likethrop and such matters as the loss of initial lettersowing to confusion of preposition and name            A much better solution however would havebeen to publish this material as computer softwareSurely the reference libraries to which people turnfor such specialized information as the origin ofplacenames as well as the individuals who are interestedenough in such subjects to buy dictionarieshave access by now to personal computers  I shouldhave been able to refer to the fruits of Millss laborsby inserting a floppy disk into my machine  On typingAdlestrop I should have been presented with theearly spellings and Millss interpretation  Had Ineeded it a Help key should have brought an instantexplanation of the symbol  and the abbreviationOE  There would have been a far fuller discussion ofthe preposition question in a separate paragraphone that would have appeared on screen had I typedin a name such as Elstree  where it was also relevant            Academic reviewers of this dictionary will asusual write a great deal about whether the authorwas right to choose one postulated form of an OldEnglish name rather than a slightly different one  Ibelieve it would be wrong to confine the discussionto such matters  I am prepared to trust Millss scholarshipand accept that he has explained to the best ofhis ability some  names  He has conscientiouslydone his job  His editors in my view havenot  They have complacently chosen to update andmarginally simplify Eilert Ekwalls previous OxfordDictionary of English PlaceNames   I see very littleevidence that they stopped to think who would beinterested in this specialized information and how itcould best be presented            This is all the more disappointing since othersections of OUP along with other publishers of referenceworks have made great strides forward inrecent years  Academic excellence has been maintainedbut combined with good design editorialflair and original thinking  The editors of this bookhad an important part to play  Unfortunately bothfor Mr Mills and his average reader they appear tohave completely missed their opportunity            Leslie Dunkling                           Thames Ditton Surrey                                          Reception and Response Hearer Creativity and theAnalysis of Spoken and Written Texts            In the early s I wrote an article WORDXXVI  Nos  an offprint of which I shallbe happy to send to those requesting it in which Isuggested that relatively accurate statistics on wordfrequencies could best be attained by factoring inthe circulation and listenership figures of periodicalsand radioTV media used as sources of data aboutthe words and phrases under investigation  While itis acknowledged that such a method would not workwell for books the idea was that the number of occurrenciesof a lemma a technical though convenientterm for the thingword or phraseunderstudy multiplied by say the Audit Bureau of Circulationsworn circulation of a periodical wouldyield a figure that could legitimately be called itsExposure   Obviously such a number would be fartoo large to manipulate readily so using a formulafamiliar to statisticians it was normalized to producea simple decimal number of only a few digits which Icalled the lemmas Exposure Index   The purpose ofthe exercise was to connect the frequency informationwith the language as it is used and perceived inaddition the approach would serve to eliminatefrom consideration those materials which thoughpublished were little read with a consequent lowinfluence on the lexicon            Frequency information on the language ofgreat usefulness to lexicographers and other linguistsis sorely lacking a study by Thorndike andLorge in the s yielded the Teachers Wordbookof  Words  but that had outlived its accuracyand usefulness by the mid s  With the emergenceof computer typesetting in the s itseemed likely that the analysis of large bodies of textfrom newspapers and periodicals in particularwould be facilitated for one of the greatest expenseswas the cost of keyboarding the texts into machinereadableform so that they could be processedspeedily and economically by computer            Those who question why a large corpus of materialshould be needed for study ought to realize thatthe amount of language written and read utteredand heard in a single day is unbelievably huge  In agiven hour the numbers of words spewed forth bythe dozens of TV channels and AM and FM radiostations alone is unimaginable  While it is acknowledgedthat statistics can make allowance for usingsamples instead of an entire corpus for analysis theprodigious quantity of lemmata thats the plural oflemma  requires an incredibly large sample  Thenagain the statistics for a few thousand of the mostfrequent words the a an but for of etcneednot be derived again and again and a few thousandsuch lemmata are usually eliminated at the outsetStill that means that a reasonably accurate sampleas I suggested in  would have to contain a billionpreferablya billion billionlemmata  Inthose days computer storage and processing equipmentwere too primitive to accommodate such quantitiesBut today the situation is quite differentMoreover publishers are today generally less reluctantthan before to make available to researchers thedisks and tapes containing text            As we all know there is an enormous number ofpublications dealing with highly specialized areas  Ifa truly unabridged word study of the languagewere ever to be undertaken such materials wouldhave to be included  But for practical purposesthere is little point in including a lemma like hwlrda kenning whaleroad for sea  if only an infinitesimalportion of the population reads Beowulf oran article about it in a recondite learned journal            Early in this century Funk  Wagnalls publisheddictionaries that contained a large number ofScotticisms either out of habit or affection for thegenre or because their lexicographers felt that everystudent who read Burns had to be able to find in thedictionary every word he used  These days when alleditions of Burnss poems are annotated withglosses for any foreign words allowing such Scotticismsto occupy valuable space in general dictionariesis not considered economical and only thoselikely to appear in crossword puzzles are includedSimilarly historical lexicographythe vocabularyof Shakespeare Milton Chaucer Richard Rolle ofHampole the Holinshed Chronicle etchas beenrelegated to footnotes in student editions or to specializeddictionaries  Of course not all Scotticismshave been excised and words like auld land  andsyne are probably still to be found in many dictionariesbut only because they are frequent  But thesewords are archaisms obsolete words that are usedfor special effect or other reasons as in popular quotationslike wherefore in Wherefore art thouRomeo known to every schoolchild and misunderstoodby many who think it means wherewhile it really means why it is retained in what for dialectal whuffo   The King James Bible which containsmany such archaisms has preserved them formodern English wherefore more commonly appearsin the tautology whys and wherefores             The book under review might well have includedsomething on the subject of exposure in oneof the essays collected within its pages for much ofthe material selected by lexicographers as sourcecorpora for citations is arrived at subjectively andimpressionisticallythough I hasten to allow thatthe subjective and impressionistic maunderings of agood experienced linguist might well be worth amotherlode of statistics  The point is that Receptionand Response is one of the few works that I haveseen that tries to present a point of view from theperspective of the receiver of information whilepaying attention to the semiotic aspects of languagethat is the elements embedded in communicationthat are not strictly concerned with languageper se            The twelve articles collected under the generalrubrics of Contexts of responsiveness Listener responseand communication and Responsive readershave mixed success in dealing with the subject  Thefirst Attending the hearing listening in legal settingsby Peter Goodrich a lecturer in law doesnot seem to come to grips with its subjectat leastin an understandable waytill more than halfwaythrough notwithstanding its inclusion of much matterthat makes good and interesting reading  RichardG Tedeschis Therapeutic listening is a broadthough concise treatment of psychotherapists reactionand receptivity to their patients  It is more anarticle on the behaviour of therapists than on languageso we can leave it  Deborah Cameron andDeborah Hills  Listening in negotiating relationshipsbetween listeners and presenters on radiophonein programmes have studied the output ofLBC Radio Londons alltalk station which Ihave listened to with interest  After devoting wastingabout half their space on a penetrating analysisof how callers and presenters say hello and goodbyeor not as is often the case with goodbyes theyfinally get down to the substance of the calls  In asubcategory called Extreme outrageous and offensivecalls the authors refer to a new genre ofphoneins in the US whose whole raison dtre isfor the presenter to pour abuse on those who callThose who have heard Bob Grant and others in theUS are familiar with the pattern  What the authorsfail to mention is that the treatment the caller receivessometimes depends on who the presenter is            For example Mike Allen on LBC is lowkeycalm and always gracious and polite seeming toevoke no outrageous calls  Robbie Vinson sp whoruns Robbie Vinsons Night Line and refers to himselfin the third person is often very unpleasant indeedand some of the conversations cited in the articleespecially one in which a caller was told that if hedidnt like Britain he should get out smack stronglyof his acerbic dyspeptic often rude manner  Whatpresenters are missing is that listeners often tune into hear all sorts of the things that other listenershave to say whether they agree with them or thinkthem mad and it makes the presenter appear intolerantlybigoted to cut off a caller whose opinions areat variance with those the presenter might perceiveto be held by the man on the Clapham omnibus  Onthe whole despite the preliminary screening thatcallers are subjected to mainly in order to eliminatecranks drunks and undesirables those who do getthrough rarely have anything of moment to contributethe presenters are notably unsympathetic ineliciting a fair exposure of their comments and thelistener is too often left with the feeling that thepresenter has been too dismissive  The analysis inthis article is interesting and well done but I questionwhether it is an analysis of the listener as onlythe caller and the presenter are discussed  To considerthe caller a listener in this structure would be amistake as far as I can see the comment on listenersis confined to the authors ConclusionRadio phoneins are speech events in which relationshipsbetween individual listeners a notionof the listening public and the station as personifiedin the professional presenter are carefullynegotiated                        I do not accept that for once the listener hasbecome a caller he is as much a part of the scriptentertainmentwhatever one might call itas thepresenter and is in effect no longer a mere listenerThat is confirmed in the followingAlthough it is the presenter who has ultimatecontrol in the encountera control he may legitimatein terms of the interests of the listenersout there their right to be entertained and tobe protected from offensive viewsthe listenerswho call in may challenge the norms he laysdown in various ways from dogged pursuit of apersonal relationship with the presenter toequally dogged resistance to the containmentstrategies presenters employ  Listeners likepresenters are aware of the linguistic and socialnorms which structure acceptable phonein talkyet they are capable of ignoring or subvertingthese and of attempting to renegotiate the rulesof the game                        Lack of space precludes further comment onthis interesting collection of papers but I should liketo add one observations  The phonein programshave created a culture language of their own onethat is curiously common to both the US and theUK  It includes comments like Im a firsttime orvirgin caller I really enjoy your program which alternateswith You really have a great program tonight and Thank you for taking my call   I havenever fathomed the purpose of the first the secondis pure sycophancy and the third is patently ludicrousfor if a presenter of a phonein program refusedcalls it would not be a phonein program            Laurence Urdang                              New Light on Boswell            The Cambridge University Press has seen fit tohonor the th anniversary of Boswells Life ofJohnson with a collection of fourteen essays on thebiographer and his subject  Only one of the contributorsis at Yale and the ghost of Frederick Pottleand his colleagues in the Boswell Factory shouldbe delighted that there has been such widespreadenthusiasm for the field they have ploughed for thepast six decades  Professor David Daiches of Edinburghleads off with a splendid introduction on Boswellsambiguities writing about the biography thatthe subject understood the biographer more profoundlythan the biographer understood the subjectTrue enough but Johnsons intellectual capacitywas greater than Boswells ab initio   Theremaining essays are organized into groups fourgeneral essays on Boswell and eighteenthcenturyScottish culture four essays on contexts for the Lifeof Johnson and five essays on features of the biographyitself            Thomas Crawford Aberdeen analyzes therhetoric of Boswells letters to such friends as AndrewErskine John Johnston and William Temple auseful way to demonstrate how Boswell developedhis literary skills  Richard Sher New Jersey Instituteof Technology probes Boswells relations withboth the Moderate and Popular wings of the Churchof Scotland  Boswells ambiguities and internal contrarietiesare neatly shown in his treatment of WilliamRobertson Principal of Edinburgh Universitypraising his literary skills but inveighing against histheology  Pat Rogers University of South Floridaprovides Boswells attitude to and use of Scotticismsboth in writing and in speech at one time we aretold Boswell considered compiling a dictionary ofwords peculiar to the Scottish tongue  Joan PittockAberdeen undertakes the important task of evaluatingBoswell as a critic  She points out that had helived in this century he would have excelled as aninterviewer much like David Frost            Boswell wrote a considerable volume of publishedwork before he began the Life of Johnson  preliminarytrials of strength  Thomas Curley BridgewaterState College uses his Account of Corsica asan example of a travel book in the same genre asSternes A Sentimental Journey and Smolletts Travelsthrough France and Italy   It is also a tract on politicalliberty and Curley quotes the epigraph from theCorsican rejoinder to a Pope in  Non enimpropter gloriam divitias aut honores pugnamus sedpropter libertatem solummodo quam nemo bonusnisi simul vita amittit  For we fight not for gloryriches or honors but solely for liberty which nogood man loses except with his life  Gordon TurnbullYale focuses on Boswells account of his defenseof the sheepstealer John Reid to illuminateBoswells sense of sympathy one of a biographersnecessary skills  Richard Schwartz Geogetownuses Boswells interview with Hume on his deathbedto explore Boswells own philosophy as well as hisattitude toward death and the life hereafter  SusanManning Newnham Cantab deals with Boswellsepisodes of melancholia a trait he shared with Johnsonand his essays on it in The Hypochondriack             The above essays set the stage for essays dealingdirectly with the Life   The first of these is an outstandingaccount of Boswells treatment of the famousquarrel between Johnson and Lord ChesterfieldJohn Burke Alabama reviews and analyzesother contemporary accounts and finds that Boswellsis not only the most accurate but that he usesit to demonstrate Johnsons character whereas otherswere merely retailing literary gossip  MarliesDanziger Hunter takes up the question of Boswellsauthorial comments that are interspersedthroughout the Life   Certainly he intrudes himselfinto the scenes sometimes for sheer selfdisplay butalso for a variety of other purposes all of which arecarefully examined  Paul Korshin Pennsylvaniasupplies a masterly analysis of Johnsons conversationas recorded by Boswell sometimes a bit longafter the fact  It may be true that Boswells formalhighly generalized diction quite possibly encouragedby Malone is no longer to our taste that is notthe diction of twentiethcentury biographers but ifso so much the worse for thcentury readers ofbiography  Donna Heiland Vassar comments onother contemporary biographies of Johnson  Shecomments that Boswell presents Johnson as a divinefigure with Boswell as his priest  The paradox inherentin the concept of divinity incarnate is theepitome of the dichotomy in Boswells portrayalof his subject  Boswell reveres Johnson and at thesame time manipulates him continually  GregClingham Fordham the editor modestly places hisessay last  He attacks the complex question oftruth vs  authenticity in Boswells portrait ofJohnson and therein lies the art of biography            This is an exceptionally fine collection of scholarlyessays greatly to be valued by readers interestedin Boswell and Johnson  Though some of themost opaque prose written today is by PhDs inEnglish Lit these essays are largely free of thatfault  Perhaps their clarity owes something to theirsubject  Both Boswell and Johnson wrote readableand lucid prose and scholars who gloss their textscannot resist their influence which is all for thegood  The contributors have as Johnson advisedBoswell rid their minds of cant            William B Ober MD                           Tenafly New Jersey                                          Of that ilk or kidney            In recent decades an ilk epidemic has afflictedjournalists and broadcasters and ordinary peoplewho like to fancyup their language a bit  For instancethis from a newspaperLanders and her sister Dear Abbey and severalothers of their ilk                        Here is Sir Bruce Fraser in his revision of Sir ErnestGowerss The Complete Plain Words               Ilk is a Scots word meaning same  It is not anoun meaning kind sort kidney  James Sporranof that ilk means James Sporran of Sporranit shows that he lives on the estate that bears thefamily name and distinguishes him from his cousinsthe Sporrans of Glenhaggis and his distantkinsmen the Sporrans of Upper Tooting  Theschoolmaster who wrote to The Times about thedamage done by the BBC by Mrs Whitehouseand her ilk should write out fifty times I mustnot use words I do not understand                        In  the Third Edition of the Concise OxfordDictionary endorsed the Scots usage but reportedthat ilk is used vulgarly for that familyclass or set  The Eighth Edition  gives thisas the first definition for ilk               colloquial disputed use a family class or setnot of the same ilk as you  Usually derogatoryand therefore best avoided                        The second definition which I need not quote hereis a quite inadequate one for the Scottish use of theword  Surprisingly Chambers th Century Dictionaryedited and published in Edinburg displays thesame insensitivity as does the Gage CanadianHowever Websters New World is quite responsiveto Scottish sensitivity            Having had this say on ilk  I am giving up thefight  I will not use the word in the now popularsense but I will refrain from snarling at people whodo  I remember though that many years ago thegreat Fowler declared that the nonScots use of ilk ismerely an example of Wornout Humour            However when the noun is used adjectivally itcan mean each or every Ilka lassie ha here laddiBut if you were not born and raised in Scotland youshould not fool with that one I was not and I do not            Perhaps it would be better as Fraser seems tosuggest to use the phrase of that kidney  Apparentlythis use of kidney came from the belief thatthe kidneys were a factor in determining a personstemperament  Shakespeare had that in mind in TheMerry Wives of Windsor A man of my kidneyAnd both Fielding and Disraeli used the word thatway in their novels  Both the Concise Oxford andWebsters New World give as one of the meanings ofkidney temperament and kind sort  Thereseems a touch of wornout humor in thator perhapsmerely of verbal cuteness                              Beyond Compare            In the usual meanings of positives comparativesand superlatives of English adjectives the gradationsare taken to mean  ermore  andestmost  the latter being the adverbs normallyused to distinguish the comparatives andsuperlatives of polysyllabic words  Despite the factthat it is awkward to describe there is nothing terrifyinglyprofound about this observation all it meansis that hot means hot hotter means more hot of ahigher temperature than that designated by hot and hottest means most hot of a temperature that isgreater than that of anything else being consideredFor polysyllables like ignorant we use more ignorantand most ignorant                            What is interesting is that the semantic patterndoes not hold for old and older when applied to peopleit seems that an old person is older than an olderperson or to put it the other way round an olderperson is younger than an old person  Old in thiscontext is more or less synonymous with elderlywhich means quite advanced in age while oldermeans advanced in age but not yet so advanced asto be called old   Oldest does not enter this discussionI venture to suggest that the reason is thatwhile an old person is merely old an older person isperceived as being older than a younger person oftenthe one who is talking rather than being olderthan an old person  Clear  I thought not            Which is younger a young person or a youngerperson  Perhaps youngyounger are not used in thesame way  How old are young people            The same sort of thing seems to be going onwith lowclass which is lower than lowerclass andwith highclass which is higher than higherclassThe dictionaries I have checked are silentimproperlyso I thinkon these senses            Are there other similar anomalies in the language                              Everything I Know            Occasionally one hears She taught him everythinghe knows or He taught her everything sheknows curious expressions when you come to thinkabout them indeed they state an impossible conditionOn the other hand She taught him everythingshe knows and He taught her everything he knowsthough improbable could make sense  The ambiguityprobably arose from SheHe taught herhim everythingshehe knows about something specifiedin which the referent of the second Shehe is ambiguouscommon sense dictates that it refer to the subjectof the sentence not to the her or him thusyielding the more reasonable She taught him everythingshe knows or He taught her everything sheknows                               When error or conjecture is uncritically copiedfrom one publication to another it is often legislatedinto fact merely by virtue of having been repeatedso often  The French word bistrobistrot forexample has countless times been attributed to Russianalthough that is mere fantasy            Creating fact merely by repeating error isparticularly frequent when it comes to Yiddish andEnglish numerous times we read without supportingproof that English words like copacetic dermathe food kibosh as in put the kibosh on  Cockamamiegazump gnof or older English gnoffe guy theperson not the rope and shyster are from YiddishIndeed proof is impossible in such cases for thewords were not derived from Yiddish            Having recently exploded the myth about thesupposed Yiddish origin of several of these words inarticles in Jewish Linguistic Studies I turned my attentionto gunsel in its various spellings  After fiveweeks of working on nothing but this word andthinking that every treatment of it in dictionariesand elsewhere had been located and evaluated Isent the article to press  Now to my dismay MurielSmith writes in VERBATIM XVIII that the suggesteddefinition  sic  is from Yiddish genzel gantzelandor German Gnslein Gnzel gosling younggoose             Let the record be set straight Yiddish has onlygendzl gosling  The e stands for the phoneme ewhich in this word is pronounced like the e in ebb inall varieties of Yiddish  That vowel would not yieldthe first vowel of gunsel hence a Yiddish origin for itis doubtful  Since this English word has no associationwith guns it is not possible that English guntriggered as some have suggested an irregularsound change resulting in an English vowel whichthe Yiddish one would not otherwise have yielded            There is no Yiddish word genzel organtzel which Smith has copied uncriticallyfrom others  If Yiddish is the source of gunsel someonewill have to produce an etymon that is phonologicallymore likely than gendzl or if that is indeedits etymon explain the irregular sound change  Athread running through all these mistaken etymologiesis that their supporters think that the only criterionin etymology is if it sounds like x  then it mustbe derived from x   That misconception can be seenon a grand scale in Isaac Mozesons The Word TheDictionary That Reveals the Hebrew Source of Englishwhich purports to show that about  English words are of Hebrew origin  That book is sobrimming with error that the title of the review of itin Jewish Language Studies Vol   pp

example of movementin the opposite direction comes readily to mindhowever  One often hears the term splitting thebaby used to describe the actions of a judge or arbitratorwho has reconciled opposing positions bywhat is better described as splitting the difference The reference of course is to King Solomans decisionwhen faced by two women claiming to themother of the same child  The Solomonic decisionto award custody to the woman who was willing togive the child to her rival rather than see it killed bybeing split between them was just the opposite ofsplitting the baby   Nevertheless by some apparentconverse of the Niceness Principle the languageperpetuates the notion that the baby was split andthat a judge acts wisely in following that example            Here is an instance of what Mr Galef calls falserecall acting not to smooth something out but tomake it rougher than it ever was                              Until I read Pagels The Gnostic Gospels I recalledthe expression the naked truth as having derivedfrom an old Roman fable perhaps from Horacearound  BC about Truth and Falsehoodemerging from a swim together Falsehood stealingTruths clothers  Truth in the fable would rather benaked than don the clothes of Falsehood thus thenaked Truth   I dont find the story appealing but itappears in all references on the derivation of the expression            Compare that pale fable with the force of thewords of Marcus a student of the gnostic teacherValentinus c  AD who Pagel writes describesthe vision that descended upon him in theform of a woman who says to him I wish to showyou Truth herself for I have brought her down fromabove so that you may see her without a veil andunderstand her beauty  Pagel then quotes Marcuson how the naked Truth came to him in a womansform            I suppose it is possible that Valentinus repeatedHoraces metaphor in different more dramaticterms a hundred years later  Or each was independentlyinspired to imagine Truth as an unclothedwoman  From now on I go with the derivation fromMarcus student of Valentinus the Gnostic  Has aVERBATIM reader any thoughts on the subject                              May I add a gracenote

mainly by the deletionof colorful interesting quaint and charmingolder entries to make room for the new  Fortunatelyfacsimile editions of the original have beenpublished and copies of early printing

                          Lunatic Lovers of Language             Readers of science fiction have occasionallybeen exposed to invented words and languages usedby extraterrestrials  Some of the words associatedwith sci fi were discussed by Dr Stephen Hirschbergin Zap the BEMs XV but that articledealt with words and not languages and with a fewexceptions with words used by humans in some futuretime not by extraterrestrials either now or inthe future  Some years ago I met a woman who waswriting her masters thesis on languages created byscifi authors but she never sent me a promisedcopy or maybe I just dreamt the whole thing            Many writers avoid the language problem by introducingmental telepathy as the means of communicationwhich is just as well human speech employsthe available organs situated between thelungs and the face and there is no reason to assumethat fishfaced or vegetablelike or otherwise constitutedextraterrestrials would be endowed with likeequipment any more than are many nonhumancreatures on earth and they would thus be unlikelyto use languages constructed for humans  The languageof extraterrestrials merits only passing mentionin Lunatic Lovers of Language which deals withthe development of artificial languages and with thesearch for language universals characteristics thatmany or all languages share and that lend credenceto the notion that there was only one original languagefrom which the present stock has livergedWithout going into the matter here it must be saidthat universals concern themselves with underlyingstructures of language not with superficial correspondencesof the type that enable us to identifylanguage families            The following passage will help to explain theslightly offputting title and will impart to the readera sample of the authors humor which I find engagingJust take a look at the lunatic in love with languagethe logophile the inventor of languagesSitting in his booklined study he collects greatpiles of information he collates and classifies ithe makes lists and fills card indexes  He is in theclutches of a denominatory delirium of a taxonomicmadness  He has to name everything butbefore being able to name he has to recogniseand classify concepts to enclose the whole Universein a system of notation produce enumerationshierarchies and paradigms  A lunatic ambitionyet there is something grandiose in it whichyou cant help admiring  So much energy spentfor so little result  I dont believe any other fantasyhas ever been pursued with so much ardourby the human spirit apart perhaps from the philosophersstone or the proof of the existence ofGod or that any other utopia has caused so muchink to flow apart perhaps from socialism  p                        Try as hard as they might inventors of artificiallanguages have been unable to disbuse themselvesof the ineluctable attraction of their own native languageor language family   Thus for exampleZamenhofs Esperanto is easy for speakers of IndoEuropeanlanguages to learn especially if they knowsome Latin or a Romance language Zamenhof was aPole who knew other European languages  But Esperantois lingua incognita to the native speaker ofArabic Chinese Japanese or any other nonIndoEuropeanlanguage notwithstanding its somewhatsimplified structure which aids in its rapid assimilationNow that certain very literate people havetaken hold of Esperanto and published novels andpoetry in it its chief function as a means of basiccommunication has been violated and with the onsetof its sophistication it has become more complexthus defeating its original purpose  Esperantists arean eagerly energetic group who believer in Esperantoas far as I know there are no native speakersof Esperanto  If Esperanto is aspiring to becomea real language then it must begin to behave likeone and before long it will begin to suffer the sameweaknesses that natural languages sufferpolysemyand pleurisemy  Before you know it you aresaying to yourself Why should I bother to learn awhole new grammer and vocabulary of Esperantowhen I can learn some sort of lingua franca Englishor French for example which at least has an extensiveliterature to offer  Today English far from aneasy language to master has probably replacedFrench as the most universally used lingua francaYiddish serves as a lingua franca of sorts for Jewswhatever they may bebut it seems to be diminishingin that role and is I understand frowned uponby the Israelis many of whom can now claim Hebrewas a native tongue            This is a curious book  Those who might be encouragedby this brief review to read it ought toknow that frequent recourse to Appendix II willclarify many of the authors referencesindeedone would do well to read Appendix II after readingthe Introduction  The author a linguist is often obscurethough it is impossible to know whether thatis her fault or her translators  I was unsure for instanceexactly how to understand the following sentencewhich opens Chapter I and which seems curiouslyunidiomatic or in my ignorance perhaps itis poeticHow it came about the the myth could take the placeof history and feed both fiction and utopia thatfiction in the form of dogma of various kindscould take the place of science that sciencecould progressively dominate fiction that historyin eliminating myth could itself become a scienceat the cost of a ruthless battle between theimaginary and the reala battle whose outcomeeven today remains unclearthis story readslike a novel and in any case doesnt the wordhistory itself which designates a succession offacts through time also encapsulate the wordstory a tale a fable an imaginary account p                        I suppose that is English but it is certainly anacoluthicobscure and viciously punctuated after theBritish style which can be destructive to both senseand grammar            The flashes of wisdom should not be overlookedhoweverThe same

head that are wrungby names like Marilyn Monroe Margaret Thatcherand Marie Queen of Rumania is identified as themodel as if she were being distinguished from theRachael Garley who succeeded Sir Randolph Quirkas president of the British Academy and that otherRachael Garley whom we all know to be the nota power behind Boris Yeltsin or Saddam HuseinOr perhaps she is identified as the model just toremind us that she is an outstandingly unique andfamous model to be distinguished from what mightotherwise be characterized as a model whichwould make her just another one of the pack  Insuch cases the is followed by a real or impliedwellknown or some equivalent thereof to wit internationally famous beloved notorious undisputeddisputed recently released or Escaped  prizewinningnovelist etc  Note the difference betweenthe transposed form with the model RachaelGarley and Mr  and the form as given withRachael Garley the model and Mr  Clearly thefirst seems to call for a model for the name surroundedby punctuation becomes less significantalso in that sequence the reader is not boxed intothe corner of obligation where he must stand face tothe wall if unaware of who this in personagemight be  If a young person today were to encountera reference to say the madam Polly Adlerthe question might well come up Who was or isPolly Adler  in which case the reply would probablygo something like She was A wellknownbrothelkeeper of the s and s in New YorkThat is the the would naturally and abruptlychange to an a particularly in reference to NewYork where it is acknowledged that brothelkeepingwas endemic and madams fame universal  Had thereply been She was THE wellknown brothelkeeperthat could have been interpreted as aputdown of the questioner as if to say You stupidignoramus  Everyone else in the world knows thatshe was the BrothelKeeper Extraordinaire of NewYork            This approach is often used by entertainerswho invoke strange names of strange people to demonstrateto an audience that they are au fait with thelatest though I am never quite sure the latestwhat  It is also the technique of the in jokeshared between such entertainers and their audiencesthough how in something can be whenshared with thousands is debatable  I felt definitelyout when I first heard a British audience applaudwith chuckling appreciation at the mention of thename Val Doonican   For all I knew the man whosaid it had made up the name and the audience waslaughing because the name was funny as they mightwell do when hearing a name like Kylie Minogue   Ittook me a while to understand that Kylie Minogue isthe name of a real person  I also discovered that ValDoonican is the name of a real person  Though Ihave no way of knowing whether either name is genunineor assumed it occurs to me that if one wantedto assume a name more euphonious choices mightpresent themselves  On the other hand Kylie Minoguedoes have a certain je ne sais pas about it as Ionce heard someone say  Certainly it seems unlikelythat someone would have to refer to her asKylie Minogue the singer except for the benefitof the same people who need the reinforcement affordedby Margaret Thatcher the prime ministerGeorge Bush the president or Elizabeth II thequeen as if to distinguish them from the localroofer the itinerant hedgetrimmer or the oceanliner  There are not a lot of prime ministers presidentsand queens aboutat least not that we areexposed to continually in the mediaand it wouldbe a bit ludicrous to read about Margaret Thatchera prime minister etc  On the other hand till shebecomes as famous as Thatcher or Elizabeth II itseems to me that Rachael Garley ought to be referredto as a not the model  To be sure thereare not a lot of Rachael Garleys Val Doonicans orKylie Minogues about either for which we and theymay be equally thankful
