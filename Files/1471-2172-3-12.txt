                    Background        Thymocyte development occurs within a complex network of        cells extracellular matrix and secreted factors referred        to as the thymic microenvironment     Current evidence        suggests that this microenvironment is created during fetal        thymus organogenesis through stagedependent interactions        between differentiating thymic epithelial cells TECs and        developing thymocytes         Therefore blocks at        different stages of thymocyte development result in        differential effects on TEC differentiation and function        Because of the complex interdependence of TEC and thymocyte        differentiation defects in fetal TEC development can be        caused either directly by cellautonomous TEC        differentiation defects or indirectly by defective        thymocyte maturation Once a mature thymic environment is        formed many if not all stages of thymocyte maturation        require interactions with thymic epithelial cells        Therefore defects in TECs can in turn cause defects in        thymocyte differentiation proliferation or cell        death        Thymocyte differentiation undergoes two main        transitions The first is from the CD   triple        negative TN to the CD  double positive DP stages        During this transition T cell precursors sequentially gain        and lose cell surface expression of CD and CD markers        express the preT cell receptor pTCR and undergo        selection        The other transition is from CD         DP to CD or CD single positive SP thymocytes in        which DP cells express CD rearrange their TCR undergo        positive and negative selection and down regulate CD or        CD to become functional CD or CD SP T cells             In addition to functional and cell surface marker        changes each thymocyte differentiation stage is marked by        characteristic changes in proliferation and apoptosis                         The most well defined role for TECs in directly        affecting thymocyte differentiation is to mediate positive        selection via expression of MHC molecules                However it is still unclear whether TECs directly        promote specific stages of thymocyte differentiation during        stages that do not involve MHCTCR interactions or whether        their role at other stages is primarily to promote cell        growth and or survival Cytokines produced by TECs have        been shown to promote proliferation in early stages of        thymocyte development and have been proposed to regulate        apoptosis and differentiation although their precise roles        remain controversial      TECs have also been shown        to promote thymocyte proliferation in SP cells after        selection has occurred     However a defined role for        TECs at the TNDP transition remains elusive Much of the        research on this transition has focused on the role of the        preTCR Mounting evidence suggests that the preTCR does        not require interaction with a ligand to perform its        function and the subsequent CD  TN or preDP to        DP transition has been termed programmed differentiation        to indicate that this step can occur in isolated        thymocytes presumably without input from extrinsic signals              However there is also evidence that the        thymic microenvironment does contribute signals required        for the TNDP transition particularly to promote thymocyte        proliferation and apoptosis        The specific        nature and purpose of the TEC contribution during this        important transition therefore remains to be        determined        In order to investigate the regulation of thymocyte        development by TECs we are studying         Hoxa          Pax compound mutant mice Hoxa        and Pax are transcription factors that act in a common        pathway regulating thymus organogenesis and thymic        epithelial cell development                 Hoxa          Pax compound mutants have defects        in TEC development including reduced numbers of TECs fewer        MHC Class II TECs and changes in TEC proliferation and        apoptosis These TEC defects result in thymocyte maturation        defects that include a decrease in total thymocyte number        and a fold reduction in the number of DP thymocytes but        an apparently normal transition from the TN to the preDP        stage The decrease in DP cells is associated with        increased apoptosis in both preDP and DP cells     As        the defects at the TN to DP transition in these mutants are        caused by defective TEC function rather than        thymocyteintrinsic defects these mice represent an        opportunity to study the role of TECs in promoting this        transition        To further investigate the role of TECs in promoting        thymocyte death and growth during the TN to DP transition        we assayed the proliferation of specific thymocyte subsets        using BrdU incorporation which detects cycling cells in        Sphase We compared fetal and adult wild type mice with         HoxaPax compound mutants             We also assayed         Rag mice which have defects in        TEC development due to arrested thymocyte maturation at the        TN stage     We found stagespecific differences in        proliferation levels between fetal and adult wild type        thymocytes We also found distinct patterns of thymocyte        proliferation in the         Rag and         HoxaPax mutants The abnormal cell        death and proliferation patterns in the         HoxaPax compound mutant fetal        thymocytes might be caused in part by observed reductions        in the transcription levels of the cytokines IL and SCF        produced by TECs Our results support a critical role for        microenvironment created by TECs in regulating thymocyte        proliferation during the TN to DP transition and show that        this function is disrupted in         HoxaPax compound mutants                    Results                  Thymocyte proliferation patterns are different in          fetal and adult wild type mice          As an initial analysis we compared thymocyte          proliferation between thymocytes from late fetal E          and adult  week wild type CBLJ mice Although          differences in the proliferation of fetal vs adult          TCRexpressing thymocytes and have been reported              we were interested in investigating the more immature          thymocyte subsets BrdU labeled fetal and adult thymi          were analyzed for the percent of proliferating cells in          different CD   TN thymocyte subsets defined by CD          and CD expression     The CD   population was          defined by costaining of all three markers Fig A A          typical analysis of the BrdU cells in DP cells and the          four CD vs CD subsets within the TN cell population          is shown in Figure  Compiled data for each subset from          all experiments is shown in Table           The wild type adult Fig C F and fetal Fig D          F thymocyte proliferation profile patterns differed          significantly at specific stages The overall          proliferation level in TN cells was increased by  in          fetal thymocytes p   Most dramatically the          percentages of BrdU cells in fetal thymocytes were          fold higher than in the adult at the earliest TN          CD   thymocyte differentiation stage P            A much lower but still significant increase was          seen in fetal TN cells  increase p            Proliferation was also significantly higher at the fetal          TN stage compared to adult  increase p            Proliferation at the TNpreDP CD   stage was          similar between fetal and adult thymocytes In contrast          DP cells showed a fold increase in proliferation in the          fetal thymus relative to adult p   Therefore          nearly every stage from the earliest TN to the DP stages          showed significantly increased proliferation in fetal          thymocytes relative to adults          It was possible that the lower percentage of          proliferating cells seen in the TN population in adults          was due to an increased number of B cells and NK cells in          the adult thymus which would not have been excluded in          our initial analysis As this was one of the most          striking differences seen between fetal and adult stages          we repeated this analysis adding antibodies against B          and NK to CD  and  in the excluded gate Fig G          H Even excluding these cell populations there is          still a significantly lower percentage of proliferating          cells in the TN population in the adult thymus than in          the fetal thymus Fig I Therefore this difference is          not due to different numbers of B and NK cells in the          adult vs fetal thymus                          Rag fetal thymocytes have a stagespecific          increase in proliferation relative to wild type          We also compared proliferation of fetal thymocytes          from           Rag mice to the results          obtained from wild type mice Thymocytes in the adult           Rag thymus have been previously          shown to have overall lower levels of proliferation than          adult wild type TN thymocytes     particularly at          the TN stage        At fetal stages our          results showed that proliferation also varied between          thymocytes in the wild type and           Rag thymus at discrete stages          of thymocyte differentiation At the earliest TN stage          thymocyte proliferation levels in           Rag thymi were similar to fetal          wild type cells Fig E F Table  At the TN stage          fetal thymocytes from           Rag mice had a proliferation          level nearly twice that of wild type fetal thymocytes p            By the TN stage the percentage of          proliferating           Rag thymocytes had dropped          slightly below that of wild type fetal thymocytes           decrease p   equal to wild type adult TN          proliferation levels In addition the percentages of          BrdU cells in TN and TN subsets in the           Rag fetal thymus were          significantly higher than those of the wild type adults          P   These results with           Rag fetal thymocytes contrast          with thymocytes in the           Rag adult which have much lower          proliferation than wild type adult thymocytes at all          stages of thymocyte differentiation                              Thymocyte proliferation in Hoxa  Pax          thymocytes at the TNDP transition          Our previous analysis of the           Hoxa            Pax compound mutant thymocyte          phenotype showed a specific partial block at the TN to DP          transition associated with increased apoptosis at both          the TNpreDP and DP subsets and a fold decrease in          DP cell numbers     Using BrdU analysis we compared          the proliferation of           Hoxa            Pax fetal thymocytes during the          TN to DP transition compared to littermate controls          Thymocyte proliferation levels for all genotypes            Hoxa            Pax            Pax  and           Hoxa            Pax  were similar to wild type          in all of the canonical TNTN stages Fig ABC          Table  consistent with the normal percentages and cell          numbers for these subpopulations previously reported              Recent papers by Penit et al have provided data          from cell cycle analysis suggesting that a discrete CD           lopopulation with a specific proliferation profile          can be identified such that the transition from TN to          DP can be further subdivided into CD hi CD lo and          CD subsets      Analysis of proliferation using          these more narrowly defined subsets still showed values          similar to wild type in the CD  losubset Fig          DEF Table  In contrast the proliferation level          of DP cells increased nearly fold in compound mutants          compared to wild type Fig C F Table  In spite of          this increase in the percentage of proliferating cells          the actual number of BrdU DP cells was reduced fold          compared to wild type in the compound mutants               vs      in wild type p            The numbers of proliferating cells at the preDP          stage were unchanged not shown Combined with our          previous results this result shows that both increased          apoptosis and reduced proliferation contribute to the          decrease in DP cells in the           HoxaPax compound mutants          Unfortunately           Hoxa            Pax mice die at birth          preventing analysis of thymocyte proliferation in adult          compound mutants                          Cytokine production is decreased in the Hoxa           Pax fetal thymus          Cytokines produced by TECs are good candidates for          mediating at least some of these changes in thymocyte          proliferation and apoptosis in the           HoxaPax compound mutants Using          semiquantitative RTPCR we analyzed the expression of          two cytokines that are produced by TECs IL and SCF in          pooled genotypematched E thymi Fig            Hoxa            Pax compound mutants had          decreased transcription of both cytokines relative to all          other genotypes including           Pax single mutants However           Hoxa            Pax compound mutants were not          completely missing either cytokine analyzed and the          magnitude of the decrease was variable between pools          To test whether the changes in cytokine levels were          responsible for the observed thymocyte development          phenotypes we attempted to rescue these phenotypes by          supplementation in fetal thymic organ culture FTOC          E embryonic thymic lobes from individual embryos were          cultured separately in FTOC with or without added IL          or SCF Cultures from control genotypes wild type           Pax            Hoxa            Pax  behaved as expected                   with addition of IL causing an          increase in the percentage of DN cells and a          corresponding decrease in DP cells while adding SCF had          no significant effect on thymocyte development data not          shown However to our surprise the two separated lobes          from           Hoxa            Pax compound mutants did not          always develop in predictable ways In fact separated          lobes cultured under identical conditions in the absence          of any added cytokines had widely differing results          Changes in thymocyte cell number and differentiation          after culture were highly variable for example cell          numbers could differ stochastically after culture by as          much as fold between two lobes from the same compound          mutant embryo This result was never obtained with          separately cultured thymic lobes from any other genotype          which always developed identically when cultured without          cytokines This property of the compound mutant thymic          lobes probably reflects phenotypic variability previously          seen in our histological and gross morphological analysis          of these mutants                                 Discussion        In this study we have examined thymocyte proliferation        in the fetal and adult wild type thymus Our results showed        clear stagespecific differences in wild type thymocyte        proliferation depending on the developmental age of the        microenvironment ie fetal vs adult We also analyzed        two mutant strains that have either cellautonomous          Hoxa          Pax  or noncellautonomous          Rag  TEC defects with blocks at        different stages of thymocyte differentiation Abnormal TEC        development in both of these mutant strains resulted in        both increases and decreases in thymocyte proliferation in        a stagespecific manner rather than simply an overall        reduced ability to promote proliferation        There is considerable evidence that thymopoiesis differs        in the fetal thymus during the initial creation of the        microenvironment as opposed to adult thymus function        reviewed in     Differences have been reported in        responses to some cytokines in signaling at the TNDP        transition in fetal compared to adult thymus and in        proliferation of CD SP thymocytes        The        proliferation profiles of both wild type and         Rag fetal thymocytes support the        hypothesis that fetal thymocyte maturation is fundamentally        different from thymocyte development in the adult thymus        The TN and DP stages both show increased proliferation in        wildtype fetal thymocytes compared to adults This        difference at the TN stage is not due to the presence of        more B or NK cells in the adult thymus Although it is        formally possible that some other cell type may still be        included in our TN population this analysis strongly        suggests that TN cells have different proliferation        profiles in fetal and adult thymus        It has been well documented that thymocytes in adult         Rag or         Rag mutants have dramatically        reduced proliferation compared to wild type particularly        at the TN stage        and Penit et al        reported  fold reductions at every stage of thymocyte        development in         Rag adults     Recent work by        Petrie et al has shown that this reduced proliferation is        not intrinsic to         Rag mutant thymocytes but rather is        secondary to thymic microenvironment defects in         Rag mutants     Our results show        that at fetal stages         Rag mutant thymocytes have a        proliferation profile that is much more similar to wild        type thymocytes at the same stage with less than a fold        difference in the percentage of proliferating cells at any        stage For example TN stage thymocytes in the         Rag adult thymus have        proliferation levels fold below wild type thymus             while in the         Rag fetal thymus TN cells are        only  lower than in wild type fetal thymus        Proliferation is not changed at all stages and is actually        increased relative to wild type at the TN stage This        increase at the TN stage may be due to the failure of TN        cells to initiate TCR gene rearrangement at this stage        which is normally associated with decreased proliferation         Rag mutants have a profound        thymocyte development block at the TN to TNpreDP        transition     During normal wild type fetal thymus        development significant DP cell development does not occur        until E in most genetic backgrounds As a result at        E the thymic microenvironment in         Rag mutants has not been exposed to        abnormal thymocyte development for very long and has not        yet developed the full phenotype seen in the steady state        adult         Rag mutant thymus            In the         HoxaPax compound mutants        cellautonomous TEC defects cause a partial block at the        DNDP transition so thymocytes do progress to DP and SP        stages albeit at reduced frequencies     TEC defects        are seen as early as E in these mutants from the        earliest stages of organogenesis     Therefore the        TEC defects in these mice would be expected to have        different effects on thymocyte proliferation than in         Rag mutants In this study we found        stagespecific changes in thymocyte proliferation at the DP        stage Our previous analysis reported decreased DP cell        number and increased apoptosis in both the preDP and DP        stages in these mutants     DP cell numbers in both        this and our previous study were decreased fold in the         Hoxa          Pax compound mutants At first        glance the increase in the percentage of proliferating        cells at the DP stage appears contradictory to this        phenotype However this increase actually corresponds to        decreased numbers of proliferating DP cells compared to        wild type In contrast preDP cells did not have a change        in the number or percentage of proliferating cells        suggesting that the signals promoting proliferation of        these cells is still present and that proliferation of DP        and preDP cells may be regulated independently PreDP        cells do have a threefold increase in apoptosis            suggesting that separate signals regulate proliferation and        survival of these cells Combined with our previous data        this result suggests that the decrease in DP cell numbers        seen in the         HoxaPax compound mutants is both        due to an increase in the number of preDP and DP cells        undergoing apoptosis as well as a decrease in the number of        proliferating DP        Insufficiencies of multiple cytokines might be involved        in the changes in proliferation and cell death at the CD         and DP stages in         HoxaPax compound mutants SCF and        IL are first expressed as early as E in the        developing thymus well before significant thymocyte        maturation takes place      Although the number of        TECs is reduced by about fold in         Hoxa          Pax compound mutants the number        of thymocytes is reduced by a slightly greater amount        around fold     Therefore the reductions seen in        cytokine message levels in the         Hoxa          Pax compound mutants are not        secondary to decreased TEC numbers In fact these mutants        should have a relative increase in the proportion of TECs        making the reductions seen in cytokine levels in the mutant        thymi even more striking The reduced expression of these        cytokines in         Hoxa          Pax compound mutants could be an        indirect effect of defective TEC differentiation or could        be direct downstream targets since both         Hoxa and         Pax are expressed in fetal thymus             Comparison of the         Hoxa          Pax phenotype with those of        cytokine mutants do not reveal many similarities                   probably because of the simultaneous        reductions in multiple cytokines in the         Hoxa          Pax mutants For example SCF and        IL have been shown to have synergistic functions             Therefore changes in multiple cytokines in         Hoxa          Pax mutants would be expected to        have complex effects on thymocyte development that could be        difficult to predict        Interpretation of the observed phenotype is further        complicated by the fact that none of the cytokines tested        are completely absent A striking example is the complete        absence of TCR thymocyte development in IL mutants in        contrast to normal TCR cell development in         Hoxa          Pax mutants     which have        dramatically reduced IL levels This result suggests that        although TCR cell development requires IL low levels        are sufficient for this function Therefore analysis of        mutants with low levels of cytokines may provide a system        for uncovering both dosagedependent requirements and later        functions for these factors in promoting thymocyte        development It is also possible that some of the        differences seen between         Hoxa          Pax and cytokine mutant        phenotypes reflect different effects of cytokines at fetal        and adult stages Studies of ILR mutants showed        relatively normal thymocyte maturation at fetal stages        albeit with reduced thymocyte numbers in contrast to a        severe block in thymocyte differentiation in adult thymus            Analysis of cytokine mutants during fetal stages        could therefore reveal a more complete picture of the role        of these cytokines during fetal thymus development                    Conclusions        Our results show that fetal and adult wild type        thymocytes have stagespecific differences in        proliferation with both TN and DP cells exhibiting higher        levels of proliferation in fetal thymus This fetal        wildtype profile was very similar to that seen for fetal         Rag mutant thymocytes in contrast to        adult         Rag thymus Therefore the changes        in proliferation seen in the fetal         Rag mutant thymocytes reflect the        earliest microenvironment changes occurring as a result of        defective TECthymocyte interactions in the         Rag thymus        The current study further supports a role for TECs in        regulating both thymocyte proliferation and survival during        the DNDP transition and suggests that proliferation and        apoptosis of TN and DP cells are regulated independently        Our results provide direct genetic evidence for these        functions of TECs by showing that these processes are        defective in mutants with a primary TEC differentiation        defect the         HoxaPax compound mutants Taken        together our results further define the role TECs play at        this complex stage of thymocyte development                    Methods                  Mice and genotyping                    Hoxa            Pax mice were mated to           Pax or           Pax mice and genotyped for both                    Hoxa and           Pax by PCR as described previously              Comparisons were made between littermates from          the same colony           Rag mice Jackson Labs were          maintained as a homozygous mutant colony All mice were          maintained as congenic on a CBL genetic background          Noon of the day of vaginal plug was considered E
