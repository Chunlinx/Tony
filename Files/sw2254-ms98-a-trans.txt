                so what type of restaurant do you like   basically well im a vegetarian um and my husband is kosher so if do you know what that means kosher okay so a a lot of the restaurants we select are um   uhhuh umhum yeah   based on the variety of food i dont particularly like to sort of American you know meat and potatoes type of restaurants   uhhuh yeah   um i i love ethnic foods i love um Chinese Indian Tai   yeah now do Indian are Indian foods kosher   well as long as youre not eating meat um its to be kosher the meat would have to be kosher   uhhuh right   and um most Indian places dont have a rabbi the places that we eat  right so um   i i was about to say i didnt think so but most of the most of the  the vegetarian Indian meals   yeah exactly vegetables and and the same with you know a lot of people wonder do you you know do you find restaurants that will just have vegetarian meals and and even   uhhuh umhum   if like you know you could go to a Chinese restaurant and eat the right um Italian you know that   oh definitely Chinese would uhhuh umhum yeah because pastas and the and the different types of sauces and things sure yeah   right yeah and even um one of my favorites is El Toritos i dont know if you have that its Mexican its like a ChiChis   which is of what no we dont have one uhhuh you know my wife and you would probably love to go eat together yeah oh definitely well everytime when we go someplace they have to have good French fries   really why oh yeah   if they dont have good French fries you know if its one of if its a place that has other things if its not that then we go to Chinese food you know i order     umhum umhum   you know a beef and broccoli or chicken or chicken and broccoli or something like that you know chicken and cashews and she orders um bean curd   oh really uhhuh oh tofu   and and vegetables right  you know so um you two would probably eat real well together   umhum we certainly would if if   uhhuh yeah she she normally picks all of our restaurants though yeah   oh does she now do you guys like to go out for sort of fine dining or are you more uh   well we really cant we really dont do that that often um i i guess recently we did um   umhum   i get when we got engaged last summer um we went for fine dining because we were sort of celebrating and we went to the Annapolis area which is um   uhhuh umhum right     Annapolis Maryland it its uh state capital but its also on the water so theres a lot of restaurants there its uh its a um   oh      very trendy resort type town but the my wife lived in Annapolis for a short time and uh she really liked this one restaurant it was its French   uhhuh oh   but it was really good everything that was very garlicky and their big specials are things like um very fancy omelets or very fancy crepes   umhum crepes yeah   and then they also have a lot of other uh French oriented uh meals and i normally get something thats crepe and very American and then she gets something French yeah but um yeah but   yeah  so shes the daring one in the family as far as food goes   yeah definitely definitely yeah but most of the time when we go out um we either go Mexican because uh uh she just has a a need for either some type of Mexican chips or Mexican pizza or something like that or French fries   umhum umhum umhum   you have to you have to have French fries with just about every meal unless youre eating something other you know some other uh   unless youre eating like a baked potato or something   right yeah in fact um since Baltimore i see im not a  you dont know the Baltimore Baltimores on the water and what   yeah i was i was wondering if you guys eat a lot of fish um yeah   um yes yeah we just had salmon last night for dinner uh but also the spices here um old bay is a spice i dont know if youre even aware of it its what they used on the   uhhuh   no   uh if you ever hear of the Maryland steamed crabs   sure yeah i have heard of that   okay well old bay is the spice they put on the steamed crabs well true male Marylander Marylander Marylanders have have old bay on just about everything they put it on their French fries theyll put it in their potato salad theyll um   umhum umhum oh really     theyll theyll put it with just my wife loves old bay with everything so if we have French fries they have to have they have to have old bay on them   i see its sort of like some people and ketchup yeah   right yeah yeah well see i i grew up in Pittsburgh uh where Heinz ketchup is and my family is big ketchup yeah   uhhuh oh really oh wow well you know i have a problem because i tend to find a restaurant and being on a on a tighter budget you know we dont go out to eat that much so once i find a restaurant i only want to go there   umhum right yeah uhhuh   and ill go there for you know two months straight we wont go anyplace else   umhum yeah we do the same   and then you know i finally get sick of that one and then ill find another restaurant i love salad bar restaurants because um   uhhuh   i find that when you order a salad at a restaurant you dont really get a salad you get like lettuce and you know what i mean and the croutons   no you get a couple yeah couple yeah its not a real meal   exactly but a salad bar thats thats my favorite i mean if because i just feel like i can make my own meal and theres usually a lot of fun stuff and obviously its a lot of vegetables but um   umhum um   yeah were the same because im in graduate school and were living off her salary   umhum yeah i know what thats like uhhuh   and my and my parttime work you know its not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where actually we live you know where my where ill return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under fourteen dollars     umhum oh thats good   and thats you know thats the two of us having unlimited unlimited French fries   thats very good     and uh it may be a Mexican pizza sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when shes having French fries   uhhuh umhum oh really   then i ill order like a vegetable soup or something you know but shell just have the French fries you know   now is she does she like um McDonalds French fries oh okay   no no in fact in were very environmental so we very rarely eat at any of the fastfood restaurants uh just because of the um the styrofoam and the plastic waste   oh umhum umhum yep   and whatever we very rarely will eat at a uh a fastfood restaurant i will ill eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the road more   well thats great it just more yeah i know what you mean   but um yeah but she will she almost refuses you know to do that in fact were at a point now where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store   yeah   we save the same plastic container and we yeah we take it with us back to the store and bring it home yeah and we take yeah   oh do you but still uhhuh well you know its funny that you say that because um our grocery store uh i personally i think the grocery stores in Rochester are very theyll allow you to bring your own like um Tupperware thing like your own container   umhum yeah   to fill it up i think thats great and you weigh your container you know and then you weigh your salad after that   uhhuh well thats a really good idea   it really is i was very happy about that because i  you know i feel the same way you do   yeah umhum yeah we weve used the same uh you know tin bottom with plastic top   umhum   probably for the past oh i dont know six months   oh thats great that really is good   yeah so so were very you know we try to be very environmental and and in fact its terrible now because um i guess weve donated money to a number of organizations and you know were in school im in school and were   umhum   barely surviving here and and we get calls now from like World Wildlife Federation like demanding a hundred dollars   yeah oh jeez oh man   yeah and when you say but were in college uh were in graduate school we cant afford that you know they they say well how about twenty seven well how about ten you know yeah so     great how to say no  and your like youll do your own part you know you can do without necessarily spending much umhum yeah   uhhuh yeah we do all we can now but that it it you know i think that also goes along uh the reason why we pick the restaurants that we go to you know we we really have we really look at restaurants now theres one other little restaurant in town that well go to that is um   yep yep   sandwiches and chips and a pickle you know but you still and thats five fifty   uhhuh     but if you go to a fastfood restaurant youre going to spend four fifty and youre going to produce a lot of styrofoam and a lot of plastic so we you know well go there instead of you know just going to a fastfood place   yep a lot more waste yeah umhum that true uhhuh well i i dont usually resort to fast food um if i do i feel like its a salad or something at McDonalds but i do rely on pizza a lot   uhhuh yeah i do too   um i mean to me either ordering in or just going to Pizza Hut or something   umhum   is like gourmet  i mean i just you know what i mean its just fun its convenient um uh the uh i dont know if youve ever heard of Pizzaria   yeah i i agree yeah yeah no uhhuh   okay well they just theyll do everything with pizzas as a matter of fact last night we just went there and they have a great pizza called Spinoccoli and what it is is um normal pizza but then with spinach and broccoli   oh oh   and its really really good and i feel like   jeez ill tell Laura ill tell Laura about that   yeah tell her about that um and i feel like im getting a little bit more health out of that pizza then maybe just well i wouldnt eat pepperoni but you know sausage or something like that but um   uhhuh umhum umhum yeah thats because my thats really see because a lot of times well order a pizza well just get a regular cheese pizza or um uh for we just recently got married so my wife   so i uhhuh     got a uh a heavy duty mixer like a KitchenAid or something like that its called so shes make she makes dough pizza dough and freezes it   uhhuh umhum oh yeah   and then takes it out before i get home for the weekend because pizzas probably one of my favorite most favorite food yeah and shell make that for the weekend and shell make you know well have two pizzas mine will be regular tomatoes and um   really   mozzarella and Monterey jack cheese you know sprinkled on it and hers will be you know something   umhum   uh more gourmet but more you know with yeah more with what you like and i i she loves broccoli and spinach and i think uh she i dont think shes ever probably thought of that   cashews or something like that right umhum well Spinoccoli she cant patent the idea though because Pizza Inn already already has it but its a its very good well they put it they i guess they put like the dough and then the sauce and then   uhhuh yeah so its its just regular its just tomatoes uhhuh
