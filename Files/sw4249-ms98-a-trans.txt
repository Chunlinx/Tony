                well um i live at the beach and   yeah   and we dont really have a lot of recycling here   well yeah   but you have do you have a lot in Rochester     we have a lot of recycling in Rochester they do uh what they call curb side pick up   okay   and so they come by and theyll pick up uh the newspapers and cardboard and uh different colors of glass and uh see what else tin cans and uh plastic like you know your milk jugs and you know soap soap soap bottle uh jugs and all that type of stuff   oh so they just pick up everything   yeah so do they do any uh any sort of recycling back down where you are   well i think they do some voluntary on the beach but i live in apartments and we dont have it here   umhum okay   um in Wilmington they have it there more i think and thats like the big town near us   umhum   but um i really wish they would have it   okay do uh i mean what do you think they ought to be doing down there in terms of doing more recycling and things like that   well sometimes i dont feel so bad i mean its really i mean it this is really sad too because we have a big dumpster at our apartments and theres this little man that goes through our trash all the time to get the cans out   umhum oh wow thats really unfortunate   i know   well they do a whole lot of recycling here in Rochester im kind of hard pressed to say they ought to do more because i dont know what else theyd pick up i mean you know they they say things like you know they want all the little uh you know those little recycling symbols like the number ones and the number twos and all those things   uhhuh   well they you know they say theyll pick up anything with number two but they guys who are uh picking it up are are kind of  i dont know i guess they arent well trained because like they say they also say they wont pick up you know the you know like you buy a uh uh uh a six pack of pop and you know the plastic rings that they come in   uhhuh uhhuh   well nowadays those are coming with a little recycling symbol on them you know with the number two but they wont pick it up because they say well no we dont pick up that we only pick up you know like the milk jugs and soap jugs and stuff like that so i think they could be doing more if they here in Rochester if they just uh quit doing uh you know so much based on what the container is in terms on what used to have in it or something and if they did more on you know what the material is   yeah   so uh i dont know so they dont do any recycling hardly at all down there   well i mean they do some but none of its mandatory   yeah   and like i said i live in an apartment complex   umhum   and so they dont do it for us   okay   but some of the houses ive seen some of the bins around some of the houses   okay well do you have any place you could take stuff if you wanted to   there is a place but its in Wilmington   okay   and so its like a a big hassle you know to try to get everything together and i mean uh youd have to save it up and have all that stuff lying around your apartment   yeah yeah well thats wild i mean like well how far is Wilmington from there   its um about twenty minutes   oh wow so youd have to get everything together and take it over there thatd be a real pain they ought to do the curb side stuff   umhum i know but i just think its it must be hard to do in an apartment thing like this   they do it here i mean they they have it here in Rochester in the apartments and people you know they have to do some special stuff but you know the apartment complex its not the city see here in Rochester the city does it   really umhum   it would like i i own my own house so the city comes by and they pick up you know the stuff on the same day they pick up the trash but for the apartments all the apartment places you know pay somebody to pick up all the trash and so the apartment people you know the the the waste disposal people have to come up with their own system but we passed a law here and they said you just got to do it theres no choice because all the you know all the landfills up here are full   yeah now see that i think thats why its not as strict in the south its because we still have have a lot of land left   yeah oh wow   so i mean but i mean people do need to realize that that theres not always going to be land   but thats going to change yeah yeah thats going to change at some point you know  a couple of years ago nobody around here talked about it and then one day everybody just kind of woke up and said gee you know were were in trouble and we got to fix this problem   umhum but i know i went to see my brother in Philadelphia in May and he   yeah   was in a voluntary program   umhum
