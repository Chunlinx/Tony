        okay well       i dont exercise on a regular basis i think about it a lot       but i chase an eighteen month old and i think if i do much else im gonna fall over   well isnt that the truth   so thats um i like exercising i feel good when i do it but i find it real hard to fit it into a schedule   well i just started going back to aerobics   uhhuh   its three times a week and it just the minute you get off work you got to run over there change clothes   umhum   do that come home take a bath you know get cleaned up and theres always people at our house   yeah   and things going on and it its hard its hard to fit it in and im not one of these that loves aerobics anyway   oh yeah no   were going snow skiing in March so im wanting to get in shape before we went so that i wouldnt just fall over dead   umhum   up there but i thought as soon as this is over i am quitting       i just   its not going to last long huh   no and i you feel good after you you know you work out but its always a mental chore for me to get psyched up to go   yeah   but once i get there im all right   yeah well now i did find uh a video that i really liked and i just cant quite convince myself its worth paying for yet       and it was Richard Simmons Sweating to the Oldies   oh i know i saw that i want that   its a lot of fun my son likes it   oh youre kidding   no my girlfriend and i used to work out to it right before Christmas and we put him in her playpen at her house and he thought that was the funniest thing to watch us dancing around because its more like just dancing     it is   than anything else   yeah and the but the fact that all the movements that they do are exactly what you need to but the fact that its songs that you like and movements that are not so hard   yeah well thats true and the only other thing about that was that they werent maybe songs that i was real familiar with   umhum   but i could feel it it it wasnt that you couldnt feel that it was working   umhum   because im out of shape and i could feel it working but i enjoyed what i was doing so much that it was pretty much one of those i didnt care that i was really working out   yeah thats the only video i have even considered buying   well and its one of three he has Sweating To The Oldies Two and Three and i havent seen the other two but i really think theyd be a lot of fun to have   i think so i think theyre around twenty dollars apiece arent they yeah   yes even at a discount store ive looked at them and theyre about eighteen ninety for one of them so uh thats why i say i cant quite   umhum     i cant see paying some one to enjoy watching me sweat and uh not and not enjoy myself     i know   that was the other thing about working out   i have a friend that lives in Dallas and she every day goes to some gym and they work out on all kinds of machines and the whole bit and i just thought you must be kidding   uhhuh um   and then they got to a while theyd go before work may be work out for an hour i thought yall are eaten up with it just  yeah just eaten up with it but theyre young and theyre single and   oh youre kidding you people are crazy oh well theres half of it right there   that kind of stuff umhum and i said well thats whats the matter with you get married and you wont care     have those babies and it changes   really i dont have any children i all my friends do ive got one that the minute she had the baby she lost every bit of the weight   uhhuh   uhhuh   and was right back a skinny little thing again and i thought you make me sick   yeah oh i agree i agree   but shes young shes about twenty twenty two   uhhuh   and i thought well thats what it is youre just youre just a child   well thats a part of it i bet because im well im twenty nine now i just turned twenty nine       and i havent lost hardly anything and my sons a year and a half   umhum some people i dont know ive got another friend that im twenty nine and shes twenty nine after she had her son she said i was just too busy to eat she she had a two year old and then she had a had another one and she says i just dont have time to eat she says i one im fooling with one and then im fooling with the other one     wrong     and she said i just at night time i think boy i dont think ive had anything eat today   well theres no way no theres no way i i make time to eat   and thats how she lost hers yeah well really   because when he particularly his age now  he and i eat the same things and if im not eating he doesnt eat very well   umhum   so   umhum   i have to eat   well yeah   you did so good on the others you keep doing that one       hes stripping Crayolas   uhhuh   yeah   that was always fun   oh yeah well what else were we supposed to talk about oh why were motivated to do what we do   oh   and your motivation was your ski trip   yeah were just getting in shape for ski trip   uhhuh   my husband  is
