                uh being a former drug user   whoa   i uh id i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it   uhhuh   uh because i know that uh in using drugs i was not a good employee   uhhuh   and so i can see from the companys standpoint that there  uh whenever you are an employee of the company you are using its assets and uh and but youre also under their liability under the Workmens Comp   uhhuh   uh on my job we had a lot of Workmens Comp cases and   where do you work   uh i work for a tire company Modern Tire and uh its also a retreading plant and thats where most of our uh injuries occur   oh uhhuh   and what we do is well have a drug test if if an if a a boy or a man uh has an accident then hes automatically uh given a drug trest   right do they do it like you know within hours of the accident or is it   yes when he goes to the doctor the first time   yeah   and so that kind of uh i dont know if its been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so   uhhuh yeah   now weve let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i dont know how TEC would handle it they havent pursued it you know   uhhuh   uh if theres some uh problem i know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines and he went to a a separate drug testing firm and they showed it negative   yeah   so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know   huh yeah yeah i think thats probably true too thats thats thats sort of scary   uhhuh really and then i also had a friend who was uh just around some people that were smoking cocaine and he tested positive on cocaine now then you always wonder well is he just saying that you know   yeah yeah  yeah really really     yeah   yeah thats thats a bad situation i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that i think they should   umhum yeah uhhuh   im a TI employee and and and uh im im really gung ho for it in fact   uhhuh   i you know some of the places now um like IBM dont allow even smoking you know in the in the plant we we have designated smoking areas   uhhuh right yeah   but um i work in sort of a building thats thats not really it well its on the campus of the TI facility but its a little bit you know separated we lease the building and its mainly its a factory environment   uhhuh   and uh they they have designated smoking but its just wide open its not ventilated properly and i think thats bad but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   i think its a its a definite i think its essential   yeah because youre endangering everybodys lives if youve if its something like that   yeah in fact weve had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years and uh   uhhuh   i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know they never they never called me they never you know       then finally the day we declared war was my time   youre kidding   no  and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think and i told him hes obviously in a high risk group         the executives right   right right and of course you know they they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they  were going to do all them first     the executives   but uhhuh   yeah wouldnt that be awful if you were   which i thought was interesting   if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything   oh man yeah ooh yeah   i cant believe id was so brazen before im like i say im a former drug user but uh i i   uhhuh   well uh i accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and so i dont use drugs any more   what kind of drugs did you use if you dont mind   uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines   wow   um yes       uhhuh and all on the job too you know it had gotten that bad   really well its really lucky that you got away from that cause thats   really its its life is so much more enjoyable   really downward spiral   uhhuh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know   yeah yeah thats thats it   i mean you know theres all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing   yeah just life in general   uhhuh thats right   yeah well im well im definitely for it   yeah   plus you know you you want to think that that youre working with people who are not only putting out their fair share   thats right   but that are not endangering your life in some cases like uh my husband uh several years back worked for Motorola   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and they had you know i mean it was a chemical handling type   oh goodness   yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing   yeah yeah   and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals   oh my gosh   and thats really thats really frightening so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know   yeah uhhuh   on on a on a greater frequency than maybe just you know the paper pushers like like i am   right well i would think they would be   well you well youd think so but uh   but they werent   i dont know if they do it until yet   isnt that awful   because when he was at course now its been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at TI i forgot what i guess it was like eighty four   uhhuh uhhuh   eighty five something like that and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever   yeah huh   so thats scary   yeah thats reminds me of uh i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time       and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh hes the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff   oh Lord oh   and i just you know went oh where   yeah should we move   let me move as far away as possible   ooh   yeah   thats awful   but im proud though that that um you know i grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and   uhhuh yeah yeah   they really have a good campaign for the young people you know they know its not smart so   uhhuh yeah   so i guess it was just a generational thing   yeah peer group is the other way now instead of   umhum thats right and thats good thats the best way to stop it   uhhuh thats yeah that it really is   yeah well i think we did it   okay well i enjoyed tack talking to you Cathy byebye   its good talking to you yeah byebye
