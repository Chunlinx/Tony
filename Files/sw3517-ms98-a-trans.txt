        okay     okay i guess were ready to start well i guess what part of  what part of the country do you live in oh okay well im also in Dallas   im in Dallas Texas what about yourself okay   the reason i ask is the last two conversations ive had or have been out of state   uhhuh   but um  have you always lived here in Dallas and   no ive lived here for almost five years now   i see   and im a uh before that i was at school in Rochester New York and im originally from Boston   oh well you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood   thats right but i like it   you probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow   well i missed it at first but now i go back there and im a real wimp about the cold  so i like it here its nice   yeah well thats good i i have lived in Texas essentially all my life and around in Texas and and   umhum   uh i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it but uh   umhum   i dont know im not sure i would want to take on those winters im getting older and   i know   uh not sure thats really something i wanna do       i live uh over in the Lake Highlands area if youre familiar with that area   yeah um tell me where that is um   okay uh you   i probably do know but i dont know by that name   this is pretty well where LBJ and Audelia Skillman cross   okay sure   were just north of uh White Rock Lake   oh okay yeah i know that area thats a nice area   well we have some very nice house homes here in this area um my particular i guess they want us to describe the area so um my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million   uhhuh oh thats quite a range   yes um the homes that were here earlier  were smaller now theyve gotten larger and larger as       as theyve developed the land and of course its pretty static right now and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy   uhhuh yeah   how about you   well i am um im gosh im barely in Dallas im just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway   okay uh okay   and i guess we have a similar situation i mean weve got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand and then weve got Bent Tree right across the street   umhum okay   so i dont i dont even know how high those go but some of those are pretty big   yes those are over a million   yeah  so its thats the strange thing about i guess Dallas because back where im from you wouldnt have that sort of a variation at all theyd all be pretty similar to one another within a a couple miles so   well we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas not as bad as Houston   yeah   but  exactly what youre describing is what happens all over   umhum       yeah ive noticed that   well now do you live in a a home or a zero lot home or   umhum uh weve got a house lets see we moved in about four years ago and it was it had previously been unoccupied but it had existed for three years this is a whole block of homes that uh a builder built all of them and i guess he he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away   okay      type of deal so the whole block was all foreclosed   oh   and so some were vacant for quite a while before they you know they finally sold them because there were so many   well your was your house in good shape was it damaged   yeah no the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because theyd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open   oh it was oh   but uh yeah so we just you know we bargained to get an extra warranty on that   i see   and um were really we havent had any problems and you know we had originally thought wed have to get a fix up special or something because being from the Northeast we figured we couldnt afford anything but the prices are much lower here and this was definitely not a fix up special but ill tell you it takes all my time between we put in our own sprinkler system and i just finished repainting the exterior and you know making drapes and buying furniture its just a money pit really is   yes i   so   am familiar with that i where i live is a house thats seventeen years old when i bought it   uhhuh   and we bought it from someone who was in it but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it had it had sat empty for the better part of a year   uhhuh   and im not sure what happened but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for for about four years   oh no   i i i found a lot of things which
