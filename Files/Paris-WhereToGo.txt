Where To GoGetting AroundThe first thing you should get is a carnet or book of ten mtro tickets good for buses too Or better still if youre staying a week or more one of the special passes which give even greater savings see page  Then buy a Museum Pass see page  to save money and avoid waiting at ticket countersTo get your bearings picture Paris as a circle with the river Seine threading across the center flanked by famous landmarksNotreDame the Louvre place de la Concorde Arc de Triomphe the Tour Eiffel Bridges link the Right north and Left Banks via the two islands in the middle Ile de la Cit and Ile StLouisThis is one of the easiest of large cities to travel around The modernized mtro system is smooth regular and fast with low flatrate fares RER commuter trains can also take you rapidly to the outskirts where two major attractions Versailles and the Disneyland Paris Resort are locatedBuses give you a sightseeing tour at a bargain price respecting schedules as far as traffic allows rush hours can create terrible jams Taxis provide a lazy alternative but are not always faster than the mtro especially on longer rides across townBus tours take you to the big attractions but inevitably at times when they are busiest Some tour buses that take you around the highlights let you hop on and off wherever and as often as you like all on one ticket for a period of up to  hours Tourist information offices see page  have details Bicycle rental companies see page  also run tours If you want to sightsee in style and expensively you can even see Paris from a helicopter plane or hotair balloon Inline skates have become very popular for touring the town and can also be rented see page Parisians themselves often use the Batobus river bus for traveling east or west and avoiding traffic snarls It runs from May to September stops are at the Tour Eiffel Muse dOrsay Louvre NotreDame and Htel de Ville Its relatively expensive but you may prefer the absence of commentaryA boat cruise on the Seine is one of the best introductions to the city While you glide along multilingual commentaries tell you about the sights Boats run from about am to pm Most tour boats provide a choice of openair and glassedin seating some offer lunch and dinner Trips last  to  minutes Canal tours reveal a less grand but more intimate face of Paris on the way from the center to Parc de la Villette see page  in the northeastern outskirts The leisurely trip takes three hours with a tunnel and several locks to be negotiatedCentral Paris is surprisingly compact and most hotels are close to many of the sights So if time isnt a major factor the best way of getting the feel of the place is to walk All you need is a pair of comfortable shoes and a map The big department stores and hotels give away millions of street maps each year Mtro stations display good maps of their local district as well as the mtro itself and give out pocket plans of the mtro and bus routes At street level busstop shelters have an excellent detailed map of the neighborhood More and more streets and entire areas like Les Halles and Beaubourg have been pedestrianized adding to the profusion of parks squares and gardensThe IslandsIle de la CitThis is where Pariss story began Like the emblem on its coat of arms the Ile de la Cit takes the form of a boat with the romantic treeshaded place du Vert Galant as its prow pointing downstream From the first settlement built by the original Parisii until the middle of the th century the pocketsized island lay at the heart of the city The earliest rulers held court here The cathedral clergy and artisans made it their home Then ruthless urban planner Baron Haussmann swept away almost all the medieval and thcentury structures leaving just place Dauphine and rue Chanoinesse ancient home of the cathedral canons as signs of the islands once rich residential lifeThe baron was also toying with the idea of replacing the gracious red brick houses of the triangular place Dauphine with a neoGrecian colonnaded square when thankfully he was forced out of office for juggling the books Near the lively PontNeuf the place was built in  by Henri IV in honor of his son the dauphin or future king Louis XIII Sadly only numbers  and  are still in their original state Number  was the home of film stars Simone Signoret and Yves MontandThe huge Palais de Justice heart of the centralized French legal system stands on the site of the Roman palace where the Emperor Julian was crowned in  Together with the Conciergerie see page  it sprawls right across the Ile de la Cit Concealed in the courtyard between them is a Gothic masterpiece the SainteChapelle whose fine proportions stand in sharp contrast to the ponderous palace The chapel was constructed in  to house holy relics fragments of what were believed to be Jesuss Crown of Thorns and the True Cross which pious Louis IX later canonized as St Louis had bought from the Byzantine emperor Try to arrive as the chapel opens or at sunset see page  and make your way to the upper level where light blazes in through  stainedglass windows separated by buttresses so slim that there seems to be no wall at all Miraculously of the  individual pieces of glass  are thcentury originals The chapel provides an exquisite setting for chamber music concertsBetween  and  the chapel assumed various guises a flour warehouse during the Revolution and a club for highranking dandies then an archive for Napolons Consulate It was this latter role that saved the chapel from projected destruction since the bureaucrats could not think of another site in which to put their mountains of paperThese days they find room for their papers in the Palais de Justice and the nearby Prfecture de Police haunt of those fictional detectives Inspectors Maigret and Clouseau The great lobby of the Palais the Salle des Pas Perdus is worth a visit for a glimpse of the many lawyers plaintiffs witnesses court reporters and assorted hangerson waiting nervously for the wheels of French justice to grind into actionTheir anxiety is nothing compared with that of the prisoners once held in the forbidding Conciergerie entrance on the quai de lHorloge It was originally the residence of the kings concierge as part of the thcentury royal palace In  at the height of the Terror it literally became the antechamber of the guillotine Queen MarieAntoinette Robespierre Danton and SaintJust all spent their last nights in the Galerie des Prisonniers The Salle des Girondins displays a guillotine blade the crucifix to which MarieAntoinette prayed and the lock used on Robespierres cell Look out on the Cour des Femmes where husbands lovers wives and mistresses were allowed one final tryst before the

religious role for at least  years In Roman times a temple to Jupiter stood here some stone fragments unearthed in  can be seen in the Muse du Moyen Age see page  In the fourth century the first Christian church StEtienne was built joined two centuries later by a second church dedicated to NotreDame Norman raids left both in a sorry state and Bishop Maurice de Sully decided a cathedral should be built to replace them Begun in  the main part of NotreDame took  years to finish Its transition from Romanesque to Gothic has been called a perfect representation of medieval architecture an opinion that has ancient and modern dissenters Cistercian monks protested that such a sumptuous structure was an insult to the godly virtue of poverty and today architectural purists still find NotreDame a bit too much It was however built to inspire aweOver its long history the cathedral has witnessed many momentous occasions In  there was the procession of Louis IX barefoot carrying his holy treasure Jesuss Crown of Thorns now in the SainteChapelle in  it saw the humiliation of Henry VI of England he was crowned King of France here see page  And in  it was where Henri IV made his cynical conversion to Catholicism a move that reinforced his hold on the French throne Napolon chose it as the setting for crowning himself emperor upstaging the Pope who had come to Paris expecting to do itIn modern times it has been a place for celebrating victory and mourning the passing of Frances leaders General de Gaulle marked the  Liberation of Paris with a mass here and in  his death was similarly commemorated In  a funeral service was held for de Gaulles archrival Franois Mitterrand hereAcross the three doorways of the west front the  statues of the Galerie des Rois represent the

unknown but Pierre de Montreuil who was involved in the building of SainteChapelle was responsible for a large part of the thcentury work The present state of the cathedral owes much to Eugne ViolletleDuc who from  to  painstakingly restored it following the ravages of the th century caused more by preRevolutionary meddlers than by revolutionaries who stripped it of religious symbols Popular support for the costly restoration was inspired by Victor Hugos novel The Hunchback of NotreDameThe step climb up the north tower is rewarded with wonderful views of Paris and closeups of the

lEtoile the star for the twelve avenues branching out from the center like a star The circular space with its whirling traffic is dominated by the Arc de Triomphe  m  ft high and  m  ft wide A trip to the top by elevator affords spectacular views It is here that you can best appreciate the tour de force of geometric planning the avenues representThe Arc de Triomphe was conceived by Napolon I as a tribute to his armies and bears the names of hundreds of his marshals and generals and dozens of victories No defeats are recorded naturally although a few of the victories are debatable Napolon himself only ever saw a wood and canvas model the arch was completed during the s It soon became the focus for state occasions such as the return of the exemperors own remains from St Helena in  and the funeral of Victor Hugo in  In  the Unknown Soldier of World War I was buried at the arch three years later the eternal flame was lit When Adolf Hitler arrived in Paris as a conqueror in  the Arc de Triomphe was the first place he wanted to see And at the Liberation this was the spot where General de Gaulle commenced his triumphal march down the ChampsElysesAvenue Foch leading away from
