extraordinarily meanspirited joke aboutChelsea Clinton at a recent Republican fundraiser                                       First I wonder if youagree with many members of the press that the joke is in the WashingtonPost s words too vicious to print In my experience vicious thingsreflect more harshly on the person who says them To that end I tend to thinkthat not printing the joke has unfairly spared McCain from a welldeserved kickin the shins from the American public                                       Second I am intrigued by the idea that McCain and Chelsea may bump intoeach other any number of times before her father leaves office How in youropinion should Chelsea conduct herself in the senators presence Im certainthat the apology from McCain to her father has likely left her with no optionbut to treat the senator with respect and courtesy But is there a good way tomake a boorish person squirm without being boorish yourself                                       Puckishly KateWrath                        DearPuck            How nice to hear from youagain Your queries are interesting ones Prudie is in agreement thatwithholding direct quotes by public people often protects the evilsayer fromothers as well as from themselves The mirror image consideration however isthat it is unappetizing to give the offending remark widercirculationespecially when it is insulting to a person of tender yearsReality though must come into play and in cases such as this there willalways be a way for the outr remark to become known Curious readers who wantto see the joke in all its tawdriness can consult Davids Plotzs thoughtfulAssessment of Sen McCain in a recent                   Slate                Alsothe censoring process increases curiosityas when one refuses to answer achilds question            A sidelight that has beengenerally overlooked is that the US attorney general took a double slam inthe senators joke In any case thoughtful people will surely wonder about thejudgment and heart of a man who could publicly denigrate the looks of a youngwoman who has famously conducted herself like a lady And Prudie knows in herheart that McCain is toast as far as the president is concerned Prudie beingold enough to remember Truman and the opera critic            As foryour second thought How should Ms Clinton behave toward the senator whilebeing both correct and shaming My old Midwestern mother taught me the answerto that one years ago Kill em with kindness and they dont know where tolook            Prudie turning theother cheek                                             DearP                                                      My sister her husbandand daughter are spending a few weeks with us We love them all Trouble islittle Alexandra does not know from discipline and I nearly twitch when I seeher talk back to her mom I have bitten my tongue all week but I finally saidsomething to the brat My brotherinlaw then chastised me for beingharsh                                       Irealize that criticizing the kid is criticizing the parent or at least theparenting but somebody should say something to somebody I muttered myapologies to keep the peace but I felt sullied having done so What do youthink                                       Lost in My OwnHouse                        DearLost            Prudie sympathizes with yoursituation And you are indeed correct that admonishing someone elses child isalso a comment on the parenting but inappropriate outbursts by any youngsterinspire most sensitive people to try to interject a little decorum Then toothe outr behavior you describe was taking place at your house allowing you tofeel rightly Prudie thinks that ltat cest moo  Im bossy aroundhere            The oddsare not great but sometimes an outsiders rebuke can serve to wake up theparentsin which case youve done a good turn all around You might evencontinue the discussion with the tyrant tykes folks pointing out thatdiscipline bespeaks love and that the kid will have hells own time if shecontinues speaking to people in such a manner If your one stab at being thekiddie kaiser causes your sister and her husband to invite you to mind your ownbusiness at least you will know that you tried            Prudie civilly                                             DearPrudie                                                      When afriend colleague or loved one stumbles it seems inelegant to ask Are youall right How would you suggest I more properly offer sympathy My bestattempt Is your dignity intact                                       Robert J LedermanAnn Arbor Mich                        DearRob            Prudiesuggests you go back to Are you all right There is something peculiar aboutasking Is your dignity intact unless perhaps dignity is code forderrire in Michigan            Prudie solicitously                                             DearPrudie                                                      Yourresponse to the query about the Zone Diet was rich in common sense and went halfwaytoward torpedoing the trendy useless diet industry The other half is toincrease the calories one burns Theres a timehonored way to do this Itscalled taking a walk How does Prudie feel about exercise as the road to atrimmer slimmer you                                       Gary RenoNev                        DearGary            Of course Prudie agrees thatworking out is the better part of weight loss she just plum forgot to mentionit And walking is wonderful exercise It requires no special equipmentor membership fees and you cant strain anything            Modifiedeating with no physical exertion would be like putting lipstick on adonkeyperfectly pointless
