                                 Gorilla Warfare            The current effort tosexually integrate the US military is not without precedent Consider thenatives of New Caledonia in the South Pacific who earned their place inmilitary annals by subduing and then eating the crew of a French survey ship in The men and women typically headed off for war in unison although theirroles did differ once the fighting began The women would fall back to therear then as one  th century observer put it whenever they seeone of the enemy fall it is their business to rush forward pull the bodybehind and dress it for the oven            OK so these women arentquite the role models that proponents of sexual integration would order up fromcentral casting But history has provided few candidates for that job AsMaurice Davie noted in  in his crosscultural survey The Evolution ofWar  war is the business of half the human race            As arule the fact that women have not traditionally performed a given role has nobearing on their competence to perform it now Centuries of female exclusionfrom academia or civil engineering havent rendered modern women unfit forthose professions However male dominance of the killing business seems tohave been going on for a lot longer than a few centuriesmaybe long enough tohave influenced human evolution shaping the biological foundation of humanpsychology If so does that mean male and female psychology are so differentthat the sexual integration of the military is misguided The question breaksdown into three subquestions             Are men designed by natural selection for warfareAs regular Earthling readers may recall the premise of evolutionarypsychology is simple Those genetically based mental traits that duringevolution consistently helped their possessors get genes into the nextgeneration became part of human nature Careful thought experiments have shownthat in a context of regular violence mental traits conducive to killingwould do more for your genes than mental traits conducive to getting killedwould So if during human evolution men often fought in wars and women didntthen indeed men might be naturally better warriors than women            Of coursethe frequency of war in prehistory is not well recorded Hence the termprehistory But various huntergatherer societiesthe nearest reallifemodels of the social environment of human evolution and thus the purestobservable expression of human naturehave been known to engage inintervillage raids Australian Aborigines of the  th centuryaccording to one chronicler made it a point to massacre all strangers whofall into their power In some of these societies more than a fourth of themales die violently            And whether or not our distant male ancestorsoften participated in actual war they probably fought other males andsometimes killed them The warless Kung San huntergatherers of the KalahariDesert once romanticized as The Harmless People  were found a fewdecades ago to have homicide rates between  and  times as high asindustrialized nations And some of this killing is coalitionaltwo brothersand a friend gang up on an enemy etc So ethnographic evidence alonesuggests that men could well be designed by natural selection to fight andperhaps to do so in groups            There ismore evidence which well get to shortly However the policy implications ofany male propensity to fight would depend on other questions For example             Are women by nature shrinking violets innatelyrepulsed by war incapable of violence Hardly Feuding AustralianAborigine women would sometimes square off and whack each other with yam sticksuntil somebody intervened Among the Ainu the indigenous huntergathererpeople of Japan women would go to war and actually fight though only againstother women            Even when women arentcombatants they hardly shy away from the thought of war or from its goreAmong the Dayak of  th century Borneo women would surround areturning warrior singing songs of praise while the head of one of hisvictims sat nearby on a decorative brass tray Among the Yanomamo of SouthAmerica women watch the oneonone club fights that sometimes escalate intointervillage conflicts screaming insults and egging their men on Among theBaHuana of the Congo one  th century ethnographer reported thechief instigators of war are the women If their men are insulted by other menand dont retaliate the women make fun of them You are afraid you are notmen we will have no more intercourse with you Woma woma afraid HuHu Hu Then out go the men and fight            All toldthough women as a group are less combative than men they are not wholly averseto combat And plainly some women are more eager and capable fightersthan some men Im male but no one has ever confused me with CharlesBronson So why deny hightestosterone women an opportunity to join in thefun If there is a good reason it has to do with our final question             Why do men fight so much Here we cometo a problem that will prove stubborn if the military tries to sexuallyintegrate ground combat forces such as the infantry The problem isnt so muchthat men are designed by natural selection to fight as what theyre designed tofight over women             Even today Yanomamo menraid villages kill men and abduct women for procreative purposes Moreovertough mean men enjoy high social status which attracts women and helps themen get genes into the next generation The anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon hasshown that Yanomamo men who have killed other men have more wives and moreoffspring than average guys            Its notjust a question of men disinclined to violence getting killed off Two menmight fight over a woman until one man submits and the winner gets the womanOr men might fight for seemingly nonsexual reasons but the winner stillenjoys the high social status that wows the ladies Indeed its possible thatnonlethal violence has done more to shape the male propensity for violencethan simple killing has            Male combat is common among primates It is the reasonthat in many primate species males are so much bigger and stronger thanfemales Indeed the more polygynous the speciesthat is the more females adominant male can sexually monopolizethe larger the size difference betweenthe sexes The toughest male gorillas get a whole harem of females tothemselves and the wimpiest get zilch Eons of combat over such high geneticstakes have led to males that are about twice the size of females In ourspecies the more modest but still marked difference in size and strengthbetween men and women is hard evidence that violence whether lethal ornonlethal has paid off for men in Darwinian terms Among the other evidenceis the fact that testosterone makes people aggressive            Theproblem with fielding a sexually integrated army of gorillas wouldnt be thatthe females cant fight Try stealing a female gorillas baby and see how youfare The biggest problem is that if you put three male gorillas together withone unattached female esprit de corps will not ensue            Yes of course human males are better atcontrolling their hatreds and rivalries than gorilla males are But are humansso good that it makes sense to sprinkle a few women into a group of infantrymenand send them all off to war where everyones prospects for survival willdepend on their solidarity Hoping even subconsciously that one of yourcomrades will die seems a poor frame of mind to carry into battle            Does thesame argument apply to nonmilitary workplaces Doesnt sexual integration sowdissension there as well Id say that any downside to sexually integratingnonmilitary workplaces is not severe enough to restrict the rights of women ormen Andin many workplacesthere may be a big upside to sexual integrationBut the military is special The cost of dissension is death not lowerearnings And during big wars when the draft is on many of the victims arepeople who didnt volunteer for the job Thats one big difference between thisissue and the issue of sexually integrating police forces            This logic has no direct bearing on the currently topicalissue of sexually integrated basic training The troops that take basictogether dont go off to war together so their bonding isnt a matter of lifeand death Still basic training is meant to model some of the rigors of warand it turns out to be a useful model indeed The complaints of sexualharassment that deluged the Army after the Aberdeen scandal which itselfdidnt involve basic training show how male and female psychology cancomplicate life for a sexually integrated army Obviously the more conspicuousproblemsmen propositioning women for examplecan be minimized withsufficiently harsh punishment But the underlying psychological forces willstill be there taking their toll And remember When soldiers go from trainingcamps to actual war things get more primitive not less            One can imagine combat rolesfor women that wouldnt fly in the face of human nature Why not try  Butreflecting on human nature doesnt seem to be a common pastime at the PentagonSexually integrating ground combat forces is now favored by one assistantsecretary of the Army The secretary himself Togo West has said he is open tothe idea And already combat forces are somewhat integrated in the Air Forcesquadrons of pilots and Navy ship crews These things though asintegrating the infantry would be Given the stakes shouldnt such decisionsbe informed by some knowledge of sexual psychology Or instead we could justwait for a war and use yearolds as guinea pigs in a poorly researchedsocial experiment
