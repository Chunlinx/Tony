                                 Sen John Glenn            Washington being Washingtonand politics being politics the announcement of Sen John Glenns return tospace was the occasion for much sneering Republicans mocked the space trip asClintons payoff for Glenns hackwork during the campaign fundraisinghearings He can go into orbit and stay there snapped a Republicancongressional staffer NASA skeptics added Glenns scientific mission to thelong list of  Remember when NASA gave shuttle rides to congressionalpaymasters Sen Jake Garn and Rep Bill Nelson            But ifits easy to be cynical about Glenns trip its nearly impossible to becynical about the man himself Glenn confounds Washington The armor has nochink His life proves that in politics virtue can triumph overexpediency Glenn hasnt sacrificed principle for ambition Thats his blessingand his curse            Glenn is as much a careerist as any pol As Tom Wolfechronicled in The Right Stuff  Glenn positioned himself carefully to beAmericas first astronaut Selected for the Mercury program in  Glennparaded his Marinepilot heroism  missions in World War II and Korea hisloving marriage his religious faith As it happened all were genuine AlanShepard beat Glenn to space But Glenn the first American to orbitEarth became the Mercury superstar anyway His eloquence his calm in the faceof danger his smalltownOhio decency his boyish frecklesthey canonizedhim Four million New Yorkers attended his welcomehome parade He was the ColdWars greatest hero He was so revered that when Robert Kennedy wasassassinated Ethel Kennedy asked Glenn to break the news to her children Andthe man is the equal of his image He is honest hardworking faithfulreligious patriotic a devoted father and a loving husband            When heentered politics Glenn vowed that he would never mortgage his reputation forpolitical gain This pact was more selfless than it sounds It ensured thatAmerica would never be disillusioned about its hero Thanks to Glennshighmindedness hes had a peculiar worthy and forgettable political careerElected to the Senate in  he has devoted himself to important numbingissues Hes the Senates technocrat He likes reading General AccountingOffice reports He is by his own admission dull Glenn helped draft USnuclearnonproliferation policy He revels in the nittygritty of armstreaties He is an expert in the science and policy of nuclearwaste storageHe pioneered the idea of reinventing government Long before Al Gore Glenn waspushing to cut waste and rationalize government procurement He has been inshort an admirable public servant a solid stolid senator            But Glenn was supposed to be more He was to bethe Democratic Eisenhower He and Ike share freckles a shiny skull warheroism But Glenn never commanded troops He does not know how to leadGlenns vision of the Senate is Platonic a committee of the wise elevatedabove conflict and partisanship that does what is right for the nation Butbargain and compromise are the fuel of politics Glenn is a bad horse traderHe makes his own decisions on principle and thinks his colleagues should do thesame He doesnt do porkbarrel He delivers goodies to Ohio only when Ohiodeserves them Hes never risen to the top ranks of the Senate because hesnever been able to behave like a normal senator            Glennsscruples as well as his dullness also doomed his quest for the presidencyHis  campaign is a model of how to blow an election Glenn entered theDemocratic race with enormous advantages He had percent national namerecognition and a stellar reputation The movie of The Right Stuff which lionized Glenn opened just before primary season He was a centrist in afield of liberals But he tanked it He was a terrible fundraiser largelybecause he didnt suck up to donors More importantly he failed to inspirevoters Glenn cant master the glib soundbite rhetoric that characterizespolitics He believes that speeches should explain facts as much as exciteemotion Glenn notoriously is a politician who gets more applause when hesintroduced than when he leaves In  he was soporific on the stump boringcrowds with endless details of energy policy and SALT negotiations Afterpolling neck and neck with Walter Mondale Glenn finished sixth in the Iowacaucuses well behind Undecided He also managed to lose every state in theSuper Tuesday primary before quitting the race            Any year political career has its scars and Glenns isno exception But here too he may deserve the benefit of the doubt He stillcarries a million debt from his presidential campaign His reluctance tofund raise partly explains the nonpayment of debt A normal politician wouldhave invited corporate allies to a few fund raisers cleared the debt andreciprocated with a few favors Glenn is allergic to such politicking He hasalso taken too much abuse for his membership in the Keating Five He acceptedmore than  in campaign contributions from S  L crook CharlesKeating and arranged a meeting for Keating with thenHouse Speaker Jim WrightThe Senate Ethics Committee found Glenn guilty of poor judgment But Glennseems to have been oblivious rather than sleazy He was simply helping aconstituent It probably never occurred to him that he was doing anythingwrong He was genuinely shocked that people saw venality in his behavior saysJohn Green a politicalscience professor at the University of Akron            Last Feb  on the th anniversary of his space shot Glenn announced that he wouldntseek reelection in  The yearold is increasingly out of place in theSenate which is a more unfriendly place than when he entered it Hes awkwardin opposition There is too much sniping for him and not enough legislatingGlenns performance in the campaign fundraising hearings last fall highlightedhis unhappiness with his job It was the low moment of his career Hestonewalled and disrupted the Republicans at every turn contending that theinvestigation was ignoring GOP wrongdoing He did his party duty obedientlybut his own partisanship made him uncomfortable He seems to know that hedoesnt belong in the increasingly nasty uncollegial Senate            But he does belong on theshuttle Yes the ostensible reason for the missionaging researchisdubious And NASAs budgetary whoring is unseemly And the appeal to publicsentiment is shameless So what Glenn has spent  years protecting the fivehours of his life he spent in space  years living up to an impossibly heroicimage He has done it admirably His first trip into space was work Doesnt hedeserve a vacation there
