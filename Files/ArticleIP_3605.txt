                                 Body by Mail Order            The editors of                  Slate                have in their wisdom decided to improve my life atminimal expense to them by giving me a budget to test health productsavailable in catalogs Even though I pose as a cynic I harbor a belief in thetransformative power of consumer goods despite the documented failure of anyproduct with slim or anti in its name I looked for items that required noeffort to use yet promised dramatic effects I also chose items that wereeither ubiquitous suggesting they had something going for them orunique the company must have locked up rights to a magical object I judgedthem not only on whether they delivered on their claims but also on whether Iwould buy one for myself or send one as a gift                           Feet                        I decided to work from thebottom up My first purchase was an oddlooking shoe called the Arcopedicowith a flat PVC sole and a knitted nylon upper Normally the first thing I dowhen I get home is kick off my shoes but these were so comfortable that Idrealize late into the evening that Id forgotten to take them off After afew weeks of wearing my Arcopedicos almost exclusively what I thought was apermanently throbbing bunion has virtually disappeared Theres one drawback tothe Arcopedico When you wear them people will say things like Look at yourshoes This is not a compliment They dont have the Ive never shaved myarmpit hair aura of the Birkenstock but they are strangely elfin inappearance                           Would I buy a pair with myown money I already have                           Would I buy them as agift Shoes are a peculiar gift but Ive recommended them to manypeople                           Purchasinginformation The

wwwnormthompsoncom                           Tush                        Moving up I settled on theTushCush Almost every catalog dealing with health or comfort carries thisitem Its a wedgeshaped foam cushion with a Ushaped piece cut out of thethicker end Sitting with your spine aligned over the hole is supposed toreduce pressure on your disks It has definitely made sitting in front of thecomputer easier and is far more comfortable than the throw pillows I previouslyused At  its a pretty pricey piece of foam but it is a lot cheaper thanan ergonomically correct chair It does not unfortunately firm your tush asyou sit                           Would I buy one formyself Yes although I think all editors should in their ownselfinterest give them to writers                           Would I buy

                     If youve ever spent anevening plunging your wrists into ice water you are an easy mark for devicesthat promise to relieve carpal tunnel syndrome The wrist supporters sold inthe Real Goods catalog feature the antibiotic of the New Age world magnetsThe Food and Drug Administration is skeptical of magnets ability to relievepain but last December the New York Times published a story about aresearcher at Baylors Institute for Rehabilitation Research who found thatmagnets significantly reduced pain from postpolio syndrome The wristsupporters I ordered were black neoprene with a metal brace and a flexiblemagnetic band I found them bulky and their primary benefit seemed to comefrom the heat retention qualities of the neoprene They were certainly no moreeffective than the nonmagnetic wrist stabilizers Id picked up at thedrugstore At  each who would order just one they seemoverpriced            Would I order a set formyself No            Would I buy one as a giftNo

its ability toinduce an almost vegetativestate depth of sleep The full mattress runs about but                   Slate                doesnt want its contributors to be thatrelaxed so I got the pillow from Brookstone for  On the box is a smallsticker that states the pillow may have a particular smell that iscompletely harmless and will disappear after some time which sounds likesomething the proprietor of the Bates Motel might say The smell is sort of across between mildew and a petrochemical plant A salesman at a Brookstonestore gave me this hint Roll the pillow up tightly several times a day tosqueeze out the trapped air After about a week of doing this the odor haddissipated enough for mein the interest of my investigative dutiesto take anap The pillow does let you sink into it while also giving support It didntchange the quality of my sleep as all the hype promised But it is reallycomfortable                           Would I buy one formyself Yes if I were feeling

conditioning claims to make thehair lustrous add body and remove odors and dandruff Along with magnets andSwedish foam ions make up the holy trinity of selfimprovement The firstproblem was that before

third one has been working finebut you have to doublecheck to makesure its really off or it will exhaust its batteries in a matter of hours Ihave dry hair and with the Ionic Hair Wand I thought I could follow myhairdressers advice to shampoo less often So I faithfully brushed my hairwith the wand for the recommended two minutes a day day after dayMiraculously eight days later my hair looked good and smelled clean How longcould I go Im not French so I finally hit the shower            Then I discovered one of thesecrets to the wand is that it produces minute amounts of ozone which acts asa germicide However ozone is an air pollutant I decided Id rather justshampoo                           Would I buy one formyself No                           Would I buy it as agift Only for people
