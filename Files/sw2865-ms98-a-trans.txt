                okay i think were supposed to discuss the changes in the roles of women in the last generation or two and   uhhuh right   and my opinion is that uh the  biggest changes uh probably are about two and one of course is obvious and thats the working woman   right   and uh the second one which i dont know if youd go along with or not is that maybe a lot of women are not as uh likely to want to be dominated as past times   well thats i would say thats probably true uh i know in in my wifes case she is a very independent sort uh you know she she has a lot of say about uh you know just about everything that uh happens in our family life   and youre proud of that   and yes i am i i you know i i feel very confident that if you know something were to happen to me or to us either one that uh you know she would be capable of taking care of her own you know what ever her own needs are right and and i think thats very important   of course well uh another uh thing that i want to talk about is which of the the changes that you can think of are the most significant     well i i really think that that that independence of of women is uh probably more important an and i guess that uh really came about because of the change or a lot of it anyway because of the change in the work force uh with more women working and having uh more uh important or or uh whats the right term anyway their jobs is being you know more people depending on them and more management decisions made i think that uh lends to being you know more independent and stepping out and saying what you want to say and what needs to be said   well and dont you think that you do see more women who are um becoming part of middle management   yes i i i thats even even uh upper management is is uh i think is going to be a a coming thing for for women too uh and in the professions also not just uh not just within company management but you know professional people that uh are going out on their own attorneys and lawyers im an accountant a CPA   attorneys   and uh i know quite a few women CPAs you know that are out working on their own running their own accounting practice and doing quite well   uhhuh let me ask you a question uh while were talking about the CPA women uh in uh a firm say do you think uh a woman CPA gets paid equally to a man   uh i would im not sure but i would think so within uh within a public accounting firm uh if theyre on the same level of responsibility now i would say that theres you know some   umhum   uh or i would even say a probability that women still have it a little more difficult to achieve the same level that a man does uh theres you know theres still some stereotypes uh within even within the the accounting practice   what and even within women that they perhaps some women do not expect uh   yeah right   um but um within public within public accounting within the what is now the big six accounting firms in particular the uh the people thats starting off in accounting uh have an awful lot of uh hours to work and and theres a lot of stress put on them uh a lot of requirements for uh you know traveling and being available all uh hours and and that kind of thing   going away on those audits   right and and i think that uh that some women may you know they may tend still tend to to not want to do that  to the point that they would restrict their own possibility for   umhum   uh for promotion to achieve that but you know the ones that the ones that really want to uh certainly can go ahead and achieve that   uhhuh yeah well what what future do you see for us in the next twenty years say   um i i would say that uh there will be you know in the business world there will be more uh opportunities more expansion of the womens role in business and i see uh womens roles expanding in the political area uh quite a bit uh of course you know we in Texas weve got uh uh a uh woman governor now   yes oh yes   uh and weve had the all lets see what have we got uh four say five major cities in Texas that have all had women mayors i think uh recently uh three at least three of them have women mayors now   Charlotte also has a woman mayor   and uh you know i see i see uh you know the movement of women into into the political arena as being very important uh   well ill tell you what worries me a little bit about uh the role of women these days and im hoping that thats going to be a change and i dont know if you see it or not my husband doesnt always uh see it or understand it uh and that is the uh the trial of trying to be the superwoman the supermom the   yeah the supermom yes   yes and uh i have gone through that uh myself and it is hell it really is is tough and to be able to excuse myself   uhhuh   from doing that was a wonderful liberation       and i guess i had i think the woman pretty much has to do it themselves but i believe that in the future that theyre going to stop trying to be all things   right right i i think theyll be uh  you know in in the political area i suppose uh for for the most part politicians have gone through their a a good bit of their business life before they get into politics       and and i think that that if thats the the situation for women they will have had their family life and their business life you know may be earlier and then move into politics   uhhuh   and i think thats uh you know thats the way that uh that you can have you know women can have all things you you just cant have them all at once  and uh i think thats you know thats the case for men  you know for the most part too   yes and a very i will say this very quickly i had an attorney friend who said and hed been practicing probably twenty five years and he said i wish there were more women in politics they are not quite as crooked   uhhum well i i think thats uh thats the truth and and i i think that theres i think and this is uh may be a bad thing for me to say but i think that women have a higher moral uh character for the most part than men do and it you know the  along the sexual type you know the   the acceptable   the the the little things that men that get involved in   morals that we uhhuh yes   right that uh women just dont tend to do that of of course it takes you know it takes a man and a women both but i think that women have or or a little more uh discreet or at at least a little more careful about what they do and are and you know   are reticent about it anyway   woman a woman congressmans not going to have her picture taken on a boat somewhere out in the Caribbean with you know with some young guy you know for the most part yeah   uhhuh umhum however i being uh uh former employer myself i did change from being someone who i who felt that women could uh share out share it one job and things like that and i became more understanding of how men often are  are for for many years have thought about uh women in the working world and my husband couldnt believe   umhum   and he started teasing me and calling me a male chauvinist or a female chauvinist but but i do i think there certainly some pluses uh on both sides we just need to get them all put together     right   well its been so nice talking to you and good luck to you good luck to you and have a nice day bye   right and uh yeah its been nice talking to you too okay thank you you too umhum you too bye
