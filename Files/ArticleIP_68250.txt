                                 Putin It Nicely            On NewYears Eve Russian President Boris Yeltsin abruptly resigned leaving PrimeMinister Vladimir Putin as the countrys acting president Everyone expectsPutin to win the presidency outright in the upcoming elections But what kindof man is Putin His detractors say hes a KGB spy a believer in centralizedpower and a ruthless prosecutor of the war in Chechnya And what do hisdefenders say That each of these vices is really a virtue                           Hes a spy Critics point to Putins  years in the KGB calling him aKGB spy KGB agent and KGB colonel One antagonist says Putin was dubbedStasi the name of the former East German secret service for wieldingbehindthescenes power Detractors use these terms to portray Putin as a ColdWarrior who cant be trusted with Russias nukes On television this weekendUS Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security Adviser SandyBerger lent credence to this theory by arguing that Putin has two strands onone side his KGB years and on the other his years as a democratic reformerin St Petersburg            Putins allies reject the twostrands theory They argue that his KGBexperience actually reinforced his interest in economic liberalization AsPutins spokesman explained on Meet the Press  Mr Putin worked in theWest Thats a very positive point  The people in the KGB in some wayprepared perestroika  because they were very open and they knew the exactsituation in the economy inside Russia and what was happening outsidePutins former mentor in St Petersburg exMayor Anatoly Sobchak told theNew York Times  He is a convinced supporter of the market economy  Heknows the western model of economic and political life not as an outsider butfrom the inside            Thiscounterspin is already making headway Putin returned from his KGB servicesteeped in Western business knowledge says the Times  On ThisWeek  Times Washington bureau chief Michael Oreskes noted thataccording to Putins colleagues In his years as a KGB agent in Europe helearned a lot about Western business practices and that may be exactly what heneeds to understand to solve Russias economic problems                           Hes a socialist American skeptics worry that Putin might wield too muchstate power over the economy and society thereby undermining both capitalismand democracy Putin however sees the state as the protector of honestcapitalism and true democracy Any attempt to exceed the limits of the law andRussias Constitution will be decisively crushed he warned in his New YearsEve message Freedom of speech freedom of conscience freedom of the pressthe right to private propertyall these basic principles of a civilizedsociety will be reliably protected by the state            Putins Russian allies and even his enemies agree that the chief threat tofreedom in Russia today is too little power in the central government not toomuch But how can they make this case to the worlds most powerful lender theUnited States in terms we can understand By comparing Putin to formerAmerican presidents Putin has a wonderful opportunity to become for Russiawhat the Roosevelts are for America Sobchak told the Times  TheTimes buys this analysis Theodore Roosevelt took on entrenchedmonopolies helping small businesses to thrive and competition to flourishFranklin Roosevelt reworked the federal government to aid the poor improveeducation and create a less crashprone financial system Both men amassedstate power over the government and economy to shape the capitalistic systemthat exists today                           Hes a strongman Critics call Putin cruel a dictator and a RussianPinochet who might suspend civil liberties to whip Russia into shape Theyreparticularly outraged by Putins War in Chechnya George W Bush says hestroubled that Putin owes his popularity to the Chechen war Bill Bradley andJohn McCain demand economic sanctions against Russia for its brutal assaultson Chechen civilians On Meet the Press  Tim Russert said Putin hadcalled the Chechen rebels darkskinned people who must be annihilated and hadwarned that they will be found in latrines and killed Furthermore Russertnoted His first official visit  was to Chechnya giving hunting knives to theRussian military            Tomake nice with Putin US officials have begun to rephrase complaints aboutthe war When asked about Russian atrocities they express regret aboutRussias actions But they also frame the war as an unfortunate expression ofa trait that could serve Putin well in other pursuits When asked about Putinsvow to annihilate the Chechens Albright called Putin very determined andactionoriented The media too have begun to use positive adjectives todescribe Putins conduct of the war aggressive toughmindeddetermined decisive uncompromising nononsense            Howaccording to Putins supporters will these traits make him a good leaderFirst he can halt Russias slide into chaos Putin frames the Chechen war as astruggle to rein in terrorism and the breakup of Russia a rationale forwhich Berger and Albright express sympathy Second he can confront cronyismCritics portray Putin as Yeltsins pawn installed by Yeltsins daughter andother cronies to safeguard their financial interests and shield them fromprosecution for corruption By underscoring his image as a fearless strongmanPutin defies this critique He began by firing Yeltsins daughter elicitingoohs and aahs from the world press even though everyone expects her to stay onas an informal adviser In view of Russias endemic corruption Americanpundits are reconsidering whether a strongman president is such a bad thingDoes he have the power and the will to take on the robber barons askedGeorge Stephanopoulos on This Week  Will he tax them Will he crackdown on them Will he clean them up            Third a ruthlesslyefficient leader can win a ruthlessly efficient election and craft a ruthlesslyefficient economy Arguing for a quick end to the Chechen war both Albrightand Berger appeal not to Putins mercy but to his political interests He nowfaces an election in three months says Berger If the costs become too highfor the Russians  this could become an albatross around his neck in MarchNever mind morality When asked whether the United States should oppose loansto Russia because of the war Berger replies Its a premature question because the predicate question is whether they get the economic reforms inorder at which point well have to look at whats in our national interestHere is an argument Americans can understand We should judge Russiaspresident the same way we judge ours The test for Putin says Berger isthe economy stupid
