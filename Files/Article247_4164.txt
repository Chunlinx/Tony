                                 Heard of Any Good Scandals Lately                        Dear Dad            I agree with you entirely about the Times versus local newspapers Asyou know when we moved down to DC a few years ago we thought we would savea little money and a few pounds of trash per week by getting the Timesonly on weekends But right from the start we went into serious Timeswithdrawal Sure the Washington Post is a good enough paper and welike its local reporting but its foreign coverage doesnt compare to theTimes  the OpEd page tends to counteract the effects of my morningcoffee with the exception of the divinely cranky Michael Kelly onWednesdayslong may he rant and the editors often seem clueless about how toput together an attractive and readable paper They still havent figured outthat its a good idea to put all the hightechnology features in a singleweekly section the way the Times does However thanks to the InternetI have been indulging my Times addiction for several years now withoutany additional cost or trash it makes me wonder how many other people aredoing the same and just how much money the Times has lost as aresult            As you say were supposed to be talking about the news But what has beenmost interesting to me about the news in the past few months is what hasnot been there namely scandal Its as if the Lewinsky business wassuch a big greasy nauseating chunk of scandal to swallow that the politiciansand chattering classes subsequently lost their appetite for the stuff at leasttemporarily Before Monica it seemed as if we had entered the age of thePermanent Floating Scandal There always seemed to be at least three or fourstacked up over Washington at any one time like planes waiting to land atNational Airport Whitewater Travelgate the FBI files the campaignfinancescandals not to mention the extra auxiliary scandals around half the cabinetSince IranContra its seemed as if theres been scarcely a week in which someWashington scandal didnt hit the front page of the Times or thePost  with the reporters dropping hopeful hints about there being MuchMore to Come and how this might all ultimately Bring the President Down            But since the Much More came and several additional large indigestiblehelpings on top of it and still the president didnt fall its as if thepress and the politicians have gone on a scandal diet sneaking in only anoccasionally guilty snack like Newt Gingrichs mistress Ironically Clintonslast two years in office seem certain to be more free of scandal than Bushs orReagans And along with the demise of the special prosecutor the tone of thecoverage has changed I certainly havent seen much recently of the prestigemedias dreadfully sententious handwringing along the lines of Should we bedignifying with our attention these allegations about presidential fondling asdetailed in the following page special report and make sure not to miss theamazing revelations from the alleged victims college roommate about herattitudes toward oral sex Instead the tone has been prettystraightforwardly condemnatory in regard to excess prosecutorial zeal andprurient exposures of private life Still this is an eminently selfcorrectingsituation The longer Washington remains without its traditional appetite forscandal the more careless powerful people will get and eventually one of themwill get blown up in a big juicy affair which will have the politicians andpundits joyfully going off the diet and gorging on all the sordid details            Of course as our sainted editor here at                   Slate                MichaelKinsley has often said the real scandal is not whats illegal but whatslegal and going on all the time Do you think theres any chance that themedias temporary diet will encourage more reporters to look at this other kindof scandal instead of dreaming about being the next Bob Woodward            Well I see Ive gotten to the end of my page and a half and haventgotten to the news either like father like son So why dont youbegin Any thoughts on Chechnya John McCain            LoveDavid
