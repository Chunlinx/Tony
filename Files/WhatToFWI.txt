                      What to Do        Sports        Regardless of the time of year you visit these islands        youll spend most of your time outdoors on or near the water and a        word of caution is necessary The rays of the tropical sun here can        cause serious trouble In no more than  to  minutes fair skin can        be painfully broiled even in the shade of a coconut tree For the        first few days youd be well advised to take the sun in extremely small        doses        Swimming        Coral or volcanic eggshell white or ashy gray the sand of        FWI beaches varies from cove to cove Your hotel may be on an        outstanding beach If not theres usually one within easy reach In        Guadeloupe the best beaches are on GrandeTerre as are most of the        hotels BasseTerre features both dark volcanic sand in the region of        La Soufrire and beige beaches in the north Local lore says that you        tan better on black sand        Martiniques Mount Pele provides the dark coloring for its        northern beaches SaintMartin and SaintBarthlemy though also        volcanic in formation but without erupting peaks have only light sand        beaches        Swimming conditions vary enormously on all the islands        Youll have no trouble in identifying the many perfectly safe        protected shores where hardly a ripple disturbs the surface Otherwise        there are some beaches or sections of beaches where swimming is less        recommended or even dangerous for all except experts Coral reefs often        reduce wave strength but may not stem very strong ocean currents        particularly in the Atlantic Time of year is also a factor the winter        months bringing heavier seas On Martinique the Tourist Office advises        that the safest beaches for poor swimmers are at SainteAnne        TroisIlets SainteLuce Trinit and Carbet        Good tidings about the shark situation no incident        involving a swimmer snorkeler or diver has been reported anywhere in        the FWI Guadeloupe incredibly almost never sees a shark anywhere        near its coast Sightings close to Martinique are very rare and not        much more frequent off the northern FWI Nonetheless swimming after        dusk is not advisable        For a small fee nonguests may use the beach and facilities        at a number of Guadeloupe and Martinique hotelsa great convenience for        islandhoppers Alternatively there are also fine public beaches and        theyre often deserted        Many hotels have swimming pools for those who may be        allergic to sand        Snorkeling Skin Diving Scuba Diving        Underwater sports off the major islands and rocky islets of        the FWI are the highlights of countless vacations Snorkeling equipment        may be provided free rented or bought inexpensively in tourist areas        so theres no need to bring any from home Beginners who can stay        afloat can learn to breathe through the tube and peer through the mask        in minutes        Many of the best snorkeling and underwater photography        areas are offshore at coral reefs or around uninhabited islands youll        have little difficulty in finding a boat to take you out Such        multicolored reef dwellers as the parrotfish and French angelfish        along with weirdly shaped coral crawfish or turtles hiding in        crevices can be yours for the viewing in these clear waters where        visibility of  m  ft is common        Freedive spear fishing without air container is        permitted in the FWI but always check with local fishermen before        eating anything you catch see page  You should see many of the        following grouper amberjack red or rock hind stingrays

at major hotels This ultimate        subsurface experience is becoming very popular in France as it has        been for a number of years in the United States The Caribbeans        transparency and teeming underwater life make it ideal for scuba and        since the water stays tropically warm yearround you shouldnt need a        full wetsuit        Boating Windsurfing and WaterSkiing        A large number of hotels in the FWI have small boats        available for rent including the always popular Sunfish You can also        find instructors to give sailing lessons as well as all kinds of boat        excursions on which a skipper and crew do the work while you relax        Windsurfing is making a splash in the FWI youll see the        colorful sails boards and masts all around the islands It looks        easier than it is youll need lessons at least two or three just to        get you started        Waterskiing is somewhat harder to find but certain hotels        do provide motorboats and skis with fixed rates for a minute tour        and an additional fee per lesson The more tours you buy the lower the        rate so waterski enthusiasts will certainly get value for money        Sailing and Yachting        With balmy trade winds infrequent squalls and flowing sea        currents the FWI and nearby Antilles are ideal for a day a week or a        month under sail As every islander knows many of the most gorgeous        coves and beaches are reachable only by boat For a fairly modest sum        per person you might consider chartering a skippered sloop or        catamaran for a full day        From Martinique the popular day or twoweek sail takes        you to St Lucia and down into the Grenadines From Guadeloupe try Les        Saintes and MarieGalante which both have safe anchorages or sail        further to Antigua A m ft twomasted vessel sleeping a maximum        of six with captain and one crew member can be taken from either        Martinique or

in PointePitre at FortdeFrance or across its        bay at the PointeduBout marina and at SaintMartins Marigot During        the peak season midDecember to midApril rates are higher        Among the yachts advertised for charter in Guadeloupe is a        m ft ketch built for the late King Farouk        Fishing        The FWI are somewhat removed from the great gamefishing        waters off the Bahamas Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands but the        average angler will find challenges aplenty here from boat or shore        There are a limited number of deepsea boats for charter they normally        accommodate up to four people Local fishermen might also agree to take        you out in their timetested nofrills boats This may mean youll        have to help with nets or traps an instructive experience        Surfcasting with lures called spinning is outstanding at        three points in southeast Martinique Cap Ferr Cap Macr and Cap        Chevalier Local buffs say its also excellent at llet Hardy Pointe        Baham and GrandRivire Expect to haul in jacks barracuda        yellowtail snapper tarpon best with bait off Vauclin dolphin red        hind and jewfish        Bottom fishing may get you grouper tarpon mahogany or red        snapper parrotfish grunts and rarely African pompano In        Martinique the best bottom fishing is probably at Le Robert and Les        Salines        Guadeloupe with more fully equipped oceangoing boats than        Martinique offers deepsea fishing for kingfish tuna barracuda        bonito and dolphin You should find some or all of these in        SaintMartins waters as well with about a dozen boats available for        charter Wahoo one of the big five game fish is hooked occasionally        off all the islands        Before

Martiniques where tourists may also use two private clubsTennis        Club de FortdeFrance and Tennis Club du Vieux Moulinwhen the        courts are not in use Playing away from your hotel will

trails around Mount Pele in the north A hiking path        connects Le Prcheur with GrandRivire advertised as a sixhour        journey        Shopping        If youre not French think French Particularly on        Martinique and Guadeloupe where the outstanding bargains are in        perfumes Parisian fashions crystal and other luxury items from        France On dutyfree SaintMartin and SaintBarthlemy the range of        best buys is even greater There are local handicraft items for sale on        all four islands that are interesting and reasonably priced but shop        off the obvious tourist beat and dont hesitate to bargain        At hotel boutiques prices may or may not be the same as in        urban shopping areas for anything major its worth comparing Opening        hours are as follows ordinary shops and stores am to noon and  to        pm supermarkets department stores and bookshops am to pm        and  to pm boutiques am to pm and  to pm        Some stores are open after normal hours or on Sundays or        holidays when cruise ships are in port Better shops are        airconditioned        All of the islands accept American or Canadian dollars        about as readily as French francs Many shops in Guadeloupe and        Martinique give discounts usually  percent for purchases in        travelers checks but not if you pay in foreign currency On        Martinique youre likely to get the same discount if you pay with one        of the major credit cards        Neither Martinique nor Guadeloupe enjoy dutyfree status        apart from the dutyfree shops at the airports but almost everything        from France is sold at mainland French prices well below what the        items would cost in North America        While Americans returning home must pay  duty on        everything above  worth of purchases made abroad the US customs        levy added to the price of an item may still come to less than what the        purchases would cost in Boston or Chicago Any goods shipped back from        FWI require a  duty regardless of the monetary value It is illegal        to ship alcoholic beverages         A wise idea is to price major items at home before your        vacation To avoid possible complications with customs veteran        travelers ask for and retain a receipt sales slip for everything        purchased        Guadeloupes Shopping Scene        Aside from a few boutiques and native crafts shops around        the island notably in or near hotels interesting shopping is        concentrated in an area of PointePitre several city

enough        can become an offbeat lamp shade You should also see items crafted        from sharks teeth and occasionally even entire jaws        Martiniques Shopping Scene        Much of downtown Fort deFrance is fertile territory for        shoppers For tourists at PointeduBout its worth taking the        minute ferry ride to the capital to investigate prices there before        shopping at the resort hotel boutiques Elsewhere on the island there        are a handful of craft workshops        Best buys perfumes and other French luxury items as listed        for Guadeloupe youll also find

huge wooden forks or seashell necklaces Some        of the salesladies at this colorful softsell market wear traditional        Martinique costumes FortdeFrances main shopping streets

Watch for onyx from        Argentina and sharkcartilage pendants from Uruguay among other exotic        items        DutyFree Delights SaintMartin and SaintBarthlemy        For many items the two small northern islands have the        lowest prices in the Caribbean Some residents of the dutyfree US        Virgin Islands nearby even do their Christmas shopping in Philipsburg        Marigot or Gustavia It takes a while to realize that not just certain        stores but every store on these islands sells at the same taxless        dutyfree prices        Almost everything is quoted in US dollars but of course        you can pay in French francs or Netherlands Antilles guilders While        prices for French perfumes and fashions may not be appreciably lower        here than in the rest of the FWI they could be half of what Americans        would pay at home        In all three little capitals shopping begins where the        boats come in There are also a few small shops in GrandCase        Best buys on French SaintMartin and to a lesser extent on        St Barts include perfumes and cosmetics luggage fashions fabrics        including madras crystal leather figurines and

certain calculators and cameras for example        are just as inexpensive at discount stores back home However on        SaintMartin and St Barts youll also be saving the city or state        sales tax that may be levied at home        Local Culture and Events        Music and Dance        Swaying rhythms are among the most appealing aspects of        life in the French West Indies While islanders of all ages love to        dance you may have to search a bit nowadays to find the gay and        flirtatious biguine the romantic Creole mazurka or mazouk the        sensually suggestive calenda Like the rest of the Caribbean the FWI        are inundated by the marvelous steel band calypsos of Trinidad the        merengue of Dominica and the reggae and rampanot to mention North        American and European pop musiccourtesy of the transistor and the        more recently popular craze zouk        The authentic FWI dances originated with the African        slaves Some are adaptations of those of the French plantation masters        The biguine immortalized for AngloSaxons by Cole Porter is thought        to have come first to Martinique from the Congo Those Creole men and        women youll see dancing it properly have been moving their hips and        knees that way since childhood Dixieland fans will notice the        instrumental similarity to New Orleansbanjo clarinet bass trombone        and drums        The laghiain which two men dancing to drums alone        simulate a fierce kicking combatarrived with slaves from Dahomey        Only in the country during patron saint day festivals or at a folk        dance performance are you likely to see rose a slave womans washing        dance grage with dancers mimicking tapioca graters to the beat of        goatskin drums the hautetaille an adaptation with accordion and        drums of a European quadrille or the belair an AfricanCreole        version of a threefigure quadrille        Twentyfive young dancers singers and musicians in the        Ballets Martiniquais Folklore group perform traditional local        favorites as do less formal groups on Guadeloupe Here youll see the        delightful but slowly disappearing indigenous FWI costumemadras        turban madras skirt over petticoat silk peplum white blouse and        gold earrings bracelets and collierchoux necklace        Carnival        It may not be the wildest in the Caribbean but the FWIs        carnival is the longest by  hours Early in the week there are        pajama doudou doll and pirate parades plus alwaysspectacular        carnival floats The riotous revelry roars right past Mardi Gras        Shrove Tuesday when redcostumed children star as devils to its peak        on Ash Wednesday Downtown FortdeFrance and PointePitre are        flooded with dancers notably diablesses all dressed in black and        white and losing themselves in the biguine The carnival king Vaval        is burned in effigy after dusk but the frenzied dancing goes on till        after midnight        Special Events        Aside from carnival and patron saints days in the towns        youll enjoy        Fishermens Festival Fte des Marins Pcheurs late in        June on Martinique with parades fish feasts and traditional        costumes        Cooks Festival Fte des Cuisinires in early August in        PointePitre with a colorful appetitestimulating parade a        religious ceremony honoring Saint Laurent chosen as the local cooks        patron saint because in ad  he was burned alive on a rack which        is now a kitchen utensil and a monumental free feast with singing        dancing and liberal applications of rum punch        All Saints Day La Toussaint  November when after        dark in an original and beautiful Antilles tradition all graves in        cemeteries are illuminated with candles        Folk Beliefs        Dont sleep in the rays of the moonyour facial features        will be distorted Pour some rum into a dead mans mouth to cheer him        up otherwise hell come back to haunt the house These and other        superstitions are held by many FWI citizens Many of the strange twigs        herbs and packets youll see in the markets have to do with magic        based on traditions that stem from the African origins of most of the        population This is not however the voodoo of Haiti and there are no        black magic performances staged for tourists        Early missionaries used to say tiens bois here drink         when they gave medicine to ailing islanders It seemed magical when        maladies were cured and from tiens bois derived the word quimbois        for magic potion or spell Today in most villages on Martinique and        Guadeloupe there are still quimboiseurs who mix the mysterious        concoctions They are considered useful for divining the future        prescribing remedies for problems and perhaps putting a spell on an        enemy        The ordinary tourist will find it difficult to obtain        precise details about this magic which is known as obeah around the        West Indies        Nightlife        Theres little danger that the French West Indies will ever        be overrun with swinging afterhours resorts But Guadeloupe is        making an effort On its riviera along the southern coast of        GrandeTerre there are a number of private discotheques and rural        nightclubs in addition to the hotel lounges Tourists are welcome at        such nightspots where theyre likely to be outnumbered by        rhythmloving Guadeloupeans Advertisements suggest there is striptease        occasionally in this area logicalor illogical  on an island        promoting nudism        On Martinique all but the most adventurous tourists will        prefer dancing and drinking in their hotels Here theyll have the        latest calypso mixed with more familiar pop and soul The admission        charge at hotel lounges includes the first drink FortdeFrance and        its suburbs have a smattering of very local very crowded discotheques        where foreigners rarely appear One reason most of the islands resort        hotels are quite a distance from the capital        If folklore performers steel bands or limbo dancers visit        your resort area they usually perform during dinner so you just sit        down and enjoy the show generally outdoors        Guadeloupe and Martinique have a couple of hotel casinos        modest and lowkey by international standards but perfectly able to        accommodate you if youd like to risk your next years salary There is        a large bright new casino in Schoelcher the northern outskirt of        FortdeFrance The casinos open nightly from pm until at least am        offer roulette American blackjack baccarat and sometimes craps and        in Martinique French boule Drinks are available and expensive        Theres an admission charge you must be at least  to        enter and you must present your passport or other official        identification each time you go At a slightly disadvantageous rate        you can exchange foreign currency or travelers checks for franc chips        Succumbing to Caribbeanwide informality the casinos do not require        men to wear a tie or jacket        If your French is good or just needs some polishing both        major islands have movie theaters that show European and American films        with French soundtracks only Seat prices wont ruin you        On SaintMartin lingering over a seaside dinner is the        preferred afterdark activity on the French side where most lights go        out by  or pm For livelier latenights spots head for the Dutch        side with its revues and wellpublicized hotel casinos        On St Barts soon after nightfall the most popular        leisure activity is sleepat least out of season But a bit of        nightlife is available in the thick of the tourist season
