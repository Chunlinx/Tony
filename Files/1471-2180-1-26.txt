                    Background        Today an estimated onethird of the worlds population        is infected with         Mycobacterium tuberculosis the        causative agent of tuberculosis      and tuberculosis        causes about  million deaths annually      Many        aspects of the interactions between         M tuberculosis and its human host        remain unclear Not only is this bacterium able to evade        the defenses of the hosts immune system it is also able        to persist in the body for years and may reactivate to        cause disease decades after the initial infection A better        understanding of the interaction between         M tuberculosis and its human host is        critical to developing new strategies to control the        tuberculosis epidemic        A key feature of the pathogenicity of         M tuberculosis is its ability to        evade the antimicrobial processes of the macrophage and        replicate intracellularly Mycobacteria enter macrophages        primarily by conventional receptormediated phagocytic        pathways     Following phagocytosis phagosomes        containing viable tubercle bacilli fail to acidify        apparently because of failure to insert a protonATPase        pump into the phagosomal membrane       This leads to        altered vacuolar maturation such that phagosomelysosome        fusion is blocked and the mycobacteriacontaining vacuoles        end up with an internal pH of about  and markers of        phagosomes and early and late endosomes                The mycobacterial genes responsible for these processes are        largely unknown        One method for identifying bacterial genes involved in        pathogenesis is to express these genes in a nonpathogenic        host and isolate bacteria with increased virulence This        technique was first used to identify a gene that enables         Yersinia pseudotuberculosis to invade        HEp cells     In these studies         Escherichia coli bacteria expressing         Y pseudotuberculosis genes were used        to infect HEp cells Only         E coli bacteria expressing the         Y pseudotuberculosis inv gene were        able to invade the animal cells     Using a similar        approach Arruda         et al    identified an         M tuberculosis gene responsible for        invasion of HeLa cells We have previously used a similar        technique to identify         M leprae genes involved in        intracellular survival     That is by expressing         M leprae genes in         E coli we were able to isolate        recombinant bacteria that exhibited increased resistance to        killing by murine bonemarrow derived macrophages                   A similar approach was used by Wei et al    to        isolate          Mycobacterium smegmatis recombinant        clones that displayed a greater than fold enhancement in        survival after  hours         M smegmatis is a fastgrowing        nonpathogenic species of         Mycobacterium in which         M tuberculosis genes can be        efficiently expressed       An in depth analysis        of one recombinant clone revealed that         M smegmatis recipients carrying the         M tuberculosis eis gene on an        extrachromosomal multicopy plasmid displayed  to        fold greater survival in U macrophages than        wildtype         M smegmatis bacteria at  to         hours postinfection     The kDa         eis gene product has been shown to be        associated with the mycobacterial cell surface and is        released into extracellular medium but its precise        function is not yet known            In the studies reported here we used a similar        enrichment scheme to identify two additional recombinant         M smegmatis clones sur and sur        that demonstrated enhanced survival during infections of        THP human monocytederived macrophages The         M tuberculosis ORFs responsible for        increased survival were shown to be         Rvc for the sur clone and         Rv for the sur clone These ORFs        encode proteins with asofyet unknown functions                    Results        Cosmids carrying         M tuberculosis genes    were        electroporated into         M smegmatis LR to create a        library of         M smegmatis transformants each of        which carries a pYUBHRv cosmid integrated into its        chromosome The library was generated from about         independent transformants This represents about          M tuberculosis genomeequivalents        given that  cosmids contain one genomeequivalent of         M tuberculosis            To enrich for clones with increased survival in human        macrophages the library was passed through THP        macrophages as shown schematically in Figure  THP is a        human monocytederived macrophage cell line    and        wildtype         M smegmatis bacteria are rapidly        killed by THP macrophages     After three rounds of        enrichment the resulting clones were analyzed individually        by Southern blot to evaluate the number of different clones        present as previously described     Out of the         colonies recovered genomic DNAs from the bacteria of         randomly chosen colonies were digested with         Pst I and hybridized with the pYUB        vector Strains carrying different cosmids should exhibit a        different pattern of hybridizing bands because of the        presence of different         M tuberculosis HRv inserts Two        clones designated sur and sur were each present three        times and were chosen for further study The remaining         clones each displayed unique patterns        As a first step in the analysis of the sur clone the        time course of its survival in THP macrophages was        determined by infecting THP macrophages lysing the        infected macrophages at various times after phagocytosis        and enumerating viable intracellular bacteria by plating on        solid medium Both parental and the sur bacteria were        rapidly killed during the first few hours after        phagocytosis Figure  The sur bacteria appeared to        survive slightly better at the  hour time point but the        difference was not statistically significant        To compare directly the relative ability of the sur and        wildtype bacteria to survive in macrophages THP        macrophages were infected with a mixture of a genetically        marked control strain and the sur strain and the survival        of each strain was followed independently as previously        described     The wildtype strain expresses the         xylE gene product catechol        dioxygenase such that when its colonies are sprayed        with catechol they turn bright yellow while wildtype        colonies remain white In essence each well of the        experiment contains an internal standard the wildtype        bacteria to which to compare the survival of the        recombinant bacteria In experiments in which THP cells        were infected at a MOI of  results in  phagocytosed         M smegmatis bacterium per        macrophage with a mixture containing equal numbers of        bacteria of the         xylE expressing control strain and a        strain carrying the cosmid vector pYUB the ratio of        recovered white colonies to yellow colonies was  at all        time points data not shown This indicates that the        survival of the         xylE expressing strain was the same        as that of the wildtype and could be used an internal        reference by which to measure the survival of other        clones        In coinfection experiments with         xylE expressing bacteria both sur        and sur bacteria exhibited increased survival Figure         Immediately after the  hour phagocytosis period  hr time        point the ratio of sur colonies to         xylE expressing colonies was  and        by  hours it was about  By  hours the ratio was        approximately  The differences between the ratios at        the zero time point and the subsequent time points were        statistically significant p   for the   and         hr time points The ratio of sur colonies to control        colonies increased from  at time  to  at  hours        and to  at  hours p          Because the recombinant clones contain integrated        pYUBHRv cosmids the following strategy was used to        isolate cosmids corresponding to those in the sur and sur        clones First genomic DNA from the sur clone was digested        with         Pst I and genomic DNA from the sur        clone was digested with         Bam HI to generate fragments of each        integrated cosmid carrying         oriE aph and a portion of the         M tuberculosis genomic DNA insert        The presence of         oriE allows the recombinant to        replicate as a plasmid in         E coli The digestion products were        treated with T DNA ligase and transformed into         E coli XL Blue Plasmid DNA from        the resulting kanamycinresistant colonies were analyzed by        restriction site mapping and partial sequencing of the         M tuberculosis genomic DNA insert as        described in Materials and Methods For the sur        recombinant PCR primers were designed to amplify a  kb        region of the         M tuberculosis insert from         M tuberculosis genomic DNA for use        as a probe in colony blot experiments Probing colony blots        of the         E coli pYUBHRv library with        the  kb PCR fragment led to the isolation of a  kb        plasmid This plasmid contained an intact         oriE and         aph gene a portion of the integrase        gene and  kb of         M tuberculosis genomic DNA Figure         PCR DNA sequence and Southern blot data indicated        that the recovered plasmid was the same as the cosmid        integrated in the sur genome data not shown For        example sequencing of PCR amplicons of the junctions        between the mycobacterial sequences and vector sequences        revealed that the junctions in the recovered plasmid were        identical to those in the sur genomic DNA        Comparison of the sequence of the cloned  kb fragment        with the         M tuberculosis HRv genome sequence           revealed that it contains portions of the         Rvc and         Rvc genes Figure  In the sur        clone the aminoterminal  bp of the  bp         Rvc ORF is fused to  bp from        the pYUB vector to generate an ORF encoding  amino        acids aa compared to  aa encoded by the fulllength         Rvc ORF The insert also contains         bp of the         Rvc ORF fused to  bp of the L        integrase ORF This ORF could encode a  aa protein which        contains the  aminoterminal amino acids of the  aa L        integrase protein fused to the  carboxylterminal amino        acids of the         Rvc ORF        To determine if the         Rvc gene was responsible for the        increased survival of sur bacteria the fulllength         M tuberculosis Rvc ORF as well        as a truncated ORF similar to that present in the insert in        the sur clone were subcloned into the pHIP vector        downstream of the         M tuberculosis hsp promoter The        truncated ORF contained the  bp of         Rvc present in the sur insert        followed by a stop codon but did not contain the  amino        acids corresponding to the vector contribution to the ORF        In coinfection experiments the ratio of         M smegmatis bacteria expressing the        fulllength         Rvc ORF to         xylE expressing wildtype bacteria        was  at time zero and increased to approximately  at         hours and to  at  hours Figure  The clone        expressing the truncated         Rvc ORF exhibited slightly less        but not statistically significantly different increased        survival  at time zero  at  hrs        To investigate the difference in survival at  hours of        the fulllength         Rvc ORF expressing bacteria and        sur bacteria a strain expressing         Rvc and         xylE was constructed and used in        THP coinfections with the original sur clone In this        coinfection the ratio of white sur to yellow         xylE and         Rvc expressing colonies remained         through  hours and then increased to  at  hrs        consistent with the abovedescribed observations        A cosmid corresponding to the one in the sur clone was        isolated from the         E coli pYUBHRv library by        probing colony blots with the  kb         Bam HI         Eco Rl fragment of the         M tuberculosis genomic DNA insert in        the plasmid recovered from the sur clone PCR DNA        sequence and Southern blot data indicated that the        recovered cosmid was the same as the cosmid integrated in        the sur genome data not shown The  kb cosmid in        the sur chromosome contains a  kb fragment of         M tuberculosis HRv genomic DNA        Figure      This region encodes eight potential        ORFs designated         RvRvc as well as the tRNA        for valine        To determine which ORFs was responsible for the        increased survival exhibited by sur bacteria each ORF was        subcloned individually into the expression vector pHIP The        two potential operons         RvRv and         RvcRvc were also subcloned        into pHIP The recombinant bacteria were examined for        survival in the macrophage in coinfection experiments at          and  hours post phagocytosis Figure  Each of the        recombinants tested exhibited a  ratio of        whitetoyellow colonies at  hours Two of the        recombinants demonstrated an increase in the ratio of        whitetoyellow colonies over time while the ratio        remained at  for the other eight recombinants One of        the two recombinants contained the potential operon of         RvRv and the other        contained         Rv only The ratio of        whitetoyellow colonies for bacteria expressing ORFs         RvRv was  at  hours and         at  hours For bacteria expressing         Rv the ratio of whitetoyellow        colonies was  at  hours and  at  hours The        survival of recombinant bacteria expressing the         Rv ORF relative to wildtype was        more directly compared to the relative survival of sur by        doing the coinfections in parallel The ratios of        whitetoyellow for both recombinant bacteria and sur        bacteria were  at  hours  at  hours and         at  hours The differences in the relative survival of        the three strains were not statistically significant        A PCR fragment containing the         M tuberculosis ORFs         Rv          Rv  and         Rv without the upstream promoter        region was cloned into the pBPhin vector which does not        contain a promoter to express the inserted DNA In        coinfections with the         xylE expressing bacteria the        recombinant bacteria containing         Rv          Rv  and         Rv did not exhibit the same        increase in macrophage survival as the sur clone data not        shown suggesting that the         Rv ORF is expressed using signals        upstream of the         Rv ORF        Southern blots of genomic DNA from         M tuberculosis          M smegmatis          Mycobacterium leprae  and         Mycobacterium avium were probed with         Rvc and         Rv Rvc hybridized to bands        in         M tuberculosis          M avium  and         M smegmatis under high stringency        conditions data not shown         Rv hybridized to a band in         M tuberculosis  and under low        stringency conditions recognized a band in         M leprae data not shown        Database searches revealed that         Rvc encodes an kDa protein        which displays significant homology only to a truncated         Corynebacterium        glutamicum hypothetical protein of unknown function         identity in a  aa overlap located upstream of a        gene encoding a fructosebisphosphate aldolase         Rv encodes a conserved        hypothetical membrane protein of about kDa and shares a        motif with the SURF family of proteins The other two        ORFs in the putative         RvRv operon Rv and        Rv share homology with several proteins in data base        searches         Rv may encode a putative        phosphatase and         Rv may encode a low molecular        weight protein tyrosine phosphatase                        Discussion        There are several potential limitations of isolating         M tuberculosis genes involved in        intracellular survival using an enrichment procedure One        limitation is that this protocol is biased towards the        recovery of clones with the greatest increase in survival        relative to wildtype     Thus the recovered clones        are not a random collection of genes involved in        intracellular survival and hence the number of genes        involved for survival cannot be calculated This approach        is also biased towards identifying genes expressing        proteins that directly interfere with the antimicrobial        processes of the macrophage Some types of genes involved        in resistance to killing such as genes that are part of a        multienzyme pathway may not be isolated Also genes        necessary for intracellular survival as opposed to        resistance to killing are not likely to be isolated        Two general classes of clones might be recovered        following enrichment of the         M smegmatis recombinant library for        clones with increased intracellular survival One type        might be clones that carry         M tuberculosis genes that confer        enhanced resistance to the antimicrobial processes of the        macrophage Another type might be clones whose         M tuberculosis gene products are        involved in attachment or invasion or increase        phagocytosis The two genes that were isolated in the        studies reported here confer enhanced resistance rather        than increased uptake That is the ratios of bacteria        expressing either         Rvc or         Rv to wildtype bacteria were         in both the initial mixture and inside the macrophages at        the end of the phagocytosis period Differences in survival        compared to wildtype did not become apparent until about         hours postphagocytosis for bacteria expressing         Rvc and about  hours        postphagocytosis for those expressing         Rv         In this study the enrichment process resulted in the        isolation of two strains containing small integrated        plasmids rather than the expected  kb cosmids            Small plasmids corresponding to the integrated ones were        present in the original         E coli pYUBHRv cosmid        library PCR sequencing and Southern blot analysis        demonstrated that the plasmid integrated in the sur clone        was approximately  kb containing  kb of         M tuberculosis DNA and the plasmid        integrated in the sur clone was approximately  kb        containing about  kb of         M tuberculosis DNA Cosmid libraries        frequently contain clones without DNA inserts     so        it is not too surprising that clones with small DNA        fragments were present in the         E coli library after infection with         phage The small plasmids may have a growth or        replication advantage causing them to be overrepresented        in the library following the various amplification        steps        The  kb deletion of vector DNA in the sur clone        results in a fusion of the ORF of the L integrase with        that of the         M tuberculosis insert such that the        fused ORF encodes a protein that contains only the        aminoterminal  aa of the  aa L integrase The        observation that the sur clone contains an integrated        plasmid corresponding to the plasmid isolated from the        cosmid library suggests that either a the hybrid protein        retains integrase activity b the plasmid inserted into        the attachment site by homologous recombination between         attP and         attB or c a functional integrase        was provided in         trans by a second cosmid transiently        present in the original transformant or by a gene present        in the         M smegmatis LR genome However        repeated attempts to electroporate the  kb plasmid into         M smegmatis LR did not generate        any stable kanamycinresistant transformants data not        shown These results suggests that the hybrid protein does        not retain integrase activity that integration by        homologous recombination into         attP is unlikely and that provision        of integrase activity by an         M smegmatis gene chromosomal does        not occur The simplest explanation is that integrase was        provided         in trans by a second cosmid        transiently present in the original transformant and        indeed         M smegmatis bacteria carrying an        integrated copy of the kb plasmid can be readily isolated        following electroporation of a mixture of the kb plasmid        and a plasmid that expresses integrase unpublished        results        Data base searches did not reveal any homologies that        could be used to predict functions for the gene products of        ORFs         Rvc or         Rv Rvc encodes a        hypothetical protein of  amino acids which displays        significant homology only to a         Corynebacterium        glutamicum hypothetical protein of unknown function         identity in a  aa overlap             Rv encodes a hypothetical protein        of  aa with three putative transmembrane domains and        which displays significant homology only to hypothetical        protein MLCBc in         M leprae to which it is         identical      This         M leprae homologue was evident in        Southern blot experiments done under low stringency        conditions Rv also contains the SURF signature        sequence    and modest homology to members of the        SURF family such as the SURF protein of         Caulobacter crescentus  identity         similarity     SURF proteins are kDa        integral membrane proteins whose precise function is not        known In eukaryotic cells SURF proteins are involved in        the assembly and maintenance of mitochondrial respiratory        chain complexes including cytochrome oxidase             The homology to SURF proteins raises the possibility that        Rv could play a role in resisting the antimicrobial        activities of macrophages by helping to maintain the        stability or function of an important cellular process        akin to the stabilizing role of chaperonins during a heat        shock        In addition to the genes described in this report other        studies with         M smegmatis recombinants andor        mutants have implicated  other         M tuberculosis genes in        intracellular survival Genes identified using enrichment        or screening protocols include Rvc and Rvc        probable glucuronsyl transferases Rv glutamine        synthetase A RvRv thioredoxin thioredoxin        reductase and Rvc          eis unknown function               By screening insertional mutants of         M smegmatis Lagier et al           isolated  mutants with impaired ability to survive in        human peripheral blood monocytederived macrophages and        identified the         M tuberculosis gene corresponding        the mutated         M smegmatis gene for five of them        The genes included Rvc probable         nrdI  which is postulated to be        involved in deoxynucleotide production under stressed        conditions Rv which is a nonribosomal peptide        synthetase that displays strong homology with a         Pseudomonas nonribosomal peptide        synthetase required for the synthesis of the pyoveridine a        siderophore involved in iron uptake Rvc which displays        homology with the S ribosomal protein acetyltransferase        which behaves as a heat shock protein in         Chlamydia trachomatis and Rv and        Rvc which are hypothetical conserved membrane proteins        of unknown function        It should be noted that these         M tuberculosis genes generally        confer only a limited enhancement of the survival of         M smegmatis bacteria in the human        macrophages That is usually only a few per cent of the        recipients are viable  to  hours postinfection This        reinforces the concept that the intracellular survival of a        pathogenic mycobacteria is a complex multifactoral process        The precise roles of any of the identified genes in the        intracellular survival of mycobacteria is not yet known        although several of the identified genes have features of        stress response genes This is not unexpected given the        relatively small enhancements of the survival of the         M smegmatis recombinants and the        numerous environmental stresses encountered in the        macrophage Additional studies such as the construction        and characterization of targeted knockout mutants will be        needed to determine the roles of the proteins encoded by        these genes in the survival of         M tuberculosis in human        macrophages                    Conclusions        Using an enrichment and screening procedure two         M tuberculosis genes Rvc and        Rv were identified that could confer an enhanced        ability to survive in human macrophages to normally        susceptible         M smegmatis recipients The        functions of these two proteins are not known This study        brings the number of         M tuberculosis genetic loci that        have been implicated in enhancing the intracellular        survival of         M smegmatis cells to  The precise        roles of any of the identified genes in the intracellular        survival of mycobacteria remain to be elucidated

of    bacteriamL Equal volumes of          the two bacterial suspensions were mixed to produce a          suspension containing a  ratio of          recombinanttocontrol bacteria A portion of the          combined mixture was plated onto TSA plates to determine          the number of colony forming units CFUs of each strain          in the initial inoculum the  hour time point in          figures The bacterial suspension was diluted with RPMI           FCS to give approximately    bacteriamL          and  mL was added to each well containing    THP          macrophages MOI of

was added to each well to lyse the          macrophages Each lysate was diluted as necessary and          portions were plated on TSA plates The cultures which          were assayed immediately after the addition of the media          with amikacin serve to measure of the number of          phagocytosed viable bacteria the time at which these          cultures were assayed was considered time zero t                      After a day incubation at C the TSA plates from          each time point were stored overnight at C The          following day the plates were sprayed with  M          catechol

       Pst I then ethanol precipitated          The precipitated DNA was resuspended in  L T ligase          buffer GIBCO BRL and then ligated for  hours at room          temperature with  units of T ligase GIBCO BRL The          ligation mixture was electroporated into electrocompetent                    E coli  and kanamycinresistant          transformants were isolated After sequencing the           M tuberculosis HRv insert in the          recovered plasmid PCR primers were designed to amplify a          product containing a portion of the cloned           M tuberculosis HRv genomic DNA

        as fulllength ORFs without their natural promoters The          PCR primers Table  were designed to contain          restriction enzyme sites for cloning of the amplicon into          the pHIP vector downstream of the           hsp promoter as well as the eight          basepairs bp upstream of the start codon of the gene          being cloned Because the           hsp promoter in pHIP contains a          ribosome binding site rbs the spacing between the rbs          and the start codon of the cloned gene is about the same          in these constructs as the spacing between the rbs
