                okay well in the organized  im with Department of Defense and uh we have random drug testing   umhum   and uh the last couple of years and people have really you just accepted that of course the soldiers and then uh the civilians they havent done the civilians yet but personally i dont think see anything wrong with it uh i think its a protection to employers and to employees and everybody else if   umhum yeah the in my mind the people that say that its in violation of their privacy its its actually a violation of the people they work with if uh   uhhuh   its not fair to have people working around you that uh could cause accidents or harm to yourself   you bet i really like it the way they do it in the in the military they go by social security numbers and they take the last number and uh so it uh and it it or or just pick a last number social security numbers uh and thats the way they do it and it works really well   umhum   and um i work with recruiters a lot and they have uh they have it monthly with recruiters   is that mandatory for the recruiters   uh no no uh they do it that way but uh well its every three months excuse me every three months and they have uh we have about um oh a hundred and fifteen recruiters in our area   umhum   and uh they have  a fourth of them every three months they on a random basis   umhum has   but uh   has your number come up   no no hasnt come up i dont know i   umhum   thats fine if it does i  the only thing you have to be careful if i know all those who join the service   sure   uh it is mandatory that theyre tested for drugs   umhum   and uh if drugs are found uh in the system then uh theyre barred for enlistment for six months and then they can come back once and test again and if its uh still positive then they cant join   hm   theyve really cracked down on that and uh i think thats thats good because the source of the bad crime of reputation for for drugs   umhum   but its surprising uh since theyve been on well the first couple of months this has been around for about a year and a half the first few months there was quite a few that were disqualified and uh since then you just never hear of it i guess the word got out and the kids know that if they want to commit and and join then uh they have to be straight   hm   the only thing thats kind of scary if you eat one of these buns with cinnamon with these uh poppy seeds on it   yes   and that would show up   youre kidding   no  no its its uh   huh   its kind of strange uh but uh yeah they they tell them that if they uh       if theyre going to if they come into the motel to stay overnight prior to being physical and tested and then so forth they tell them not to eat anything with poppy seeds on it a hard roll if theyre having lunch or something or dinner but   hm umhum well what does it test uh for   well im not sure and it just shows that theyre uh uh but they they specify that or just tell them that theyll have to kind of be careful well and its the same with alcoholic beverages they they test for that too   umhum   and uh i think its great i really do i mean   yeah   but in the work place i i feel that it it should be uh something that the employers have the right to do if they want   umhum   to protect everyone concerned and   yeah   the the only problem i can see and ive heard is the the fact that if they uh   hm   if the test whoever runs the test theyve got to make sure they run it correctly so its not a a misreading on it or something   umhum   and that thats happened in some instances i guess but uh   hm   i think theyre pretty well ive heard what ive heard and especially the ones that that test the the soldiers they uh they make sure they they run them correctly and uh have the right right person with right sample and everything but   umhum my my companys small enough here that uh   so   in fact i dont know of any companies right around the Twin Falls area thats testing im sure theyre here   uhhuh   but i certainly wouldnt be opposed um is is it hard for you to tell people that are on drugs i mean and i dont know how you can confirm that or not but uh uh id really be surprised if someone in my company was using drugs now it doesnt mean theyre that theyre not there   uhhuh   and maybe the testing wouldnt you know show that they were there   yeah i especially the the uh alcoholic alcohol part of it uh thats a thats a thing that uh   but you can see that pretty easy cant you   yeah right you really can you can and uh
