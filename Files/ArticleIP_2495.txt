                                 Is Clinton a Sex Addict            Bill Clinton our most adeptpractitioner of therapeutic politics has always flirted with dysfunction Sixyears ago during his first successful presidential campaign he discussed hisdysfunctional family history during a televised interview He acknowledged thatgrowing up with an alcoholic parent may have made him particularly eager toplease and placate Veterans of the recovery movement which remained popularin the early s would have instantly recognized Clinton as an ACOA adultchild of an alcoholic Considering his abusive alcoholic stepfather hissubstance abusing brother his mothers penchant for gambling and his owncompulsive eating and alleged womanizing Clintons family looked like a casestudy in a codependency book            Whether you saw this as aweakness or a strength depended on your relationship with the therapeuticculture Real men dont get on the couch a spokesperson for President Bushtold the New York Times  standing up for the American tradition ofrugged individualism But for the millions of Americans who consideredthemselves survivors of dysfunction and abuse and believed fervently in thehealing power of the couch or their support groups Clintons implied awarenessof his feeling reality was much more appealing than any display of machismoBeing in recovery is no weakness to people who consider being in denial theonly alternative            BesidesClinton never actually presented himself as truly dysfunctional Who wouldelect a dysfunctional president Instead his moments of apparentintrospection humanized him and made him seem approachable They helped himpolitically just as Princess Dianas bouts of bulimia helped transform her intothe peoples princess            Clintons desire to please was a classic symptom ofcodependency but those who recognized it as such probably felt closer to himwhen he acknowledged it People who were not conversant in the language ofrecovery might see in his desire to please a talent for compromiseanessential political art As a candidate Clinton deftly balanced hints ofcodependency with the image of a leader in control of policy and the politicalprocess If he could not always control his appetitesfor cheeseburgers anddoughnutshe was someone voters could identify with But his unmistakableintelligence his ability to master the details of complicated policy mattersand his skills at communicating made him someone voters could also admire            The most powerfulcharismatics are those who simultaneously invite identification and awe Andeven Clintons opponents are awestruck by his seduction and survival skillsCharismatic personalities combine transcendent beauty glamour or talent withaccessibility providing a way in for people eager to identify with a higherbeing They seem both ineffable and utterly familiar            But thisdelicate balance of minor private victimless dysfunction and the ability tomaster public issues and events has been endangered by the current scandalsClintons image as a caring leader one who will help us heal has been badlydamaged by Kathleen Willeys story which has put his very membership in thetherapeutic culture at risk The president who ran on a platform of compassionallegedly acted cruelly to someone who came to him in need of it If Willeysstory is true he didnt feel her pain He used it            People steeped in popular therapies seekexplanations Is the president a sex addict some wondered when the Lewinskystory broke In the aftermath of Willeys  Minutes interview theconversation has revived According to Time  Clintons old friend andreputed former lover Dolly Kyle Browning claims that in  she confrontedhim with her suspicions that he was a sex addict just like her According toBrowning Time reports the president broke down and cried Whether ornot this sensational story is true it suggests Clinton is in danger of beingdefeated by the therapeutic culture that helped get him elected            Therecovery movement gave us the concept of sex addiction which is a form ofcodependency In the s the movement popularized the notion that behaviorscould be as addictive as substances such as cocaine or alcohol and it foundedstep programs for compulsive shoppers gamblers sexaholics and so onRecovery enthusiasts would probably be sympathetic to a sexaddicted presidentbut might be unlikely to support him until he agreed to get helpwhich is hardto imagine            To people who are most familiar with the term and mostlikely to take it seriously if Clinton is a sex addict he is clearly not inrecovery Therefore he is in denial To recovery aficionados that probablymeans he is not sufficiently evolved spiritually or psychically to lead thenation They would not expect the president to be devoid of dysfunction butwould expect him to have recognized and vanquished his own abusive behaviorsTo support him would be to support his denials thereby making themenablers            There issome symmetry in the diagnosis of Clinton our therapeutic president aspatient in addition to healer The personal development tradition greatlyvalues the presumed authority of experience and codependency expertsleaderssuch as John Bradshawroutinely confessed their own struggles with variousaddictions in order to bolster their credibility But they marketed themselvesas people who had been through the process of recovery surrendered theirwill to their higher powers and freed themselves of addictive behaviors Fromthis perspective Clinton has yet to get with the program            For people who are not immersed in recovery butare receptive to the notion of sex addiction the presidents dysfunctionsimply means that like Ken Starr he is out of control Nobody wants an outof control president Meanwhile people hostile to popular notions of addictionwill dismiss the characterization of Clinton as a sex addict as an evasion ofpersonal responsibility And indeed some of his supporters may prefer seeinghim as the victim of a disease rather than as an intentional sexualpredator            But lets get clinical Doesthe diagnosis of sex addiction make sense Outside the world of pop psychologyit is likely to engender skepticism The American Psychiatric Association doesnot formally recognize sex addiction as a mental disorder Among experts whotreat and study compulsive behaviors and chemical dependencies there iscontroversy over the meaning of the term addiction and the efficacy of thedisease model for a range of supposed addictions from alcoholism to compulsivegambling            Even if sex addictionexists and even if Clinton qualifies he is unlikely to claim the bannerPolitically its a loser Or is it It did work for Washington DC MayorMarion Barry a selfprofessed sex addict who rehabilitated himself politicallyafter a drug conviction by declaring his powerlessness over drugs and sexrepenting and entering a program Most people are recovering from somethinghe explained to the Washington Post  Barry won back the mayors officeby embracing his own dysfunctionsbut Washington is a dysfunctional city
