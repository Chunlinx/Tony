        uh in Pittsburgh we have just recently in about like last year uh in the fall they started uh a blue bag and and blue container uh sort of program where you know is that the same for you     yeah um well we just have to have put it out in a separate container is is that a curbside pickup then   yeah its curbside and also uh we have a dumpster in the apartment building where i live and theres a blue dumpster too   umhum yeah   when you go to the supermarket they give you uh plastic blue plastic bags   oh okay   but i dont think it works out so well where i live uh im in in the university area uh well because the blue dumpster gets full uh with other things as well so i know that the they reject the uh recyclables when theyre mixed with other trash so it probably doesnt work out too well   yeah as as as as a matter well its a matter of people starting to respect it and understanding what its for and understanding that it actually does help everybody if they all recycle   yeah but it but also uh it this seems kind of its kind of bad but i think it needs to be more convenient to recycle i mean that that almost seems like its its as recycle as convenient as it could be   yeah   but the problem is that you have the garbage dump right there and then you have the recycling dumpster bin right next to it   yeah you just you just need to uh keep a separate container in the apartment or whatever and separate there   yeah but it is pretty nice though that the supermarket im not sure whether i mentioned this uh they give you the the the blue plastic bags uh along when you when you buy your groceries and you just use those to recycle   umhum so is is that mixed all recyclables do you or is it only uh cans and bottles and stuff   well right now and i was just going to go look for the little pamphlet i have about that uh but its um bottles and cans and theyve just added paper to it but what im not sure is whether or not you can put them all in the same bag i usually separate them   oh okay yeah New New Jersey has since New Jersey has had a major waste problem for a couple of years now um right now at least in the town im in they collect all recyclables paper you know newspaper and junk mail in one bag and then mix together cans bottles and thats both aluminum and bimetal cans as well as uh plastics like your soda bottles laundry detergent bottles that type of thing   right im not sure   and you just put it put it all together into one bin its nice and convenient   yeah i think i think uh i think you can put them all in into the same bin im like i like i said i have been separating them just because im not sure uh but im i know that the one restriction they have is that uh youre youre not supposed to you you well obviously you have to clean out anything that had food in it or you know whatever youre not supposed to put things that could have been contaminated   right do do you have to soak off all the labels too   uh no i dont soak off the labels  because that that would be a pretty big pain i i im like i im not quite sure about the exact policy uh because i thought i had uh something laying around uh that specified what the policy was but i could never find it   yeah   so i i mean im sure im sure that it doesnt take that much to to remove the the labels its at least doing something um but i know i mean if if i did there all the rest of the people in the apartment building that i that i i live in probably wouldnt because because theres just just a matter of education its its just not there   yeah well it it its that and also in the apartment building you dont have the fear of being caught   oh thats true   yeah oh in New Jersey they will or they at least they can i i havent really heard of anyone doing this if you put recyclables in with your regular trash they can refuse to pick up your trash   right well thats   but whereas if youre living in an apartment building theres no way of tracing back who put in what   right well what they do uh i i i dont know anyone that uh has has had had this happen to them because no one that i know has a home in the recycling areas yet but uh if you walk along after garbage pickup day uh some people will have their bags still sitting out there with a little note on it   yeah   which ive never read one but im assuming is probably telling them telling them why they couldnt pickup that particular uh bag but   yeah they theyll do theyll do that here too if uh you put out lets say your glass and cans in a paper bag theyll put a big orange sticker on it saying put it out in a plastic bag or a separate container   umhum you know what though i bet if they they could certainly just stick the the rental company with with the uh with the bill or or whatever and they just give the rental have the rental company have more responsibility because theyre really   yeah   in that respect theyre the only people who could have any you know any control over over it over over educating their tenants or you know   yeah the the the problem with that is its such a long way it doesnt ever get back to the tenants that this is something you really need to do because even if they do a slight rent increase its so small and over such a long period of time that no one notices   yeah   yeah the the only other way to uh make it a little more um useful for people to do is what they had down in Atlanta
