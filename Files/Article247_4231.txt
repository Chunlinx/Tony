                                 The GoreBradley Debates Talk to the Hand            In their two televised debates this weekend the Democratic candidates bothshowed substantial improvement since their previousencounter in New Hampshire back in October Al Gore has calmed down Whilestill hyperactive he seemed much less desperate and hysterical than in thefirst debate Bill Bradley was much more keyed up Hes no longer practicingpassive resistance in the middle of a food fight            You got a sense of how Bradley has recalibrated his approach in the first ofthe two events a dull minute Nightline special that kept East Coastpolitical junkies up until after  am on Friday night Bradley finally madean effort to seize the offensive on health care asking Gore repeatedly Whowould you leave out In response Gore just kept repeating his ineffectual andinaccurate answer that his plan would leave no one out            But it was during the much feistier encounter on Meet The Pressthis morningthe most contentious of the primary debates so farthat Bradleyfinally came into his own He performed a sort of political jujitsu I havenever really seen from him before waiting for Gore to charge at him and thenturning the assault back on his attacker Bradley used this technique todevastating effect and he did so repeatedly through the hourlong broadcast             Bradleys best moment came in response to a series of questions from TimRussert about campaign finance reform Gore offered Bradley a compact thatthey both agree to a moratorium on second ads and that they debate twice aweek for the rest of the campaign In a long exchange Bradley grabbed thisweapon out of Gores hand and pistolwhipped him with it Here are somehighlights                           Gore  Wedont have to wait for the Republican nominee to be picked Bill Ill make youthis offer right now If you will agree I will stop running all television andradio commercials until this nomination is decided That can get a lot of themoney out of the presidential campaign and accomplish one of the best reformsWhat about it                           Bradley Sounds to me like yourehaving trouble raising money                           Gore No uh as a matter of fact Imnot                            Bradley I mean this is aridiculous proposal You know the way you communicate with people iswhen you talk to them I love to talk to them in town meetingsthats myfavorite place Ive been doing that since January But I also love to talk tothem over television in their living rooms                            Gore turning to moderator OK heresthe second part of the proposal  Lets debate twice a week from now untilthe nomination is decided and just go facetoface about the issues and get ridof all these television and radio commercials Why not do that                           Bradley You know something For months that I was running for president you ignored me You pretended I didntexist Suddenly I start to do better and you want to debate every day Itsridiculous Were having debates  The point is Al and I dont know if youget this but a political campaign is not just a performance for peoplewhichis what this isbut it is rather a dialogue                           Gore Look we could call this the Meet The Press agreement We could havetwo debates every single week and get rid of all the television and radiocommercials Im willing to do it right now if youll shake on it  extendshand                           Bradley Al thats good I like thathand talks to the hand But the answer is noooo  I mean why should Iagree now Im not interested in tactics Al  And that was a veryinteresting ploy on Meet the Press                            Gore Look Im ready to agree rightnow                           Bradley It was nothing but a ploy                           Gore Debates arent ploys                           Bradley That Come here shake myhandthats nothing but a ploy            Ive quoted this exchange at length because I think it represents a pivotalmoment in the Democratic campaign Im not sure whether the effect fully comesacross in written form but on television Bradley made Gore look like acomplete ass                   Slate               s Chatterbox thinks it was theother way around click here forhis take For more on the debate see PunditCentral Gore gave him an opening by acting like a fasttalking used carsalesman in a plaid blazerBill Ill make you this offer right now Bradleyresponded by snipping off the hucksters polyester necktie saying in effectDo you have so little respect for me as to think Id fall for something thatstupid  While Gore waited with his hand dangling in midair Bradleydisdainfully critiqued and dismissed his whole approach to politics             Bradley was equally effective in neutralizing Goresassaults on other topics When Russert asked Gore and Bradley what steps theywould consider to ensure longterm solvency for Social Security and Medicareboth candidates tried to rule out the option of raising the retirement ageGore then criticized Bradley for having voted in the Senate at one point toconsider raising it Bradley responded that the Clinton administration haditself discussed this option Gore responded that he hadnt ever discussedit                           Bradley You didnt discuss it in allyour Social Security forums out there                           Gore I certainly didnt                           Bradley No one ever did right No oneever did Give me a break                           Gore Bill I voted against raising theretirement age                           Bradley Give me a break But the pointis that at the same time you criticize me for wanting discussion in the UnitedStates Senate on the variety of possibilitiesthe exact thing Tim is talkingaboutyou and your administration are out doing the same thing            What made Bradleys response on this point especially devastating was hisaccompanying hand gesture undoubtedly unconscious but perilously close to theuniversal symbol for pull it a little harder Throughout the entire debatein fact Bradleys facial expressions and body language were those of agrownup compelled to contend with an obnoxious punk  He would fight back ifnecessarybut only after making clear that doing so was beneath him WhatBradley showed I think is that he has found a way around the diabolicalbox that Gore has tried to put him in He has figured out a way to defendhimself without climbing into the mudwrestling pit While Gore rolled aroundin the muck Bradley did no more than take off his jacket and roll up hissleeves            At various points in the broadcast you could hear Gore chuckling andsighing while Bradley was saying something he disagreed with But theseexpressions of contempt have nothing of the force that Bradleys do Goressneering gestures all seemed rehearsed and theatrical Bradley on the otherhand came across as straightforward and real his authenticity underscored byGores plasticity            In sum Gore may want to reconsider his request for twiceweekly debates Afew more like this mornings and hell be kaput
