        uh i get most of my news uh from newspapers really i read the daily newspaper uh the Houston Chronicle and sometimes ill read uh like the uh       uh Wall Street Journal or The New York Times i dont subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it um how about you do you you mostly get news from TV or newspaper   yeah i actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks however i do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page of the Wall Street Journal most everyday   oh uh thats interesting you said computer networks um what uh what sort im fairly knowledgeable about oh okay thats interesting   uh well well Dow Jones for example have a has a uh a news wire and its uh its picked up and actually available um at my office so its no fee subscription im uh very easy to to read at my leisure and um its sorted by category for example so i can read certain businesses or topics   oh is is it is it the AP news wire or is it uh something thats thats a little bit different from that   well its similar to that but its Dow Jones which is um The Wall Street Journals news wire   uh okay so that that thats interesting okay yeah ive had i had access in the past to uh  uh the AP news wire and i found that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news um ive never uh used the Dow Jones news wire but uh yeah it uh do you do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach   um well actually not uh i do uh follow um uh uh i dont know how to how to describe it um so its a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense its a weekly  but uh but not um   yeah   but not like Business Week or uh or News Week or or or one of those kinds of things i id like to say that however um that im overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires   uh interesting in what way in like in sort of like uh a quality a quality or sort of the orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever   um i i think that it i think it has to do with  uh i personally think  i i have a problem with their viewpoint and i personally think that uh  that theres a strong bias   go you well you wont offend me so go ahead and say   theres a strong theres a strong bias in the media   yeah like liberal a liberal type of bias   yeah absolutely after after all who who who writes are people are journalist who are trained to write and theyre thats a liberal   yeah yeah yeah   uh a liberal field at least from academia and uh the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that im   yeah yeah   an expert in i find their descriptions to be wrong   yeah yeah they generally make mistake on anything technical at least but   and it thats right well even if its not technical if its um social thing or or whatever it doesnt matter if im expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things im not expert in that theyre telling me lies   yeah yeah yeah do you by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think theyre deliberate sorts of things   i i think both uh by deliberate um  i mean mistakes mistakes of omission or uh  or uh bias toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal view point that they have   yeah yeah yeah   so uh uh well give an example uh you you well go out of the printing media i know of cases where um for example in television media where theyll show clippings from       one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what theyre talking about is the same thing that theyre showing you   hm   which is sort of like a deliberate bias um which is which is rather disturbing i know ABC does that   hm thats disturbing uh i havent really noticed them doing that but whatever again i dont watch TV news that much now if i had access to CNN i would watch TV news more um i dont you know but i dont usually yeah   yeah i dont have access either although i did at one time and uh it was i did during the Gulf War and it was addictive   yeah did you did you think that CNN well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of uh uh abnormality i just wonder i guess id be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say CNN TV news compared to the three networks um you know whether you thought it was more or less biased or whatever but i i guess you wouldnt  you probably if you just watched it during Gulf War that probably wouldnt wouldnt tell you much   yeah well during that small sample i would say that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks who also had radio then television programming so if at a particular time you wanted to get   yeah   the latest and greatest news you could do that by um turning on CNN and you would   yeah
