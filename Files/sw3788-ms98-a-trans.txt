        and i have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that i hadnt voted in an election yet and although i did go down and register and i thats the first time ive ever done that has whats been your voting experience     my voting experience   well do you feel like uh i mean i   i i well personally ive been very diligent until recent years   umhum uhhuh   when i felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain   yes   for the issues that you know that i felt really strong for um i think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run   umhum   thats really true thats kind of the way that i have felt it i also feel guilty um not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates course we only have mostly the representation given in the media but um i have felt since ive been here that i havent known what the issues were and that i because it was a new community   you really do have to study to get yourself um up to par with what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research and and people today are very busy   umhum it does   and uh and that is an excuse because we are we are always uh involved i know im heavenly involved in other things   yeah umhum   and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i dont have the time to devote to that   umhum no   and uh you hopefully will find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard and unfortunately they are not   umhum no   and uh its really a dilemma uh that we find ourselves in i believe um   right   so i kind of just have taken a back step away and uh hopefully that someone will clean up the mess thats there   umhum   take it it because it is a task that is to me kind of overwhelming   yes and uh and uh i also feel especially in the presidential elections that uh since were back on the old system of electoral votes and or that and that you dont necessarily your vote doesnt necessarily elect a president   right they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes   right and its kind of its awful and and its hard to feel like one person but i know that its important   yeah   and i feel guilty that i havent done that here havent taken the time and i know that you know people can make a difference but its hard to to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what youre up against and it makes me feel bad that im glad i mean i am thankful for the uh  nineteenth amendment that it gives women the right to vote and uh       im glad that that happened   yes   and everything and i hope that i will become a better make a better difference in but i havent done that so far   well i know that when youre in a smaller community i live in Mesquite and uh   umhum   when we have uh a local election say for our mayor and so forth   umhum   they really uh give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper i mean they they just give it a small portion of the newspaper but the local newspaper really goes into uh quite a bit of history about the candidate   umhum   and uh and then they have they raise a they raise two sides and uh theres a pro and a con side and uh you can really um   umhum   feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method   umhum   uh i feel pretty confident about the way its put forth now i wouldnt say that about the larger cities though and the and the country uh like the presidential   umhum right   uh i mean theyve got people that are running that are admitted uh criminals and admitted crooks you know im sorry but   right right   i dont believe in them turning a good uh uh a new leaf   umhum   unless they have the Lord that has done that to them   right   and uh without the Lord they cant do it   yeah and its not very likely i mean it seems like their
