                 okay um  well its not such a bad idea to think about judges uh you know taking the idea of uh uh sentencing in into their hands versus you know the jury especially if its a highly publicized case such as uh youve got cases right now that are going on that everybodys very well informed of or have read uh certain uh things in regards to cases like the Dahmer case in Milwaukee and stuff so its it may be an idea to think about you know cost trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as   yeah   um they may say theyre not biased but deep down they are against against this person or whatever so um i dont think its such a bad idea to think about so   right that a that a a a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not depend and and uh   exactly   not depend so much on the on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective well i i i certainly havent thought much about this but um   umhum yeah     yes yes some of them some of them do and some of them dont but uh this one uh   catches you off guard doesnt it   i was trying to remember back it seems to me that that you know when i studied civics in school or stuff that this   umhum   the juries being involved in the sentencing wasnt wasnt so much and im im trying to figure out whether thats im remembering wrong or whether thats a by state     i didnt think they were either i thought the sentencing was done by the judge and its either guilty or not guilty     yeah yeah and uh i guess i guess  uh and i dont know whether its by state or whether theres been some   changes   Supreme Supreme Court decision perhaps that said that uh that uh as part of the trial by the peers that i had to include the sentencing or too or whatever id yeah but i   umhum   yeah i i certainly wouldnt be uh uh worried about that i guess in terms of the uh uh you know having having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and and uh unbiased uh   oh sure yeah yeah   in terms of doing away with the with the unanimous jury i guess i guess i uh would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in in a trial system that thats just a such a tradition that its a that its got to be a unanimous jury that uh   exactly exactly   i dont know where youd where youd draw the line anywhere else uh you know uh two thirds or three fourths or whatever but uh   yeah yeah umhum   and and i i i certainly wouldnt feel comfortable with just a just a bare majority um   exactly uhhuh yeah thats kind of how i you knows in certain cases i can see them going uh uh just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict   yeah yeah   uh simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small um maybe uh you did a crime that was uh burglary or whatever and it goes into the court case or whatever and its not highly publicized but when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether its through the National Enquirer or whatever   whatever yeah   um its the idea that a person might initially have this thought well jeez this persons guilty no matter what im not gonna listen to the facts or and and   yeah   con their way into uh getting past the lawyers and and getting through that but um also theres the aspect of cost and i im not quite sure how much cost it does take for uh the judicial system to try and call a jury whether its uh very costly or if its something thats not costly or what you know being that im not in the that area i really dont know but i wonder   yeah   if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if theres something that they have to pay i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work or at least give them the time off   yeah   from work uh whether it i think its with pay if i remember jury duty is with pay     well and and im id id i know it is i know it is where i where i work but im not sure that thats   and uh its not it hm   that thats necessarily required uh you know by law that it has to be paid um   paid right   i suspect thats a thats a benefit of a bigger company but but there are certainly some   umhum some that may decide not to     some that some that wouldnt uh yeah   hm
