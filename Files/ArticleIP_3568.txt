overpriced The alternative is to bringyour own and expect to pay corkage I have noted however that even corkagecharges are rising to an unacceptable level Aside from this the charge isincluded in the bottom line bill My question is What might be considered anappropriate tip on the total given that the corkage charge is for service aswell                                       Appreciate your

feelingexpansive they let the grand total determine the tip And sometimes the totalcan be quite grand Other times when overtaken by the enough is enoughgremlin they compute the gratuity based on the food adding a modest incrementto acknowledge that wine was served As anyone who can read a wine list knowsa bottle of wine can be trs pricey and the same effort is exertedpouring from a  bottle of wine as from one that costs             Prudie penuriously                                             DearPrudence                                                      Howabout all the showers at

business that is going well I studied English in Koreaso I manage with customers After being here a year on a visit to Korea a manI knew younger than me pursued me with ardor and convinced me to marry himMr Koh stayed in Korea for many months It was hard to ever get him on thephone                                       He said that if I wouldfinance his martial arts studio he would move to America to be with me I didand he moved here with his three teenage children who are wilder than my twoThere was not too much married activity if you can know what I mean Then hereturned alone to Korea saying his business couldnt do as well here as thereHe left his children with me and he uses one of my credit cards                                       I haveno idea about what he plans but I have the awful feeling that he may have usedme for a green card and for a way to keep his children in America I am afraidto tell him I want to divorce because husbands are not easy to find There isa chance that he is better than I think What do you think                                       ANK in WesternMass                        DearAN            Prudie thinks your use ofthe subjunctivehe may be

Ive read with interestyour comments and others responses on the use and abuse of Viagra As a userof the previous wonder drug of the moment Prozac I am uneasy I suppose myunease is based on how quickly public discourse has switched from the medicalbenefits of Viagra to stories of otherwise healthy people going to incrediblelengths to get something they dont medically need It allows Those of Us WhoWould Never Do Such a Thing to wring our hands and complain while feelingsuperiorconveniently ignoring actual discussion about messy subjects such asimpotence or depression and our societys feelings toward these conditions andthose who have them                                       Viagra and Prozac couldhave been used as a starting point to discuss why impotence and depression areunderdiagnosed and undertreated Instead with Prozac we got stories about thespecter of perpetually peppy sales reps and erroneous reports that it causespeople to go on murderous rampagesalmost as titillating as Viagra abusersperpetual erections Ten years after the introduction of Prozac depressionstill labors under public misconceptions about its prevalence andtreatment                                       Viagraand Prozac are used to treat real medical conditions The abuse potential is aworthy subject for public discourse but does nothing for the individualsufferer who would benefit from taking the drugs                                       Sign me No ErsatzMurderous Rampages Just No Longer Depressed                        Dear No            Prudiehopes the public prints are not
