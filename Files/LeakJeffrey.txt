                     Resident with me and the most from my childhood was ah the story about my grandmother         My mother Im Im from Charlotte and my mother was from here as well she died in  yeah December  and she the only girl of  kids         She had nine brothers         I had nine uncles         Three of them are still living         Uh but one of the stories uh my grandmother was born in  yeah  and she lived to be ah          So she had  kids and of course her parents had been slaves                     Uhhuh                     So um my mother grew up out near the airport near in the Steele Creek community and um my grandmother for all those years all the th century basically lived out in the country until the last three years of her life         She came and lived with us         But she had her leg amputated so she moved in with us and we took care of her         Uh but before that she was in the country and so my mom use to talk about how as the only girl she would have to wash dishes and do the domestic things so even at dinner Sunday dinner if their were a chicken if they had fried chicken my mother had to wait for her brothers to eat the choice pieces of chicken and then she could eat a wing or a back or a neck and to the day she died thats how she was         If she fried some chicken for us shed always eat the smallest pieces         The meager looking pieces         So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny uh had decided she was going to go to town and you know back then youre talking oh probably s early s uh my mother wouldve been  or  somewhere around there and Granny uh went to the train track to get on the little trolley train whatever they had at that time to come downtown                     Uhhuh                     Well during her absence my mom was suppose to clean the house and probably prepared dinner and stuff like that         This was a Saturday         Well my mom thinking Oh Moms gone all day         Shes gone hang out a little bit         Well after about I dont know about two hours two and a half hours I think my mom said Granny came back and she was quite upset         One Mama hadnt done any work she was suppose to do and she got a beat down all right and two Granny had sat about two hours at the um train stop and she hadnt noticed the tracks had been moved                     Uhhuh                     So there was no longer a train that ran there and so         I dont know what the um I dont know what the rationale was for all of that         I guess they just changed the route and what not but uh she laughed about that all the time my mom did she didnt laugh at the time she was getting beat ah but she use to always tell us that was really the only time that she got beat                      Uhhuh                     by Granny and and she never beat her boys because her boys could did no wrong in her mind         So thats probably my favorite story about uh or from my mom that I recall         I believe yeah         And then hum theres another story well this is a this is not a this is not a story she passed down this is a story of mine I guess                     Uhhuh                     That happened with Mama and Granny and my sister Reda                     OK                     Now bear in mind that I told you Granny moved in with us um towards the later years of her life and when she moved in with us I was in the th grade so I was just starting high school         Um you know going through puberty and dating and playing basketball and stuff like that         That that was my favorite sport         So my senior year I went to the health department to get a physical         Thats required for those who are playing sports                     Yeah                     You got to have a physical         No problem         I was up on Beatties Ford Road         Everybody knows where the health department is there         Well standard procedure back then I dont know what it is now is that you come in someone comes in and they give you now I dont if its like this now but back then they would give you a bag of prophylactics condoms all right         So they gave me a bag and I didnt really you know pay any attention to it         So I said OK fine and I actually put them in my trunk trunk of my car                     Uhhuh                     This was like a Monday or a Tuesday         Now my mother never drove her entire life she never drove so I took her wherever she went                     Uhhuh                     Took her to the grocery store took her to church stuff like that         My grandmother never drove either even before she had her leg amputated         So Sunday comes around and this particular Sunday were taking Granny to her home church                     Uhhuh                     Out in the Steele Creek area out past the airport         And thats fine you know Im driving         I got ah at that point I was driving an Oldsmobile Delta          It was a diesel         And so this Sunday morning we had eaten breakfast and were getting Granny situated in her wheelchair and everything and that was pretty much my job and I told my mom and my sister to go out to the car and open the trunk         And my sister Rita did that         All of a sudden we hear these yells                     Uhhuh                     Oh my goodness somethings happened Mama         Come back here         Im thinking they found a dead dog or you know something in the driveway backyard         Then Mama goes uh Oh Lord help me                  I say What is the problem         And so Jeff Jeff get out here right now         I mean everybody in the neighborhood         I mean its Sunday morning and this is an old black neighborhood everybody knows everybody         And so I take Granny out wheel her out through the front door         I said Well I say Granny Mamas calling me         Somethings wrong but lets go on out and Ill get you situated in the car         And um get her in there and around to the back         Explain this and I said Explain what         I just told you to open the trunk         Well low and behold the condoms which are multicolored had fallen out the bag         So they spread out all over the trunk red green blue whatever         And its Sunday morning were on our way to church         Im like Well Im speechless what am I going to say they already convicted me now my mother and my sister         So needless to say that that ride to church was very quiet and they said Excuse me this afternoon you and your nephews my sisters kids who are my age uh were going to have a talk after dinner         And so we had the birds and the bees talk after dinner                     Uhhuh                     Now remember my mother was at that point at that point she was probably she had me when she was  so she was close to  yeah she was close to  at that point         And its hard enough talking to your parents about sex if theyre fairly young         Its definitely hard getting it from a  year old                     Uhhuh                     Now of course my dad never talked to me about any of that stuff but thats another story         So we had Sunday dinner and we went through the dos and donts of sexuality         Needless to say my nephews and I were quite embarrassed and didnt want to be there         But they were just convinced that they were getting ready to just ruin our lives but some women were going get us to do some stuff they didnt need to do and we were going be some babys daddy and Lord and thats my story in terms of um um something we still laugh about my sister and I yeah                     Thank you                     That will work
