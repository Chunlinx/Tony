                what part of the country are you in   uh Pennsylvania yeah   oh you are East or west im from Pittsburgh   oh are you really what part of Pittsburgh   yeah um the South Hills area Beaver County well originally Beaver County   uhhuh   and uh where are you from   uh Clarion County   oh okay i know where that is   i live we live out in the country   yeah thats pretty out there What well   yeah we have we have two children that live in Pittsburgh  yeah   oh okay yeah i got my brother and my whole family there im im talking to you from Dallas right now uhhuh     oh oh you are do you work do you work for Texas Instruments then     no my husband does and who how about you   oh uhhuh no im just my son works for a computer a computer uh federal company you know   place that that needed this well thats okay i guess its an easy thing to do so youre you have a big do you have a rural house or what do you have   so yeah uh we have a big old farmhouse that weve you know remodeled   oh thats a uhhuh those are beautiful   it had been you know of course a farm its a farm community and we   uhhuh yeah is it a is it a working farm or is it   ours is not a working farm   more more i can understand that thats probably what i would uh   yeah i have a garden but you know we have a garden but we dont farm   yeah i can hear the accent now i hear the  i hear the Western Pennsylvania um we live uh we lived in Minneapolis for about five years we we originally lived in Dallas and we met and got married and then   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   um actually married in Pittsburgh and thats thats not what they want to hear on this call uh at any rate we came back here with my husband was transferred around uh up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T i   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   and were leasing a uh two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas   oh uhhuh   and its uh near a little town called Plano well its not little any more   uhhuh uh Grapevine do you know Grapevine   uh yes thats out near the airport thats about forty five miles from us   yeah my brother has a home there hes trying to sell he hes living now up uh in in Maryland but uh he  lived lived in Grapevine for a long time   its yeah thats why we not sure we were not sure we want to uh buy down here because we actually we lived up north long enough to appreciate the um Minneapolis Saint Paul is very clean you know in terms of     um uhhuh uhhuh   and in terms of housing down here um you really have your pick but its just everythings overpriced for the economy   oh its terrible   it really is i mean were were in a leased town home and its uh youre probably your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking its nine hundred a month   i oh im not surprised   but you know what if you if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living     uh right right right   you know the big apartment complexes and and i just have no tolerance for that   right yeah yeah its not good   no i prefer   and the people think the income is really great in some of those areas but when they sit down and look at what it costs  to live   thats right   and uh  of course most of the homes are you know fairly nice theyre uh done up fairly nice uh   yeah but like the town home were in i dont know how i mean we this is its like a duplex like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh and its nice but its i mean the girl bought it for a hundred and ten and now she cant sell it And our neighbors     right uhhuh right   uhhuh well prices have come down on the homes the duplexes   yeah i mean well our neighbors the attached on the other side theyre very nice thank God they paid fifty eight for it   uhhuh oh my heaven   thats how bad it i know   well i know up in Connecticut the same thing happened and uh its people are devastated because they paid so much for their home   thats right uhhuh yeah i have some friends that live in Westport and its really really bad i mean you   but we like our area it like i said its its an old house and everything but uh   uhhuh how far where is Clarion County in relation to actually because were considering moving to Pennsylvania   well were about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh   thats not too bad thats north   north and yeah and its its really not you know not that far   are you going up toward uh uh im trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M Bradford no thats too far north     Bradfords north of us   so youre youre not that far north then okay well youre really not too bad yeah   no no uhhuh   um was it a home that youve had for quite a few few years or that youve   well weve been here since sixty six   oh then you have yeah do you have a lot of land or   uh we have fifty acres well pardon me we have forty we gave ten to one of our children   oh my well then there you go did you have a hard time getting used to do you feel like you live in an isolated area or     no not really and and towns keep creeping closer and closer you know   yeah i think that thats um i can remember in Pittsburgh when this has to do with homes uh indirectly but i can remember when upper Saint Clair was out in the you know     uhhuh   the rural end of Washington and now its  its a terrible connection     yeah its ours up here we have our rural connections are real bad   oh well thats okay um   but we but we live about ten miles from probably three or four not large towns but you know reasonable   but but substantially yeah substantially you know um do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that   uh yeah were tired of doing it though we we dont want to do too much more   how big is it how many square feet do you have   uh oh golly i really uh we have um   well how many rooms do you think yeah   uh four rooms downstairs and a pantry and upstairs we have a bath a bath oh we have a half bath downstairs too we have a bath upstairs and one two   uhhuh uhhuh   three four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room   a junk room yeah i understand we have that too thats thats large if your children arent at home any more thats large if your kids arent at home any more   and uh pardon well it really isnt too big yet we we like a lot of people say that but um   uhhuh   its we just like it real well and   its enough space for two people  yeah   yeah we had five children so and theyve all moved you know on theyre all out on their own now     yeah oh okay yeah right thats okay well weve got um this this town house is pretty big its about eighteen hundred square feet its got three bedrooms two and a half baths um its really nice   uhhuh well it sounds like a good buy   yeah it is i mean i would never buy it but leasing it is fine   uhhuh   um but its just again the the privacy you know um we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres and my husband was raised um on a working farm near Dayton   oh and that makes a big difference   right near Dayton Ohio and he said you know hes hes slowly getting me to um not feel isolated if we move to to where theres more land   uhhuh you really arent isolated because its the advantages is your home is far enough away that youre not bothered by being too close to people but yet you can have your friends uh you can have them in you can go out you uh   right uhhuh   you have more of a choice youre not pressed upon as bad     thats kind of what like his parents have uh land that they retired to um about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and in Georgia and it is too far south for me but um   uhhuh uh uhhuh   um but i mean they have one of the um when they said log cabin i just laughed that they retired to but they built one of these i mean its just beautiful   uh   its like a custom you know its not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins  you know i mean its modern its right right its modern its beautiful its country its you know um   uhhuh   more luxury uhhuh uhhuh right yeah   but uh i dont what else about housing except its uh well Pittsburghs housing economy i i i think its holding its own   uh theyre yeah i suppose they are now we both of our children who live there have just bought a home now   what part what sections are they in   uh in the Mount Lebanon area   yeah thats nice   and uh the one the one boy the house they bought is completely livable they didnt have to do much to it   great   the other one is uh uh has you know needs more work done its twenty years old i think and but they have two children too and they they bought what they could afford   uhhuh uhhuh thats yeah a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills and theyve been in their house oh probably about twelve years now and um its its you know theyre going to start to see their return on their investment very soon um but its a beautiful home and   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh they are beautiful homes   i mean my brother lives is it called Baldwin or Bebble i mean he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon um its real pretty up there its just   uhhuh uhhuh   it is its real nice   and the neighborhoods are stable you know its uh when you come to this part of the country weve been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing   uhhuh oh my you would you do when you move when we first got married uh my husband works for the state and we moved once a year usually   oh my goodness   and then after they had to start paying to move us   uhhuh   that suddenly wasnt necessary any more   thats what it is here yeah thats why were at a point now weve uh were adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get  well be staying in  so   right yeah you have to stop some place yeah   yeah thats kind of like where were so were considering Pennsylvania and were just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know a lot of people say it doesnt matter where they live if they have a nice house and but i disagree with that i   yeah yeah uhhuh well i do too ive heard too many people say i hate it here you know they buy a place and they just hate the area   uhhuh i know and it and the economy here in Dallas i mean it its steady but its still not going up and i um i just refuse to buy it um if i know im not going to be there for at least   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   five years uh you you know   yeah well my brother theyre having trouble selling their home they   oh im sure yeah there i mean you can go down a street and here he told you this every other house you know if its been foreclosed on or you know even big executives um   hm right uhhuh oh yeah yeah   its really i mean a and and its hard to sell the properties people from JC Penneys from New York came here about a couple of years ago   uhhuh uhhuh   and they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property Jean   oh uhhuh uhhuh   and it would make you ill to see this   yeah   i mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something   i i couldnt handle that   yeah i know and thats you know like i can look outside right now and look into the next unit you know its across the way and its landscaped and all that with azaleas but its still its still not that private     uhhuh uhhuh i get tired uh sometimes mowing because we mow you know a good bit of ground around the house area and i do get tired of that but uh   yeah but you have a rider   i dont know i dont think id want to change it   no and your kids have to tell you the truth um i think that if you can keep that that way you know kind of like a homestead   uhhuh
