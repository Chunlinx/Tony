                                 Victor Hugo Lives            Composers are always settingto music the words of great poets but does the music give us any betterunderstanding of the poetry There is the case of Victor Hugo a poet of longagoborn in France in  died in who in recent years has somehowrisen ghostily from his grandiose patriots tomb in the Pantheon to become inour late  th century the poet of the hour so far as musicgoes            Musicbased on Hugos writings is everywhere today Les Misrables  themusical based on Hugos novel of the same title opened in France in  andin a somewhat different Englishlanguage version has been playing on Broadwayand touring the United States for  years now with no sign of disappearingsoon Last year Disney came out with an animated movie musical for childrencalled The Hunchback of Notre Dame  based on Hugos NotreDame deParis  This year Hyperion Records has issued a CD Songs by CamilleSaintSans for piano and voice with  of the  songs from poems byHugo Which is to say Victor Hugo rendered into music is coming at us fromthree directions today triophonically so to speakas a Broadwayextravaganza as a mass entertainment for children and more arcanely asclassical music in a  th century French style            You might suppose that Hugo himself or his shade facedwith these sundry renditions would take particular exception to the idea of amovie cartoon for children But that is not so certain Sometimes Hugo welcomedadaptations of his writings and as for children he wrote a volume of poetryLArt dtre grandpre  devoted largely to the topic of childrensplay Its true that in The Hunchback of Notre Dame Disney has done awretched job though The technique of the Disney empire like that of TheInvasion of the BodySnatchers  is to get hold of the outer shell ofsomeone elses desouled creationHugos medieval fantasies AA Milnesstories about WinniethePooh or anything at alland fill it with a creepycommitteederived cheerful substance of Disneys own That is a pity not tomention a crime            The songsin Disneys Hunchback  by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz are amishmash of the ersatzsometimes imitating the oldfashioned Broadwaycleverness of George Gershwins brother Ira the lyricist as inHunchback s A Guy Like You sung by stone gargoyles which you canlisten to briefly by clicking  though I dont advise it other timesimitating the modern Broadway cleverness of Les Mis as inHunchback s opening number which you can also listen to with a click though why But theres no point in looking for Hugo in any of thateven ifits worth noting that Disneys single inspiration of any worth inHunchback  the talking stone statues was originally conceived by Hugohimself in his epic poem La Lgende des Sicles             Iwent to see Les Mis  the Broadway showexpecting something no better than the Disney production given the tinselstupidity of most Broadway musicals today But Les Mis  as untoldmillions of theatergoers have discovered before me turns out to be anintelligent and moving show Technically speaking it is an opera all singingand no talkingexcept that unlike a regular opera the music byClaudeMichel Schnberg is intended strictly as a velvet background velvetClick to see what I mean intended to display the jewels which are the lyricsThese lyrics have been composed by a committee consisting of in the Frenchoriginal Alain Boublil and JeanMarc Natel with the addition for the Englishversion of Herbert Kretzmer aided by James Fentonthis last person being afirstrate poet and arts critic well known to readers of the New YorkReview of Books  From this assemblage has come more lyrics than you wouldthink possible in an evenings entertainmentwordy rhyming couplets pouringoutward from the stage in a ceaseless gush until you feel you have beendrenched as you will see if you click             Thelyrics tell a story that sticks pretty closely to Hugos novel and even to itsleftwing spirit which I much appreciate Les Mis is decently Hugolianin that respect Even the rhyming couplets stand closer to Hugos spirit thanyou might imagine His own theater playshis play Hernani  for examplewhich set off a riot in Paris when it was originally staged in consist inlarge part of very similar verse The only difference is that in Hugosoriginal writings the wordy rhymed couplets conjure a feeling of endlessverbal ingenuity advancing majestically at a stately pacewhereas with thelyricists committee at Les Mis  everything rushes forward pellmell asalways in modern Broadway productions and clichs tread on one anothersheels and you have this feeling of a hidden stage director crying NextNext            If you want the true Victor Hugo rendered into music youhave to get hold of Hyperions CD of Songs by Camille SaintSans  verycapably performed by the baritone Franois Le Roux and the pianist and musicscholar Graham Johnson The songs are in French of course which is part ofwhat it means to have the true Hugo who once said The measure of a nationsintelligence is its ability to speak French They are written in the lightteary lovely style of  th century French songthe style that youcan see in a little pastoral love poem of Hugos with the singer and pianistjoined by Philippa Davies on flute by clicking  The songs convey some of theorderliness and purity of Hugos poetic imagination his unflappable fluencyhis verse structures varying with perfect control as if every possiblevariation on rhythmic and melodic order lay easily within his graspas in forinstance the opening bars that you can hear by clicking             But isthere any advantage in listening to Hugoor to any poetthrough thesoundboard of a composers music I find it enjoyable to listen to the musicalsettings by SaintSans but then again a little disappointing Poetrycontains its own music even if the music is only hinted at and if somecomposer comes along and fills in the hints with imaginings of his own theeffect is to close off possibilities for your own imagination Claude Debussyonce said to the poet Stphane Mallarm that he had set a poem of Mallarms tomusicto which the poet is said to have replied I thought I had already donethat            The splendidly incongruous th century musical resurrection of Victor Hugo makes me concludethat when composers set a poets work to music the best thing to do is inthe case of a fiasco like Disneys Hunchback  to stay away completelyand in the case of a show like Les Mis  to enjoy the story withoutpaying any attention to the literary art In the case of a SaintSans on theother hand the best thing is to savor the musical settings and the wordstooand then put aside the music to enjoy Victor Hugo the poet as presentedby himself on the printed page with piano accompaniment and vocal sonoritiesprovided by your own dreamy imagination
