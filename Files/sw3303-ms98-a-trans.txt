        okay you wanna go ahead and tell me your favorite team or who you think will be doing well this year     uh well where im from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference and course we have Duke University that was the national champions last year so im kind of hoping that theyll repeat again this year they have a lot of the same players back   now we talking about is this the NBA this is college college okay   no this is college basketball right we have like Carolina and Duke and Georgia Tech and NC State teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty   umhum   so hopefully well have a good year i dont really  follow the NBA very closely   and see thats probably all all i like saw while i we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas and theres so many colleges and universities in Texas we havent really followed them too much and none of them are our our alma mater  so that seems to help   do you like professional basketball   uh  ive uh follow it especially around the playoffs so course i was real familiar with the Utah Jazz and the Mailman or Karl Malone was you know pretty big thing and the Lakers have always been amazing to watch   yeah   no i i did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks theyve not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with with Tarpley and maybe now that thats over theyll theyll come out of it but     well thats an up and coming team though   yeah i hope they do something they need to or theyre not going to have any esteem left at all   thats somebody you can get behind and be patient     yeah kind of like the Cowboys i guess   yeah they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons   yeah they coming out of it this year well see if it holds on   but i think Chicago will probably win the NBA again   the Bulls   yeah   yeah theyll probably be pretty good and course the Celtics theyre always really  really good too with their players   thats true   be interesting to see how the the Olympics does this year with all the  the NBA players playing on the Olympic team   thats true it will be interesting and itll certainly be different   so yeah i dont know how close ill follow them and and the season hasnt started yet im usually more at the end of the season person and we need to talk about baseball  and so       yeah oh my Atlanta Braves   well they did well   well i really do uh yeah the basketball season supposed to start in the next couple of weeks  its a long season   its yeah yeah it is it is and thats why ive i guess my mind went blank its like last season was so long ago and i havent really even started thinking about basketball yet so   yeah   but this wasnt a good subject but but well see how our predictions come true   its a little early we definitely will   okay well its good talking to you   good to talk to you byebye   alrighty byebye
