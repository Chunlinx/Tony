                    Background        Fungal pathogens can be important selective forces on        plants in habitats favorable to fungal development but        estimating the magnitude of selection by fungal pathogens        in nature is difficult The development of fungal disease        in plants has at least three important control points the        prevalence of fungal inoculum the environment during        infection and disease development as modified by plant        defenses      Most field studies on wild plants have        not measured pathogen abundance but have focused on disease        expression        Atmospheric moisture is generally        the single most important environmental factor influencing        the incidence and severity of fungal diseases on plants                High relative humidity and several hours of        free surface water are critical for both spore germination        and successful infection       In addition        infection ie invasion of plant tissue by the fungus        and disease ie the expression of symptoms such as        lesions or necrosis    on plants due to airborne        fungi are favored by temperatures of C             Field studies on plant pathogens have demonstrated that the        growth of fungi is favored by high moisture and moderate        temperatures        and that low relative        humidity and extreme temperatures inhibit growth and spore        germination      Other studies on soil fungi also        show that prevalence differs among habitats and seasons and        correlates positively with moisture and negatively with        temperature      This apparent positive relationship        between moisture and fungal growth and abundance may result        from the high surfacetovolume ratio of fungi making them        vulnerable to water loss        The positive association between habitat moisture and        the incidence and severity of disease suggests that the        selective pressures imposed on plants by pathogenic fungi        may vary among habitats However the relationship of        habitat characteristics to inoculum abundance infection        and disease is poorly understood This study focuses on        abiotic correlates of inoculum abundance It is not an        attempt to describe the distribution of particular species        of fungi but rather to obtain an independent predictor of        the prevalence of fungal inoculi in different habitats To        do this we examined fungi in the air and on leaf surfaces        rather than trying to separate opportunistic and obligate        pathogens from nonpathogens First it would be        impractical to identify all fungi sampled and second there        is no reason to expect that pathogens and nonpathogens        differ in their abiotic requirements for growth The growth        and sporulation of many pathogens is favored by high        humidity and temperature requirements are similar to other        mesophiles with ranges between  and C and optima        between  and C       Thus characterizing the        weather conditions favorable for fungi in general may be        useful in predicting the extent of selection imposed by        pathogenic fungi on plants in different habitats        In this paper we report the relationship of fungal        abundance and species richness to abiotic factors such as        weather elevation geographic location and soil        characteristics in the Intermountain West Although a        geographically restricted area Fig  the Intermountain        West encompasses a diverse array of habitats from desert to        alpine habitats Our goal was to estimate habitat        favorability to fungi by relating weather and other        environmental conditions to fungal abundance and richness        Given that the distribution and abundance of organisms as a        function of environment provides the fundamental basis of        many ecological and evolutionary disciplines            establishing a better understanding of fungal distributions        in natural habitats is central to the study of mycology and        plant ecology                    Results                  Fungal abundance and richness          In order to estimate fungal abundance and richness of          different habitats we sampled fungi from the air and the          leaf surfaces of the vegetation We used three different          media in case fungi had different growth requirements          potato sucrose agar casein agar and agar made with          extracts of sagebrush leaves For vegetation sampling          we found no effect of media type on fungal abundance          KruskalWallis nonparametric analysis                          P   or on fungal richness                                   P   Therefore for the          vegetation sampling we averaged data from the three          media types to obtain one value for the abundance and          richness at each site For the air sampling in  we          found no effect of media type on fungal abundance                          P   or richness                          P   so we averaged data from          the three media types Lastly for the air sampling in           we averaged the data from the  plates          Because one time sampling may not adequately estimate          fungal abundance and richness in the community we          combined the vegetation values and the two air sample          values to give one index of fungal abundance from each          site and one index of fungal richness from each site          Table  To calculate this index we standardized the          values for the vegetation sample by dividing the value at          each site by the mean for all sites This gives an          average index of  We repeated this procedure for the          two air samplings using their respective means For each          site the one vegetation and two air samples were          averaged to obtain an index of fungal abundance Fungal          richness was calculated the same way The resultant          average fungal abundance positively correlates with the          average fungal richness across sites r             P            We compared habitat differences for each of the fungal          sampling techniques in question independently For fungi          sampled on vegetation field sites differed in fungal          abundance KruskalWallis nonparametric analysis                          P   and richness                          P   For samples from          air field sites differed in fungal abundance                          P   and richness                          P   in  and in           fungal abundance                          P   and richness                          P   Fungal measures          obtained from vegetation and air sampling in  were          not correlated abundance r             P   richness r             P   Fungal abundance in air          was positively correlated between years r             P   but this          relationship was not significant for fungal richness r                      P                            Weather          Two years of data  and  were compared for          seven sites and weather patterns were similar between          years data not shown The weather within the two field          sites with duplicate dataloggers had no detectable          withinsite differences data not shown Conversely the          weather across field sites had a broad range of          temperatures and moisture regimes Table  With the          exception of the seasonal maximum and minimum relative          humidity all weather variables differed considerably          among sites The average temperature for the growing          season ranged from C to C The average relative          humidity ranged from  to  and the average diurnal          maximum in relative humidity ranged from  to  The          duration of unfavorable periods expressed by the average          number of consecutive days with maximum diurnal relative          humidity less than  ranged from  to  days While          relative humidity is a measure of available moisture in          air the VPD is an absolute measure of the moisture          deficit of air Therefore temperature has a negative          effect on relative humidity and a positive effect on VPD          During the growing season the average VPD ranged from           kPa at the hottest site Gunlock C to           kPa at the coolest site Racetrack C Sites with a          high VPD had a higher variance in VPD than sites with low          values of VPD the standard deviation in VPD explained           of the variance in average VPD            P                            Relationships of fungal abundance and richness with          weather variables          Fungal abundance and richness of the field sites were          related to many of the weather variables however single          weather parameters averaged over the season such as          temperature or moisture generally explained less          variance than composite weather variables such as the          average number of consecutive days with a maximum diurnal          relative humidity less than  Table  Temperature          was negatively related to fungal richness r             P   but not to fungal          abundance The relationships of the average relative          humidity of the growing season with fungal abundance r                      P   and richness r                      P   were stronger than the          relationships with temperature An even stronger negative          relationship was observed with VPD and fungal abundance          r             P   and richness r                      P   Fig           A greater proportion of the variance in fungal          abundance and richness was explained by the proportion of          time conditions were favorable for growth Table  The          favorability indices were the proportion of days and the          average number of consecutive days with temperature          between  and C plus a maximum relative humidity          greater than  Both measures were positively related          to fungal abundance r             P   r             P   respectively and          richness r             P   r   ns          respectively Variables based on maximum diurnal          relative humidity greater than  consistently had          stronger relationships than variables based on relative          humidity greater than  data not shown          Measures of unfavorability explained even more of the          variation in fungal abundance and richness among sites          Both the proportion of days and the average number of          consecutive days with maximum diurnal relative humidity          less than  were negatively related to fungal abundance          r             P   r             P   respectively and          richness r             P   r             P   respectively In          fact the average number of consecutive days with a          maximum diurnal relative humidity less than  was the          best climatic predictor of fungal abundance and richness          Table  Fig  Most weather variables were highly          correlated with each other so combining variables          through stepwise multiple regression explained no more of          the variance in fungal abundance and richness than did          the average number of consecutive days with relative          humidity less than                           Weather stations          Fungal abundance and richness when regressed against          climate records from nearby weather stations displayed a          positive relationship with precipitation abundance r                      P   richness r            ns and a negative relationship with temperature          abundance r             P   richness r             P   The trend for fungi          to be less abundant and diverse as temperatures increase          and moisture decreases is consistent with the results          obtained from the direct weather measurements Table                                    Geographic pattern          The fungal abundance and richness of the habitats has          a geographic and elevational pattern Table  Fungal          abundance and richness were positively related to          latitude r             P   r             P   respectively and          elevation r   ns r             P   respectively A          negative relationship was found between fungal richness          and longitude r             P   but this relationship          was not significant for fungal abundance r            ns                          Sitespecific factors          There was a positive relationship between the presence          of streams or lakes at a site and fungal abundance r                      P   and richness r                      P   However the presence          of water at a site was not related to the average          temperature r             P   or the relative          humidity r             P   of the site The          associated vegetation indicative of moisture also          explained a significant portion of the variance in fungal          abundance r             P   and richness r                      P                            Soil          We found no significant correlation between soil          properties and fungal abundance and richness  organic          carbon in soil  nitrogen in soil pH of soil  sand in          soil  silt in soil or  clay in soil However we          noted trends for fungal abundance and richness to be          positively related to soil organic carbon nitrogen          clay and silt and negatively related to soil pH and          sand                            Discussion                  Abiotic predictors of fungal prevalence          Fungal abundance and richness were clearly affected by          weather showing large differences among habitats          Weather parameters differed considerably in the amount of          variance they explained in the fungal abundance and          richness of the habitat As demonstrated by previous          studies both temperature and moisture were important in          explaining the fungal abundance and richness of the          habitats All three of the humidity variables averaged          over the growing season VPD relative humidity and the          average maximum diurnal relative humidity were highly          positively related to both measures of fungal prevalence          Table  These data are consistent with studies of crop          plants that suggest dew duration relative humidity and          temperature are critical parameters for predicting the          extent of disease          Of the three          humidity measures in our study the average maximum          diurnal relative humidity was the best predictor          explaining  and  of the variance in fungal          abundance and richness respectively Because most          mesophilic fungi fail to grow at less than  humidity              it is not surprising that the maximum relative          humidity was a better predictor of fungal prevalence than          the average          Because extreme temperatures below freezing and above          C likely impede the growth of most mesophilic fungi          regardless of moisture conditions      one might          predict that the length of the growing season would be          positively correlated with fungal abundance However in          our study we found that fungal abundance and richness          decreased as the number of consecutive days without          freezing increased Furthermore there was a weak          negative relationship between fungal abundance and          richness and average temperature These negative          relationships may result from the fact that our field          sites with a longer growing season are hotter and drier          than sites with a shorter growing season          Although direct weather measurements almost always          explained more of the variance Table  data on          temperature and precipitation obtained from weather          stations were significantly related to fungal abundance          and richness and had similar trends as data obtained in          the habitat Hence in the absence of direct weather          measures weather station data may be of value in          predicting fungal abundance and diversity                              Proportion and duration of favorable or unfavorable          days          All weather variables expressing the proportion of          time with favorable conditions in a habitat high          relative humidity with moderate temperatures had a          positive relationship with fungal abundance and richness          Table  Although previous work has emphasized using          favorable conditions to explain fungal distribution              in our study the parameter that explained the          greatest amount of variance was an index of unfavorable          conditions the average number of consecutive days with          maximum relative humidity less than  Fig  It is          not entirely clear why unfavorability was such a strong          predictor as most spores are probably capable of          surviving these conditions although fungi might not be          able to sporulate germinate or grow                               Habitat and Geographic patterns          The abundance and richness of fungi were related to          the presence of water in a habitat and to vegetation          indicative of moisture Table  Drier habitats          generally have less vegetation than do moister cooler          habitats and plant biomass has been shown to accurately          predict the microbial biomass of the soil     These          observations indicate that the plant community may be a          good predictor of fungal abundance and richness          The geographic trend in Utah of fewer fungi with          decreasing latitude and increasing longitude may be          explained by more arid weather towards the south and west          than towards the north and east Table  Western and          Eastern Utah are divided by two biogeographic provinces          that differ in precipitation patterns     Western          Utah is part of the Great Basin which receives the          majority of precipitation during the winter months when          most fungi may be dormant Conversely Eastern Utah is          part of the Colorado plateau and receives a substantial          amount of precipitation during the growing season                            Conclusions        Our data indicate that microclimate strongly influences        the abundance and diversity of fungi in the Intermountain        West Even though both measures of fungal prevalence were        strongly correlated across habitats we propose that fungal        richness is a better indicator of habitats favorable to        most fungi than is fungal abundance In other words a high        fungal richness may be a superior indicator that conditions        of the habitat are broadly favorable to fungi Because a        few species may produce abundant spores during periodic        conditions of high moisture and moderate temperatures        sporadic sporulation events may affect fungal abundance        measurements and overestimate the habitat favorability to        most fungi        A surprisingly large proportion of the variation among        sites in fungal richness was explained by the proportion of        days with favorable conditions of temperature and high        humidity r   The number of days with unfavorable        periods was an even better predictor r   Because        fungal pathogens appear to have similar abiotic        requirements for growth as most fungi        it        is likely that fungal pathogens would show correlations        with climate that parallel those reported in this study        This suggests that moister habitats will have a greater        inoculum potential from pathogenic fungi than drier        habitats An elevated inoculum by pathogens could be        largely responsible for the increased incidence of fungal        disease documented in moister habitats We would also        predict that a high prevalence of pathogens would select        for greater levels of antifungal defense by plant species        adapted to moist habitats Thus weather factors identified        in this study as being important predictors of fungal        abundance and diversity in general may also shed light on        the distribution of fungal pathogens and the extent of        selection on plant defenses                    Materials and Methods                  Study sites          The Intermountain West is topographically and          climatically diverse and provides many different habitats          to study the relationship between weather and fungal          abundance and species richness We selected  field          sites approximately  hectare in area in and near Utah          that differ in factors that influence weather such as          elevation longitude and latitude proximity to permanent          water sources and topography To eliminate comparing          habitat extremes all  field sites share a widely          distributed species of shrub sagebrush           Artemisia tridentata Asteraceae          Community types include arid grasslands with cacti          riparian communities characterized by cottonwoods and          subalpine areas with tall forbs and aspen stands          The Intermountain West consists of two biogeographic          provinces the Great Basin and the Colorado Plateau that          differ in precipitation patterns and drainage              While both the Great Basin and the Colorado Plateau share          weathers with cool wet winters and relatively dry          summers they differ in that the Colorado Plateau has          wetter summers and drier winters than the Great Basin              There is also a trend for sites to have lower          total annual rainfall towards the south and west                          Fungal culturing          Fungi were collected in the air and on the vegetation          see below and were grown on plates containing growth          medium This method quantifies a portion of

 Leaves were placed under a hood for one day to remove          chloroform and then dried at C to constant weight           to  days We homogenized dried leaves in  ml of          water and then

September of  we measured fungal abundance          and richness in each habitat by culturing fungi found on          the vegetation in  communities Because some plants          contain secondary metabolites on the leaf surface that          inhibit fungal growth we cultured fungi collected only          from leaf surfaces of the species that were not aromatic          when their leaf surfaces were rubbed Using sterilized          scissors we collected one cm of leaf material from each          of seven haphazardly chosen plants from three to five          species and combined all seven in a single sterile vial          This was repeated using the same plants Leaf samples          were collected in the late afternoon and stored at C          for up to  days before culturing The relationship of          diversity and abundance of culturable fungi with storage          time was not determined To remove fungi from leaf          surfaces we soaked and vortexed leaf samples for           seconds in  ml of a sterile aqueous solution containing          a  sodium chloride  casein and  sucrose We          spread  l of the inoculated solution onto one cm          Petri plates each of potato sucrose agar casein agar          and sagebrushleaf agar Since we collected two          vegetation samples per site there were two plates of          each of the three media or six plates per site          We incubated the inoculated plates at room temperature          C for  days before counting the number of colonies          per plate as a measure of fungal abundance We found          little change in the number of colonies after  days          presumably due to the proliferation of the aggressively          growing fungi We classified the colonies under a          disecting microscope  to  into morphotypes based          upon colony morphology effuse raised domed or          umbonate color transparency and shape irregular          crenated or rhiziod We scored fungal richness as the          total number of morphotypes per plate We averaged fungal          measures from two vegetation samples for each of the          three media We did not attempt to identify species or to          compare morphotypes across plates Although the different          media probably favor different fungal species our goal          was not to measure habitat differences of specific fungi          but to estimate the overall fungal abundance and species          richness of the habitats Furthermore the fungal          measures likely represent the abundance and richness of          mesophiles because the temperature C used to          incubate inoculi falls within the temperature optima of          mesophilic fungi                          Air sampling          During September of  we collected airborne fungi          at  sites by vertically swiping three agar plates one          each of potato sucrose agar casein agar and          sagebrushleaf agar ten times in the air During October          of  we collected airborne fungi at  sites by          swiping  potato dextrose agar plates vertically           times in the air At each site the replicate plates were          collected at  haphazardly chosen locations to obtain an          average measure of fungal abundance and richness of the          habitat Samples were collected in the late afternoon We          incubated inoculated plates in a cooler at ambient          temperature approximately C for  days and examined          plates in the field Fungal abundance and richness were          scored as above                          Direct weather measurements          We recorded the average temperature and relative          humidity every  minutes at  of the  study sites          with NOMAD dataloggers OMNOMADRH Omega          Engineering Inc Stamford CT protected in a          weatherproof casing For all sites we recorded the          weather for a complete growing season midMarch of           to midOctober of  To compare annual differences in          weather we also recorded weather from June of  to          midOctober of  at seven sites To investigate          differences within a habitat two sites were equipped          with two dataloggers each Using these data we          calculated weather variables that are commonly reported          in the literature see below                          Temperature          We calculated the following temperature parameters in          C for the entire growing season average standard          deviation of the minute readings range maximum          and minimum We also calculated a length of growing          season parameter equal to the maximum number of          consecutive days without freezing temperatures                          Relative humidity          The growth and survival of a fungal spore germinating          on a leaf depends on the amount of moisture available in          the air and the length of time the leaf surface is wet              Dew formation can be critical for spore          germination of many plant pathogens and may be the best          indicator of the proportion of time a habitat has weather          favorable to fungi Although the duration of leaf wetness          is frequently measured in agricultural studies     it          is not practical for many ecological studies However          relative humidity of the air is a good measure of          moisture availability     The relative humidity            RH  where           RH             e

water vapor pressure in the          air           e                       a             to the maximum amount of water vapor that air can          retain at a given temperature the saturation vapor          pressure            e                       s             where           e                       s                        e TTthe units of           e                       s            are in kPa and           T is the Celsius temperature Buck           Using the relative humidity records from the          dataloggers we calculated the following relative          humidity parameters for the entire growing season          average and the standard deviation of the minute          readings average of daily maximums and the seasonal          range maximum and minimum

in kPa is the maximum amount of water vapor          that can be retained in air at a given temperature minus          the actual water vapor pressure in air     This          measure reflects the desiccating capacity of the air          Using the minute readings of relative humidity and          temperature from the dataloggers we calculated the          average VPD and the standard deviation for the entire          growing season                          Proportion of time a habitat has weather favorable          or unfavorable to fungi          We calculated weather variables that reflected the          proportion of time a habitat is favorable or unfavorable          for fungal growth We calculated the proportion of time          based on the minute averages over the growing season          that the temperature was between  and C    and          also had a relative humidity greater than  Three          other indices were calculated as follows the proportion          of days when the temperature remained above C and below          C as well as having a maximum relative humidity that          was i greater than  ii greater than  or iii          less than  A broad temperature range  to C was          used to represent the range of temperatures likely to          support most mesophilic fungi        Because          the growth of mesophilic fungi can occur between  and          C with optima from  to C a temperature of C          may represent a conservative minimum at which mesophilic          fungi grow and a temperature of C may represent a          conservative maximum at which mesophilic fungi grow                          Duration of periods with a favorable or unfavorable          weather          We calculated weather variables that reflected the          duration of consecutive favorable or unfavorable days in          a habitat We estimated the average number of consecutive          days during the growing season when the daily temperature          remained between  and C as well as having a maximum          diurnal relative humidity that was i greater than           ii greater than  or iii less than  The          maximum number of consecutive days also was calculated          for the same three parameters                          Climate estimated by nearest weather station          We estimated the climate of each site using the          monthly average precipitation and temperature collected          by weather stations located  to  km from the study          sites For three of the high elevation sites Francis          Racetrack and Strawberry in Northern Utah we used          records from Alta Utah a site with similar altitude and          location within  km of the three sites Climate data          were obtained from the Western Regional Weather Center          and elsewhere     Climate records covered  to           years depending on the site                          Sitespecific factors          We scored two other sitespecific factors the          presence of nearby water sources and vegetation types          indicative of moisture       For the presence of          nearby water sources we gave a score of zero for none           for ephemeral water sources such as washes and a          score of  for habitats with permanent water sources          such as streams and lakes We listed the five most common          plant species at each site determined visually and          scored sites for vegetation types indicative of moisture          Plant species characteristic of dry habitats such as          cacti and yucca were given a zero Each plant species          indicative of intermediate levels of moisture such as          juniper pinyon pine scrub oak and rabbit brush were          given a score of  We gave a score of  for each          plant species characteristic of mesic habitats such as          riparian vegetation tall forbs aspen and spruce          Therefore the highest vegetation score a site could have          is                           Soil          We also measured soil properties that might be          indicators of habitat moisture To control for variation          in soil nutrients due to seasonal fluctuations we          collected soil from  sites within a month during the          spring of  Because overtopping vegetation can affect          the nutrients in the soil below we collected samples          away from overtopping vegetation     We discarded          the top  cm of soil and collected  to  kg of soil up          to a depth of  cm We dried soil samples for  hours          or until constant weight at C For particle size          analyses we removed rocks before sieving     We          determined the percent silt and clay using a hydrometer          We determined soil pH using  g of ground soil in  ml          of distilled water To determine percent organic carbon          and nitrogen of soil by mass spectroscopy we first          removed the inorganic carbon by bringing soil samples to          a pH between  and  with N hydrochloric acid Soil          samples were then flash combusted on an elemental          analyzer Carlo Erba Milan Italy coupled to an isotope          ratio mass spectrometer Finnigan MAT Bremen Germany          operated in continuous flow mode                          Data analysis          We performed univariate and multivariate statistical          analyses in SYSTAT Version     and JMP SAS          Institute Inc Cary NC For differences in fungal          abundance and richness among media types and sites we          applied KruskalWallis nonparametric analysis Using          simple linear regression we analyzed the natural log of          fungal abundance and richness as a function of the          previously mentioned weather variables For periods when          the dataloggers malfunctioned and did not record          temperature and humidity we estimated missing values in          SYSTAT by their correlation with data from other seasons          at the same sites For example spring data were missing          from the Canyonlands field site so we used summer and          fall correlations of relative humidity and temperature          across all sites to estimate the missing value for          Canyonlands There were three sites with missing values          for spring three for summer and none for fall To          determine whether two weather variables could explain          more than a single variable we applied stepwise multiple          regression
