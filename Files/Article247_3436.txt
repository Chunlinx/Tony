                                 Americas Fear of Teenagers                        This is my summer schedule which is basically no schedule at all  mydaughter whos  is away at camp the two of us are rattling around thehouse with no classes meetings etc to worry about  closest thing tonirvana except for places like the McDowell Colony where they give you mealsand bring lunch to your studio door            On Columbine before I forget I dont in general buy as a sufficientexplanation for media obsessions that its all about ratings and sellingpapers for two reasons First because you have to ask why huge numbers ofpeople are so interested that they watch the TV shows and buy the papers Andsecond because the money explanation assumes a detached cynicismor a totallymechanical subservience to their bosses interestson the part of thereporters editors producers etc who are responsible for the actualcoverage when in fact journalists are caught up in the same fears andfantasies as their audience As I see it Columbine hit more of a culturalchord than the Atlanta murders because Americans are in turmoil about childrenand teenagers On the one hand everyones political agenda is rationalized asprotecting children whether its censorship and drug testing or welfare andgun control on the other adults are fearful of young people feel thattheyre out of control and at the same time guilty about the many ways kidsare being shortchanged in this enormously pressured workobsessed and uptightenvironment            Speaking of drug testing according to todays Times  the ACLU hastaken on the case of highschool kids in a small rural town in Oklahoma whoare forced to take urine tests if they want to participate in extracurricularactivities or take the classes that are in some cases connected with theseactivities Aside from the travesty against the Fourth Amendment this is justanother example of the paranoia and contempt aimed at teenagers Treat themall like presumptive criminals who deserve no autonomy and respect and thenwonder why some actually fulfill your expectations            On the hatecrime issue its true you cant execute someone twice but mostsuch crimes are assault or rape or lesser degrees of homicidenot capitalcrimes For the record Im basically against the death penalty on the groundsthat its application is discriminatory mistaken executions of innocent peopleare inevitable keeping people on death row for years during the appeal processamounts to cruel and unusual punishment yet limiting appeals is even worsetheres no evidence that executions have any practical deterrent effect andemotional catharsis is not a good enough reason for the state to kill peopleBut Im not an absolutist on the subject For instance theres a legitimatequestion to be raised about what you do about someone whos already servinglife without parole who kills an inmate or guard how to deter a murderer whoshoots the cop trying to arrest him figuring he has nothing to lose and othersuch situations And then theres the issue of whether politically motivatedmass murder like the Oklahoma City bombing should be in a special categoryWhich leads back to the issue of why we ought to create a special category forwhat Im calling intimidation or political terrorism because these crimes aremore deleterious to the social fabric than ordinary crimes I disagree with youabout Matthew Shepard I believe it was a lynching Those guys were out toteach himand by extension all gay mena lesson            This is already too long so later for Maureen Dowd What do you think ofthe Village Voice redesign And whats the NYPress inhouseculture like
