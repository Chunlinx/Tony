hand President Nelson Mandela is compared to GeorgeWashington On the other the Mandelaled coalition government of severaldisparate political parties has crumbled The largest white party bolted andhas taken an increasingly intransigent stance toward Mandela Whats thedeal            SinceWorld War II two organizations have dominated South African politics Foundedin  by Afrikanersdescendants of  th and  thcentury Dutch settlersthe National Party demanded the end of Britishcolonial rule South Africa was a Commonwealth member until  When theNational Party took power in  it imposed apartheid disenfranchising and officially segregating the countrys black majorityMillions of blacks were transported to homelands small tracts of landconsidered foreign countries In the s the African NationalCongress  a party founded by the countrys small black middle class in to combat segregation adopted a Marxist line The ANC also started receivingfunding from the Soviet Union and employing terrorist tactics            The ANC and the National Party were forced into oneanothers arms in  Economic sanctions and political pressure applied bythe international community on South Africa weakened the National Partysresolve and the collapse of the Soviet Union left the ANC without outsidefunders When the ANC renounced its Marxist intentions to redistributewealth it no longer threatened white privilege Frederik W de Klerk the headof the National Party and president of South Africa released ANC presidentMandela who had been jailed for  years and lifted a longtime ban on the ANCthat had forced the group into exile in Zambia            In April South Africa held multiracial elections To ease the transition todemocracy de Klerk and Mandela agreed that the first postapartheid governmentwould include all major political parties  with each partys Cabinetrepresentation proportional to its electoral strength The ANC won more than percent of the vote and the National Party won  percent making Mandelapresident and de Klerk only a secondary player It was an untenablerelationship The National Party disagreed with too many of the ANCledgovernments liberal policies including affirmative action legalization ofabortion and abolition of the death penalty Last June the National Partywithdrew from the government            One of the National Partys main grievances isthe Truth and Reconciliation Commission impaneled by the government toinvestigate political violence from the apartheid era Headed by Nobel PeacePrizewinner and antiapartheid activist Desmond Tutu the committee grantsamnesty to all who confess to political crimes as long as the crimes are notdisproportionately heinous By the time the commission stopped acceptingamnesty applications two weeks ago it had received more than  requestsMost came from lowlevel white officers in the police and army Only two formerCabinetlevel government officials applied Most apartheidera officials takede Klerks position denying knowledge of assassinations or instances oftorture Tutu however protests that he reported cases of illegal governmentviolence to de Klerk several times            Last month de KlerksNational Party repudiated the Truth Commission calling it a politically drivenwitch hunt  bent on proving the existence of a systematic program ofviolence where none existed Blacks have also criticized the commissioncomplaining about the generous amnesty provisions            Tutu hasmostly received high praise for his evenhandedness At one point hethreatened to resign if the ANC did not admit that it had ordered violenceFour members of Mandelas Cabinet have admitted to plotting ANC brutalitiesDeputy President Thado Mbeki whom Mandela has anointed as his successor hasalso admitted that he commissioned acts of terrorism when he was amember of the ANCs national executive committee Tutu will issue a report ofhis findings at the end of the year            The National Partys obstreperousness could bode ill forSouth Africa The armed forces police and bureaucracy are still dominated byholdovers from the apartheidera government who have longtime allegiances tothe National Party They could erode the credibility of Mandelas governmentAlso the National Partys witch hunt allegations could undermine thespirit of reconciliation that the Truth Commission and coalition governmentwere intended to foster            De Klerk has also discussedmoving the National Party toward the center campaigning on a platform ofChristian values intended to appeal to black conservatives as well Butsome local National Party leaders are allying with rightwing radicals who arecampaigning for a separate white state These local alliances could presage ashift further rightward            Despiteits tactics the National Party is slipping in opinion polls Meanwhile theANC enjoys wide support  though its popularity has as much to do withMandelas charisma as with its own platform Mbeki notorious for his wonkishstyle and nervous tics polls poorly            ANC power will most probably be challenged inthe  election by the left Expectations that the ANC would oversee landreformreturning land seized during apartheids forced migrationsand wealthredistribution have not been met Unions protest that the government has notfulfilled promises made to labor Black South Africans may throw theirsupport to the PanAfricanist Party a leftwing spinoff from the ANC Orradical politicians could challenge Mbekis control of the ANC and return theorganization to its leftwing roots            A lawandorderbacklash is also possible After the collapse of the apartheidstatesecurity apparatus worldwide crime syndicates from Colombia Nigeriaand Thailand set up operations in South Africa As a result the murder ratethere is now the highest in the world per  people Police are saidto be inept and corrupt The classic example An automatic teller machine wasswiped from police headquarters in broad daylight            The postapartheid SouthAfrican economy has averaged  percent annual growth for the last three yearsInflation is at a year low of  percent The countrys resurgence has beenattributed to Mandelas freemarket policies His government has cut the budgetdeficit from  percent of the GDP to  percent deregulated aviation andtelecommunications and cut taxes Corporations have responded by funnelingmillions into ANC campaign coffers However unemployment is at percent  and the average black income is onesixth the average whiteone
