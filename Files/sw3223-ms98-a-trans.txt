        well i almost forgot the topic i was waiting so long for uh for it to find somebody       uh   it was its on your favorite TV shows and why   right well so what is your favorite TV show   uh Major Dad   oh you like that one   i i love it i think it promotes good family values and its funny   umhum  ive ive never really watched that one you know its funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows   thats right yeah uh   and uh you know theres so theres only a few that i that i like to watch routinely   what kind do you like to watch   probably my favorite is um oh well i i like shows like Growing Pains and uh whats the other one now they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night so i dont get to watch it very much   Wonder Years   Wonder Years yeah thats my favorite uh   i like both of those real much also i i think basically they promote same thing they promote family values   yeah yeah Wonder Years i i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever i guess i can really really relate to it and uh its just a real cute show uh i i guess i like the shows that really have a a real sense of uh  i dont know honesty or sort of a purity value i guess   i do too i i dont like it uh lot of the shows that that ive liked in the past like uh oh Golden Girls and some of them tend to get so risque and when you have children   uhhuh yeah   uh watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me and uh   right right   thats one of the reasons i mean  if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was Little House on the Prairie   uhhuh yeah my wife really likes that show   yeah which i just i always i always felt was wonderful uh and so many of them nowadays like i said i think are just um   uhhuh   uh they they go after   yeah   well  like i said the risque stuff just i guess they think thats what people want to watch   yeah well there was but theres a sense of honesty i guess purity in the show like one of my favorite shows used to be Happy Days but uh   yes   you know Richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure i guess and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it and i never did like it after that   yeah umhum umhum   so i i dont know i i say see the same thing in like Wonder Years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere   yeah i i agree uh do you like the sports programming   yeah uhhuh   um i i enjoy those also almost as as much to a certain extent im our whole house is baseball fans and uh we enjoy that and uh   uhhuh so youre gonna watch a game tonight   oh yeah oh yeah theyre   so do you do you have a favorite for the series or anything   uh probably the Pirates but only because of Steve Bushel i guess  otherwise i really dont care that much but uh you know im im   oh uhhuh yeah   annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him and uh id like to see him do well laugh all the way to the bank i guess   yeah yeah hes a nice guy  i i take it you live in the Dallas area do you live in the Dallas area   with as much pardon uh live in live in Plano   uhhuh yeah i live in Garland and yeah i i like Steve Bushel but i dont really like the Pirates im a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan so uh im kind of im kind of pulling for the Braves over all they you know they   umhum umhum   theyve come from so far down  i really would like to see them do well   well yeah yeah its uh its what i keep hoping the Rangers are going to do     yeah one one year then maybe theyll make it i dont know   right   so  but uh yeah id like sports programming quite a bit but uh i guess my my favorite shows are the and you know the getting back to a point that you made thats really true we are watching Roseanne i guess couple of weeks ago and her daughter was talking about birth control you know and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time and  you know shes only seven years old so   umhum well its so many of them now um  you know it it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in and and uh   yeah   you know im  you know im im an adult and i have adult tastes now but i dont need that   yeah yeah yeah   uh i i like things that uh uh are wholesome i guess   yeah well that that seems to be more our values too like like the Wonder Years i i mean uh its kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers you know or and and you can kind of relate to it you know i dont know thats i enjoy that a lot   umhum yes yes   but uh you know i i i agree with you the and its funny because the shows like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like Threes Company and stuff i think they they maintained people would watch them because there was that uh you know there was really the period that was going on there i mean he really wasnt messing around with the girls but everybody perceived him that way and stuff   umhum   but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died   yeah   and its its interesting that that a lot of the shows are that way
