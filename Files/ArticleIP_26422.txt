                                  Double Take            Since NATO began bombing Yugoslavia a month agoAmerican hawks and doves have agreed on one thing NATO and the Clintonadministration have miscalculated The administration completelymiscalculated when it launched the air campaign declared Sen FrankMurkowski RAlaska April  They assumed that the Serbs would immediatelyretreat when the bombs began to descend            This critique is well founded but its only halfof one dimension of the story In war there are two players and each canmiscalculate Furthermore war has a psychological dimension in which eachsides morale is undermined by its mere belief that it hasmiscalculated To win the practical war you dont have to calculate perfectlyAll you have to do is outcalculate your enemy Likewise to win thepsychological war all you have to do is make your enemy secondguess hisbelligerence more than he thinks youre secondguessing yours The surest wayto lose the psychological war is to fret that you have misjudged your enemysresolve while failing to entertain the possibility that he will decide he hasmisjudged yours            The miscalculation critique permeated Wednesdayswar debate on the House floor It appears that President Clinton and otherNATO leaders mistakenly thought that bombing specified military targets inSerbia and Kosovo would send a message to Yugoslav President Milosevic thatwould cause him to quickly embrace the NATO peace plan It is obvious this wasa gross miscalculation charged Rep Bill McCollum RFla Rep Chris SmithRNJ denounced the tragic miscalculation by President Clinton thatMilosevic would back down if we bombed Serbia for a week or maybe two            Since this way of framing the conflict treats NATObut not Yugoslavia as a rational player susceptible to threats punishmentfailure and reevaluation Yugoslavia is happy to encourage it Last FridayYugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic warned that a NATO ground invasionof Kosovo would be yet another miscalculation by those who have already beenproved wrong so far posing dangers to the whole continent and drawing theUnited States into a quagmire that would make Vietnam look like nothing            Tuesday morning NATOs military commander GenWesley Clark decided he had heard enough of this critique Wrapping up hisopening remarks to reporters in Brussels Clark turned the miscalculationargument on its head Milosevic said Clark may have thought that NATO reallywouldnt launch the airstrikes But he was wrong He may have believed theywouldnt last after they were started Wrong He may have thought that somecountries would be afraid of his bluster and intimidation they would withdrawthe use of their bases or buckle under his intimidation He was wrong Hethought that other countries might rush to his aid Wrong again            Clark went on He thought that taking prisonersand mistreating them and humiliating them publicly would weaken our resolveWrong again He thought his air defense would be effective against ouraircraft Wrong He thought his troops would stay loyal Increasingly heswrong about that There are more desertions Former generals are under arrestDissent is growing louder and louder Military press censorship has beenimposed He thought he could hide the truth from his own people I suppose andincreasingly hes wrong in that Were winning Milosevic is losing and heknows it He should face up to this and he should face up to it now            In recent days other NATO and US officials havereinforced Clarks campaign to counterframe the miscalculation thesis NATOspokesman Jamie Shea suggested that the assignment of fresh Yugoslav troops toKosovo demonstrates yet again Milosevics miscalculations He thought he coulddefeat the KLA in a short fivetoseven days operation  This wascompletely wrong and is further testimony to the success of the air campaignSen Joe Lieberman DConn contended that Milosevic counted at the outsetof this when he moved his forces into Kosovo on NATO breaking up quicklyandquite the opposite has happened White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhartpredicted that Milosevic will change his calculation as his apparatus ofpower is progressively destroyed            Did NATO misjudge Milosevics efficacy and resolveAbsolutely But to debate that question by itself is already a loadedproposition because it overlooks the corresponding question of whetherMilosevic has misjudged NATOs efficacy and resolveand whether heaccordingly can be humbled into reconsidering his belligerence before wereconsider ours Gen Clark understands that in war morale is both vital andrelative He has heard enough pessimism from pundits and politicians on thesubject of whether NATO has miscalculated He is not interested in changing theanswer He is interested in changing the question
