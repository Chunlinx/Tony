                                 Somebody To Lean On                        One issue about masculinity that intrigues me revolves around the experienceof dependence Traditionally in America dependence was dishonorable for menwomen were allowed to be taken care of as part of caring for others meninstead have been pushed to become selfreliant Manly equals selfreliant Infact this traditional image of masculinity is nonsense Imagine for instancesomeone at the beginning of an affair declaring Dont worry I can take careof myself I will never lean on you You would soon lose interest after allyou wouldnt really matter in the other persons life But American men in myexperience have a great deal of trouble saying I need you It seems weakand so shameful            Faludis interviewees hew to this silence and I wonder if that isnt partof their trouble Again I think economics matters in this silence today Theideology of work in modern society puts great emphasis on independence ontreating oneself entrepreneuriallybut if you treat yourself as an independentagent you dont establish much emotional connection to other people Its thesame problem If you dont acknowledge you need them they are not going tocare much about you Unlike Shoshana I dont see the modern economy in factgiving people more independence as she herself has shown experiences such asworking from home via the computer often plunge people into situations wherethey are more tightly monitored than if they were working in a traditionaloffice So perhaps part of the trouble with conceiving of strength as autonomyis that it makes people feel actually worse about the tangled web ofdependencies that in fact rule their lives Men in particular            This insight isnt really mine The psychologist Carol Gilligan in her finebook In a Different Voice  has probed the destructive consequences ofmanly silencefor men themselves as much as for the women and children whofall under the spell of this silence In fact making issues of dependenceovert and legitimate requires a great deal of personal strength You need toknow what you need and you need to figure out whether someone else can helpyou I missed at the end of Faludis study a discussion of this dynamic ofmasculinity though the problem surfaces in her interviews again and again            Id like to end this discussion however by saying that perhaps unlikeShoshana I think Stiffed is an admirable serious and humane book Itrecords the deadend society has put men into as workers parents andcitizens Stiffed is blessedly free of jargon and full of tellingdetail Its analysis is meant to provoke debate and will continue to do so Ithink people should read it and argue with it
