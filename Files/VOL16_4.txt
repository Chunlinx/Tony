                              The Germanization of American English            I can still remember the disappointment I feltmany years ago when I first discovered that thephrase to be in the picture had been stolen from meIn England we had a always used this phrase to meanto be in the foreground to play a prominent partIf I said Im just not in the picture when Boris isabout this meant that in the presence of Boris Ihardly counted I was scarcely noticed  It was a nicegraphic way of putting it  Then I came across theAmerican usage for the first time the employmentof the same phrase to mean to be informed in theknow I was annoyed I was embittered for I foresawthat the genuine English usage was going to beousted by this upstartand how right I was  I wasall the more annoyed because I knew where the newmeaning came from from German from the phraseim Bilde sein   Some German or Swiss or Austriansettler in America had wrongly translated his nativeexpression into English the unsupecting Americanshad taken it over and now we had it round ournecks while the original genuine English expressionhad received the kiss of death            Ever since that time I have writhed repeatedlyas I have seen one Germanism after another creepinto the English language  I suppose most Germanswho settled America especially recently were fairlyliterate people whose sayings were easily taken aslegal tender by the local inhabitants  Americans tendto be uncritical and snap up everything new acceptingthe mistakes that Germans make as featuresof American English  Today these Germanisms donot even stay put in the United States  They arepromptly exported across the Atlantic so that allBritain now speaks pidgin German            This must actually have begun before my timefor in the twenties of this century I was alreadystubling upon what were clearly Germanisms inuse in America  The dumb blonde who got fresh wasobviously eine dumme Blondine die frech wurde   InBritish English the verb stem had always meant tohold back resist as in stem the tide  for instanceMy Concise Oxford Dictionary  still gives onlythat meaning  Americans however had long beensaying that something stemmed from something elsewas descended from or caused by it exactly in thesense of the German stammen von             Alas it was only a beginning  Germans whowanted to translate their word interessanterweiseinto English tried interestingly which in thosedays sounded horrible to British ears but the Americansat once pounced on it  There followed a numberof other similar formations such as importantlyAmericans must have realized about thistime that the German ending  weise has an Englishequivalent and this was accordingly resuscitatedthe old likewise and crosswise family was joined byneologisms like countrywise and stylewise   Thencame hopefully  a word which had long existed inEnglish and meant in a hopeful manner you couldapply for a job hopefully because you were full ofhope  The Germans however stumbled upon hope  fullybecause they wanted a word for their own hoffentlich admittedly a useful word so hopefully wassoon being used in a quite different sense viz  tomean it is to hoped Consequently we now havea measure of confusion which be it noted is notshared by the Germans as they have two differentwords for the two senses hoffentlich for it is to behoped and hoffnungsvoll for hopefully            Even during the Second World War when youwould have expected the AngloSaxons to react allergicallyto Germanisms they continued to infiltratethe language  I remember my astonishment athearing Its a bit much for the first time  This turnof phrase became very popular in the war though itis in fact a direct translation from the German Es ist               ein bisschen viel   We did not really need it for wehad a perfectly good English equivalent Its a bittoo much In any case it was a bit too much for me            Another is the expression almost nothing   Had Iwritten that in an essay when I was a boy at schoolI should have been accused of tonedeafness forEnglish idiom  It was not in any case a thing thatany of us would have said  The idomatic Englishwas hardly anything   Germans however were not toknow this and brashly translated their fast nichts Granted in this particular case the French andItalians might have had a finger in the pie with theirpresque rien and quasi niente  but I feel pretty surethat the Germans were the main offenders  One mayof course ask what is wrong with almost nothing and the question is not easy to answer  The fact isthat English is idiomatically an extremely subtlelanguage with many taboos particularly in the areaof positivenegative statements and degrees of affirmationand negation  Why can we say I haventmuch money but not I have much money  It ishard to find a logical explanation yet these subtledistinctions are part of the spirit of our languageand it is this spirit that is easily destroyed foreverlike a delicately balanced biotope when peoplewalk roughshod over it            Anyone with a good knowledge of German whofinds it amusing to hunt down Germanisms in AmericanEnglish will soon be reaping rich harvests  I cannotgo into such detail here though I have come tothe conclusion that German has been even influencedbasic features of the American language  For instancethe American sailboat for British sailing               boat  is surely a copying of German wordformation Segelboot  as is also ski school  Skischule  thoughwhat you learn in such a school is obviously skiing            In recent times the direct translation of Germanphrases into English seems to have gatheredstrength  It shocked me when one of the leadingwriters of English textbooks told me in a letterthat he would come back on one of the pointsI had raised  He could easily have returned orreverted to it but the pressure of the German zuruckkommen auf  is evidently too great  I recentlyheard another to load off is children at their grandtendedto load off his children at their grandmothersGerman abladen             Yet there are things that worry me far more thanthese examples  I strongly suspect the Germans forinstance of having initiatedor at least aided andabettedone of the most disturbing developmentsnow under way in the English language the disappearanceof the verb maymight   This verb was formerlyused to express possibility or sometimes permissibilitywhile can had to do with ability  NoEnglishman fifty years ago would ever have beenheard saying It could rain  It is quite obviousthat it can rain when it wants to but what we aretalking about here is not ability but possibility Itmay rain It might rain German speakers are ofcourse far less likely to use this from in English forin their own language they have no alternative tocan  Es kann sein Es konnte regnen   They will thereforetend to use can forms even where they are notidiomatic in English  In any case one hardly hearsanything else today but these can forms which havesomehow become the fashion It can happen  Wecould be wrong   What we are therefore observing isthe loss of a valuable distinction and in fact the slowextinction of the verb maymight  an extinctionwhich in the linguistic world seems to me just asdistressing as the loss of the elephant in the zoologicalworld  Might we not yet be able by a unitedeffort on the part of all lovers of the English languageto save the world may             Another development that worries me is theemployment of plurals in an adjectival sense  It hasbeen a rule in English from time immemorical to puta noun into the singular when it is used as an adjectivebefore another noun  Thus we have anteatersand carol singers  although they eat ants and singcarols in the plural  This rule is upheld even when anumber is specified a sixfoot pole a tenpenny               stamp a twentymile stretch   Yet today this rule isbeing broken more and more often and the rot certainlystarted in America with such terms as materials handlingand greetings cards   Nowdays my favoritescientific magazine talks only of drugs firmsand chemicals manufacturers  though such expressionsmust surely grate on the ears of anyone whostill has a little feeling for the English language  Do Ineed to mention that the German for these expressionsis Drogenfirmen and Chemikalienhersteller  becausein German the plural is used in such cases  Ofcourse we cannot blame the Germans for makingthese mistaked but we can blame English speakersfor swallowing them whole and with such a blatantlack of feeling for English idiom  As it is I darehardly scrutinize English publications any more forfear of coming across even more barbaric examplesthan those we already havenutscrackers perhapsor windows cleaners            There are I must confess a few cases in whichthe Americans have not followed the German  Moreand more of themand alas more and moreBritonscan today be heard talking of kiLOMetresSee IV  The other case in which Americanshave not taken German as a model is a major catastrophein the words billion and trillion   A billion one would think is a bimillion that is a millionmillion and that is exactly what it is in German aswell as in French and always was in British Englishtill the American pressure queered the pitch  A trillionwas equally simply a million million millionor subsue With this system there is also a good wordfor a thousand million a milliard  as used in Frenchand German  Alas all clarity has gone by the boardsince Americans arbitrarily decided to use billion fora thousand million  Utter confusion has sincereigned  Why one earth didnt the Americans maketheir old mistake and follow the German

of Curious and InterestingWords Penguin   As oxter means armpitthe original did not appeal to me and if I wassent a review copy I didnt bother to open the bookI did not receive a review copy of the Penguin editionThe present edition atrociously overpricedconsidering it is a reprint albeit with some addendais worthy of mention as a dictionary of hard wordswith citations  The editing has been rather carelessthough as the opening line of HOW TO USE THIS DICTIONARYbears witness in referring to itself at ThePenguin Dictionary of  when it clearly has becomeThe Logodaedalians             There

which the preceding are only a sample  The interestingthing in the book is its words list taken from arelatively small corpus of books including ones byBurgess Vonnegut and especially Alexander Theroux Darconvilles Cat  all of them writers who enjoyplaying with the language  The lastnamed bookis largely a spoof on linguistic pedantry and I fearthat Saussy III has been drawn in  It is a pity that hemade so many unwarranted assumptions about themeanings of words he did not understand could notdivine from the context or failed to find elsewhere            There may be some readers who enjoyed thetwo earlier editions and are craving more  If so theymight be induced to buy this edition because it contains pages of words definitions and citations notpreviously published  There are I

                          Grammar and glamour are historically the sameword  Back in the eighteenth century one ofthe meanings of grammar was magic enchantmentthe Scots let slip the r into an l  and lo cameforth glamour   In the popular mind grammar is anythingbut glamorous  Whatever magic resides in thesubject is felt to be a sort of black magic a mysteriouscauldron filled with creepy crawly things            At St Pauls School we are convinced that thestudy of grammer need not be an arcane in vacuo exericise and all of our students explore the structure ofEnglish from the parts of speech to the phrases andclauses ultimately applying their knowledge to usagepunctuation and sentence creation            Every selfrespecting mechanic said JohnDewey Will call the parts of an automobile by theirright names because that is the way to distinguishthem  Thus it is with the writer  If Alexander Popeis correct in asserting that True ease in writingcomes from art not chance a nameing of the grammaticalparts we believe will reduce the chanceand enhance the art even if the names are one dayforgotten  And if students are slipping structuralcogs we need a common language to communicatethese problems John you should use the possessiveform before the gerund Mary try combiningthese two sentences by using an appositiveGeorge your sentences are repetitious try varyingyour sentence openings with introductory adverbsphrases or clauses  Ultimately though our initialand primary assumption is that in the words ofstructuralist Paul Roberts the best reason forstudying grammar is that grammer is interestingGrammar may not be glamorous in any glitteryHollywood sense but grammar can be very interestingeven enchanting            After our scholars have completed their study ofdescriptive English grammar they are frequently assignedthe writing of a supersentencea singlesentence that includes one example of each of thefour phrases and three subordinate clauses that areindentified in English grammar  These are prepositionalphrase participial phrase gerund phrase infinitivephrase adverb clause adjective clause andnoun clause  These units may occur in any order inthe sentence            One afternoon while grading a batch of supersentencesI decided to try writing one myself usingthe fewest words possible  Before continuing thereader may wish to try this feat too  An hour ofintense industry produced the following When people  who swing want  to see  whats happeningthey try  attending parties  given by hipsters   words                        The numbers in the above sentence indicate thebeginning of each phrase and subordinate clause adverb clause When people who swing want tosee whats happening modifies the verb try in themain clause  adjective clause who swing modifiesthe noun people   infinitive phrase to seewhats happening acts as the direct object of theverb want   noun clause whats happening actsas the direct objective of the infinitive to see gerund phrase attending parties given by hipstersacts as the direct object of the verb try  participial phrase given by hipster modifies thenoun parties   perpositional phrase by hipstersmodifies the passive participle given   In subsequentsentences I shall provide numbers but leave thereader to identify the structures which will appearin varying orders so as to avoide cluttering the discussionwith labyrinthine explanations like this one            I proudly presented my word concoction tomy departmental colleagues and to my students anda few days later I was summoned by an emissaryfrom a Fourth Form tenth grade English class thatmet a few rooms down the hall from my class  I enteredthis strange territory and thereon the chalkboardwas inscribedFred   wanting  to win  by  playing hard practisedmore  than I  who knew  he stank   words                        Among the triumphantly glowing faces in thealien classroom was that of Bruce Monrad the finestyoung linguist in our school at the time  Bruce itturned out was the author of the word supersentenceacreation that not only contains an ellipticaladverb clause of comparison than I practisedand a hidden noun clause that he stankbut compacts the four phrases into the subordinatepart and the three clauses into the main part            not to be outdone I laboured mightily for a fewdays and came up with stung  by  what happened Lederer began  trying to write better  than Monrad  who fainted words                        The next morning I marched into the rival classroomand confidently wrote my new sentence on theblackboard only to be instantly oneupped byyoung Monrad who stepped forward and inscribed Helping  win  by  scoring more  than I  whothought  he stank Fred overcome   words                        Here Bruces Brilliant excision of one word is accomplishedin his second phrase the infinitive in whichhe lifts out the to  Helping to win by scoring            Now I was growing desperate  Word of the contesthad

resigned admission The studyof grammar is dry  It engages not the passions  Resolvingnot to give out up or in I closeted myselffor the entire weekend and finally emerged withEureka on my lips for I had written Helping  win  by  overcoming  what threatenedLederer  who persisted  when challenged triumphed words                        In addition to being eminently readable my supersentenceis characterized by two clever strokes aclause within a phrase within phrase within aclause within a phrase in the first five words andthe distillation of the adverb clause into a twowordcluster when he was challenged instead of theprevious three words more than I  Not only areall the structures as concise as they can be but withthe exception of the subject Leadere  all nouns adjectivesand adverbs are now replaced by phrasesand clauses  This sentence was traveling at the speedof light  I could become no smaller  Or so I thought            On Monday morning I strutted into Brucesclassroom and hubristically engraved my ultimatesupersentence on the enemys board delivering alearned lecture proving that we had reached the endof the road supersentencewise  As I wheeled toleave Bruce giggled Not so fast Mr Lederer  Hethen explained that he too had discovered the formulafor the twoword adverb clause and that moreoverhe had been able to replace all nouns adjectivesand adverbs with phrases and clauses  He thenchalked up Whoever rebels  dafring  oppose  by  fighting when oppressed  which overcomes conquers words                        While reaching the theoretical limit for supersentencesBruces creation is rather awkward withthe adjective clause which overcomes emergingas a dangling modifier  Still I have never been ableto improve on Bruces effort and I invite VERBATIMreaders to submit more graceful and coherent supersentencesof eleven words  Like two boys choosingsides for a baseball game Bruce and I have run ourhands up the bat and there isnt any wood

but more important as one who continuallyhas trouble retrieving certain English wordsfrom my mental lexicon I consider this book a realgold mine  The blurb on the back of has itabsolutely right A new and expanded edition ofthe popular reinvention of the standard dictionaryfirst created by legendary New York Times languageexpert Theodore Bernstein  Although I seldomwork crossword puzzles this is a must book for thecrosswordpuzzle addict or even the occasionalplayer            I like this dictionary because like most peopleI often find myself groping for words that are righton the tip of my tongue  How many of you likeme cannot always remember that a rhinologist is themedical specialist dealing with nasal problemsWhy not a nasologist  Even after memorizing osteologistskeleton heterologist tissue or helcologistulcers I have difficulty in remembering these particularwords  I have occasionally confused a hematologistblood with a hepatologist liver  And manyof my students in introductory linguistics coursesconfuse etymology word origins with entomologythe study of insects  Now that I have succeeded ingetting you to see that a reserve dictionary is muchmore than a thesaurus with which of course itshares some similarities its purpose is really to listdefinations in alphabetical order which in turn willgive you the word that you have forgotten confusedor just plain do not know or cannot recall            One can quibble as always with some of thedefinitions presented in any dictionary so this workis not different from many others in this respect  Forinstance a wrestler or boxer over  pounds iscalled a heavyweight p I do not think I haveever seen on TVs professional wrestling a heavyweightwrester who weighted  most of themweight over   Although this is a picayunish pointconsider that wrestlers are also divided up accordingto the author into lightweight featherweightwelterweight middleweight  and heavyweight  as areboxers  To my knowledge these terms are not normallyused in professional dare we call it entertainmentwrestling as they are in professional andamateur boxing            Under language expert p  and p  onefinds logogogue whereas I would have thought theproper choice to be linguist or perhaps even theawkward linguistician a term to be avoided  AlsoI fail to see how polyglot p can be defined aslanguage mixture since it merely refers to a multilingualperson  Language mixture may refer towhat linguists call pidginization and creolization oflanguages a process of language simplification althougheven this is misleading and not the entirestory            To illustrate how useful the volume can be letus assume that you have heard the two common Yiddishloanwords used in English schlimazel and schlemiel How do you find them in a reserve dictionaryYou have to remember that both refer to a bungleror bungling person and that is indeed what you haveto look under to find them            Bernstein explains in the introduction p viihow he got the idea for the book in the first placeHe was chatting with a friend about Chinese foodand in the course of the conversation he remarkedthat the words won ton a Chinese dumpling used asan ingredient in a soup of the same name madeperhaps even more sense if they were read backwardHis friend immediately replied  justlike in Madam  Im Adam   And neither one couldretrieve the word for something which read thesame forwards or backwards   Palindrome ofcourse  If you are still addeled addlebrained  or addlepatedp  do not be look up confused in thisdictionary  If you like words and are looking for agreat game to play at your next coctail party thisbook is definitely for you  About the nicest complimentI could give Bernstein and Grambs for producingthis

That Make a Difference            This book was first published in  by TimesBooks as Words in Action   Although that is a bettertitle than the new one something more aproposwould be Words to Impress Your Friends By   Its maingoal is to increase your vocabulary  As any reader ofVERBATIM knows there are many books on the marketdesigned to do exactly this however one canrarely get through more than the first few chaptersof such tomes  This volume I am happy to report isdifferent  I recommend it for those as the bookscover observes who want to speak more effectivelywrite more colorfully or be better preparedfor the SAT the verbal portion of the ScholasticAptitude Test a widely used instrument foruniversity admission            The reason that most books of this type  How toIncrease Your  Words in  Days or Double YourMoney Back Satisfaction Guaranteed fail is thatthey are boring or mundance or both  The readergets the book home and proceeds to memorize polysyllabicwords by the dozens with their lenghthy definitionscoupled with madeup sentences which oftenmake little sense or if they do make sense aredull at best  Then the student gets through the mechanicaltask of taking multiplechoice examinationsor fillintheblank quizzes which are usually awaste of time because the words and its meaning areusually forgotten within a day or two            How does this book then differ from the competitionFor one thing the author has taken as illustrativeexamples many important words and expressionsfrom the rather lively and wellcomposedpages of The New York Times  lexemes to beexact although we can quible about some of theentries  For another the definitions are on thewhole well written and to the point  For exampleconsider the word electic  which is defined ascomposed of material or ideas gathered from a varietyof sources  Its meaning is illustrated quitenicely by the following New York Times passageLive artillery shells a dead sea turtle half the sizeof a Volkswagen Bettle a drowned giraffe antiquecrockery pocketbooks chemical sludgeraw sewage and about  cords of driftwooda yearthe waters of New York Harbor yield astrage and eclectic bounty                        Most of the  examples are excellentchoices and Greenmans definitions and illustrationsare well done there are however some significanterrors to report            Under the term lingua franca p  for instancewe learn that the original lingua franca ItalianFrankish language was a hybrid languagespokenin the th century  It consisted mostlyof Italian words without their inflections  Linguistshave demonstrated that the first lingua france calledMediterranean Lingua Franca by many linguists wasactually spoken before the first Crusade began in AD  There is a document written in it from DjerbaTunisia dating from AD   In addition to Italianvocabulary the language also included many itemsfrom another Romance language Provenccedilal  As mediterranceanLingua Franca was used on the BarbaryCoast of North Africa there were many words that itborrowed from Spanish and Portuguese  In fact onesuch word is savvy shreed in the know whichGreenman erroneously derivers p  from Spanishsabe usted do you know The word came into MediterraneanLingua Franca from Portuguese  That is notsuch a serious error however since Spanish and Portugueseare closely related            Some of the books lexical entries are questionableI see no reason to include for instance thefollowing words antiseptic novel nosh snackfrom Yiddish novice theorem threshold  or tycoon I believe all of these with the exception of nosh  arefairly well known by the average college freshmanthough readers may decide for themselves if I amwrong on this point  I do not consider the word noshimportant enough or for that matter frequentenough to have been included  Certainly it isdoubtful that one would encounter it on an SAT examinationI have exactly the same sentiment forchutzpah brazen nerve from Herbrew via Yiddishwhich is also included p  as well as bubkessomething trivial from Russian via Yiddish p However one must remember that The New YorkTimes is read in New York which has a sizable jewishpopulation and these three examples are probablyknown and used by most New Yorkers evengentiles such as the late authour and raconteur AlexanderKing one of my alltime favorites and a regularon the old Jack Paar Show who used them regularlyin speech as well as in writing            I am delighted to report that the special diacriticaare shown for the common European loanwordslike French natidotvet artlessness

theway things are going in many periodicals diacriticsin English will soon be a thing of the past            One can also find some definitions here andthere that are not entirely wrong yet with which onemight disagree  Kamikaze p  for example isdefined as a suicide attack by a Japanese airplanepilot in World War II the airplane or pilot in such anattack  In my own semantic system and English ismy

certainly is not a techie fromtechnician usually electronic technician one familiarwith and capable of dealing with technology            There are three ways of transmitting a desiredtelephone number from your telephone instrumentThe first is pulse   This is the method usedsince the invention of the automatic telephone exchangeby Strowger and others early in this centuryIt operates by electrically acting as if the receiverhandset had been rapidly and repeatedly replacedon the little pushbuttons hook switch inset into thetop recess cradle of the main portion of the telephonebase  Phone freaks sometimes dial by rapidjiggling jiggling of the hook switch which is thesame action as far as the telephone exchange centraloffice equipment switch is concerned but Im gettingtoo old and cant do this fast enough any more            The second dialing method is tone DTMF ordualtone multifrequency  The trademarked nameby ATT is touchtone which operates by sendingmoreorless musical tones from your instrumentto the switch to specify the number desired  Pulsetoneas mentioned in Galefs footnote is the labelplacard on an instrument for a switch that adjuststhe instrument to operate on one or the otherPulsetone is not a technical term            Rotary phones have the familiar dial with a circularmotion and finger holes  They invariably dialby the pulse method although it is certainly technicallyfeasible to arrange for them to dial with tonesnobody has figured out why anyone would want todo so  Pushbutton phones have pushbuttons sometimestechies are not terribly imaginative with languageitsnot usually their strong suit  Pushbuttonphones often are arranged so that they maygenerate either pulses or tones thus the switchSome switches cannot handle tones and often thereis an extra charge for touchtone service so someusers must have pulse phones            The third method is digital  and Im not going togo into that  Its too techie                              Instead of

specificword which has been made generic by the advent ofa new technology  I cannot add anything to his excellenttreatment of the etymology but can respondto his uncertainty in one of the technical areas            The generic term computer  was extended beyondits human meaning to refer to computing machinesduring World War II  All these machineswere indeed what are now known as analog or analoguecomputers   They were mechanical analogs ofthe objective processes used in such devices as gunaiming systems and bombsights            The advent of the digital computer  after thewar necessitated the modifying of the old term bythe backword analog  to distinguish it from the newdigital computer            The analog computer does not compute bymeans of discreate voltages or any other physicalquantity  Rather it embodies a continuous physicalprocess that is an analog often in a different mediumfor the process for which information is desiredBy measuring the instantaneous value of quantitiesin the analog we can determine the value oftheir analogous quantities in the object process            The digital computer on the other hand simplyperforms arithmetic operations by counting veryquickly  When dealing with a continuous process itcan only compute its state at discrete instants oftime since it only manipulates discrete numbers            Analog and digital timepieces are in fact computerswhere the object process is the continuousmotion of the Earth  The fact however is that bothare analog computers  The analog process in a mechanicalwatch is the motion of the pendulum or balancewheel and in quartz watches the electricalwave produced by a crystal oscillator  Both countthe oscillations to determine the passage of time andtransform the analog signal into a digital one  Theydiffer only in the method used to display the resultsThe analog watch converts the digital counts backinto a more or less continuous movement of thehands  The digital watch simply prints out the numericalcount in proper format            It is my belief that those who originally coinedthe terms analog and digital watch intended only todescribe the display not the underlying physics orany relationship to computers  An analog displaymoves continuously like the Earth or time and adigital display shows numbers            To my knowledge the only timepieces that aretruly digital are the atomic clocks used as timestandards that operate by counting discrete particlesemitted by a radioactive substance            Returning to etymology clock in the aboveparagraph is incorrect in horological usage  Strictlyspeaking clock should only be used when referringto a timepiece that also incorporates a strikingmechanism to sound out the time at regular intervalsThe word

cri de coeur of a singlemindedpatriot beset by the idea that the purity of hismother tongue was being corrupted by the Anglomaniacleanings of his countrymen  Disgustedly hepointed at words like cockpit bowling snack  andhundreds of others constantly used by French technicianssportsmen youngstersin fact everybodyLest the national language be eventually supplantedby le sabir atlantique the Atlantic pidgin he urgedthe government to set up a system of penalties todivert the linguistic polluters from the path of sin            Feelings of bitterness did not keep the authorfrom presenting his admonitions in an easily digestiblestyle  All the fire and brimstone were wrappedin a lighthearted tone and padded with humorousremarks  The book became enormously popular andthe term Franglais entered the worlds dictionariesBut most people happily went on introducing wordslike le workshop le touroperator they insist on thehyphen le self selfservice restaurant le must thething to wear le pickup the truck or the recordplayer not the girl le hifi pronounce eefeeEven now it becomes a bit easier each day for anEnglish speaker to read a French newspaper            However Etiembles appeal caught on with thepowers that were  In  only two years after thepublication of the book General de Gaulle thenpresident of France established a High Committeefor the Defence and the Expansion of the FrenchLanguage  Through subsequent legislation each governmentdepartment was equipped with one or severalterminology commissions with the responsibilityof compiling lists of approved terms in theirrespective spheres  The use of these terms is statutorilyrequired not only in official documents but alsoin all business correspondence and advertising includinglabels catalogues waybills etc employmentcontracts radio and television programsnotices in public places and certain schoolbooksReplacing such a term by a foreign equivalent is apenal offense and may cost the offender anythingfrom  to             The Office of the Commissioner General for theFrench Language a supervisory body has recentlypublished a new edition of the Dictionnaire des Nologismes Officiels  which lists the odd termsso far approved plus some  recommendedones whose use is obligatory for certain publicationsonly  To judge from this batch the purge is going tobe less radical than one would expect from a systemprofessedly resting on the tenets of linguistic protectionismIndeed quite a few of the listed terms areidentical to their English counterparts in spellingthat is this regime rarely interferes with pronunciationExamples adobe for adobe management formanagement drone for  drone  in military avionicsMore than that the Dictionnaire gives its blessingalso to several words of blatantly English stocksuch as hall drugstore  and pipeline pronouncepeaPLEAN even including portmanteau words  bitpixel  and acronyms  laser radar             Along with these outright borrowings came hybridscomposed of an English root and a French suffixsuch as clonage for cloning scorer for to scorenurserie for nursery fishbreeding plant andsupporteursupportrice for supporter  In somecases slight spelling changes have been applied butthe English origin remains unmistakable chalengeurfor challenger dribler for to dribble mdia mandatoryplural mdias  for media astronaute for astronautThe last term seems in both languages arather hyperbolic denomination for a person whotravels less than two lightseconds away from hishome planet  But then it is modest compared to theRussian cosmonaut   Some of the Dictionnaires Anglicismshave undergone more drastic transcriptionalsurgery eg gazole for gas oil fioul for fueloil roquette for rocket bipasse for bypass            All this seems a far cry from the uncompromisingoverhaul Etiemble must have hoped for  To hismind French was a rich enough language to meetany new requirements from domestic resources  Hemight even have snubbed the many Dictionnaire entriescreated by literal translation of the imagery embodiedin the corresponding English term as sourisfor mouse of a personal computer or retombesfor nuclear fallout  Application of this method tocompounds results in calques like banque de donnesfor data bank or atterrissage sur le ventre for bellylanding  However since French compounds tend tobe rather explicit and their components are generallystrung together by all kinds of grammatical particlesconjunctions prepositions articles thismethod often leads to tapewormish constructionssuch as espace extraatmosphrique for outer spaceor boucle en pingle  cheveux for hairpin loop            Etiemble would probably have warmed morereadily to entires which in no way derive from anEnglish model like logiciel for software axniquewithout foreign matter for germfree or suramplificateurfor booster  The Dictionnaire offersmany such ingenious coinages but they generallylack the pithiness and sprightliness that enliven sucha great deal of scientific and technological terminologyin English  Vibreur sonore for buzzer tireurisol lone rifleman for sniper and mitraillage ausol machinegunning towards the ground forstrafing are of course correct but they sound likepunctilious definitions rather than handy appellationsEven more ponderous are exposition interprofessionnellefor trade show transport maritime la demande for tramping the

Unsurprisinglythe French law shows little patience forthe charming onomatopoeias which the technicalpeople have invented for audio equipment and itstantrums like tweeter and boomer or wow andhum The renderings imposed by the latterday indexexpurgatorius are respectively hautparleurdaigus tolerated second choice tuiteur hautparleurde graves ditto boumeur pleurage weepingronflement snoring            To be sure the Dictionnaire does not consist exclusivelyof naturalized or Frenchified alien wordsand wordy phrases of bureaucratic facture  Many anentry had already had a life of its own before a ministerialdecree raised it to its present status  Some ofthem are real gems tableur tabular operator forspreadsheet is concise precise and originalbaladeur stroller for walkman although basicallya loan translation adds a fresh nuance to theimagery best of all perhaps is ordinateur for computerthe French term current since the sadopted by the Dictionnaire in  meaning somethinglike methodically arranging agent  Since themachine is not as generally believed in formeryears a new kind of calculator but rather a highspeedsymbol manipulator ordinateur hits the mark            Whatever the merits of all those novelties theFrench seem to have a relaxed attitude to the disciplinaryaspects  They use both prescribed and proscribedterms depending probably on efficiencypersonal preferences and what others do  In onerespect however they are unanimous  They stick toan odd collection of English words which have a differentmeaning or are nonexistent in Englishspeakingcountries  As in Etiembles days they say smokingfor dinner jacket and slip for underpants  Thechoke in an automobile is still referred to as starterthe real starter is called dmarreur and a femaleradio or TV announcer as speakerine

humanitycomes to know them  The predilection for the fleshof Strombus gigas the queen conch by the whiteBahamians and their relatives on the Florida Keys iscited by many etymologists in explaining the originof the appellation Conch for a native or inhabitantof the Florida Keys or a Bahamian            I am a native of the Florida Keys as was myfather but I was never called a Conch in my hometown  Only since moving to the mainland have Ibeen tagged a Conch and as some dictionaries nowdefine any native of the Florida Keys as a Conch Ino longer demur  But can a black native of the FloridaKeys be a Conch  I have never known of theword being used in this way except when referringto a member of a team fielded by Key West HighSchool the Key West Conchs            I was told by a black Bahamian that the origin ofthe word Conch came from Conchy Joe which is theblack Bahamian equivalent of whitey  You see theinner surface of the queen conch shell has a colorthat approximates that of the epidermis of the Bahamiansof British ancestry  While folk etymologymight be at play here this explanation certainlyseems possible and may explain another etymologicalpuzzle            Two of my dictionaries inform me that the originof the term honky is unknown and Mr Bereskysarticulate arguments for hunky IV have notswayed me  Now honky means whitey and rhymeswith Conchy  May I suggest that honky was I nolonger hear it a corruption of Conchy Joe                              As an addendum to Milton Horowitzs letterXVI about the depiction of Moses with horns Iwant to come to the defense of St Jerome  That holycurmudgeon is usually chided for translating Exodus incorrectly in the Vulgate Bible  Alas I havefew scholarly works to which to refer but I lookedconfidently into my battered copy of Edward RobinsonsA Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testamentth Edition   This is a translation andamplification of Gesenius original Latin work            Of the entries under qaran pp f only theuse in this passage is translated without some referenceto horn  Robinson notes initially with regardto this verb that the primary syllable should be comparedto the Sanskrit carnis horn from car tobore  The derivative forms qeren etc are all translatedwith some reference to horn except thedual form qarnaim which is translated rays oflight splendour  But Robinson goes on to noteeven with this form So Arabian poets compare thefirst rays of the rising sun to horns and hence callthe sun itself the gazelle            Even more illuminating is an entry p Hence in prophetic vision horns are symbolic ofkings powerful princes Daniel  and are cited  And then Robinson bids us compare theArabic epithet of Alexander the Great which hetranslates as the Latin word bicornis twohornedHe goes on to observe that this is the symbol ofpower might so both Alexander and the Seleucidaeare represented on coins with horns            The Septuagint translates qaran  in the passageof Exodus  with a Greek verb used in the NewTestament to mean to praise extol magnify celebrateto honor do honor to hold in honor to makeglorious adorn with lustre clothe with splendor tomake renowned render illustrious ie to cause thedignity and worth of some person or thing to becomemanifest and acknowledged to exalt to a gloriousrank or condition Thayer A GreekEnglishLexicon of the New Testament  How readily StJerome might associate these meanings of the morephilosophical Greek with the horn imagery of powerin the more ancient Hebrew            The symbolism of power conveyed by horns andhornrelated Hebrew and other Semitic words asportrayed on the aforementioned coins or someothers which might have used the same imagery butwhich are no longer extant may well have led StJerome to his translation            In any case his translation in light of the foregoingseems as plausible to me as the exceptionalusage given approval by the accepted translationsSo before we fault St Jerome for a blunderlet us consider that so impressive a linguistic scholaras he may have chosen to give Moses horns deliberatelyby using cognate imagery he understood tostand for dignity and powerRoy B Flinchbaugh JrYork

in VERBATIMEditor            Lysander Kemp reminded me of a malapropismin Spanish which I created for myself  When I waseight my family moved from London to Buenos AiresMy Mother who believed that children shouldlearn languages as early as possible dropped me intothe local Argentine school where I absorbed Spanishby a kind of osmosisexcept for one phrase  Inschool we sang a song the first line of which wasEn los patios de la escuela la cesando el gran rumorIn the school patios the great noisehubbubisceasing  I happily sang En los patios dela escuela va Cesandro el Gran Rumor  whoCesandro was or why he was the Great Rumorwhatever that was I hadnt the faintest idea but obviouslyhe was out in the patios while we were inclass  It was very many years before rememberingthis I realized what I had been supposed to be singing                              I recently purchased a new computer and becauseit operated on a system different from the one ofmy old computer I asked a few friends to recommenda wordprocessing package that I might find useful  Iwas particularly interested in one that would allow meto designate a variety of typestyles during keyboardingideally one that showed the styles on the monitoras the text was being typed  That is called WYSIWYGpronounced wizzywig for What You See Is WhatYou Get in other words when you designate text toprint in boldface or italic type it appears in boldfaceor italic type on the screen  For those who areunfamiliar with computers and the need for a wordprocessingpackage I should explain with what Ihope is merciful brevity that when you buy what isfondly called a personal computer you get threepieces of equipment though they may be combined insome models or makes a rectangular box with someslots in the front and sockets in the back which is thecomputer a monitor which is a small TV set withoutthe usual buttons and a keyboard which looks like anordinary typewriter keyboard but in many modelssold today has a number of additional keys alongsidethose for the familiar alphanumeric characters  Onmine nestled among some control keys on the rightside is what is called a number pad which resemblesthe key arrangement one sees on an adding machine orcalculator on the left side is a double bank of five keysmarked F through F which when pressed alone orin combination with another key perform certainfunctions some of which are useful others of whichare evidently thought useful by the manufacturer butwhich I never use            These boxes come with wires called cables inthe trade because that sounds more impressive thatallow them to be connected to one another and into apower source  The trick is that they will not do anythingunless and until the Disk Operating Systemwhich comes with the machine is installed  Afterthat the DOS as it is called performs certain functionsthough seldom any that anyone but a computerspecialist would want to perform  In order to do somethinguseful you have to buy a program which is apackage consisting of a number of diskettes and a manualA diskette is also called a floppy the reason forthe name is not immediately apparent nor why theitem is called a diskette for that matter but allbecomes clear  The socalled diskette is a flat blacksquare sealed envelope of rather tough plastic with ahole in the middle and an oblong slot on each of theflat sides it is said to be  inches square but that isa lie as the only person who probably ever measuredone of these things I can tell you it is   inchessquare that may seem irrelevant but it is only thebeginning of the Great Deception  Inside this squareplastic casing which you should never open is aflimsy flat black plastic papadum  If the diskette isplaced in the slot of the machine a motor engages thecenter of the disk inside and spins it around at a greatspeed so that portions of it are exposed through itsoblong slot allowing them to be read by some deviceinside the box  The diskettes that contain programshave information on them that the computer understandsand translates into a number of commandsthat make the machine do certain things  The thingsdone depend on what kind of program is on the diskette            I bought a wordprocessing program calledFRAMEWORK II  It is quite versatile and as I requiredallows me to create certain kinds of files in which I amable to style the text as I wish  In case you are interestedit allows me to mark text in any of the followingstyles which appear on the monitor screen in a closeapproximation roman bold roman  underlined romanunderlined bold roman  italic  bold italic  underlineditalic  and underlined bold italic   I acknowledgethat no selfrespecting typographer would ever haveanything to do with underlined italic underlined bolditalic or some of the other styles described but youhave to remember that those are merely regarded byme at least as a means for discretely coding stylesthat I do wantlike small capitalsthat are not providedby the program            FRAMEWORK II is sold by AshtonTate a siliconvalleyconcern that makes quite good programs butlike most of the software companies produces suchabominable manuals with directions for using the programsthat they have to maintain a staff of severaldozen technical personnel who are on duty about hours a day beginning at about six in the morningCalifornia time merely in order to answer the questionsof confused customers  This failing appears to beepidemic throughout the industry I recently spokewith an executive of Okidata a manufacturer of a verygood computer laser printer who told me that histechnical staff answers  telephone queries amonth  I pointed out to him that if he made availablea proper manual he could probably reduce the calls bya factor of   Only the telephone company is profitingfrom such ineptitude            But the foregoing is all preliminary and backgroundto the main theme  One of the services performedby FRAMEWORK II is in a program subroutinecalled the Spelling Checker  I do not need a spellingchecker but I have found it extremely useful as ameans for proofreading text that has been keyboardedand stored  The way it works is this after completingan article chapter or whathaveyou you press a fewkeys and the program automatically scans every wordof text comparing each with a dictionary containedin the program  It is not really a dictionary of coursebecause it lacks definitions it is merely a word list  Youcannot display the entire word list to examine it butfrom the directory of programs I can invoke on themonitor I know it contains about  charactersor about  words  Being a computer the machineperforms this comparison checking very very rapidlyit takes only a minute to proofread a file containingabout  words  If it encounters a word that is notin its repertoire it offers a choice of actions at thestroke of a key or two you can ADD the word to the listGO ON and ignore the word entirely or EDIT the questionableitem by correcting a typo for instanceThere is another option called SUGGEST which if invokedlists up to seven or eight words that you mighthave had in mind when you wrote the one that offendedthe machine and this brings me to the point ofthis article            It seems unnecessary to point out that FRAMEWORKII cannot have a very sophisticated list of words if it hasonly  in its memory but I thought it might beinteresting to see what suggestions it might make assubstitutions for the words it disliked  In each listingbelow the boldface word is the word that FRAMEWORKdisliked the words following are the substitutions itsuggested  Where ellipses occur I have not bothered tocopy down the entire list of offerings selecting onlythose that struck me as odd either because of theincongruity of the choice or because I could not in mywildest flights of dyslexic schizophrenic fancy imaginethe criteria employed in arriving at the selections  Iam fully aware that some of the words in my text arenot everyday

nowadaystyping is outthe text you are reading returned tothe beginning of the paragraph to see how some ofthese words would fare  I looked up the word precedingand was after a brief moment asked to

speech onedefinition for the preposition and three for the verbparticipial senses  I called up the synonyms for theadj and the following appearedSynonymsantecedent anterior foregoing former pastprecedent previous prior                        The way the program works is this one uses the cursorto highlight a particular word for which synonyms aredesired  It is similar in principle to finding a synonymin a synonym dictionary and then successively lookingup its synonyms to find their synonyms  I am not surewhy but I expected the program to network in thesame way  However when I highlighted antecedent what appeared on the screen was the same list of synonymsbut with antecedent missing but preceding hadreappeared  If all this is too complicated to follow letme summarize you look up word X and get synonymsA B C D E F and G  You look up the synonyms forword A and you get synonyms X B C D E F andG  Even the definition provided for the sublistings isidentical in wording to that of the word originallysought            This is very economical of space and involves aclever computer ploy but it does not provide a particularlyuseful synonym dictionary for as we all knowsynonymy in language does not yield to the mathematicallaw that states Things equal to the same thingare equal to each other  Perhaps the Proximity peoplethought that they had got round that little problem bygiving the same definition for each of the items in thelist but we know that only very rarely are two synonymsbiunique which is another way of saying thatjust because ingredient means constituent not allmeanings of constituent mean ingredient an ineluctablefact of language            If a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionaryis likely to be of use then this package may be ofservice  It works with a hard disk or with a set offloppies and can be used with  popular wordprocessingprograms  That was the number listedwhen I received my copy it might have increased  Italso has a few neat features like suggesting a fewalternatives if you happen to think that preceding isspelt preceeding as some people do  It has a usefulHelp feature that can be called upon at any stageAlso if you enter jump  you get the synonyms for thatbut if you entered jumped  you get the same synonymsbut inflectedincluding the variants leapt leaped for leap   All in all for a primitive system it isnot too bad but you would have to be in love withyour computer to use it in preference to the far morecomplete books of synonyms available especially TheSynonym Finder  Rodale in the US and CanadaLongman elsewhere which offers more than synonyms more than three times the number listed inany other synonym book            The blurb on this bookdisk package reads Suppliesyou with  true synonyms for entries  My guess is that such a quantity might bereached if one counted all the permutations and combinationsin reality though there are probably farfewer actual words  Readers can judge for themselvesthe validity of this numerical legerdemain                              PS The foregoing was written more than a year agoSince then I have updated FRAMEWORK II to FRAMEWORKIII to add as

the Attorney General Sir PatrickMayhew to determine what the word obtainedmeans in the context of the insider dealing laws                              The case is vital to the offence of insider dealingIt results from the acquittal of Mr Brian Fishera businessman on charges of insider dealing after aruling in Southwark Crown Court which threatensto severely restrict the scope for prosecutions of insiderdealing            Mr Fisher had been charged with insider dealingin shares of Thomson T Line just before a takeoverbid for the company  He had claimed to be interestedin bidding for Thomson but KleinwortBenson the companys merchant bank told him outof courtesy that the company had accepted anotheroffer  He immediately bought  shares himselfultimately netting a profit of             However he was savedand acquitted of insiderdealingby the dictionary definition of theword obtained  Judge Gerald Butler said that MrFisher had not actually obtained price sensitive informationin the sense of actively seeking or procuringit  He had merely received it            He ruled that the proper meaning of the wordin the Companies Securities Insider Dealing Act connoted active conduct in the sense of seekingout information            The Attorney General argued in court yesterdaythat the word obtained embraces both the activeand passive usage            Dictionary definitions are not always helpful tothe court and slavish adherence to these should beavoided if the result is to frustrate the intention ofthe legislation he said            He submitted that the wider construction of theword obtained gives proper effect to the statute            Judgement was reserved  The Times  September                              Anyone laboring under the delusion that Englishis not an

Transatlanguage            It was in a hotel bar in Chicago on my first nightof a visit to the US that I was given some adviceon how to communicate with Americans  My volunteertutor an executive with the Sears companyexplained that the British have a beataboutthebushway of saying things whereas Americans alwaysgo straight to the point  In America he assuredme I would hear English with its sleeves rolledupJetlagged after ten hours in the custody ofAmerican airline staff I could neither believe norargue            Back here in rural Herefordshire after twomonths in the States Ive had time to reflect on whatthe man said  Did he have a point  Well I do saytaken to hospital rather than hospitalized  eventhough the American term is two syllables shorter  Iwould never write All thru the nite just to save fourletters  And I still remember being baffled by a Britishnews story in USA Today   The paper reportedthat the Duchess of York had been presented withher pilots wings at Oxford Monday  I actuallychecked the index of my Ordnance Survey atlas OxenwoodOxfordOxhillbefore concluding that there was no such place and what they reallymeant was at Oxford on Monday  Is it just becauseI am English that I resent the dropping of a smallpreposition  Do I belong to a race of fusspots whodecorate their sentences with words that dont matterThe man from Sears thought so and he was notalone  His belief turned out to be so widely held inAmerica that it was almost beyond question            Let us question it now  First of all think of fiveliving English People and remember how each ofthem speaks  Come onMargaret Thatcher DudleyMooreany other three  Are they euphemisticIs their diction cluttered with redundant wordsand phrases  Are their sentence structures so ornateand pernickety that the meaning is obscured  Nowthink of a few people who are guilty of those linguisticsins  I can guess who they are American airlinestewardesses Pentagon Officials New England hostessesand people who insist on being referred to asspokespersons for social reform            In airlinespeak and Pentagonese the ideaseems to be to build up the number of words or syllablesin a sentence at the expense of its color vitalityand charm  English is reduced to a bland verbalporridge  The nosmoking signs are illuminated atthis time  The sentence is in the present tenseThere is no need to say at this time or even now but the rules of airline English state that whenever astock useless phrase may be inserted into a sentencethen that phrase must be inserted  at that moment intime             The Pentagon is more extreme but perhapsmore honest  Its euphemisms are so blatant that noone could fail to recognize them as anything butstraightforward attempts to deny the truth  Bombsare called systems  poisons are agents   Then there isthe marvelously uninformative Strategic Defence Initiative To help maintain the required standards ofblandness and inefficiency the words situation andlocated must be used they would say utilized  asoften as possible  Unfortunately the practices ofmilitary and airline staff are contaminating the languageof the greater public  In England we talkabout the weather  In America it is the weather situation In California I saw a notice Scotchtaped to asupermarket door This door is locked please usethe other door which is located around the cornerIn England where everything is supposed to be solongwinded the sign would ask simply Please usethe door round the corner            New Englanders deserve a special mention  It isthey I believe who are mainly responsible for thiscrazy notion that the English have a niminypiminyway of expressing themselves  You know the sort ofthing inexpensive instead of cheap RC instead ofCatholic TP or even bathroom stationary instead oftoilet paper   They believe it sounds English so therest of America believes it too  What it really soundslike is genteel Victorian English a style extinct in allbut a few suburban lowermiddleclass areas  WhileEnglish people are more or less immune from themincing style of the Mayflowers granddaughtersPentagonese has seriously infected the language ofBritish trade union leaders  Situation pops up likeacne all over their sentences and at this time has deterioratedto at this moment in time  Located hasmercifully not caught on            Even in England trade unionists
