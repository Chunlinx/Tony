                                 Dog Days of Summer            Thetraditional summer silly season finally arrived in Fleet Street Friday whenmost British papers chose as their top news story a claim that sunbathing isgood for you A report published in the British Medical Journal by ateam of Bristol epidemiologists infuriated cancer charities by saying there isevidence that the potential benefits of exposure to sunlight may outweigh thewidely publicised adverse effects on the incidence of skin cancer The reportwhich led the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph and made the front pages of theTimes and theIndependent  said that sunbathing could protect against heart diseaseand multiple sclerosis and that more people would die from keeping out of thesun than from being in it The report also made the banal observations thatpeople find lying or sitting in the sun enjoyable and relaxing and that thissubjective sense of wellbeing may be important in itself in improving thequality of a persons life            Aneven sillier silly season story appearing the same day on the front pages ofthe Times and the Financial Times  concerned the British governments decisionto establish a task force to study the threat of an asteroid hitting Earth anddestroying all life on the planet The FT said that a plan to avertArmageddon has been demanded of the government by an opposition member ofparliament named Lembit Opik whose Estonian grandfather Ernst had an asteroidnamed after him Asked whether the proposed establishment of a Near EarthObject Task Force wasnt rather a limp response to such a cataclysmic threat aspokesman for the Science Ministry said defensively Its not as if there areasteroids hovering above the earth            Otherprominent stories in the British press included Thursdays  millionrecordbreaking sale at Christies in London of a famous art collection lootedby the Nazis from the Austrian Rothschilds in  and recently restored totheir American heirs and the news that fox hunting is almost certain to beabolished in Britain now that Prime Minister Tony Blair has said he willsupport legislation against it            TheDaily Telegraph  the Financial Times  and the Independent raneditorials Friday about Britains reestablishment this week of diplomaticrelations with Tripoli following Libyas belated admission of responsibilityfor the  death of a British policewoman who was killed by shots fired fromthe Libyan Embassy in London The FT said this was the right decisionnot because Muammar Qaddafi was now a Jeffersonian democrat but because hehas started to come into line with international law enough to justify a policyof engagement rather than isolation The Telegraph  however said that behind this decision and an earlier one byBritain to exchange ambassadors with Iran lay an unwillingness to stand up toterrorsponsoring regimes that have large commercial contracts in their giftThe paper said Britains current cozyingup to Libya Iran and China distancesit from the United States and exposes the Governments proclaimed Atlanticismas increasingly questionable The Independent  on the other handsupported the Libya decision on the opposite groundthatby establishing dialogue we are differentiating ourselves from the US Itsaid Britain too often comes across as an American catspaw            Areport in the Guardian Friday from Tehran said that conservative clericshave struck a blow at Irans reforming President Mohammed Khatami by closingthe newspaper Salam  which helped his rise to power There were nowfears that two other progressive
