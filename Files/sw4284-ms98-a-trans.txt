        have any children     no uh im single and but ive i been keeping an eye on what the child care situation is and i have several friends that do have children     well what do you think about child care i mean i dont have any children so   well its its uh its i i feel that uh regulation uh uh whether be at the state or federal level is a must so we can have some sort of standards from one place to another uh that uh in terms of cleanliness uh the ratio between the uh adults to children is maintained uh food and so on i dont think one person one adult should have like twenty children to keep after   well well do you think that how many children do you think they should be allowed or should be in one facility at one time   well the facility i i dont have a problem with its just how many adults or how many children to an adult and if if i remember correctly um one adult for six children was very good for around here and was more twelve to twelve children one to one adult was about the average   but then and well in public school um you have one teacher for every thirty kids   and so on but the but in day care usually the child is not able to um function totally on his own whether if its if its uh a toddler uh diapers have to be changed uh must be tended to constantly for fear that they might get into something   well um do you think that there is enough child care available in your area   i think there is its just that sometimes location makes it difficult if if if i was married there is no place between my house and work that is convenient that i could uh use as for child care theyre usually in areas where they can they can afford to set up shop and not where its convenient for the people that are working   umhum well do you think that employers should provide child care   well some companies ive noticed will provide the facilities and then let a let a uh a company come in and provide the child care while the employers just providing providing the the facility   umhum   in many cases like in large companies that becomes a perk to the employees where theyre able to get reduced child care and in and in the case of uh new mothers theyre able to go uh instead of a cigarette break they can go see their child for ten minutes and then go back to work you have a better retention then of um people by not having them go on sick leave or uh paid holiday to take care of their children and so it saves the company money its in the companys best interest   well i think that really am i am all for employers providing some kype type of child care or at least the facility and i dont think we really have enough of that   no its its its a relatively new idea from what i understand its has uh enough companies havent gotten on the bandwagon they where they could see a realization and um savings of money right now by people being at work and not taking off and being at home if you make it convenient for them people will stay uh stay or stay with the company if you if therere more perks like that you can give them its not just money its its everything about it and child care is a big issue its important to me if i was married and had children id want to be as close to my kids as i possibly could   oh i know and i think that if i had children and i couldnt find adequate child care i probably wouldnt want to work   im the same way but then again how do you provide for the child when you cant work   you you i know you really dont have a choice but then um im my boss had a case where um his baby got sick in child care and um all the babies at the child care place that he went to all came down with an ear infection and thats i think there should be some kind of um health regulation or or some kind of i dont know how bad i mean i can see how it could happen with all the children there together   umhum
