A Brief HistoryT he early history of Portugal is closely related to that of the entire Iberian peninsula Prehistoric cultures flourished first in the north and in todays Alentejo region of southcentral Portugal The south was visited by a number of peoples who came primarily to trade including the Phoenicians the Mycenaean Greeks and the Carthaginians The Phoenicians established a trading post at Lisbon around  bc calling it either Alis Ubbo or Olissipo When Celtic peoples crossed the Pyrenees in the first millennium bc they intermarried with the existing Iberian population and built a series of hilltop fort communities or citnias the finest example of which is at Briteiros see page The Carthaginians under Hannibal recruited locals to fight as mercenaries against Rome The Romans eventually defeated the Carthaginians and invaded the Iberian peninsula Their occupation was fiercely opposed by a confederation of Celts known as the Lusitani living in central Portugal The Lusitanian leader Viriathus kept the Roman forces at bay until he was assassinated in  bc The Romans cultivated grapes wheat and olives built roads and bequeathed the Latin foundations of the Portuguese language and a strong base of Christian belief Julius Caesar founded many cities including Ebora vora where the remains of a Roman temple survive see page  and Pax Julia Beja The Moors and the ReconquestIn ad  a great Muslim invasion fleet from North Africa crossed the Strait of Gibraltar In a matter of only a few years the Moors had conquered almost all of Iberia except for the small Christian kingdom of Asturias in northern Spain Lisbon became a thriving outpost under Muslim occupationThe Moors failed to penetrate much further north than Aveiro about halfway up the Atlantic Coast They settled in the Alentejo along the Tagus river and in the Algarve which they named alGharb or Western Land By the midninth century alGharb had become a Moorish kingdom with a capital at Chelb or Silves see page The Moors introduced new crops including oranges and rice to the region Their highly distinctive whitewashed houses and filigree chimneys are features of Portugal to this day as are azulejos handpainted glazed ceramic tiles Many Moorish place names also survive including that of Ftima the preeminent Catholic site in Portugal Unlike their successors the Moors were tolerant of the many different peoples who lived together in Portugal including Berbers Arabs Christians and JewsEven so the Moors were regarded as an occupying power by the local Christian population The Christian Reconquest which sought to drive the Muslims out was under way in the north by the ninth century It was not until  when Dom Afonso Henrques became the Count of Portucale that the struggle to regain power met with any real success Henrques consolidated his position by defeating the Moors at the Battle of Ourique in  and celebrated by naming himself the first king of Portugal By  the frontier between Christianity and Islam had been drawn at the Tagus Not until  did King Afonso III  complete the Reconquest and secure borders for Portugal years before the Spanish could do the same Consolidation and Golden AgeAfonso III moved his capital from Coimbra to Lisbon in  six years after he had called the first Cortes parliament in Leiria His successor Dom Dinis  consolidated Portugals borders by constructing castles along the frontier with Castile The last of the Afonsin dynasty King Fernando I  formed an alliance with the English and appealed for support in his disputes with Spain When Fernando died without an heir the Spanish claimed the throne through a web of intermarriages between the two royal houses Spain was backed by Portuguese aristocrats eager to avoid war The army of Juan I of Castile invaded Portugal in  but Joo of Avis recently proclaimed King Joo I of Portugal defeated the Spaniards in a decisive battle which was fought in  at Aljubarrota about km  miles north of Lisbon Batalha Abbey see page  was built in gratitude The victory secured independence from Spain A new alliance with England was sealed in the  Treaty of Windsor a year later Joo of Avis married Philippa of Lancaster the daughter of John of Gaunt Their third surviving son the Duke of Viseu Master of the Order of Christ would change the map of the world Ultimately he become known as Henry the NavigatorBuilding an EmpireWith Portugal facing the Atlantic Ocean  rather than the Mediterranean Sea it remained cut off from most trade routes However as the Ottoman Turks in the th century dominated the Mediterranean and shipbuilding technology improved longer Atlantic journeys became a serious prospect Peace with Spain in  prompted Portugal to seek overseas conquests Prince Henry retired to what was known as the endoftheworld the Sagres peninsula in the Algarve see page  There he established a school of navigation that attracted astronomers cartographers and other leading scientists of the day Henry established expeditions that ultimately succeeded in redefining Europeans very understanding of the world During Henrys lifetime Portuguese caravels sailed far beyond the westernmost point of Africa With the colonization of Madeira and the Azores the foundations were laid for the future Portuguese empire The Portuguese also sailed down the west coast of Africa going beyond Cape Bojador in  a feat theretofore considered to be impossibleHenry died in  but Portugals discovery voyages continued The king who ruled over the golden age of explorationand exploitationwas Manuel I The Fortunate who reigned from  The many important discoveries that were made during his reign would assure his position as Europes richest ruler He could well afford to erect monuments as elegant as the Tower of Belm and as impressive as the Jernimos Monastery in Lisbon The architecture that eased Portugal from the Gothic into the Renaissance still bears his name the Manueline style is whimsically flamboyant and decorative and rife with references to the seaThe most significant expedition under Manuels flag was Vasco da Gamas legendary sea voyage from Lisbon in the summer of immortalized in The Lusiads  the epic poem by Portugals national poet Lus de Cames  Rounding what is now known as the Cape of Good Hope da Gama found what Columbus had been searching for in  although in the wrong direction the searoute to the lucrative spices of the East The Portuguese thus ended the Venetian monopoly on Eastern trade and began attracting merchants from all over Europe to Lisbon Portugal and Spain the planets foremost maritime powers agreed to divide the world between them by means of the  Treaty of Tordesillas This accorded everything lying more than  leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands to Spain while everything lying to the east went to Portugal thus giving Portugal a free hand in exploiting the Orient In  Portuguese explorer Pedro lvares Cabral accidentally reached Brazil Trading posts were set up all along the west and east coasts of Africa in the Middle East Hormuz southern India Goa Malaysia Malacca and even in China Macau Profits came primarily from trading in eastern spices silk and porcelain African gold and slaves as well as through importing copious sugar from Brazil and So TomWealth helped disguise inherent weaknesses in the Portuguese state It was not long before other nations such as the English and the Dutch began challenging the Portuguese monopoly on the spice trade No entrepreneurial class developed as it did in Holland and England The only real entrepreneurs were the Jews who were forced either to embrace Christianity or face expulsion The Inquisition took root in the s and the CounterReformationary Jesuit order gained control

Spain marched in and backed by wealthy Portuguese forced the union of the two crowns Spanish Rule and RestorationPhilip II of Spain became Filipe I of Portugal in  Philip upheld Portuguese autonomy making no attempt to unite his two kingdoms It took  years for the Portuguese to organize a successful uprising against the occupation On  December a date still celebrated as Portugals Restoration DaySpanish rule was finally completely overthrown The Duke of Bragana was crowned King Joo IV in a festive ceremony that took place on Lisbons beautiful riverfront square the Terreiro do Pao today the Praa do ComrcioHis grandson Joo V enjoyed a long and glittering reign  As money poured in from gold discoveries in Brazil the king spent it on lavish monuments and buildings including the spectacular aqueduct that still brings fresh water into the center of Lisbon Portugals citizens overburdened with taxes bore the brunt of the kings extravagancesDestruction Rebuilding and the Peninsular WarThe middle of the th century marks a great divide between early history and modern times in Portugal On All Saints Day  November  as crowds packed the churches to honor the dead Lisbon and parts of Portugal all the way to the Algarve were devastated by one of the worst earthquakes ever recorded Churches crumbled the waters of the Tagus heaved into a tidal wave and fires spread throughout the

tyrannical minister known as Sebastio Jos de Carvalho e Melo best remembered as the Marqus de Pombal Pombal dominated Portugal as an enlightened despot banishing the Jesuits and executing certain members of the nobility who may have been involved in an assassination attempt on the king He abolished slavery reformed education and diversified Portuguese trade Although he lost his hold on power shortly after Joss death in  many of his reforms survived laying the foundation for the modern Portuguese stateAt the beginning of the th century Napoleon managed to drag Portugal into the heat of Europes conflicts France invaded in  when Portugal refused to close its ports to British shipping The royal family fled to Brazil aboard a British ship and the British general Arthur Wellesley later the Duke of Wellington countered the invasions The final battle came in  when the French unable to pass the huge fortifications at Torres Vedras retreated back to SpainThe Fall of the MonarchyIn  Portugal made peace with France and Brazil was raised to the status of a full kingdom the following year Portugal itself was ruled as a virtual British protectorate A military coup in  finally

austere authoritarian regimethe Estado Novo New Statefavored economic progress and nationalism He kept Portugal neutral in World War II but permitted the Allies to use the Azores as a base Toward the PresentSalazars New State began to unravel when Portugals former colonies demanded independence In  soldiers carrying red carnations in their rifle barrels successfully deposed the government in a
