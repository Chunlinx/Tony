                                 Citizen or Consumer                        Dear Peggy            You of course get right to the heart of the matter A good teacher neverfollows a method to the letter And if youre the parent of a child whos luckyenough to have a good teacher you rarely find yourself worrying about whetherthe method being employed is traditional or progressive whether theres enoughbreadth or enough depth Whats more neither do your fellow parentseven iftheir kids are not at all the kinds of students yours are Good teachers seemto manage to find ways to fit the needs of many different sorts of students inthe same class Its during the lousy years with weak teachers that we parentssuddenly find ourselves being led from our particular complaints to ask biggerquestions about the whole approach of a school and being tempted to think inunduly polarized termsas if there was some clearcut choice betweenconstructivist and more teacherdirected learning            I suppose an important question to ask which is not at all the focus ofBennetts book but should presumably be part of the debate about curricularreform is what sort of guidance proves most helpful to teachers and mostconducive to attracting good ones to the profession Do you for example thinkthe Core lesson plans could be useful background material for a teacher whofelt free to take half a year or more to do her own version of what Hirschallotted say  days to cover I couldnt tell from my quick peek what thequality of the bibliographies was We all hear constantly that strongprincipals play a large part in creating strong schools but I was struck thatBennett had very little to say about them and their roleexcept as the lastresort for disgruntled parents What do the best of them do to help set aschools academic direction This book has notably little to say about whatsort of changes could help most to raise the quality of teachers andprincipals which they evidently consider to be pretty low            But if anything is to be accomplished its clear they think school choiceis the way Bennett et al are in favor of a voucher plan that would allowparents to choose among not just public schools but private and parochial andcharter schools as well In fact the program of constant oversight andpressure this book advocates almost doesnt make sense or is merely a recipefor frustration if there isnt school choice Start hunting for a differentschool they urge parents whose complaints havent born fruit But what do youdo if you cant afford or get your kid into a private school and dont wanthim to attend parochial school If you dont have at least some publicschoolalternatives to consider you stew It does seem somewhat surprising thoughto hear these authors defend their voucher plan on the grounds that it fosterspluralism in schooling after pushing a shared curriculum as hard as theydo            I havent thought as much as I should have about school choice but theparents I know who have been able to pick from a variety of public schools havebeen glad of itand have stuck with the publicschool system when theyotherwise would have left As a spur to improvements in the system given theslow pace of topdown efforts at reform it seems worth trying out in differentways but it shouldnt be considered a cureall especially for the worstoffschools Nor as James Traub pointed out in the New York Times Magazinelast weekend are schools themselves a cureall for poverty But if the resultof school choice is to isolate failing schools even further than they alreadyare from pressures that might lead to improving them it would be a failure forreform            This book has the unintended effect of exposing the unappealing side of theschoolchoice crusade The ideal parent of these pages does not remind me muchof an upstanding civicminded citizenthe kind of patriot Bennett presumablyadmires Instead the micromanaging mother and father conjured up here resembledemanding consumers obsessed with promoting their childs future and convincedthat school and teacher should revolve around their needs and demands Whatkind of respect for our common culture is that For oldfashionedhonorthyfatherandteacherandcountry types the authors convey asurprisingly ruthless s getahead attitude Do you agree The message toparents makes me more tired than I already am of marketplace values Along withthat moral compass Bennett has urged it seems we better whip out our PalmPilots and fast You must be the chief coach trainer coordinator and rolemodel            This has been fun and youve made me think that what Id really like tohave on my shelfand readis the teachers guide for parents            Ann
