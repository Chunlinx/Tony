                                 Is Seattles Curfew Legal                        On Wednesday Seattle Mayor Paul Schell imposed an overnight curfew on thecitys downtown area for the second night in a row Police threatened to arrestanyone who ventured into the zone without legitimate business The ACLU plansto contest the action in court Is this curfew legal            Like most cities Seattle has municipal laws that grant the mayor broadpolice powersthe authority to take the actions necessary to protectcitizens and their property Similar powers are granted to other chiefexecutives such as county commissioners governors and the president InSeattles case the mayor may declare a state of emergency andor impose acurfew whenever he believes that extraordinary measures are needed toprevent the death or injury of persons and to protect the public peace safetyand welfare and alleviate damage loss hardship or suffering            Even if Mayor Schells curfew is found to be consistent with Seattlesmunicipal laws as most agree it will be it could still be challenged infederal court on the grounds that it violates constitutional rights such asfree speech Typically justices defer to the judgment of the executive branchduring the eventthat is they would be unlikely to grant an injunctionpreventing the city from enforcing its curfew while the WTO is in townInstead cases are brought after the fact that seek either monetary damagesfrom the city or a court order barring similar action in the future            These instanceswhen public safety and fundamental rightsconflictcomprise one of the murkiest areas of constitutional law There arefew cutanddry legal standards for determining which interest prevails Thefacts are weighed on a casebycase basis If the Seattle curfew is contestedin courtwhich is all but inevitablehere are the major questions the judgewill have to decide                           Were free speech rights violated Courts have deemed streetssidewalks and parks to be open forums for free speechand Seattles actionclearly limited the protestors access to them However courts have alsodetermined that governments can restrict expression to a reasonable timeplace and manner The city might argue that this is all its curfew did sinceprotestors could simply go elsewhere in the city to hold their demonstrationswithout interference But since access to the desired audience is part of freespeech complainants could counter that restricting their location impinged ontheir rights                           Were continued protests likely to have led to unlawful conductFederal courts have clearly held that First Amendment activities cannot bebanned simply because prior similar activity led to violenceas they did inSeattle on Tuesday afternoon For example after the Rodney King verdict andensuing riots in  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that theSan Francisco Police Department had acted improperly in ordering officers todisband all future protests However if police have specific informationabout future lawbreaking or reasonably believe that they would be been unableto control an outbreak of violence courts have sometimes allowed FirstAmendment rights to be temporarily curtailed                           Was the prohibition contentbased Any law that prohibits one type ofspeech while allowing another is presumptively unconstitutional In Seattlethe curfew banned from downtown everyone who said they intended to protest orwho lacked another reason for entering Therefore the city might argue it wasnot contentbased Everyone was equally affected regardless of his or hercause However complainants could contend that in practice it wasdiscriminatory It actually affected only the group of protestors who opposedthe WTO and some reports suggest that police were barring people based ontheir style of dress                           Could the same result have been accomplished by more limited meansGovernments are required to restrict speech and other rights as little aspossible So complainants would likely win a case if they could prove that thecity did not pursue another less restrictive option Seattle could contendthat nothing short of an outright ban on downtown demonstrations would haveboth protected public safety and ensured that nonprotestors including WTOdelegates would be able go about their lawful business And they could pointto their accommodationwhich some have even suggested was too greatofprotestors during the day and the limited duration of the curfew But otherlawyers have already publicly stated that the complete prohibition ofdemonstrations and the large size of the area are both unconstitutionallyextreme                           Explainer thanks Prof Stewart Jay of the University of Washington Schoolof Law and Prof Eben Moglen of the Columbia University School of Law                        Next question
