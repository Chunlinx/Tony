                    Background                  Model of an oscillating biochemical network          In     Laub and Loomis propose a model of the          molecular network underlying adenosine cyclic          monophosphate cAMP oscillations observed in fields of          chemotactic           Dictyostelium discoideum cells The          model based on the network depicted in Fig  induces          the spontaneous oscillations in cAMP observed during the          early development of           D discoideum           In this model changes in the enzymatic activities of          these proteins are described by a system of seven          nonlinear differential equations                    where the state variable           x             x                       x             represents the concentrations of          the seven proteins           x             ACA           x             PKA           x             ERK           x             REG A           x             Internal cAMP           x             External cAMP and           x             CAR and the fourteen different           k                       i            represent system parameter values It was shown          numerically in    that spontaneous oscillations appear          at the nominal parameter values found in Table  Note          that because there are typographical errors in the          original paper the values being used here for the          nominal parameters were obtained directly from the          authors of              This particular model is primarily concerned with          describing selfsustaining oscillations in the          biochemical system From Fig  it is clear that at the          nominal parameter values of the model this is achieved          We seek to determine whether the system is robust  that          is if we change these kinetic parameters will the          systems oscillatory behaviour persist We next present          two possible means based on whether parameters are          changed one at a time or in groups                            Methods                  Single parameter robustness Bifurcation          analysis          Selfsustained oscillations such as those being          modelled here appear as stable limit cycles in trajectory          of the underlying dynamical system     The existence          and stability of these limit cycles may change under          parametric perturbations Whenever a stable periodic          solution loses stability as we vary the underlying          parameters of the system and this solution transitions to          another qualitative solution  for example a          steadystate equilibrium  we say that the system          undergoes a           Hopf bifurcation It is therefore          possible to use bifurcation theory as a means of          quantifying the robustness of this oscillatory network          model               Using the bifurcation analysis package AUTO              it is possible to produce oneparameter bifurcation          diagrams for each of the model parameters           k                       i             These diagrams illustrate the steadystate          behaviour of the systems as the parameter values are          changed Suppose that Hopf bifurcations occur at                       k                                  i            and                       i            so that stable limit cycles occur for the range                        k                           i                                                i             Both the size of this interval as well as the          proximity of the nominal parameter value to either          boundary are measures of the robustness of the system To          compare the robustness of the system to the different          parameters we can define a series of parametric          robustness measures We define the           degree of robustness DOR for each          parameter           k                       i            as                    It is straightforward to see that this value is always          between zero and one The former indicates extreme          parameter sensitivity whereas the latter implies large          insensitivity          Bifurcation diagrams provide an excellent means of          determining the robustness of systems to single parameter          perturbations We next describe a method for analysing          and quantifying robustness to simultaneous changes in          several parameters                          Multiparametric robustness Structural singular          values                      Determining the limit cycle Harmonic balance            method            The first step is to obtain a mathematical            expression for the limit cycle oscillation The            harmonic balance method can be used     The basic            idea is to represent the limit cycle by a Fourier            series with unknown coefficients              a                         n              i                            n              i   and period             T                         The nonlinear differential equation can be used to            set up a series of algebraic equations that the            coefficients must satisfy These equations can be            solved using numerical packages such as Mathematica or            Maple Depending on the particular form of the limit            cycle a small finite number of coefficients can be            used We can denote this periodic solution as             x              t                                 Linearization            The nonlinear differential equation must now be            linearized about this periodic orbit     Writing            the state vector             x              t  as                        x              t               x              t               x                           t             then the local behaviour of the nonlinear system is            governed by that of the linearized system                                      t               J              x              t              x                           t             where             J is the Jacobian matrix of the            vector field             f  Note that since the            linearization is performed about a periodic orbit the            linear system is periodic                                Restructuring into nominaluncertainty            systems            The Jacobian matrix includes all uncertain            parameters At this point we need to separate the            system into a nominal model and a feedback            interconnection that involves all parametric            uncertainty We first write each parameter as                        where             k                           i              is the nominal value and                            i              is the relative amount of perturbation in the             i thparameter We now separate            the Jacobian matrix as                        J              x              t               A                           t               B                           t               C                           t              where             A                           t  is the Jacobian matrix with            all parameters at their nominal value and  is a            diagonal matrix containing all the uncertainties                            i               Let             y              t               C                           t              x                           t  and             u              t                y              t  the system is now of the            form of Eqn  with             x              t  replaced by             x                           t                                 Discretization            The system can be discretized by sampling the state            and output with sampling period             h              Tn  where             n is a positive integer and            assuming that the inputs are piecewise constant this            is also a standard technique in control engineering                In particular a linear continuoustime system            governed by Eqn  gives rise to the discretetime            linear system                          k

of the            transition matrix Moreover it is not difficult to            confirm that             A                           d                           B                           d              and             C                           d              are periodic with period             n  The uncertainty matrix after            discretization is now                            d               The discretization step is illustrated in Fig            A                                Lifting            The final step in preparing the system for SSV            analysis is to transform the periodic linearized            system into an equivalent timeinvariant one The            technique for this is known as             lifting     Rather than            giving the general formulae it is easier to illustrate            the general principle with an example            Suppose that a discretetime system with state            variable  input             v  and output  obeys the            difference equation                          k                a              k              k               b              k              v              k                           k               c              k              k             where the time varying coefficients             a              k              b              k  and             c              k  are all periodic with period            two Calculating the state variable and output            stepbystep leads to                        for any integer             p  By defining lifted inputs            and outputs                        and considering the system state only at the even            time points               p                p  we arrive at an equivalent            timeinvariant system            The lifting technique has been illustrated above for            a discretetime system with period two however it can            be applied to systems with arbitrary period  though            the corresponding formulae are considerably more            complicated see                                    Computation of SSV            There is considerable literature in control theory            on the computation of the SSV see for example                  For general classes of uncertainty computing               is known to be NPhard                Typically given the feedback loop consisting of             G and  we compute upper and            lower bounds for the SSV     The lower bound is            exactly equal to                   unfortunately computing            this lower bound involves a search over a nonconvex            set and therefore may converge to local optimums that            are not global In contrast the upper bound can be            rewritten in terms of a convex optimisation problem so            that a global minimum can be obtained However this            upper bound is in general not tight A software            package is commercially available that can compute              upper and uses a power algorithm            to attempt to compute              lower                                          Results                  Single parameter robustness          The robustness of Laub and Loomiss oscillatory model          was first analysed by means of singleparameter          bifurcation diagrams Four typical diagrams are shown in          Fig  The activity of internal cAMP            x             is plotted as a function of the          variation of each parameter We use internal cAMP in the          diagram as it is the element that is usually observed          experimentally     In each of the diagrams there          are three types of solutions stable steady state          unstable steady state and limit cycle oscillations          These diagrams illustrate that Hopf bifurcations occur          for each parameter that is the oscillatory behaviour          exists only in a limited range of parameters around the          nominal value For each of these parameters the          respective intervals and values for degreeofrobustness          are found in Table                           Structural singular value          From the numerical simulation Fig  of the          nonlinear model we observed that the oscillatory curves          did not deviate greatly from a simple harmonic oscillator          plus a constant offset Thus to obtain an analytic          expression for the periodic orbits we assume that the          state variables are expanded into Fourier series          containing only the fundamental and constant terms                    for each of the seven states Since it is the relative          phase shift between each state variable that is relevant          we assume that               The substitution of the Fourier          series into the original equations leads to a series of          real algebraic equations for the coefficients not shown          whose solution was obtained using Mathematica This leads          us to obtain the corresponding periodic solutions where          the values of           A                      i             A                      i  and                        i            are found in Table  The period           T is approximately  minutes          This analytic solution matches well with the numerical          simulation except for an arbitrary phase shift which          does not affect the shape and location of the limit cycle          in the phase space and can thereby be ignored not          shown          Following our prescribed methods we next linearized          the system The Jacobian matrix is obtained and was          decomposed as in Eqn  to obtain                    The matrix           B                       t              B                     i            j   where                    Similarly the matrix           C                       t              C                     i            j   where all coefficients are          zero except for the following                    Finally           D              and the perturbation structure          is given by            diag                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Note that since the nominal trajectory is periodic          the matrix functions in the nominal description are also          periodic Note also that in the uncertainty matrix           some uncertainties are repeated                                     and              while             is missing          The system was then discretized and lifted following          the procedure outlined above A comparison of the system          response for each of the approximations at the nominal          parameter values is given in Fig B          For the sampling time we tried various values of           n but found negligible differences          for values above eight Finally we computed the bounds          on the SSV Once again we found that the values of these          two bounds were not affected much by the sampling          frequency provided that           n is greater than eight The upper          bound was successfully computed using     The          maximum over all frequencies is approximately           However the high dimension of system causes convergence          problem during the computation of            lower using this package To obtain          an acceptable lower bound we calculate the spectral          radius at each frequency This gives us a lower bound for                     lower  The plot of the bounds for          the SSV when           n   is shown in Fig  We can          use            lower to obtain a conservative          region for robust stability The highest value over all          frequencies for            lower is approximately                             Discussion        Recent years has seen an appreciation that key cellular        properties are robust to variations in individual parameter        values Based on the topology of many of these networks        this should not be surprising Feedback  both negative and        positive  control systems are ubiquitous in most        biological networks    and one of the reasons for using        feedback is that it reduces sensitivity of a systems        behaviour to its parameter values        In modelling biological networks it is important that        this robustness also be in evidence The particular        behaviour being characterized by the model should not rely        on precise values of the models parameters  for example        reaction rate constants or protein concentrations In        particular a precise measurement of these constants is        difficult whereas protein concentrations will vary from one        cell to another or throughout the lifetime of any        individual Deviations from the nominal model parameter        values should not result in a loss of the networks        performance thus parameter sensitivity can be used to        validate mathematical models of biochemical system That        is the more insensitive the system response is to the        accuracy of the parameter the more faith we should have in        the model            In looking at certain classes of behaviour where        qualitative changes in the stability of the system are        possible bifurcation diagrams provide an elegant means of        evaluating robustness For example in evaluating the        robustness of the model of Laub and Loomis of primary        importance is determining whether the oscillatory behaviour        will persist if the parameter values are altered This        qualitative difference in performance  from limit cycle        oscillations to constant steady states  can be quantified        and compared across parameters or from one model to        another Once the robustness of the oscillatory behaviour        is established further investigations of the robustness of        some of the oscillatory features for example frequency and        amplitude can further be evaluated        From the bifurcation diagrams obtained for each of the        fourteen parameters we know that oscillations exist only        in a limited range around the nominal value We find the        system to be quite sensitive to variations in         k                   k                   k          and         k          and mostly insensitive to the others        Singleparameter bifurcation analysis also shows that the        amplitude of the oscillation is greatly affected by the        variation of  parameters          k                   k                   k                   k                   k                   k                   k                   k           and         k                  Based on the SSV stability to interpret multiple        parameter sensitivity we can conclude that robust        stability of the periodic orbits will be maintained        provided that                Since the uncertainty matrix consists only of diagonal        entries this bound applies to each of the individual        parameters Thus we can guarantee that the system will be        robustly stable provided that no single parameter differs        more than  from its nominal value        In our analysis we found a large gap between          upper and our lower bound for  As        we later show for this system the upper bound is fairly        tight as we are able to obtain a destabilizing        perturbation of size  For general biological models a        robustness measure based on the upper bound          upper may also be more appropriate        Robustness bounds for systems in which arbitrarily        slowlytimevarying parameter values are allowed are known            For these systems it has been shown that the        bounds converge as the timevariations approach zero to the        upper bound          upper     Since many of the        parameters in models of biochemical networks represent        features that will vary over time such as enzyme        concentrations this number may therefore be more        indicative of the models true robustness        The ability to consider the effect of timevariations on        the robustness of the system is one great advantage of the        SSV over other methodologies One drawback of the SSV        approach compared to the bifurcation theory is that it does        not provide the precise combination of parameters that        destabilizes the system  only its size Also since the        upper bound is only sufficient to guarantee robustness        this number may in general give an overly conservative        notion of robustness        It must be emphasized that the SSV approach denoted here        is based on the linearized model of the system For some        classes of systems this linearization may not be possible         in this case the linear SSV approach documented here will        not be applicable However for most models used to        describe biochemical reactions this should not be a        problem        Because we are concentrating exclusively on the local        stability of the linearized model important parameters of        the oscillatory behaviour such as robustness of the        frequency and amplitudes of oscillation are not evaluated        Also the effect of parameter variations on the equilibrium        orbit are omitted In particular varying the kinetic        parameters will change the behaviour of the system in two        different ways the equilibrium periodic orbit will change        and the stability of deviations about this orbit will also        change The SSV allows one to quantify the robustness of        the second of these two effects It does not say anything        directly regarding the effect of parameter variations on        the equilibrium periodic orbit One way of bounding the        effect of these parameter changes is to write the original        differential equation as                 t           f          x          k         where         k          k            is the set of kinetic parameters        with nominal values         k           If the nominal periodic orbit when           is given by                x          t           x          t           x                   t         then linearizing about this orbit yields                          t           A          t          x                   t           v         where  is a constant vector that includes the effect of        this parametric uncertainty Thus the system can be        considered as being perturbed by a constant input signal         v  Provided that the homogeneous        system is exponentially stable and this is guaranteed by        the existence of a stable limit cycle and that         v is not too large the perturbed        systems state will remain in a neighbourhood of the origin        if the         f          x          p  in the original equation is        reasonably well behaved in         k  Detailed bounds and conditions on                f are given in Theorem  of            though it should be emphasized that these bounds tend to        be overly conservative in practice        To illustrate the local nature of the SSV analysis for        this system we perturbed the system parameters by varying        amounts The particular parameters were either increased or        decreased so as to bring them closer to the Hopf        bifurcation For example the nominal value of         k          is closer to                   k                   than to          so that we reduced         k          whereas         k          is closer to          than to                   k                   so we increased         k           In Fig we show the response of        these systems to changes of  and  both for the        linearized system  where the linearized response has been        superimposed on the nominal limit cycle Fig A and the        original nonlinear system Fig B For the smaller        value the linearized response is stable and we see that        after a transient the response settles to the nominal        limit cycle We also see this same behaviour in the        response of the nonlinear system with this level of        parameter perturbation For a  change in the parameters        however the linearized system is unstable We see this as        a deviation from the nominal limit cycle In the nonlinear        systems response this translates into an end to the        stable limit cycle The response does not blow up but        instead settles into a fixed point        This example illustrates how a robustness analysis of        the linearized system can be used to deduce the robustness        of the original nonlinear system as it shows that when        the linearized system is unstable the desired behaviour of        the nonlinear system will no longer be present This        example also points out the fact that the upper bound          upper   is not overly        conservative for this system as we were able to produce a        destabilizing perturbation of size         Finally we note that multiparametric robustness        analysis considered here is based on local properties of        the dynamical system since we are evaluating the        robustness of the linearized model Extensions to the        nonlinear model are the subject of active investigation                   However it is by combining the robustness analysis of        both single and multiple parameters we can obtain a more        thorough understanding of the region of stability of the        periodic solution in the high dimensional parameter space        and use this to improve upon the model In this particular        example we find that the systems robustness is governed        by several robustness limiting parameters         k                   k                   k          and         k                              Conclusions        Determining the robustness of mathematical models of        biological systems is important for several reasons First        there is growing evidence that many aspects of the networks        being modelled have evolved in such a way so that they are        robust as this allows them to tolerate natural variations        in the environment Thus faithful models should replicate        this robustness Second robustness of the models provide a        means of validating model quality since the performance of        the models should not rely on precisely tuned parameter        values that are impossible  or at best  difficult to        measure exactly        In this paper we illustrated the use of two tools        developed in dynamical systems theory and control        engineering to assess robustness quantitatively For an        example we considered an oscillatory molecular network        model due to Laub and Loomis that aims at describing        oscillatory behaviour in cAMP signalling observed in the        social amoeba         D discoideum This behaviour appears        as a stable limit cycle of the equations describing the        model We have evaluated the degree to which this limit        cycle is robust to variations in all the system        parameters        The robustness of the oscillatory behaviour to single        parameter variations was quantified using bifurcation        analysis Using the bifurcation analysis software tool AUTO        we determined that single parameter changes as small as         from the nominal value can cause the limit cycle to        disappear and a stable equilibrium to appear In addition        to the stability robustness AUTO is also able to evaluate        the sensitivity of the amplitude of the oscillation to        these parameter changes        To investigate the robustness of the model to        simultaneous changes in parameter values the structured        singular value SSV analysis tool was used Once the        system was in the correct framework for SSV analysis we        were able to determine that the system can only tolerate        very small changes in the parameter values  in the order        of   if we allow these parameters to vary with time        arbitrarily slowly        Finally it is important to note that to understand        completely the robustness properties of a model it is        appropriate to combine single and multiple parameter        sensitivity analyses                    Authors
