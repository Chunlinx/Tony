        okay um what type of music do you like   well pretty much uh the thing im into mostly is new age uh like Yanni um oh uh Peter Barden uh   uhhuh   gosh theres just so many of them i cant even cant even name them all Enya i just got a catalog just now as a matter of fact uh actually my husband got it uh Lady Slipper Catalog and its it has music from a lot of women and its got uh Enya in it and Carol Nessin have you ever heard of her   no i have not what what is the the message what is the underlying theme of new if heard of new age music but i dont i wouldnt know how to identify it   well actually most of the music that i listen to theres no theme its instrumental   oh really   um and i tend to like instrumental better because there isnt that underlying theme theres no message to be get gotten there um its just enjoying the melody   what   thats what i like about music   okay what separates that from something such as jazz music or you know   well um i guess you could tend to categorize some of the stuff like i like in into jazz uh Jean Luc Ponty is hes kinds of a hes hes jazz but hes kind of more of a contemporary type jazz hes got the um the electric violin   uhhuh   um um my husband just said  before i switched to this other phone he said so you like the Dixie Dregs and thats is another one of my favorite groups but its theyre kind of in a group by themselves really   so   theyre more theyre more like progressive   okay theyre progressive in that its just the same up beat tempo type or instruments they use   um no progressive music is more like they have real complex um uh rhythms and key uh key changes   uhhuh   um its its a more complex its its not your your typical top forty type that has um itll itll be in a particular key or whatever and it it doesnt change   uhhuh   um progressive has a lot of different um i dont know its its a lot more complex   okay what does this type of music have to do like when i go to the book store and i see new age books does this have anything to do with that   no no thats really a lot of groups dont like to be called new age because its kind of a a label that it it kind of kind of connotates the out of body experience like the   uhhuh   um Shirley MacLaine type thing and thats not it at all   yeah okay   its its just a different type of music and i guess um i guess you would really call it contemporary jazz   okay thats thats good and is this becoming more widely available   i think so um do you ever listen to one oh six   no   um um they play some of the stuff that i like although theyve gotten them theyve gotten to a lot more into the saxophone stuff and i dont really care a whole lot for saxophone like um Kenny G   yeah   hes okay but um i like more of a variety and it seems like they are playing all of this saxophone type music that enough is enough you can only handle so much of it   yeah so so you could label Kenny G as a new age   well yeah hes kind of a new age   okay i was wondering   kind of a jazz new age   all right   it kind of kind of depends on how you look at it   okay i ive listened to one of his disks probably about a month ago and and   uhhuh what did you think of it   i thought it was talented i thought you know hes a you know has definitely a lot of talent and i i wouldnt buy it for myself but i was glad to listen to it you know id   uhhuh yeah i saw him in concert several years ago and he is puts on a really good show   seems like he does   he really is incredibly talented   yeah well thats cool   what what what kind of music do you like to listen to mostly   um im very um open i listen to a little bit of anything ive got       i listened to rock and roll a lot when i was growing up so a lot of the groups that have been well established for a long time such as you know like Tom Petty or you know the Eagles   uhhuh yeah   i know most of their stuff and i continue to purchase their latest releases as long as you know they dont sell out and still stick within their you know their certain style   yeah i i like top Tom Petty until he got to be kind of top fortyish   yeah   like his first two albums were really good theyre real real you know nitty gritty down to the i mean real roots of rock and roll and i really liked that   yeah   when he got to doing his um um didnt he do a he did an album with who was it Stevie Nicks i think     yeah yeah they sang a couple of tracks on one of her albums   and that was okay but i liked his early stuff a lot better   yeah i was really im really impressed with his latest the what was the name of the latest album i have it its um i like it you know its youve got some top forty hits and im sure you know hes geared to that but there are some songs that are pretty cool on that and you know with the videos and stuff now coming out   yeah   he may be softening up little bit but you know i still like his voice and you know hes not you know its not that bad um i also like Christian music a lot   uhhuh   i like um i like um i like orchestra i like symphonies classical music   uhhuh   because   i like some classical except that i have a really hard time going to buy it because some of it is just really awful and some of it is really good and i dont know the good from the bad   right you dont know until you listen to it       so   excuse me   yeah unless you have someone that can loan it to you or you go to the library and listen to it   yeah   its kind of hard just to   yeah the one one classical piece that i really do like is Vivaldis Four Seasons   yeah   i really like that and i like i like some Beethoven   yeah   um and thats really all that ive really sampled that i why i should say i i have listened to some others that i like that i cant remember their names offhand my husband makes all these tapes of all different artists and i never know what im listening to i just know that i like it   so so if you walk into your home then you stick something in youre youre not sure what what would you stick in if you come home and just could you turn on a station or stick in an album or disc     id id probably put a CD on and i would i would probably probably most likely go to something new age i would probably  Carol Nessin or um or Yanni or somebody like that um once in a while ill put on some classical um   sometimes my husband has a whole variety of music so i really have pretty much anything to choose from   uhhuh well   um i do like a lot of the older stuff too but we dont really have a lot of the older stuff on CD um and thats pretty much all i listen to   did you   i i hardly ever listen to the radio anymore   did you say one oh six   yeah   has the new age station now are where do you live   yeah i live in Carrolton   okay we live i live in Sherman so im not sure if ill i can receive that station or not but i will try and ill you know listen for a while   oh okay okay   and see what it sounds like Stephanie was it   yeah   well uh thank you very much for talking and uh maybe well get hooked up again sometime   okay great thank you   all right talk to you later   okay   bye   byebye
