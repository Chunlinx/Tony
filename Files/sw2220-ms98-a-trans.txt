        i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music and theyre none of them are recent right   umhum   so i like Gordon Lightfoot do you know who he is  and the Moody Blues and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot and Willie Nelson   yeah uhhuh so you like  a a variety sort of easy listening because you you like country but then   yeah but not all country i dont like that when they start i dont know i just like Willie Nelson i guess because hes such a character   um oh uhhuh yeah i i like some of his songs though theyre theyre not so       theyre not so sad country all the time theyre just kind of sweet sometimes you know i mean theyre not the the typical country where theyre just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know   yeah my truck is broken down   yeah my trucks broken down and my house just burned down you know but   yeah and there theres a guy have you ever heard of George Winston he plays piano i think hes dead now  but he plays wonderfully   no uhhuh   i like that   are do you do you play the piano is or you just like it   very badly ive got a piano  my mother got a piano and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons   yeah   and i was  the one that did the least poorly so she gave it to me and its sitting here mostly taking up space but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it it is real relaxing     yeah it must be fun to be able to play it and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to itd be thatd be kind of fun i think   yeah   because i mean i play the flute and not many things you can play thatll you know people will sit there and sing along to and you cant sing along either so but um i like a lot uh i like classical music just because of the when when i i dont play i like jazz music but   oh so do i forgot about that i said so do i i forgot about jazz   whats that whats that yeah i like a lot like i like uh the the New Age music like with um uh the um um i dont know if youve heard Neurotic Collection   yes weve got about five of those i love them   yeah i love those too theyre just so relaxing   uhhuh id never heard them before until i went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and i just i heard a piece and it was just so wonderful and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it   yeah yeah isnt that nice i mean its nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful that everybody likes you know and uh   yeah   it it it it you know it has pieces that are uplifting but it uh its mostly relaxing and you dont uh because it doesnt have words you know you dont feel like theres anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean or but uh   i mean you can just sit you know those little booklets that come along with it and you can just see the things that theyre trying to show with music my my little boy has gotten so into it that hes identified the the people that have written certain songs and he buys the   yeah yeah   the pieces that have that person   yeah oh okay i see what youre saying yeah   you know on it huh i mean i dont even know who did which ones but he does   i i cant identify them either i just like them i couldnt i know which ones come next but i dont even know their names most of them i dont know their names of the song but i i can identify them but i like that and i like um course i i like classical music and uh   yeah were you in the band   i was in the band yeah so and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff so   so was i   im used to pieces i and and i played classical flute i didnt play play jazz flute or anything like that so i can i can relate to it i suppose but uh and i like im like you  i like the older stuff too because i like Chicago and i like i like um uh   yeah   let me think who um i like Hebert um oh you dont know Hebert Laws but Hebert Laws is a flute player hes a jazz flute player and i like um uh Chuck Mangione do you know who Chuck Mangione is yeah i like Chuck Mangione im trying to think of all um   yeah     uh whats his name plays the trumpet       um   i like the Moody Blues   yeah yeah i like Moody Blues i i like mostly the older groups i think   did you like them   oh  but we do have i like Simply Red we got Simply Red i thinking of all our CDs that we have what i really like and uh i like Breeze i like the group i think just because they all sort of sound they sound like a lot like red uh Simply Red if im going to listen to that kind of music nowadays thats its easy in listening   so what type  Simply Red ive never heard of that   um   is it just instrumental   no its its got people singing but  its it is instrumental but its its got people singing but its got a like a whole bunch of people singing you know um   how many people are in   yeah   on he cant hear me i i dont remember how many people but its its got men men and women and its not its its nice i mean its pleasant you know music its not whats it hurts your ears to hear it but its not as its not like uh Chicago where its got that much instrument to it you know it doesnt have like all the brass and everything   yeah   yeah   well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road were going to go to Commerce and see a friend and then im going to go to Sulphur Springs yeah where are you     oh you must live in this area were in Sherman   okay so were in Garland   oh okay youre going to Commerce for East Texas or something oh okay   yeah yeah yeah just because theres a friend up there not because theres much else   oh okay well theyre having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas thats why i was just wondering yeah East Texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester and theyre theyve been doing a lot of that in the area   for colleges well theyre not colleges theyre not going to recruit me anymore im through  no more for me what what do you do   no more huh well right now im just a homemaker but im going to school uh for legal assistant and thats why i know so and uh just nothing basically   are you going to go to East Texas for that   no no it uh no i dont go to East Texas uh i got a degree from TWU but im really interested in legal  you know in the legal environment but i dont want to be a lawyer so i said well i think ill go back to school and see about being a legal assistant  so   thatd probably be pretty interesting i was summoned down to the courthouse last week they had summoned eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial   oh uhhuh   this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three   yeah   and they had us fill out a long questionnaire we stayed till about one thirty and theyre going to call the ones that theyre interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial wont take place until June   yeah thats how it works   and they say its going to last about two to three weeks and this guy in front of me said i cant believe i was summoned i was an investigator and i was tailing the woman that was killed well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend thats a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one thats accused was the one that actually did it and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and hes going to testify for the state against her so hell have his sentence reduced   and this is the man that was in front of you oh well theyll weed him out   yeah the the investigator yeah he he got off right away and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that hed told me that so i figure that that will make me biased and i wont be chosen   yeah uhhuh   hopefully   well not necessarily but theres probably something else that might make you because you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jury the jury   yeah   you i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know and and know some of the different things about it but um they they might weed you out some other way you know if you if you dont believe like if this was a capital crime and and you dont believe in if you dont believe in death penalty youre not going to be picked at all so but   the death  penalty no i said that i could i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be id find it hard to levy that against somebody   yeah so see there there they would have a doubt about you that you know because if thats what if thats what the punishment is in that in that instance then youre always going to say   you know uhhuh   you know not guilty youre youre not going to want to have them have that crime uh that punishment so   yeah but then when youre uh when youre picked see i was picked for another murder trial before oh gosh and its so hard because you know   uhhuh   everybody is wanting to go on and and get the sentence done and if youre trying to hold out you know theres so much pressure on you and youve got to come up with a decision   well especially with something where you have to find you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt you have to find whether theyre guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and its like do you really feel that sure about
