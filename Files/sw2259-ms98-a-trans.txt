        well how how do you feel about the immigration laws   at currently i think they are a little restrictive uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries um i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern Europe for example uh particularly the uh the Jewish uh uh people from Russia i think we could permit more of them in than we have uh permitted in the last uh several years and i think we have uh uh too much restriction on the uh on the Orientals also but of course thats just my opinion   yeah well im not real sure why i got this topic because i dont think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws   umhum umhum well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly South American countries and uh there is no uh uh i have nothing of course against uh the uh the South Americans or uh or Hispanics in that sense but i think we uh are more restrictive of the um so called eastern uh European countries than we uh uh we should be of course thats from my own bias since my ancestors from Eastern Europe so   oh   and uh so i think uh you know the  um embargo we placed on the uh on the Russian Jews although we spent of uh spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred we   uhhuh   simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds so   hum   i do not quite go along with that but   no that doesnt make a whole of lot sense   no and i still think you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from a uh uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides both my mothers parents and my fathers parents were immigrants so   umhum   im a little touchy  every now and then about that     yeah well uh my uh my family is from uh  Europe from well from England and Ireland   umhum   and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years   oh my   so i dont have any any uh relatives that i am or or uh several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all they were all born here   uhhuh   so i dont have any real strong ties with any with with the immigration laws i dont because i dont i dont have any personal feelings about them and i i havent taken the time or effort to learn what they are   well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an opposite point of view which is uh although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country um   uhhuh   i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um some quotas of course my family and i again again that was you know my uh grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas so they had to wait uh you know in uh certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over   uhhuh   so you know  but uh   yeah i i   i think unrestricted immigration i think is not uh is not best uh   well i agree with that i i think if  immigration was entirely unrestricted uh not only would would the United States become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly i think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries i think theyd come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime   umhum well you know theres another aspect of this too theyre also uh uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which   i was not aware aware of that   well yes there are were some uh regulations over i dont know whether theyre laws passed or or whatever theyre called uh just recently where uh people with certain diseases cannot be excluded uh from immigration AIDS is one for example and uh recently uh tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also   uhhuh   so i think in in some some aspect some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense but uh i think we should be a little more circumspect about it again my opinion   yeah   think weve talked long enough   i think so   all right   well ive enjoyed talking to you   or i i i have talked long enough   okay  thanks       thank you   byebye   goodbye
