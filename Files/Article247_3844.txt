                                 Linguistic Resuscitation                        Dear Dennis            The issue of minority languages is one that I find very interesting and youraised some important questions You have written quite a bit about bilingualeducation and Englishonly movements But I wonder what you think about some ofthe real minority languages            In your letter you mentioned Navajo and Breton the Celtic language ofBrittany coincidentally this morning I got a letter from a colleague who haspublished an extensive dictionary of Hopi and is working with educators to helpHopi children learn their ancestral language It seems to me that such casesare viewed rather differently in the mainstream than say Spanish People havea romantic attachment to these obscure languages often for nationalisticreasons The Celtic languages are an especially relevant casenot only isthere renewed interest in Breton Irish Scottish Gaelic and Welsh but thereare revival movements for the extinct Manx and Cornish The Cornish revivalmovement is in general supported mostly by middleclass English people inCornwall not the descendants of the Celts who originally spoke the languageHistorical details often support these interests as in the Navajo codetalkerswho played an important role in World War II            The political movements that support English as an official language are notthreatened by Breton Basque or Boontling a moribund argot spoken in a townin Northern California They are threatened by Spanish mostly Do you thinkit ironic that there is interest in some of these languages at the same timethere is such hostility to other languages and nonstandard dialects            Back to Lewinsky While the name does have a little currency as a slangterm or euphemism for oral sexmore than I thought when I spoke to the NewYork Post I agree that it wont have much staying power The differencebetween it and Heimlich or sandwich to take two more common eponyms isthat there are many many other terms for oral sex but none for the Heimlichmaneuver or a sandwich A good comparison is the use of OJ as a verb In and  I collected a number of examples of OJ in the sense to beat oneswife or girlfriend and debated entering the term in the second volume of theRandom House Historical Dictionary of American Slang  which I wasediting at the time In the end I thought that it was unlikely to last andkept it out Based on the subsequent history I think it was a correctdecision Its likely that without the senior Lewinskys calling attention tothis usage it would have died a relatively natural death instead it will beremembered as a joke whenever her name comes up            BestJesse
