                i you know actually in this modern day and age it seems like uh uh we have more and more leisure time because uh we have so many uh convenience appliances and whatnot and we dont even have to cook dinner anymore uh     yeah really   but i uh ive heard i dont know this for a fact but ive heard that a lot of families really dont spend a great deal of time together that kids the kids maybe on the average get uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents   thats what ive heard too uh   it seems bizarre to me i dont quite understand it although i think probably the the worst thing thats happening in the world at least the modern world today is  television   yeah   not so much because uh its bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming and i think theres also some uh i think um poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time   right   its so darned easy to turn the thing on   i know it ive ive found myself sometimes just sit down after work and   so i refuse to have one in the house yeah   oh really well good for you good for you a lot of people ive talk to a lot of people about that and ive thought about it myself and       i thought about it a lot   um   but uh i still havent done it yet well thats good   well ill tell you television sure makes child rearing easy on you i mean the kids can be a real pest uh and turning the TV on is almost like magic you know its uh like sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center and you dont have to worry about them   thats true ive noticed that   but i dont think its too good   i dont think so either   um so you know i dont know i take advantage i dont have a great deal of time to spend with the kids but i take advantage of um dinner time we always eat together and you know whenever youre with your kids you wanna interact with them rather than just ignore them   do you keep your kids uh active in sports or anything or   uh i guess our big outlet is music um our thirteen year old son plays violin and our nine year old daughter plays cello   oh okay   and uh when our son started playing violin i took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello i took up cello so theres plenty of   okay   plenty of interactive time in uh practicing although neither kid likes to practice       i guess thats not a big surprise   no not for kids   but i mean i imagine with infants you  are most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them   yeah well i i i try and read to them and   although you   and i take them to the park and stuff and   oh you know reading is so good   yeah   i uh i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little and i still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore   yeah well they get to this stage   uh but i read you know theres this Doctor Seuss sleep book have you ever seen that yet   sleep book no   yeah its called a sleep book and uh you ought to get it i tell you i read that book to my kids so many times i almost have the thing memorized       uh   weve got a quite a few of Doctor Seusss books and   yeah well i think i think his sleep book is my favorite   oh really   umhum   well yeah i like to i like to do it and they enjoy reading and ive actually i never read a lot growing up and i never read until a few years ago i just started picking up books and so it ive found that you know its really important to me to get to read to i like to get away in a book you know   umhum umhum   and so ive put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids   umhum   to try   so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day   oh i probably spend an hour or two   oh thats great   my wife works at night so she does uh Tupperware so shes gone a lot at nights and so i spend a lot of time with them   oh i see so how old are your kids again   theyre two and one   two and one   umhum   yeah so you have your hands full with them thats for sure   yeah
