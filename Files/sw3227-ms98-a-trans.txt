        okay well um     what kind of music do you like   i am i was thinking about it for a long time and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music um i dont have a whole lot of dislikes i um like jazz um especially the blues and uh i like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from Bach and and Beethoven and Chopin and um just in general everything   umhum   um i enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh       still   do you like like rock and those kind of things punk even   yeah right right uh well       that gets some of the punk um when i was in high school that was uh one of the big things was punk music and uh a lot of it is has a lot to say or some some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do but the the actual   i dont think they have a whole lot to say even   uh well it its its it really expresses some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music   yeah i guess   um but as far as a musical art form i just dont see a whole lot of art to it um   uhhuh do you like rap   um some of it um it depends i like uh the rap the two types of rap i like or i enjoy to listen to and one is the the rap that is just funny um and they usually do a lot of satire   yeah   um   that kind i kind of like some of it is kind of   right right the monotonous the monotonous no thats not   pointless yeah   i dont enjoy that at all when theyre just talking about well im better than you and blah blah blah i dont like that i like the funny satire and then some of it is   uhhuh yeah yeah   some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in   yeah   urban society it it really does it talks about um race relations and police relations and um that that   i guess i dont really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times um im with you though i like classical um   umhum umhum   i dont like to listen to it all the time but um some of the time anyway i like easy listening just kind of you know i guess i dont care much for rock and roll any more i used to like it all right but i dont really care to listen to it any more for some reason um lets see country western uh im not quite as big on that some of its okay um   yeah thats thats about my opinion of that   yeah   its its okay um   uh some of it kind of falls in the rap category i guess so   hm the thing about country western that i dont enjoy is is doesnt seem to be any imagination   yeah   behind it the one country and western song sounds like every other country and western   a lot of them sound uh really similar yeah   and so the the musicians       dont get to really get into their music they just play a certain number of chords the drummer plays a certain beat and you have a country and western song   yeah hm   and   well thats kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes too i guess they dont really has kind of the same sound over and over and the other thing i dont like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you cant understand what the lyrics are   hm   you cant understand what theyre saying on some of those songs   right   which probably is just as well on some of them too   yeah and i cant say that i like a lot of the modern the very very modern   yeah   uh rock and roll but i i definitely i really enjoy the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies   yeah earlier things   rock and roll and uh i really enjoy especially the sixties uh every
