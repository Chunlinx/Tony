Where to GoAmsterdam is a small city and eminently walkable though if you only have a short time take advantage of the tram system which will transport you efficiently to all the most important attractions Circle Tram  links them all on one route and runs at minute intervals throughout the day from the central stationPerhaps the most disconcerting thing for the newcomer is how to find your way around The City center can seem at first like a maze of tiny streets and canals with no overall plan however in some ways it works very much like the plan of a spiders web and once you understand the structure of the town plan it is relatively easy to get around The central core around Dam Square is horseshoeshaped and consists of a series of wide streetsthe main one is the DamrakRokin which cuts the centerand narrow alleys It also has some of the oldest waterways once so important for the delivery of goods from around the Dutch colonial worldThis area is ringed by a girdle of canals the major ones are called grachts running outward in ever larger circles Singel was once the outer barrier for the medieval city but as the city expanded Herengracht Gentlemans Canal Keizersgracht Emperors Canal and Prinsengracht Princes Canal enlarged the web Incidentally if you do feel lost or confused when strolling remember that these three canals are set in alphabetical order H K and PSmall streets straats radiate out from the center crossing the canals by means of the thousands of bridges which are such a distinctive part of the city landscape To the north of the city centerthe IJ becomes the IJsselmeer a former route to the North Sea now dammed west of the IJ at this point is the NoordzeekanalAmsterdams presentday route to the open seaWe have divided the city into four sections which are easy to follow on foot We have started in the center of the city where you will be able to take your bearings obtain whatever information you need from the VVV Tourist information office and take a canal boat tour This is one of the most exciting ways to get an overview of historic Amsterdam and to see the true beauty of the cityThe CenterCentral Amsterdamwhat was once the Medieval cityis very small indeed The port was the lifeblood of the city at that time and ships would sail right into the heart of Amstelredamme as it was then known Today only a few architectural gems are left to remind us of this era but the tangle of narrow alleyways gives a feel of the hustle and bustle which must have accompanied the tradersThe decision to locate the Central Station on the site of the old harbor wall was the final death knell of maritime trade for the city It stopped large cargo ships from landing their catches and diminished the importance of the canal systems The station opened in  dominates the view up Damrak The impressive building was designed by PJH Cuypers who was also responsible for the design of the Rijksmuseum and sits on three artificial islands supported by  wooden pilesAcross the wide Stationplein in front of the entrance you will find a large VVV Amsterdam Tourist Office where you can get information buy transport tickets make hotel reservations or book theater tickets The office is housed in the rebuilt Noord Zuid Koffiehuis which was rebuilt in  from the plans of the original This was demolished when the metro was constructed in  You will also find canal tour boats moored here and thousands of bicycles waiting for their ridersWalk over the square towards the city and as you cross the canal bridge look to your left to see the distinctive spires of Sint Nicolaaskerk Saint Nicholas Church Sint Nicolaas is an important saint for Amsterdam being patron of the city and of seafarers This Catholic Church replaced many of the secret chapels which were built for worship during the period of Catholic persecution and was completed in Once over the bridge you will find yourself on Damrak This wide boulevard was formerly a major docking area for sailing boats from the colonies On your left you will find the marina area full of glasstopped tour boats To your right the street side is lined with fast food cafs giving it a slightly down at the heels appearanceJust beyond the tour boats at the head of Damrak is the Beurs van Berlage the old stock exchange Its refined modern lines were a revelation when it opened in  and excited much debate in the city Unfortunately it didnt excite traders quite as much and is now used as a concert and exhibition hall featuring everything from chamber music to modern artThe warren of streets to the left of the Beurs building is what Amsterdammers call Oude Zijd or Old Side and this area constituted the old warehouse district in medieval times The narrow alleyways are darker than in more modern parts of the city and the houses appear even narrower and taller Dominating the streets is the imposing Gothic basilica of Oude Kerk Old ChurchAs its name suggests Oude Kerk is the earliest Parish church in Amsterdam work began on it at the start of the th century when Amstelredamme was only just starting as a trading town Over the following three centuries the church saw several extensions as the population of the city grew until it took on the interesting and rather overbusy shape it is todaywith several chapels adding gables to the original structure In its early life it was more than a church acting as a marketplace and hostel for the poor and needyOnce inside the sheer scale of the church is immediate and impressive Commemorative tombstones cover the floor including that of Saskia Rembrandts wife The stained glass windows are also impressive One commemorates the Peace of Munster and shows a Spanish official handing over the charter recognizing the independent Dutch State Several of the windows show Bible scenes on a majestic scale but look also for the simple red door above which is written the advice marry in haste repent at leisureThe canalside streets of Oudezijds Voorburgwal and Oudezijds Achterburg southwest of Oude Kerk are home to the infamous Amsterdam Red Light District known to Amsterdammers as the Walletjes or little walls As with any large port prostitution was rife from the earliest times and although the Calvinist Protestants tried to stamp it out it has thrived to the present day What makes the situation different in Amsterdam in modern times is that the industry has been legitimized and regulated in an attempt to curb the most disturbing facets of exploitation and in order to address health concerns The prostitutes are entitled to regular health checks and are expected to pay taxes on their earningsyet another example of the Dutch peoples trademark pragmatic approach when it comes to tackling societys difficult issues The area is safeexcept perhaps in the early hours of the morningand filled with tourists The treelined canals and old narrow iron bridges are some of the prettiest in the city and prostitutes ply their trade behind relatively discreet windows not on the streetsAt ground level seedy or amusing  depending on your point of view shops sell sex wares attracting customers from all walks of life but dont get too distracted else youll miss the rows of dainty gables quirky wall plaques and window boxes brimming with flowers which give the whole area a cheery feel Dont be surprised to find offices shops and restaurants living side by side with the brothels hereits all part of Amsterdam lifeAt night the streets come alive with bars clubs and adult shows It is one of liveliest parts of the city after dark Just make sure that you stay on the busier and welllit thoroughfares as you make your way back to your hotelYou will find several historical gems as you wander Walletjes One of the narrow houses on Oudezijds Voorburgwalnumber has a wonderful secret to share Museum Amstrelkring was a merchants house bought by Catholic Jan Hartman in  Following the Alteration in  Catholics were not permitted to practice their religion and Hartmanalong with a number of other wealthy Catholics of the timehad a secret chapel built where his family and friends could worship Although they were common at the time this is now the only secret chapel left in the city and because of its location in the house is called Our Lord in the Attic or Ons Lieve Heer op Solder Over its years of use as a church three surrounding houses were added to create extra space and several of the other rooms are furnished in authentic thcentury style It is a fascinating glimpse of a very difficult time in Amsterdams history but its not just a museum piecethe church is still used for weddingsSoutheast of Oude Kerk you will walk through the small Chinese Quarter to reach Waag This is one of the oldest buildings in the city and was opened in  as a city gate marking the eastern boundary of the city along the new wall built after the disastrous fire in the s The numerous turrets and rounded tower give it the look of a fairytale castle but it has had a more colorful history Public executions were held here in the th century with the condemned being kept in a small cell on the ground floor before they met their fate From the early th century it became the weigh house the name Waaggebouw means weigh house for cargoes entering or leaving the city down the Geldersekade Canal to its north The upperfloor rooms were taken by various trades guilds for their meetings and for onethe Guild of Surgeonsit was used for practical medical research including experiments with cadavers Rembrandt created two canvasses for the Guild of Surgeons which have become two of his most famous paintings The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Tulp and The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Diejman both show scenes from guild activities at the Waag and were hung here on their completionIn the early th century the weigh house closed and Waag had a number of less illustrious tenants it even spent some time as a furniture store It now houses a cafbar so you can have a refreshment and admire the impressive Gothic interior at the same timeNieuwmarkt New Market surrounds the Waag and it is home to several different types of market throughout the week If you walk to the north side of the Waag and look up the Gelderskade you will see a tower dominating the skyline This is Schreierstoren also part of the new city wall of  City scholars are divided as to the reason for the towers name Some say it comes from the word schreien which means weeping as it was a place where sailors weeping wives came to wave their men off to sea Other say that the name is a derivation of scherpe which means sharpdenoting the towers position on a degree bend in the wallFrom Waag walk down Sint Antoniesbreestraat past modern apartment blocks built for the workers of the city in the s On your right you will see the ornate tower of Zuiderkerk South Church This church was the first place of worship to be built following the Reformation and was begun in  Designed by Hendrick de Keyser its lines were much admired by Sir Christopher Wren architect of St Pauls Cathedral in London It was deconsecrated in  and is now a community information centerThe end of Sint Antoniesbreestraat brings you to a tiny square with a wonderful view up the Oudeschans Canal to your left Youll find an old house now a small barcaf in the foreground and in the background the tower of Montelbaanstoren Built as part of a new outer defensive wall in  it originally had a flat roofthe ornate peak giving it such panache was added by de Keyser later in  Today it is used by the local Water Authority as an office buildingAfter pausing to take a photograph cross the street to Jodenbreestraat Jewish Broad Street and the story brick building with red shutters This is Museum Het Rembrandthuis Rembrandts House and was home to the great artist from  toThe painter bought the house as he rose in prestige and wealth He created a studio on the top floor where there was abundant natural light to illuminate his subjects and space for him to teach his numerous pupils He lived with his wife and infant son on the first floor The whole house was restored in the late s including the studio and the painters kunstkamer or cabinet to recreate the early s as faithfully as possible Over  of the artists etchings have been beautifully presented on the upper floors of the house Unfortunately Rembrandt was not able to live out his life in his home His lack of financial acumen and love of expensive objects caused him to become bankrupt in  and he had to sell all his possessions including the house in Het Rembrandthuis has as a neighbor one of the most up to date attractions in the city The Holland Experience offers an audiovisual tour of Hollandits landscapes and traditional activities Ride through colorful bulb fields or across the polders lowlying lands reclaimed from the sea and rivers from the comfort of your seat and all in  minutesSoutheastRunning parallel to Jodenbreestraat on the lefthand side is Waterlooplein named after the famous battle and home to the famous flea market of the same name Every day youll find an eclectic mix of secondhand crockery clothes and electrical equipment on sale along with cotton clothes from India or Indonesia The eastern end of the market square is dominated by the twin spires of Mozes en Aronkerk Moses and Aaron Church a Catholic Church built in  on the site of a secret chapel The Old Testament figures of Moses and Aaron were found depicted on gable stones in the original building and were set into the wall of the new edifice The fine towers are actually wood rather than stone They were painted to match the sandstone walls in a  restorationWaterloopleinand its marketused to be much larger but a massive building project begun in the early s cut its size considerably Protesters deplored the loss of several old canal houses fringing the square which constituted much of what was left of the old Jewish Quarter Nevertheless the construction went ahead and the result of this labor is the Muziek Theater and Stadhuis the front faade and entrance of which sits majestically on the Amstel RiverThe attractive glassfronted building was opened in  It is home to the Netherlands Opera and the National Ballet and also hosts a range of traveling companies in what is the largest auditorium in the Netherlands Amsterdammers have christened this combination of town hall and theater the stopera staduisoperaThe Amstel River has always been a major artery through the city and even today you will see a large amount of commercial traffic passing along the waterway From the terrace and walkway around the Muziek Theater there are wonderful views of the boats and the canal houses bordering the water The bridge in front of Muziek Theater provides a wonderful view down the river and is also one of the most interesting bridges in Amsterdam Blauwbrug Blue Bridge is named after the color of the previous bridge which occupied the site The present bridge dating from  is based on Pont Alexander III in Paris and is ornamented with carvings of ships and other maritime themesAlthough Blauwbrug is the most ornate bridge in the city Amsterdammers and visitors alike still have a soft spot for its neighbor just a little way south down the Amstel Magere Brug or Skinny Bridge This whitepainted wooden drawbridge is pictureperfect and one of the most enduring symbols of the city It is even prettier at dusk when the lights on its arches and spars are switched on There has been a bridge on this site since the s but the present one was erected as recently as Along the river on either side of Magere Brug are a number of wonderful barges moored on the banks The huge craft which would once have carried heavy cargoes such as grain and coal now make surprisingly large comfortable quirky and very expensive homesBeyond Magere Brug on the left bank of the Amstel you will see the faade of Theater Carr Traditionally the site of the Carr Circus the Carr family built a wooden structure on the site to house their shows Later the structure was deemed to be a fire hazard and so they had this beautiful stone building designed for them which opened for performances in  It now hosts many different types of performance but a circus always appears here at Christmas timeCross the river via Magere Brug then travel one block north and take a left along the northern bank of the Herengracht Canal Here you will get your first glimpse of the canal system which was built during Amsterdams Golden Age and revolutionized the city During its time probably the most sought after and expensive real estate in the world Herengracht particularly has many beautiful houses which can really only be appreciated by an afternoon strolling by them see box page  This part of town is still mostly residential and many houses have been converted into apartments for successful Amsterdammers It is fascinating to peek inside at the ultramodern interiors which give a feel of the flair the Dutch seem to have for interior designAt number  Herengracht Museum WilletHolthuysen gives you the opportunity to look behind the faade of a genuine Golden Age house It was completed in  and structurally has been altered very little since that time although it has been changed cosmetically several times as fashions changed In  it came into the possession of the Holthuysen family Pieter Holthuysen was a successful trader in glass and English coal which goes to prove that you didnt need to trade in exotic goods to become wealthy After the death of Pieter and his wife the house is bequeathed to their daughter Louisa who later married Abraham Willet He had a love of art and was a founding member of the Royal Antiquarian Societya society whose aim was to promote national art and history On her death in  Louisa bequeathed the house and its contents to the city of Amsterdam on condition that it would be opened as a museum This it duly did in  You will be able to examine in detail the furniture porcelain and numerous artworks collected by the familyTravel further along Herengracht to the end of the second block Here you will find one of the most fascinating views of the canal ring From the bridge it is possible to see  other bridges by looking up and down Herengracht and ahead down the adjoining Reguliersgracht this view is even better at water level so take a canal cruiseand your camera Reguliersgracht has some very pretty houses and is quieter than the main three girdle canals built at this timeThe small square here is Thorbeckeplein and you will see a suitably somber statue of Johan Rudolf Thorbecke who designed the Dutch constitution in  Wander through the square which hosts an art market on Sundays to reach Rembrandtsplein one of the citys most vibrant social centers Before  this square was called Botermarkt a butter market was held here in the th century but the square was renamed after the large statue of Rembrandt was sited here One wonders what he would have made of the square for since the statue was unveiled it has attracted theaters cinemas clubs and show halls along with a plethora of bars and restaurants and a curtain of vibrant neon signs all around the faade On a summer evening it is one of the best places to sit with a drink and watch the world go by and is within easy reach of a romantic walk along the canalsidesBeyond the eastern end of Waterlooplein you will see the Visserplein busy with several lanes of traffic Head across the square to Weesperstraat to find the Joods Historisch Museum Jewish Historical Museum which documents the history of the once large and influential Jewish community in the city Jewish history dates back to the late th century but was cut short by the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam in  The systematic deportation of the Jewish population to concentration camps destroyed the community and after the war only a handful of the thousands forced to leave returned to their homesThe museum which opened in  was created by the amalgamation of four old Ashkanazi synagogue buildings The exhibitions reveal the history of the Amsterdam Jews but also explain the philosophies of Judaism and examine Jewish identity in a broader senseAcross the busy road of Weesperstraat are two other reminders of the oncethriving Jewish community In a stark exposed position near the road in Jonas Danil Meijerplein is the Dokwerker Statue by Mari Andriessen This figure of a true working man commemorates the day in February  when the dock workers rose up in protest against the Nazi deportation of the Jews Behind the statue is the PortugeseIsralitische Synagoge Portuguese Synagogue which was inaugurated in  for the Spanish and Portuguese Sephardic Jews who settled in the city Its design is said to be based on that of King Solomons TempleFrom Jonas Danil Meijerplein look southeast to the glass houses of the Hortus Botanicus Botanical Gardens easily seen just across the Nieuwe Herengracht canal Cross the canal by walking left along its banks to the nearby bridge Once across you have entered the Plantage area of the city once an area of parkland but which developed from the midth century into one of the first city suburbsThe Botanical Gardens have a long and illustrious history They began as a small medicinal garden in  but soon became the depository for many of the new plant species brought from Dutch colonies in the Golden Age and were responsible for developing each genus for cultivation propagation and commercial exploitation The distinctive glass houses were added in  and today the gardens have one of the largest collections in the worldA twominute walk down Plantage Middenlaan Plantage Middle Road leads you to Artis a fascinating complex of zoo aquarium planetarium and Geological Museum which aims to increase your knowledge of the physical world The zoo was one of the first in Europe when it opened its doors in  and it has continued as a groundbreaking institution now acting as a center for efforts to save several endangered species of animalsMany of the old and confined Victorian enclosures where the animals were kept have been redeveloped in the s to create more fitting environments for their majestic and healthylooking animals The Planetarium and other areas of Artis offer fun ways to learn about the world around us and are entertaining for adults and children alikeSoutheast of Artis across two canals and busy roads is Oosterpark an open green area with a lake and play areas we would suggest taking a tramnumbers  and rather than walking here from the city center In the northern corner of the park is the Tropenmuseum once the home of the Dutch Colonial Institute The building itself was built in  and built especially to house the institutes collection of artifacts from the tropicsToday the aim of the museum is to improve our knowledge of the worlds tropical areas and promotes an understanding of the peoples in these developing parts of the world A vast collection of artifacts from the former Dutch East Indies now Indonesia was the starting point for the displays which range from tribal masks to tools and utensils in daily use Recreations of a Bombay street and Arab souk among other locales bring home the reality of life in these very different societies The museum also has a Kindermuseum Childrens Museum offering  year olds a chance to explore the collection and interact with the exhibits Special guides lead children through the artifacts and explain their context The Kindermuseum must be booked in advance and at present the tours are in Dutch onlyNorth of Artis is Entrepotdok In the th century this was the warehouse region of the city and its carefully designed canals were one of the busiest port areas in Europe The warehouses fell into disrepair in the th century and lay empty for many years before they became a center for the s and s squatter revolution which overtook the city Since the s the area has been totally renovated and the warehouses gutted to create modern spacious housing offices and bars and restaurants without changing the basic design of the buildingsSome inhabitants get a birds eye view of Artis zooimagine looking out of your apartment window on a rainy Amsterdam day and seeing a small herd of grazing zebraWalk north through Entrepodok and you will reach the main route of Prinse Henrikkade which runs along the northern edge of the city this would lead you back to central station if you turned left Cross the bridge of the Nieuwe Vaart canal and walk towards a large square building with a masted sail ship docked outside This is The Scheepvaartmuseum The National Maritime Museum As you cross the bridge look left for a glimpse of the only windmill left in the citys central area The De Gooyer windmill was built in the early part of the th century to grind cornThe building housing The Scheepvaartmuseum was built in  for the Dutch navy Its strong walls safeguarded a vast arsenal used to protect Dutch interests around the known world Today its extensive exhibits document the long and illustrious history of maritime achievement by the Dutch with paintings maps and maritime models explaining the part that shipsand particularly the VOCplayed in the growth of the empire in the th centuryThe Dutch Royal barge last used in  is also kept in airconditioned splendor but perhaps pride of placeand certainly what brings thcentury seafaring to lifeis the recreation of a Dutch East India ship The Amsterdam which sits in the dock outside She is the lifesize replica of a real ship completed in  but more than this The Amsterdam has a pressganged crew to man her As you explore her decks the captain will illustrate his course with charts of the time the doctor will explain his rather primitive treatments and the ordinary seamen will be happy to sing you a Dutch sea shantyNext to the museum and unmistakable by its modern shape and huge green outer walls is the newMetropolis science and technology center Opened in  the center was created to bring the latest science and technology literally into the hands of the lay person whatever their age Even the location of the building is a technological marvel It sits high above the entrance to the IJ tunnel which takes six lanes of traffic under the IJ waterway to Amsterdams northern suburbs and north Holland beyond Inside the center you can try your hand at playing the stock exchange by computer change the wheel on a car or look at the cells of the body through a microscope There are handson experiments for everyone from young children to adults focusing on five linked themesEnergy Humanity Interactivity Science and TechnologySouthwestThe southwest section takes on a fan shape from the center of the city widening as it travels out and taking in the major art museums of the cityOur starting point is Muntplein at the junction of the Amstel and the Singel canalsAlthough only a small square and cut by so many tramlines that it is difficult to know which way to look it has a very beautiful towerMuntorren Mint Tower Originally a medieval gate guarding the entrance to the city it was damaged by fire in  and the clock tower was added by de Keyser during the renovations of  In  the carillon was installed and this still fills the air with its regular bell rounds During the war with France in  when Amsterdam had its supply of money cut off the tower was transformed for a short time into the city mint and the name has remained since that timeIn the shadow of the tower and floating on the Singel canal the medieval protective moat for the city is the Bloemenmarkt Flower market The daily market has been held for centuries when the flower sellers would arrive by canal with boats laden with blooms Today the stalls still float on the water but are permanently attached to the canal wall The blooms they sell bring a splash of color to even the dullest Amsterdam dayStroll along the market until you reach Konigsplein and take a left down Leidsestraat This is a major shopping street and one of the busiest because it links one of the largest squares in the city to the central areaStop at Metz and Co department store which sits on the corner of Keizersgracht and Leidsegracht One of the oldest in town it offers good views of the city from the caf on the top floorAt the end of Leidsestraat is Leidseplein probably the busiest in the city and a major focus for RR in the city The bars and cafs spill out onto the square which strangely has no real point of focus unlike Rembrandtsplein Look out for a small grassy area with sculptures of lifesize iguanas and other large lizards The narrow streets leading off the square are filled with cinemas concert halls and intimate live venues There is also a busy VVV Amsterdam Tourist OfficeIn summer youll find several different street performers vying for your guilders Its a place where talented music students play classical pieces or musicians from around the world play their traditional tunes In winter an ice rink fills the space so you can enjoy a skating session Whatever the time of year as the sun sets the neon lights are switched on and people flock to enjoy the restaurants and nightclubs which keeps the square buzzing until the early hours of the morningOn the western side of Leidseplein you will find the Stadsschouwburg Municipal Theater which was built in  Once the premier opera house in the city it has been usurped by the Muziek Theater but still hosts regular performances of visiting and Dutch companies being home to the Toneelgroep drama group Next door sits the American Hotel an Art Nouveau treasure and national monument completed in  If you are not staying at the hotel be sure to visit the Caf Americain on the first floor to enjoy the sumptuous surroundings and perhaps share a coffee with a celebrity or twoTurn left once through Leidseplein and across the Singelgracht canal and you will find the Amsterdam Casino and Lido on your left On your right across Stadhouderskade is a narrow gate leading to Vondelpark This park founded in  has been called the lungs of Amsterdam and was founded after a number of philanthropic city fathers decided that there was a need for a genteel recreation area for the citys population many of whom lived in overcrowded slums The park was named after the Netherlands premier poet Joost van den Vondel and designed in the English fashion of the times Today its  hectares  acres have grazing farm animals flocks of parakeets jogging tracks and cycle paths It is the perfect place for a picnic on a summers day The large pavilion which opened in  was restored and refurbished in  and reopened as the Nederlands Filmmuseum It now shows more than  films each year including many outdoor screenings and other artistic performances in the summerOnly five minutes to the south of Leidseplein is the museum quarter for many visitors the raison dtre for their visit to Amsterdam Here three of the most important art collections in Europe sit side by side allowing visitors to walk from one to the next in a matter of moments Although all very different in appearance they are brought together by an open space which has recently been redesigned and replanted to accent the buildings The square is called not surprisingly MuseumpleinThe RijksmuseumPride of place must go to the Rijksmuseum The National Art Gallery with arguably the greatest collection of Dutch art in the world The collection is housed in a magnificent Victorian Gothic building especially designed for it by P J H Cuypers which was opened in  The museum can be a confusing maze of connecting roomsadditions were completed in  and so it pays to sit down for a few minutes to study the very comprehensive map which accompanies your ticket A multimedia interactive study area also allows you to review the vast collection on a screen pinpoint works which you want to see and print out further details of each piece The center called ARIA Amsterdam Rijksmuseum InterActief is located in room  behind the Night Watch room You can also take advantage of an audio CD tour to give you background detail as you exploreThe collection is varied but most visitors come to see the works of the Dutch masters Dutch painting of the th to th centuries are to be found in rooms  to  on the second floor Among the collection are  works by Rembrandt including The Nightwatch properly entitled The Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch The work which was commissioned by the company for its barracks is remarkable for its lack of formality and very different from the accepted style of the dayJohannes Vermeer  is also wellrepresented and his effective use of light can be clearly seen in The Kitchen Maid painted in  which is one of the gallerys bestloved pieces There are paintings by Frans Hals the founding artist of The Dutch School along with a collection of Dutch artists influenced or schooled by the masters Rembrandt was a prolific teacher and his pupils produced work so similar to his that in later years many were initially mistaken for the great artists workLook out also for painting A by a lesserknown artist Gerrit Adriaensz Berckheyde which depicts Herengracht in  when its grand houses were just being completed The view has no trees and shows the Gentlemans Canal in pristine conditionWorks of later Dutch artists include a number by artists of The Hague School which rose to fame in the late s and whose bestknown representative is Jan van HuysumThe museum also has a collection of work by nonDutch artists including Rubens Tintoretto and El Greco and impressive displays of porcelain furniture sculpture and decorative arts including a large section of Asiatic art in the South Wing It also has a restaurant for those who feel the need to take a break in the middle of their tourThe Van Gogh MuseumBehind the ornate Gothic Rijksmuseum are the ultramodern lines of the Van Gogh Museum devoted to the work of this modern Dutch master The main building was designed by Gerrit Reitveld and opened in  however a large freestanding wing of circular design by Kisho Kurokawa was completed in  to host temporary exhibitionsThe museum houses over  paintings and  drawings by the artistone of the most infamous of the th centuryand it constitutes the greatest collection of his work covering all periods of his troubled career The bulk of the collection was brought together by Theo Van Gogh who also kept over  letters written by his brother which when read in conjunction with viewing the paintings bring life and context to the works themselvesVincents working life was short but frenetic interspersed with periods of manic depression and his paintings reflect his moods His  work The Potato Eaters shows the hard lives endured by the rural poor among whom Van Gogh lived at this time Contrast this with the superb vibrant colors of The Bedroom in Arles and Vase with Sunflowers both painted after Vincent moved to Provence in  Van Gogh is renowned for his reinterpretation of the works of other artists and the museum has prime examples of works based on paintings by Rembrandt Delacroix and MilletThe Stedelijk MuseumNext door to the Van Gogh Museum is another whose stately exterior presents a very different impression to its contents The building of the Stedelijk Museum was finished in  The faade is neolassical with figures of famous Dutch men such as the architect de Keyser gaze down on the passing crowds It was built specifically to house the private art collection of Sophia de Bruyn who then bequeathed it to the city in  In  it became the Museum of Modern Art and today it displays a permanent range of work by celebrated artists and numerous temporary exhibitions which reflect the cutting edge in visual art genres such as photography and video Look particularly for works by Marc Chagall including his self portrait Portrait of the Artist with Seven Fingers Pregnant Woman and Man with Violin Picasso is represented by several works along with paintings by Monet Czanne and Matisse There is also a comprehensive examination of the De Stijl The Style art and design movement which swept through the Netherlands in the postWWI period Gerrit Reitveld designer of the Van Gogh Museum has several designs in the collection and the work of Piet Mondrian the Dutch modernist are some of the most popular in the museumIf you feel exhausted after your museumfest then the streets around the Museumplein offer some exciting retail therapy Walk across Paulus Potterstraat from the Van Gogh Museum and you will find Coster Diamonds one of the oldest houses in the city where you can watch diamonds being polished and maybe buy a carat or two Van Baerlstraat bordering the west side of Museumplein is the haute couture area of the city For further culture of a musical nature the Concertgebouw on Van Bearlstraat is home to the orchestra of the same name The main auditorium is considered to have almost perfect acoustics even though the designer of the building Van Gendt had no experience in this specialized areaIf you want to stroll back to town after your visit to the museums then walk through the open courtyard which cuts through the center of the Rijksmuseum across Stadouderskade and on to the narrow street of Nieuwe Speigalstraat This center of antique and art galleries has some wonderful windows to gaze into Prices are said to be on the high side but the dealers are some of the most experienced in the world and they are sure to give you good adviceWalk north along the whole length of Nieuwe Speigalstraat and you will eventually reach Herengracht at its most spectacular point When it was first dug and the lots of land sold it was soon realized that this section of the canal between Vijzelstraat and Leidsestraat would have the largest houses inhabited by the richest families in the city For this reason it has become known as the Golden Bend Many of these buildings now house banks and financial institutionsNorthwestThe northwest section abuts the center commencing at Kalverstraat the rather brash happening shopping street which cuts the center of Amsterdam from north to south When you reach Spui take a left into a small squareon Fridays you will find a book market here On the north side of the square you will see a small alleyway which seems to lead between two houses This is the entrance to the Begijnhof a haven of peace in the center of the cityThe cluster of buildings around a small central square was set aside in  for the benefit of Beguines members of a lay Catholic sisterhood They lived simple lives and in return for their lodgings undertook to care for the sick and educate the poor Although nothing remains of the thcentury houses number  is Het Houten Huis Amsterdams oldest house dating from  The Catholic chapel dates from  when it was built in a style to disguise its purpose The stained glass windows depict the Miracle of Amsterdam However in the center of the courtyard is an earlier church now called the English Presbyterian Church It was rented out to English and Scottish worshippers in  following the Alteration and the Pilgrim Fathers worshipped here before they set off on their long journey to the New World they came to Amsterdam from England before they set sail for the New WorldThe last Beguine died as recently as  and today although the houses are still offered only to single women of the Christian faith the women are not expected to undertake lay workBehind the Begijnhof is the old Convent of St Lucian which became the city orphanage after the Alteration although it was only open to welltodo orphans the poor had to fend for themselves Extended several times including a wing designed by de Keyser it was opened as the Amsterdam Historical Museum in  and its rooms reveal the details of the development of this fascinating city Youll see plans maps and paintings depicting the streets and canals as they were when just completed The Golden Age is brought to life rooms  but there is also an interesting section on thcentury Amsterdam the Nazi occupation and efforts to protect and preserve the city Tiny details such as the relief above the Kalverstraat entrance which asks people to support the upkeep of the orphanage also point to the museums original purposeOnce out of the museum walk north Take Kalverstraat or if you find it a little too busy for comfort take Rokin which runs parallel to Kalverstraat to the right This wide street was once also a canal which was drained and filled in to allow better access for modern forms of transport On the far side of the canal you will see the elegant Georgian faade of the Allard Pierson Museum the archaeological collection for the city Another couple of minutes strolling will bring you to Dam Square simply called Dam by Amsterdammers the symbolic heart of the cityDam is a wide cobbled square usually filled with people and pigeons and dominated by the ornate faade of the Koninklijk Paleis Royal Palace which dates from  It was originally built as the Town Hall facing the landing wharfs of the Damrak which would at that time have been busy with ships The classical design by Jacob van Campen gives some indication of the confidence of the city in the Golden Agea statue of Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders sits astride the rear of the building and in the sumptuous interior only the best materials were used When Louis Bonaparte brother of Napoleon became King of Holland in  he demanded a palace suitable for his position and requisitioned the Town Hall He furnished it with the finest pieces of the time and left them all behind only four years later when he was forced out of power It has remained a Royal Palace ever since but it is not a royal residence  la Buckingham Palace in London and is only used for ceremonial occasions It is possible to visit the palace in summer if there are no official activities taking placeBeside the Palace sits Nieuwe Kerk New Church built before the Royal Palace but not the oldest church in the city hence its name The church has suffered several catastrophic fires during its history and was stripped of all its treasures during the Alteration The pulpit is interesting since it is beautiful but extremely ornate for a Protestant place of worshipAcross Dam Square is the stark white National Monument paid for by public subscription after WWII and erected in  It commemorates the role of the Dutch nation in the warOn Dams south side you will find Madame Tussauds a branch of the London waxworks Not only will you be able to see figures of your favorite music and film stars here along with a whole panorama which recreates Amsterdams Golden Age but also the windows on the upper floors give excellent views over the squareMake your way behind the Royal Palace to Raadhuisstraat which will lead to the northern canal ring Heren Keizers and Prinsen grachts Immediately behind the palace is Magna Plaza originally the main Post Office building built in  in an almost exaggerated Gothic style It was considered far too ornate for a civil service when it was originally opened but was refurbishedand the interior sympathetically adaptedin  to house the citys only shopping mallRaadhuisstaat is the main thoroughfare to the northwestern canal ring and is busy with trams buses and cars It will take you quickly to the main attractions of the area but it is not the prettiest or quietest route Wandering the smaller alleys and lanes to the north and south of it will be much more fulfilling the details of the highlights of each of the major canals can be seen on page  Follow Raadhuisstraat until you reach the Westerkerk set in its own square on the left and overlooking Prinsengracht This church was designed by de Keyser in  and was one of his last commissions It is said to be the burial place of Rembrandt but unfortunately no one knows knows the exact location One of his pupils Gerard de Lairesse painted the organ panels which were added in  In summer you can climb the tower the tallest in the city at m  ft for incomparable views of the surrounding rooftops The crown on top of the bell tower is a replica of the crown presented to the city in  by Maximilian I Holy Roman EmperorTurn left beyond the church to Prinsengracht  just an ordinary canal housecumoffice but made famous worldwide by what happened here in WWII This is Anne Frank Huis Anne Frank House where during the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam this young girl her family and a small group of others hid for two years in an attempt to avoid capture and deportation Anne wrote a diary which paints a clear and terrifying picture of the life the family lived It comes to an eerie stop only a few days before the family was discovered and sent to concentration camps Of the eight people in hiding only Annes father survivedAnne died of typhus only weeks before the war endedand after the war in  he published the diary It became not only an international bestseller but also a symbol for the oppression of humankindThe house built in  has been left much as it was at the time that Anne hid here It opened as a museum in  The secret rooms upstairs where the family spent the daylight hours are stark and bleak A couple of magazine pinups still adorn one wall The wooden bookcase which hid the doorway to their refuge is still in situ propped open for visitors to climb the few stairs to their homeDownstairs were the offices and warehouses of Mr Franks business which have been recreated in a multimillion dollar development opened in September  Two adjacent buildings have been bought by the museum and refurbished adding muchneeded exhibition and audiovisual space without compromising number  itself Youll see videos of Annes story and of Amsterdam under occupation along with photographs and artifacts of the time Anne Frank Huis also acts as an education center and resource for political and philosophical groups fighting oppression in the present dayCross Prinsengracht to reach the area of the city known as the Jordaan Built as housing for workers and artisans in the early th century it extends roughly from the far bank of Prinsengracht to Lijnbaansgracht and from Brouwersgracht Brewers Canal in the north down to Leidseplein Many of the streets were named after fragrant flowers but this was not the prettiest or sweetest smelling area of Amsterdam in its heyday Overcrowding was rife and with industries such as fabricdyeing carried out on the ground floors it was an unsanitary place to live Its name is said to derive from the French word jardin since a large contingent of French Huguenots came to live here to escape political persecution in their homeland Today the Jordaan has been revived and it has become a fashionable residential area Youll find many bars restaurants and interesting boutiques in the area Its a good place to browse for an unusual souvenir of your tripThe outskirts of AmsterdamAmsterdam is a large city despite its small center and the sprawling suburbs hold some attractions which you may find

of Calvinist Dutch whose traditions reach back hundreds of years The older inhabitants of this closeknit community still wear traditional Dutch costume as everyday wearUntil  the village was situated

of cheese production for many centuries and is now the only town which continues with a cheese market every Friday morning during the summerThe large square in front of the thcentury Waaggebouw or
