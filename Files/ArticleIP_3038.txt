                                 The Emperor of IceCream            WallaceStevens needs to be read in isolation His poetry makes little sense inconjunction with anyone elses Like many people I was baffled when I firstread his poems in highschool anthologies The Emperor of IceCream soundedlike antique mumbo jumbo in comparison with the uptotheminute adolescentangst of The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock Only when I began to read the Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens did I come to terms with himStevens eludes the anthologists because no one poem is the great one Its thetotal book that counts You can pick up the new Library of America editionturn to any page and sink yourself into the unconditional unfootnotablesplendor of the voice I am not sure if this edition is the ideal packaging ofStevens even though it includes more of his work than any previous collectiondid It may include too muchthe words look smaller the margins thinner Fora writer as worshipful of words as Stevens these slight differencesmatter            Stevens rough chronological equivalence with Joyce andEliot has created a mistaken notion that his poems are rich in complexityBlessedly they are not Stevens offers a double liberation first frommeaning then from modernist meaninglessness His world is separateimmaculate You do not need a Dublin map or a German phrase book to travel init Academic interpreters have failed to meet the challenge posed by HelenVendler in her landmark study On Extended Wings to give up the searchfor intellectual subject matter and to treat Stevens as pure sound Vendlerherself sometimes fails to meet that standard She offers ingenious paraphrasesand elaborations but she imposes a false order on a genially chaotic worldShe looks for process and argument in a poet who excels at sudden revelationsin miniature She and others have also promoted the idea that the greatestStevens is to be found in his ambitious long poems But it is in thosepoemsNotes Toward a Supreme Fiction and An Ordinary Evening in NewHaventhat his language is driest his images dullest Stevens came closer tothe Supreme Fiction in short forms in fragments            Ratherthan try to launch a new exegesis I want to name a few simple technicaldevices with which Stevens makes his verbal music More often than not hewrites in iambic pentameter the antiquated base rhythm of English poetry Takethe famous opening line of The Idea of Order at Key West She sang beyondthe genius of the sea Click for a longer sample He chooses the sounds withgreat care In this line the vowels almost rhyme ee ah ee aw eh ee yuhoh eh ee Only two words have more than one syllable Stevens follows toextremes the old schoolhouse rule that short words work better than long onesLike Shakespeare he loved the heave and ho of a line in which each beat hasits own word A lot of classic oratory also relies on monosyllables The onlything we have to fear is fear itself Ask not what your country can do foryou In Stevens monosyllables run riot sometimes saturating severalconsecutive lines as in the vertiginously beautiful climax of Esthtiquedu Mal  Click             The Idea of Order culminates in anotherhighly monosyllabic line And when she sang the sea Whatever self it hadbecame the self that was her song for she was the maker But as the languagegrows ever more chiseled and incisive the picture grows more vague That womansinging on the beach is dissolving into abstraction It seems as though someprinciple is being preached At this point if you read the poem in high schoolor college you may remember deadly questions intruding from the poetryanthologies Does the sea represent language Is the woman the poet Anyquestion about meaning in Stevens whether well or badly formed ruins thetrance His words are a dream melody of language bells from nowhere You canhear as much in tapes of Stevens reading aloud he is so intent on keeping aneven magisterial tone that he occasionally loses himself in the convolutedsyntax on which Vendler expends such analytic energy Stevens fashioned a neworatory free of meaning he wrote a surreal agnostic King James Bible culledfrom dilettante philosophy dated chinoiserie and picturepostcardAmericana            Stevens grandeur is an inchaway from absurdity if not in the thick of it This is by intention He likedto deflate solemnity with silliness His humor is his least noticed attributeprobably because it is so widespread Even his titlesThe Revolutionists Stopfor Orangeade The Emperor of IceCreamundercut their own pompositySometimes I think Stevens was a collegiate prankster who never gave away thejoke he played on literature He comes close in some of the offbeat writingsthat appear toward the end of the Library of America editionespecially insuch nonsense aphorisms as A poem is a cafe A poem is a pheasant and Allmen are murderers More than a few of the poems I think are selfparodiesalthough its hard to say which A good candidate is Of Hartford in a PurpleLight A long time you have been making the trip From Havre to HartfordMaster Soleil Bringing the lights of Norway and all that Stevens securelyemployed for much of his adult life by the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Cocould afford to laugh aloud at the pretensions of the poetry business            Thecloseness of the sublime and the ridiculous of the daft and the grand iscentral to Stevens The poem that sets it out most clearly is The Man on theDump in which he writes One sits and beats an old tin can lard pail Onebeats and beats for that which one believes The monosyllables are the meaningof the poemthe actingout of a literary philosophy which is to hammer newbeauty from wellworn words and modern bricabrac The poem goes on to askthese questions about the poets task            Is itto sit among mattresses of the deadBottles pots shoes and grass and murmuraptest                eve Is it to hear the blatter of grackles andsay Invisible                priest  is it to eject to pullThe day to pieces andcry stanza my stone                        Yes it is this is what poetry is But Stevens frames hismanifesto in questions as if uncertain I think hes pointing up acontradiction The poetry that he imagines being murmured on the dumpaptesteve invisible priest stanza my stoneis not in itself distinguished byintention its a bit ridiculous The sublimity comes in the way thosefragments of a Romantic vision glide together with artifacts ofordinarinessbottles pots shoes grass The poem performs its theme it isselfsufficient it runs on its own power            It is the purity of Stevenslanguage that makes the Library of America editionedited by Frank Kermode andJoan Richardsonseem a bit off Not only do the poems look better in theCollected Poems which to be sure omits great ones early and latethey are also unencumbered by comparison with the uncollected poems whichinclude a lot of mystifying mediocrity Its good to have all the poems in oneplace and also the published prose and a smattering of letters But its alsodistracting and occasionally misleading You cant find the real Stevensvoice in the early poems but you can find it in early letters not printedhere In one the teenage Stevens writes a deadon Stevensian description of amotley village bandthe piping of flamboyant flutes the wriggling ofshrieking fifes with rasping daggervoices the sighing of bassviols drumsthat beat and rattle the crescendo of cracked trombones Eight years laterthe young man writes flamboyantly to his fiancee I believe that with a bucketof sand and a wishing lamp I could create a world in half a second that wouldmake this one look like a hunk of mud For all its omissions CollectedPoems is the better picture of that awesome world
