                    Background        The ubiquitinproteasome pathway is essential for        degradation of many regulatory proteins Proteins are        targeted for proteasomemediated degradation by attachment        of a polyubiquitin chain The addition of a polyubiquitin        chain to a protein requires the sequential action of a        ubiquitinactivating enzyme E a ubiquitinconjugating        enzyme E and a ubiquitinprotein ligase E     E        activities are thought to be essential because they are        involved in substrate recognition SCF complexes are Es        composed of the Cullin family member Cul Cdc in         S cerevisiae  as well as Skp        Roc also called Rbx or Hrt and one of the numerous        Fbox proteins that act as a receptor for the substrate        for review see            The founding member of the SCF family SCF Cdc was        identified through genetic analysis of the GS transition        in budding yeast and served as a model for the study of        other SCF complexes Mutations in the E enzyme Cdc or in        any of the SCF Cdccomponents CdcCul Skp and Cdc        arrest cells at the GS transition because of a failure to        degrade the cyclindependent kinase CDK inhibitor Sic               In a wildtype situation G cyclinCDK        complexes phosphorylate Sic at the end of G This leads        to Cdcdependent ubiquitination and degradation of Sic        Phosphorylated Sic but not the unmodified protein is        recruited to the SCF complex by binding to the WD domain of        Cdc        The Fbox motif of Cdc binds Skp so        that the Fbox protein acts as a bridge between substrate        and the SCF complex Cdc forms the core of the complex by        binding Skp Roc and Cdc The CdcRoc subcomplex        stimulates the ubiquitination activity of Cdc               Upon association with the complex Sic is extensively        ubiquitinated and then degraded by the proteasome While        mutations in the         CDC gene of         S cerevisiae eliminate SCF activity        toward its many diverse targets the phenotype is        nonetheless specific Presumably arrest at the GS        transition is a result of the thresholds and kinetics of        action of the various substrates which imparts special        importance to the targeting of Sic for degradation        Mutations in the         C elegans ortholog         Cul lead to increased cell number           showing that in this organism a different aspect of        cell cycle regulation is controlled in a Cul dependent        fashion It has been inferred that a deficit in Cul        function results in defects in turnover of specific        proteins and that the phenotype varies between systems        because of differences in the spectrum of proteins affected        and differences in the importance of the targeted        proteins        The transcription factor EF is an important regulator        of the GS phase transition in metazoans and a major        target of the tumor suppressor Rb        The        mechanisms controlling EF activity have not been        completely elucidated EF is activated toward the end of        G and it functions to promote S phase Nonetheless EF is        inactivated andor downregulated upon progression to S        phase a regulatory feature that appears critical as EF        overexpression or ectopic activation induces apoptosis both        in mammalian cells and in flies                     Inactivation of the DNAbinding activity of EF by the        cyclin ACdk complex has been shown to be critical for        proper S phase progression     In mammalian cells        EF is also subject to proteasomemediated degradation                 and recent evidence indicates that EF        degradation occurs in S phase     Control of EF        stability has also been linked to its association with the        Fbox protein Skp    but this has not been tied to a        specific phase of the cell cycle In addition Skp        knockout cells do not accumulate EF    and an EF        mutant unable to bind Skp is still ubiquitinated and        unstable     Thus the basis of S phase destruction of        EF remains unresolved Analysis of EF levels in the         Drosophila eye disc showed a        disappearance of EF staining in the S phase cells of the        morphogenetic furrow suggesting conservation of the S        phase destruction of this regulator            To explore potential roles for Cul in cell cycle        control in         D melanogaster  we overexpressed        mouse Cul mCul in the wing imaginal disc and found that        this overexpression has a dominant negative effect leading        to a reduction in SCF function A screen for modifiers of        the resulting small wing phenotype identified EF as a        putative target of SCF action Further analysis of genetic        interactions implicated the SCF Slimbcomplex as a regulator        of EF function                    Results                  Mouse Cul overexpression in Drosophilaleads to          reduced SCF function          Since genes encoding highly conserved activites often          function across species boundaries we attempted to          evaluate mouse Cul mCul function in           Drosophila  To this end we used a          GAL transgene to drive overexpression of mCul in the          wing disc           MS is an Xlinked transgene          that expresses GAL strongly on the dorsal surface and          more weakly on the ventral surface of the wing primordium          in third instar larval wing imaginal discs Because of          dosage compensation GAL levels in males            MSY  are twice those in          heterozygous females            MS  In males            MSYUASmCul  mCul          overexpression led to a strong reduction in the size of          the wing without any gross patterning defects fig          AB Females            MSUASmCul  displayed a          weaker phenotype that was sometimes indistinguishable          from wildtype see fig A In males further          increasing expression by using two copies of the          UASmCul transgene reduces the wing to a rudimentary          stump not shown The reduced wings also occasionally          showed a multiple wing hair phenotype in which several          trichomes instead of just one were produced by individual          intervein cells particularly in the region near the          anterior crossvein Introduction of a single mutant copy          of the           Cul           k allele    or a          deficiency that uncovers           Cul            DfRNCX  dominantly enhanced          the wing reduction fig C In contrast decreasing the          level of endogenous           Cul            guftagu another Cullin family          member see httpflybasebioindianaedu or          expressing a GFP marker had no effect Coexpression of           Drosophila Cul            dCul  suppressed the phenotype          induced by expression of           mCul fig D These data show          that overexpression of mouse Cul has a dominant negative          effect on           Cul function or that           dCul suppresses a neomorphic          activity of           mCul           To test if overexpression of mCul is sensitive to the          dosage of other SCF components we asked whether changing          the copy number of both           dRoc and           dSkpA can modify the           mCul induced phenotype           dRoc and           dSkpA are located at the tip of the          X chromosome in region B Flybase          httpflybasebioindianaedu The small wing          phenotype seen in flies overexpressing mCul was enhanced          when flies also had a deficiency uncovering this region          fig AB while coexpression of dSkpA rescued the          wing phenotypes fig CD These results show that SCF          function limits the mCul overexpression phenotype          Cul and SCF function are required for          proteasomedependent degradation of a number of proteins          in other organisms We thus tested whether reduction in          proteasome function would modify the phenotype caused by          mCul overexpression The           DTS and           DTS alleles are mutations in the           and  subunits of the proteasome        Both          mutations which have antimorphic activity acted          dominantly to strongly enhance the small wing phenotype          generated by mCul overexpression fig E supporting          the idea that the phenotype is due to reduced degradation          of an SCF substrate          To directly assess Cul function we sought a target          protein whose destruction might be limited by the          activity of the Culproteasome pathway While SCF          triggers ubiquitination and proteasome action degrades          many substrates to completion a few targets are instead          cleaved and partially degraded This is true of the          transcription factor Cubitus interruptus Ci it is          cleaved and its Cterminal portion is degraded                    Cleavage and degradation require          phosphorylation SCF Slmb and proteasomal activity          While complete inactivation of SCF Slmbcauses cell death          it was shown that a cellviable hypomorphic           slimb allele resulted in          accumulation of unprocessed Ci Based on this and          findings that Ci accumulation is especially sensitive to          pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome data not          shown it appears that Ci levels are particularly          sensitive to partial reduction in the activity of the          SCFproteasome pathway of protein processingdegradation          Inhibition of Ci processing can be scored by the          accumulation of a Cterminal epitope     This assay          showed that reduction in the function of Slimb or Roc          two activities that contribute to SCF function is          associated with an increase in Ci staining                 Similarly reduction of Cul function by mutation in          Cul data not shown and     or by overexpressing          mCul fig Fand G led to Ci accumulation          Together these results indicate that mCul          overexpression leads to a Cul dominant negative action          that reduces SCF function Based on the strength of the          phenotype and its enhancement by removal of an endogenous          copy of Cul we infer that the mCul expression only          partially suppresses Cul function to create a          hypomorphic phenotype We infer that the wing defect          results from a reduction in the rate of degradation of          one or more targets of SCF action                          Reduction in Cul function induces apoptosis          The reduction in wing size in mCul overexpressing          flies could result from changes in cell size or cell          number Each cell of the wing blade produces a hair and          hair density indicates cell density and hence cell size          Wing hair density was unchanged by mCul expression even          when there was a dramatic effect on wing size             cells m for           MSY     cells m          for           MSYUASmCul  This result          suggests that mCul overexpression causes a reduction in          cell number either by a coordinate reduction in cell          growth and proliferation or by increasing cell death To          distinguish between these possibilities we dissected          wing imaginal discs from late third instar larvae and          stained them for mitotic or apoptotic cells Labelling          with an antiphosphohistone  antibody did not reveal          any significant changes in the number of mitotic cells          not shown However acridine orange staining showed a          large increase in cell death throughout the wing pouch          when mCul was overexpressed fig AB Coexpression          of baculovirus antiapoptotic protein p rescued the          reduction in wing size fig CD indicating that mCul          overexpression induces elevated apoptosis mCulinduced          apoptosis was insensitive to the coexpression of dominant          negative forms of p not shown p expression also          suppressed the multiple wing hair phenotype indicating          that this phenotype too requires apoptosis As dead cells          do not contribute to adult structures this phenotype          must be a secondary consequence of cell death We          conclude that limiting SCF function induces apoptosis          Note that this conclusion does not argue against a cell          cycle role for SCF as defects in cell cycle progression          can trigger apoptosis                          Dominant negative mCul genetically interacts with          EF          Having determined that the mCul overexpression          phenotype results from a dominant negative effect we          were in a position to test for genetic interactions          between mCul overexpression and mutations in potential          cell cycle targets of Cul Because SCF complexes have          been implicated in cell cycle control in other organisms          we tested whether changing the dosage of cell cycle          regulators dominantly modified the mCul overexpression          phenotype Reductions in the levels of a variety of cell          cycle genes            cyclin E            dacapo            roughex            DP            RBF            string            cyclin A            rca            wee and           cdc  had no effect on wing size          not shown In contrast reducing the level of           EF by  completely restored          wildtype wing size fig ABC an effect that          correlated with a strong reduction in cell death in the          disc fig EF The presence of a single           hsEF transgene gave a weak and          incompletely penetrant enhancement in the absence of heat          shock and this enhancement was stronger and completely          penetrant when the transgenic strain was exposed to a          heat shock treatment every  h during third instar and          early pupal development fig D Since the presence of          the           hsEF transgene and its induction          by our heat shock protocol low level overexpression          compared to Asano et al  had no phenotype when in          a wildtype background we conclude that mCul expression          sensitizes the cells to EF overexpression The          reciprocal suppression by EF mutation and enhancement by          EF overexpression show that the apoptosis triggered by          mCul is mediated by or requires EF function Because a          high level of ectopic expression of EF is known to          induce apoptosis        these results suggest          that mCul overexpression might interfere with normal EF          downregulation                          Dominant negative Cul expression disrupts EF          inactivation in S phase          Immunostaining for EF in the furrow of the eye disc          showed an abrupt drop in protein levels at the position          where most cells exit G and initiate S phase              Using a double label approach we were able to test          directly for overlap between EF presence and S phase as          marked by bromodeoxyuridine BrdU incorporation in          dividing cells of the wing disc despite the asynchrony of          division No EF staining was detected in BrdU labelled          cells green of wildtype wing discs whereas nonS          phase cells showed strong EF red staining fig A          B C no EF staining was observed in over a thousand          BrdU positive cells from  different discs Thus EF is          downregulated in advance of significant BrdU          incorporation in wildtype wing disc cells          When mCul is overexpressed a small fraction of S          phase cells  of  BrdU positive cells from           independent wing discs contains detectable amounts of          EF fig D E F arrowheads Since EF is normally          degraded prior to S phase the overlap in staining          suggests that the partial suppression of Cul caused by          mCul expression slowed EF destruction to the point that          it persisted briefly in S phase We suggest but have not          demonstrated that the low percentage of cells showing          the overlap in the staining is due to a remaining          capacity of the residual SCF activity to promote slower          but still effective elimination of EF during S phase In          any case our finding shows that when dCul function is          reduced the normal pattern of EF degradation in S phase          is disrupted leading to inappropriate persistence of          EF While it could also be suggested that this effect          might be secondary to other disruptions induced by          dominant negative Cul the genetic suppression of          phenotypes by reduction of EF dose above suggests          otherwise as do the analyses of the role of the Fbox          protein Slimb below                          Slimb is required for EF downregulation in S          phase          The experiments described above demonstrate that          overexpression of mCul produces a phenotype that can be          modified by second site mutations and therefore could be          used for a more general genomewide modifierscreen To          determine whether other suppressors or enhancers might be          isolated we tested if deficiencies on the third          chromosome uncover other potential interacting genes          One modifying deficiency           DfReR  removes region          BD and acts as an enhancer of the small wing          phenotype One gene in this region           slimb  is an interesting candidate          because this gene encodes an Fbox protein that is part          of an SCF complex        Several independent          alleles of           slimb were tested and all enhanced          the dominantnegative mCul overexpression phenotype          fig  compare A and B Four deficiencies uncovering          other predicted Fbox containing genes CG CG          CG and CG or mutations in the Fbox protein          genes           ppa and           ago       had no effect on          the phenotype not shown showing that the effect is          specific Interestingly coreduction of           EF and           slimb function reversed the           slimb enhanced mCul overexpression          phenotype fig Aand C and loss of a copy of           slimb attenuated the suppression of          the mCul phenotype resulting from loss of one copy of           EF compare fig Cand C This          mutual cosuppression suggests that           slimb and EF exert opposing          activities on the same process and perhaps that Slimb          acts on EF or on a critical regulator of EF          activity          We thus wished to test whether loss of Slimb had an          effect on EF protein in imaginal discs As           slimb null mutants die as first          instar larvae direct analysis of the mutant discs was          not possible The severity of the slimb mutant phenotype          suggested that the mutation reduced crucial SCF functions          much more than did expression of mCul We used a           slimb mutant stock carrying a           slimb transgene under the control          of the HSP  promoter to modify the time of onset of the                    slimb mutant phenotype In the          absence of heat shock           slimb homozygotes exhibited the          early lethality of           slimb mutants but a single           minute heat shock at C during first instar was enough          to allow some larvae to reach the wandering third instar          stage  days later These larvae have small imaginal          discs Labelling of these discs with the antiEF          antibody revealed that nearly all cells expressed EF          fig A Many of these cells also incorporated low          levels of BrdU fig Band C usually in regions of the          nucleus with lower EF staining A few cells also had          high levels of BrdU incorporation and these also          expressed EF although at lower levels asterisks on          fig Aand B An hour and a half after a heat shock          that restored Slimb expression BrdUlabelled cells no          longer contained detectable levels of EF fig          DEF No accumulation of EF mRNA can be seen in           slimb mutant discs fig           suggesting that any effect of Slimb on EF occurs          posttranscriptionnally These results indicate that          elimination of EF during DNA replication requires          Slimb                          Slimb and EF interact in vitro          The above results raise the possibility that an SCF          Slmbcomplex can target EF for degradation If this is          the case it is expected that Slimb would recruit EF to          the complex To test this hypothesis we asked whether          Slimb and EF physically interact To this end          Slabelled EF was produced in vitro in a wheat germ          lysate and incubated with the WD repeat region of Slimb          fused to GST and bound to beads Analysis of bead          associated proteins fig  showed association of          radiolabeled EF with the fusion containing the WDrepeat          region of Slimb lane  but not with GST lane  The          interaction between Slimb and EF depends on a          phosphorylation event as it is prevented by the presence          of active alkaline phosphatase lane  but not when the          phosphatase is inhibited by sodium vanadate lane           Similar results were obtained with EF the other           Drosophila EF family member not          shown                            Discussion        We have provided evidence indicating a role for an SCF        Slmbcomplex in elimination of EF during S phase in         Drosophila  We first demonstrated        that mouse Cul overexpression has a dominant negative        effect on SCF function in the wing imaginal disc resulting        in apoptotic cell death leading to a small wing phenotype        in adult flies Thus SCF activity normally suppresses cell        death The cell death that occurred upon reduction of Cul        function was suppressed when EF function was reduced by        mutation This genetic interaction might be due to action        of EF and Cul in parallel pathways one suppressing and        one enhancing cell death or they might act in opposite        directions in the same pathway Because SCF complexes are        involved in controlling protein degradation we favoured        the hypothesis that Cul promotes the destruction of EF        and that the inappropriate persistence of EF leads to cell        death Consistent with this idea EF overproduction can        induce apoptosis        Furthermore cell cycle        specific destruction of EF was suggested by the finding        that EF protein becomes undetectable in the synchronised S        phase cells of the morphogenetic furrow of the eye imaginal        disc     Our double labelling analysis extended this        finding to the asynchronously cycling cells of the wing        imaginal disc and demonstrated that EF is rapidly degraded        prior to significant DNA replication In contrast we found        that EF was detected in a fraction of S phase cells when        SCF function was reduced by mCul This shows that normal        EF downregulation is delayed or slowed by reduction in SCF        function        Although the dominant negative action of mCul in         Drosophila was unanticipated it        offers a fortuitously convenient tool for the analysis of        SCF function The         Drosophila Cul mutant is less useful        because maternal contributions of Cul are so large that        homozygous mutant animals develop to pupariation        Additionally unlike the spatially restricted expression of        mCul the strong Cul mutant alleles result in lethality        The stage and generality of the defects make analysis of        the Cul mutant phenotype particularly difficult In        contrast the induced expression of mCul in the wing disc        does not compromise viability and it gives a distinctive        graded phenotype well suited for the study of genetic        modification While the basis for the dominant negative        effect of mCul remains unknown it is important to        recognize that inactivation of the endogenous Cul is        incomplete so that a reduced level of Cul activity        persists One likely explanation for the negative effect is        that mCul overexpression leads to sequestration of some        limiting SCF components into weakly active complexes This        hypothesis is consistent with the fact that mCul retains        some positive function in flies as revealed by its ability        to prolong survival of         dCul mutant flies JK Hrich and        PH OFarrell unpublished data        The essentially complete suppression of the mCul        phenotype by reduction of the genetic dose of EF suggests        a remarkable level of specificity in which among the many        targets of Cul action the destruction of EF appears to        be particularly important Similarly limitations of Cul        function in other organisms also uncovered the        disproportionate importance of particular substrates For        example Cul mutations in mice result in the accumulation        of the SCF substrate cyclin E but not of p another well        characterized SCF substrate     Among all of the        substrates targeted for degradation by SCF in         S cerevisiae  it is the failure to        degrade Sic that underlies the G arrest in cdc mutants               Thus different substrates of the SCF appear        to have particularly high dependence on SCF activity in        different biological contexts We suggest that our        experimental context using mCul expression in the wing        disc is particularly effective in exposing the involvement        of SCF in EF destruction        Since SCF complexes function in conjunction with a        variety of Fbox proteins that act as specificity factors        mutations in individual Fbox proteins ought to affect        particular subsets of SCF substrates In an extensive        screen for loci that modify the reduction of function        phenotype for Cul we identified the gene encoding the        Fbox protein Slimb as a modifier and we failed to detect        contributions of other Fbox encoding genes to the        phenotype This implicates Slimb in the action of SCF on        EF Analysis of EF levels revealed that cell cycle        oscillations in EF levels were absent when Slimb function        was severely reduced Note that the severity of this EF        destruction phenotype in comparison to the mild defect in        cell cycle programming of EF destruction upon mCul        expression is entirely consistent with the fact that the         slimb mutant gives a stronger loss of        function than the reduction of function imposed by mCul        overexpression The absence of cell cycle oscillation in        EF presence in the         slimb mutant suggests that SCF Slmbis        responsible for targeting EF for S phase destruction If        this destruction is the consequence of direct action of SCF        Slmbon EF we would expect the Fbox protein to interact        with EF We confirmed this prediction by pulldown        experiments Furthermore we demonstrated that the        interaction between Slimb and EF is dependent on        phosphorylation as expected for the interaction of Fbox        proteins with their substrates We suggest that the S phase        specificity of EF destruction is regulated by a targeting        phosphorylation event but we have not yet investigated        this level of the regulation        While SCF was previously implicated in the destruction        of EF in mammals     this earlier study appears to        focus on a distinct action of SCF The starting point for        the analysis was an interaction between EF and Skp an        Fbox protein that is not the mammalian homolog of Slimb        Mutations of EF that disrupted this interaction        increased EF stability in transfection experiments        However there was no demonstration that this interaction        was involved in or required for cell cycle oscillations in        the level of EF Furthermore Skp knockout cells show        no defect in EF degradation     and EF proteins        unable to interact with Skp are still unstable            Our results implicate SCF Slmbrather than SCF Skpin cell        cycle specific destruction of EF and argue that this        regulation is critical for cell viability at least in        flies As a unifying view we propose that Skpmediated        control and Slimbmediated control of EF activities occur        at different times during the cell cycle and that SCF        Slmbis responsible for the rapid destruction of EF in S        phase        Since EF is a positive regulator of the GS        transition it is not clear why S phase destruction of EF        is required However we note that         slimb mutant cells do not replicate        DNA normally and the replication defect is correlated with        an increase in EF in individual cells This observation is        consistent with previous reports indicating that EF can        limit DNA replication both in mammalian cells    and in        flies     This enigmatic feature of EF regulation        suggests that its continued presence has a negative effect        on DNA replication and indicates that we still have much to        learn about its roles in cell cycle regulation        SCF Slmbappears to influence other cell cycle events        perhaps by actions on other substrates or perhaps as a        result of events that are secondary to its influence on EF        destruction For example a         slimb allele shows defects in        centrosome duplication control     and         slimb null cells undergo apoptosis            Both effects could be explained by a failure to        inactivate EF as EF promotes centrosome duplication in        mammalian cells    and EF can induce apoptosis               A link between Slimb function and the RBEF        pathway of cell proliferation control is also suggested by        the genetic interaction between the         C elegans slimb ortholog         lin and the RBF ortholog         lin in which         lin function limits the severity        of the loss of         lin     Since RBF is an        important modifier of EF activity perhaps this        interaction is a reflection of the action of both Lin        and Lin on EF However in our experimental situation        we did not observe any modification of the mCul        overexpression phenotype by mutations in either the         RBF or         DP gene two known partners of EF        This result suggests that these factors are not limiting        factors in this situation or that EF acts independently of        RBF and DP The latter hypothesis is the most likely        explanation for the lack of an RBF interaction for the        following reason The EFRBF complex has to be disrupted        for EF to drive cells into S phase and EF degradation        occurs after the GS phase transition which only happens        after EF has been released from its association with RBF        According to this view we would predict that the        mCulinduced phenotype should be specifically sensitive to        factors impinging on the elimination of EF activity during        S phase and factors involved in the unknown processes by        which persistence of EF has negative outcome        Consequently this experimental system may provide an        avenue for the genetic dissection of this mysterious facet        of EF function                    Conclusions        To explore potential roles for Cul in cell cycle        control in         D melanogaster  we overexpressed        mouse Cul mCul in the wing imaginal disc We found that        this overexpression has a dominant negative effect leading        to a reduction in SCF function We used the resulting small        wing phenotype in a modifier screen to identify mutations        in cell cycle genes capable of dominantly modifying the        mCulinduced phenotype We found that EF lossoffunction        mutations were the strongest modifiers as they completely        suppressed the phenotype The reduction in SCF function        associated with mCul overexpression also correlated with a        failure to downregulate EF normally in S phase        Additionally mutations in         slimb that reduced the function of        the Fbox protein Slimb enhanced the phenotype and led to        persistence of EF in S phase cells Finally this Fbox        protein interacts with EF in vitro These results indicate        that an SCF Slmbcomplex is involved in regulating EF        activity during S phase                    Methods                  Identification of fly Cul and Skp          orthologs          We identified several lead ESTs in the Berkeley          Drosophila Genome Project database Sequencing of one of          the corresponding cDNAs LD obtained from Genome          Systems Inc St Louis MO revealed that it encodes a          protein with  identity to the mouse and human Cul          proteins Expression of this cDNA in yeast is able to          rescue the cdc mutation not shown indicating that          the protein can perform at least some of the functions of          the yeast Cul We used the same strategy to identify a          Skp cDNA that also rescues skp mutations in yeast not          shown Because the Drosophila genome contains several          Skplike genes we call the fly Skp homologue          dSkpA                          Stocks          UASmCul UASdCul and UASdSkpA were generated by          subcloning
