                  well seems to me the one of the reasons that people dont go out to vote is maybe theyre bored with the whole election process   well i agree with the boredom of the election process but i also uh think that people dont realize that their boat vote will make a difference uh they feel like that you know its going to go however its going to go and their one little votes not going to make that much difference and its just why make the effort   well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference   well i agree with that and i and i do know that you you know all those votes are counted and and they do make a difference um also i think that people have a tendency to to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the the more local elections   well its kind of strange because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their daytoday lives   exactly exactly and uh i i even have a tendency to do that myself and i have to really make a concerted effort to to get involved i lived i live in a suburb in Mesquite and uh so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see whats going to because that directly affects me but i i think on the whole most people dont uh feel that way or dont even look even look at that i think they just dont even i i dont think theyre conscious of it   well main part of the problem is they dont they think they have enough choices   well that may be true too i hadnt thought of that   you know in some of the European countries they have numbers of parties that run and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country   umhum right and sometimes its uh well not sometimes but many times its who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign and and issues get uh bogged down   well maybe its a matter of you know voter awareness   um i think voter awareness i worked i did some work for the uh Womens League of uh Voters uh several years ago and i think there are some organizations that used to uh do some voter awareness uh things dont they dont get a lot of participation they dont get a lot of uh activity most of the League of Women Voters what they did was they put out information so that it it would just be made available to everyone now other areas that ive worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates come and it would just you know that was not a lot lot of community involvement and those were people that would mostly vote anyway   well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long in Britain you know they have a set period of time and and for campaign thats it in this country it seems like its a continuous ongoing campaign   its a its an ongoing campaign and its expensive campaign and it it uh eliminates a lot of qualified people uh maybe more qualified and uh more dedicated uh uh to the issues   well the they dont want to spend the time or they dont have the money   exactly exactly and it it i i cant believe i just cant believe ive ive worked in a couple of local campaigns i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally   well its a matter of name recognition people arent going to vote for someone theyve never heard of   oh well i agree with that but also and i and im not for controlling controlling how much is spent but do you know thats one thing if a if the time wasnt so if it wasnt such a long uh campaigning time then they couldnt spend as much money   and even debates dont seem to help much   no they really dont uh its always its a lot of it is who looks the best who uh who happens to say the right thing at the right time who not not it who may not be the most qualified and can get the  uh the job done   so were really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers   exactly and its a its a lot ive worked in public relations a lot and uh that kind of thing can make and break make or break you as you can remember  uh Clayton Williams campaign   well that was certainly a media event   it really was and its just uh uh he possibly could have uh won that election had it not been for some of the the uh the way he presented himself   well he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease     hoof is is i guess the right term for him
