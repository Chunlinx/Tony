United States General Accounting OfficeInternal ControlGAOExposure DraftDecember Maintaining Effective Control Over Employee Time and AttendanceReportingGAOGAbbreviationsINTRODUCTIONIn recent years significant changes in work place habits andtechnological advances have affected the manner in which time andattendance TA reporting is accomplished For example moreflexible work schedules and places and the trend in government tostreamline operations have provided a major impetus for changes inTA systems However perhaps the most significant influence onthese changes is advancing technology and the increased use ofautomation The Government Paperwork Elimination Act GPEAencourages the movement toward paperless applications and the useof electronic signatures Although GPEA focuses on electronicsystems regarding information obtained from and provided to sourcesoutside the government it provides an additional impetus toagencies to seek further applications of paperless systems and useof electronic signaturesTrends toward increased automation and workplace flexibilityhave changed the operating environment However the need for goodinternal control continues to exist To keep abreast of thechanges especially those in automation we have revised thisdocument to emphasize the attention that should remain regardingeffective internal control in TA systems This document offerssuggestions for taking advantage of the advancements in automatedTA systems and updates the previous guidance to incorporateguidance offered in response to agency requestsAs advancing technologies continue managers have greaterflexibility in designing and implementing TA systems bestsuited for their agencies In designing and implementing newTA systems or components of existing systems managementshould strive for costbeneficial systems and related internalcontrolThe traditional work schedule followed by civilian employeesdiffers from those generally followed by members on active duty ofthe armed services Because traditional work schedules influenceinternal control in TA systems this document contains twomajor parts the first dealing with civilian employees who areexpected to be working usually during certain times and thesecond part dealing with members of the active duty armed serviceswho are expected to be in a duty status and thus on call  hoursa day Part I civilian employees provides guidance for civilianemployees and part II military service members provides guidancefor military service members Employees who are paid regardless oftheir presence or absence and who do not accrue leave under USC  et seq eg certain political appointees are exemptfrom the provisions of this documentQuestions on or interpretations of any material in this

TA SYSTEMSThe primary objective of a TA system is to ensure thathours worked hours in pay status and hours absent are properlyreported Reliable data are important to accurately compute andaccount for computed pay leave and allowances To achieve thisobjective management should have in place an internal controlsystem that provides reasonable assurance that  TAtransactions are properly authorized and approved and  TAdata are completely and accurately recorded and retainedTA Transactions Are Properly Authorized and ApprovedThe nature and extent of TA transaction approvals andcontrols can vary among TA systems Fully automated systemsfor example may require fewer approvals than manual systemsbecause of automated edits and controls and the use of automatedsignatures Nevertheless the nature and extent of TAapprovals must be such that management has assurance thatsupervisors or other officials know they are accountable for theapprovals of an employees work time and absences This helpsensure that accurate TA information is recorded and reportedfor the purposes of computing pay and allowancesPrimary responsibility for authorizing and approving TAtransactions rests with the employees supervisor who approves theemployees TA reports Timekeepers and supervisors must beaware of the work time and absence of employees for whom they areresponsible to ensure the reliability of TA data To theextent practical changes to an employees normal work scheduleshould generally be approved prior to the change actuallyoccurring Unanticipated changes should be reviewed for approval ordisapproval as soon as reasonably possibleTA Data Are Complete and AccurateBecause most federal civilian employees are paid on an hourlybasis or fractions of an hour and earn and charge leave on thatbasis a complete and accurate record of the time an employee worksmust be retained as an official agency record available for reviewor inspection To provide a basis for pay leave and benefits therecords must include aggregate hours of regular time other timeeg overtime credit hours or compensatory time and leaveTo help ensure accuracy the completed records must be reviewed andapproved by the supervisor or other equivalent official In anautomated environment system edits and other automated testscanThe traditional TA system normally involved a timekeeperwho was responsible for assisting supervisors in recording andverifying employees work time and absences New TA systemscan reduce or even eliminate timekeepers duties and shift theresponsibilities to employees or supervisors Regardless of thechanges made recording accurate TA information remains theprimary control objectiveTraditionally daily arrival and departure times were requiredto be recorded Although it is not required that daily records bemaintained agency management may choose to do so by usingsigninsignout sheets or other meansassist the supervisor in his or her review and verify thatrecorded work time is accurate and allowableRELIANCE ON INTERNAL CONTROLS IN A TA SYSTEMAs TA systems evolve toward increasingly automated methodsof recording and reporting employee work and leave times it isimportant to implement and maintain a welldefined system thatprovides management with the confidence that controls are workingas designed This can be done byHaving a welldefined organizational structure and flow ofTA data with clearly written policies and procedures settingforth the responsibilities of employees timekeepers ifapplicable and supervisors regarding recording examining andapproving TA transactionsEffectively applying available technology and concepts toachieve efficient and effective TA system processes inaccordance with applicable requirements and the environment inwhich the agency operatesHaving the ability to record payroll costs byappropriation organizational code and work activity to facilitateapplication of required cost accounting for financial and programmanagementReviewing and testing all aspects of the TA systemsprocessing procedures and controls in sufficient scope depth andfrequency to provide reasonable assurance that key procedures andcontrols are working and effective and that

LegalConsiderationsinDesigningandImplementingElectronicProcessesAGuideforFederalAgenciesin November Attestation and Verification by Employees and TimekeepersThe employee and timekeeper if any are not required to attestor verify TA reports and related documents However ifmanagement requires such attestations andor verifications theyshould be performed as close to the end of the pay period aspossible When not possible until after the end of the pay perioda copy of the TA report and related documents whenapplicable should be provided to the employee promptly forattestation and to the timekeeper promptly for verification Theemployee andor timekeeper should promptly disclose anydiscrepancies to the supervisor The supervisor should promptlyresolve such discrepanciesApproval of TA Reports and Related RecordsAll TA reports and related supporting documents egovertime pay authorizations must be reviewed and approved by anauthorized official Review and approval should be made by theofficial normally the immediate supervisor most knowledgeable ofthe time worked and absence of the employee involved Approval ofTA reports and related documents should be based on personalobservation work output timekeeper verification checking dataagainst other independent sources reliance on other controls or acombination of these methodsThe official most knowledgeable of the time worked shouldapprove any overtime or compensatory time Care should be taken to ensure that the overtime was approved preferably in advanceand  that the amount and type of overtime regular orirregular credit hours and compensatory time is accuratelyrecordedIf practical TA data must be approved at the end of thelast day of the pay period or later When this is not feasiblebecause of payroll processing requirements to meet establishedpaydays TA data must be prepared and approved as close to theend of the pay period as possible to still allow processing of thepayroll by paydayAdjustment or Corrections After the TA Period EndsAdjustments or corrections required because of changes afterTA data were approved must be made in the payroll system andreflected in pay for the pay period to which the changes applywhen possible When not possible adjustments must be made as soonafter discovery as practical Any changes must be approved by anauthorizing official before being entered into the payrollsystemSelfApproval of TA ReportsIn general employees may not approve their own TA dataHowever the head of an agency or designee may authorizeparticular individuals to approve their own TA data in certainsituations or if the individual is a high level manager such asthe head of a large unit within the agency In these situationsan official authorized by the agency head or designee must grantadvance authority in writing and the agency must ensure thateffective controls are in place to ensure the proper reporting ofTA dataExceptions to the general prohibition of employees approvingtheir own TA data are intended to apply when it is notfeasible to have TA data approved by a supervisor Theseexceptions include but are not necessarily limited to  employeesworking alone at a remote site for long periods and  employeesbased at the same duty station as their supervisors or timekeepersbut frequently at work sites away from the duty station In othersituations when it is not practical for the supervisor to approveTA data promptly the employee may be paid and the supervisormay subsequently review and approve the dataTRANSMITTING TA INFORMATION TO PAYROLLTA information must be transmitted to the payroll systemfor all employees or under exceptionbased systems for employeeswho have changes to their normal work schedules While the choiceof methods used to transmit the TA data may be based oncosteffectiveness and management information needs the system usedto transmit the information must protect TA data fromunauthorized change or alteration and must generate a record of anychange made Any change to previously attested to and approved datamust be reviewed by and attested to by the employee whose data waschanged The changed data must also be reviewed by and approved byan authorized officialEXCEPTIONBASED SYSTEMSExceptionbased TA systems as the name implies require payperiod recording of arrival and departure times only if materialvariances from preestablished work schedules occur Employeesschedules are established either through management designatedwork schedules or by mutual agreement between employees andmanagement When employees arrival and departure times for a payperiod are established these schedules become the basis forrecorded TA data unless material variances or deviationsoccur As previously noted if no material variances occur arrivaland departure times and hours worked per day need not berecordedMaterial variances or deviations must be approved by thesupervisor before the change occurs if feasible or promptly afteroccurring if not feasible As part of their approval of thechange supervisors or designees must verify that the dates andamounts of material changes have been recorded in the appropriateTA record However in either case material variance or novariance each employees TA record must be approved by thesupervisor or comparable officialSeveral alternatives exist for recording changes to establishedschedules Changes can be noted by recording arrival and departuretimes directly on an employees time sheet recording arrival anddeparture times on a centrally maintained timeintimeout log usedby many employees or noting the number of hours and minutes of thedeviation in a record that the supervisor maintains The methodselected by management to record the deviations should be the mostefficient and effective one under the circumstancesUnless otherwise designated by management material variances ordeviations from an established schedule for recording purposes arethose that differ by  hour or more during a planned workday orflex day However if leave is used a deviation of less than hour could be considered material For example if an employeearrives  minutes late but works  minutes past the planneddeparture time this would be considered an immaterial variationand need not be recorded On the other hand if the employeechooses to request annual or sick leave rather than to work for thetime absent then a material deviation for recording purposes hasoccurredALTERNATIVE WORKPLACE ARRANGEMENTSAlternative workplace arrangements involve working atlocations other than the traditional government office Locationsof alternative workplaces are usually the employees home ortelecenters Although numerous benefits exist for both the agencyand employees participating in alternative workplaces such asemployee moral and lower commuting costs flexible workplace is amanagement option not an employee benefit Employees who work atalternative work sites should have a written agreement with theirsupervisors stipulating among other items the period of time theagreement is in effect days in which the employee will work at thealternative site work assignments and performance work scheduleand time and attendanceAs a basis for approving TA data supervisors are requiredto obtain reasonable assurance that employees working at remotesites are working when scheduled and that TA informationaccurately reflects time worked and absences from scheduled toursof duty Numerous techniques are available to the supervisor toobtain this assurance For example reviewing the work output ofthe employee and occasional phone call or visits to theemployeeOther terms used to refer to alternative workplace arrangementsor locations of work are flexible workplace flexiplace andtelecommutingTelecenters are facilities away from the traditional governmentoffice that are equipped with workstations telephones andcomputers among other items that are shared by employees ofmultiple agenciesPART II MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERSACTIVE MILITARY PERSONNELActive military personnel are considered to be on duty  hoursa day Because the nature of some military assignments makes aconfirmation of the presence at duty stations difficult if notimpossible the recording of presence for duty and of specifichours during which duty is performed each day is not required Thisis similar to exceptionbased TA systems explained earlier inthis document Most active duty military personnel followexceptionbased systems However superiors are expected to be awareof the presence and absence of service members for whom they areresponsible When a service member is on temporary assignment toanother component of the armed services or to a civilian agencythe entity to which the service member is detailed must providetime and attendance recording for the service member and report theinformation to his or her home component promptly to facilitatepayment of basic pay and allowances by or through the homecomponentAbsence reports must be maintained daily to indicate thoseservice members who are to be charged leave and those who are notpresent for duty but who should be Examples of reports that mightcontain such data are morning or day reports strength reportsunit diaries and other similar reportsInformation on absences which affect pay should be compiled eachpay period and be transmitted to the payroll system Without suchinformation the payroll system may mistakenly pay the member forunauthorized pay and allowances The following requirements forreview and approval must be metReports of such information and related supportingdocuments must be reviewed and approved by a designated authorizingofficial The official must be aware of the responsibilities he orshe is taking regarding the accuracy of the reportsApprovals of such reports will be made at the end of thelast day of the pay period whenever possible When this is notpossible because of payroll processing requirements to meetestablished paydays documents must be approved as close to the endof the pay period as possibleApproval must be done in accordance with guidance foundin the subsection Attestations Verifications and Approvals ofsection Authorizing and Approving TA Transactions of thisdocumentAny adjustments required because of changes in reportedabsences after the reports were approved and transmitted to thepayroll system must be made and reflected in the pay period towhich the changes apply when possible or when not possibleadjusted as soon as possible preferably in the next payperiodAny changes must be approved by the authorizing official priorto being entered into the payroll system Service members may notapprove their own absence reports unless prior authority to do sois granted in writing by an authorized officialWhen feasible as in an office setting or environmentcosteffective and applicable attendance reporting and relatedinternal controls set forth in Part I Civilian Employees shouldbe instituted for service members to the extent management deemsappropriateMILITARY RESERVISTSTA controls for military reservists depend largely on thenature of the work If they have defined work schedules and are notexpected to be available for duty on a roundtheclock basis theTA requirements for civilian employees are operative andshould be used If however they are employed similar to those whoare on active duty or are actually on active duty then thecontrols in the subsection Active Military Personnel areoperative and should be usedAPPENDIX I GAOS REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURESAPPLICATIONSGAO has been asked by several federal agencies to reviewelectronic signature systems used in financial management systemsand to discuss how such systems should be evaluated Because ofsome of the unique risks associated with highly automatedenvironments traditional data integrity techniques such aspassword and user identification based systems used toauthenticate an individual may not provide the same degree ofassurance as that provided by paperbased systems For example in apaperbased system an individuals signature on the paper documentis a timetested method of showing that an individual intended to bebound by the terms and conditions in the paper document Howeverin an electronic world where adequate controls have not beenimplemented the similar approach of having an individuals nameappended to a data record does not provide the same assurancebecause for example the terms and conditions can be changedwithout obtaining the individuals approval of the changesmadeWhen reviewing electronic signature systems we evaluate whethera system generates electronic signatures that represent anindividuals or an entitys intent to be bound To do this wedetermine whether the electronic signature system providesreasonable assurance that the signature produced by the system is unique to the signer  under the signers sole control capable of being verified and  linked to the data insuch a manner that if the data are changed the signature isinvalidated Adopting these criteria facilitates our evaluation ofhow well the electronic signature system addresses its threats andhelps identify vulnerabilities that may be present in the systemWe have also found these criteria useful since they are technologyneutral can be used regardless of the technology used to producethe signature and allow for a variety of implementation methodsdepending of the degree of risk associated with a givenapplicationWhen deciding on an electronic signature system for TAdata agencies should identify andor develop and document thecriteria used in the selection of the signature system and how thecriteria and the selected system complies with the GPEA definitionof an electronic signature In addition the agencys riskassessment process as called for in the OMB guidance shoulddisclose the risks considered that would prevent the system fromsuccessfully complying with the criteria selected by the agencyWithout developing the criteria that the system should meet andthen effectively assessing the risks agencies could adoptsignature systems that will not provide the necessary dataintegrity See footnote A recently issued GAO report InformationSecuritySeriousandWidespreadWeaknessesPersistat FederalAgenciesGAOAIMD September   showed that in
