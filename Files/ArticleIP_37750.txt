                                 Voting Online                           First of two parts                        Nextweek Jodi Kantor will report on the emergence of Internet voting and some ofthe obstacles to it the most daunting of which is ballot security But letsassume for the moment that the practical problems can be overcome WillInternet voting be good news for American democracy            Thechief argument for evoting is that it will cause more people to vote Aseveryone knows turnout has been declining In presidential elections it hasfallen from  percent of the votingage population in  to less than percent in  There are many reasons for this but one of them is surely theinconvenience of casting ballots in person Before you can vote you need tohave registered often several weeks before an election Then you must gosomewhere and stand in a lineon a day that seems scientifically chosen tomaximize the odds of lousy weather If youre going to be away from home onElection Day you have to think ahead about getting an absentee ballotEvoting would eliminate these hassles Some advocates believe that it wouldhave its greatest impact on participation by voters aged  who turn out inlower numbers than any other group            On theother side are a variety of objections In addition to concerns about fraudsome argue that Internet voting would accentuate the socioeconomic skew of ourelections Wealthier whiter people are more likely to vote than poor peopleand minorities Since theyre also more likely to own personal computersonline voting might exaggerate the disparity There is also an argument thatthe familiar process of voting in person serves a civic purpose Rick Valellya professor at Swarthmore College argued  in the New Republic recently that realvoting is a vital public ritual that increases social solidarity and bindspeople together You might call this the communitarian objection Valellythinks that evoting would create political anomie            Ithink its fairly easy to answer the raceandclass argument No one thinksthat evoting would replace rvoting any time soon So long as it is anoptional alternative evoting makes it easier for some people tovoteespecially the handicapped people living abroad and frequentflyerswithout inconveniencing anyone else This is whats called a winwinsituation Over the next decade access to the Internet is forecast to becomedirt cheap and quasiubiquitous But for those who still cant afford or dontwant private access at home there will be public Internet terminals inlibraries schoolsand probably grocery stores and bus stations as wellEvoting might actually be a boon to the poor who often cant miss work tovote as easily as higherincome types can            Thecommunitarian objection is a bit more troubling Around the world peoplestruggle and die for the right to vote just as people in this country oncedid If youve ever seen the oncedisenfranchised standing in line all day tocast the first ballot of a lifetime in South Africa or Guatemala its hard notto be appalled at how cavalierly people treat voting in this country Itstempting to say that anyone unwilling to sacrifice an hour to exercise theright to vote doesnt much deserve it Having to take a bit of trouble to votereminds you that voting is the cornerstone of all our rights By eliminatingthe ritual evoting stands to diminish the meaning attached to it            Idsay that this complaint is valid but not persuasive The chief value of theritual of voting is to convey the significance of voting to democraticcitizens Once the ritual becomes a deterrent to the act itself as it prettyclearly has it ceases to serve its purpose In the end the communitarianobjection to evoting seems more aesthetic than substantive On the Internetmore of us will exercise our right and fulfill our civic responsibilities Wejust wont meet in a church basement to do it The tradeoff of higherparticipation for poorer visuals would seem one well worth making            In fact evoting is lessof a leap than it might seem When you think about it voting has long been afusion of public and private of tradition and technology The secret ballotwas a Progressive Era reform Voting machineswhich utilize primitive punchcard computer processingcame into widespread use in the s These twoinnovations mean that we already vote privately by computerwe just visit apublic place to do so Its not that nothing will be lost when we all vote fromremote terminals instead of at the local polling place But what we stand tolose is ephemeral What we stand to gain from virtual voting is very real
