                    Background        The GC content of a genome and the codon usage of its        genes are determined by selection and mutation pressures            Because these evolutionary processes are        characteristic of each species the sequences belonging to        a genome share a common pattern of composition of bases        codons and oligonucleotides      making it possible to        identify laterally transferred genes LTGs as those whose        features are atypical for a particular genome Thus genes        displaying atypical composition or vocabulary are inferred        to be alien and to carry features of their previous genome            However it is thought that only recently acquired        genes would be detected by this approach because sequences        quickly adjust to their new genome pattern        Since the inception of these approaches it has been        noted that alien genes tend to display lower GC contents        than their new host genome        Mdigue         et al     analyzed the codon        usage of the genes of         Escherichia coli using a multivariate        analysis and found that the genome can be separated into        three gene classes according to codon usage The first        class corresponds to highly expressed genes the second to        weakly expressed genes and the third to genes with unknown        function insertion sequences IS phage and genes        possibly related to virulence and antibiotic resistance        Therefore this last class has been interpreted as the        class of genes recently acquired by horizontal        transfer        The fact that recently acquired genes all group together        in this analysis implies that they are relatively        homogeneous in their codon usage Although not pointed out        by Mdigue         et al      this result is        surprising because these genes are thought to have been        acquired through several independent events from different        species and therefore should display very different        codonusage patterns and be separated by the analysis        Other methods based on compositional analysis often show        the same result that is recently acquired genes tend to        share characteristics such as codon usage and GC content                    It has thus been argued that the methods used to        identify LTGs are unable to detect genes acquired from        donors having similar base composition and that the amount        of LTGs although representing a substantial fraction of        the genome following their predictions is yet highly        underestimated      Moreover as noted by Lawrence and        Ochman     Since base composition  is conserved        within and among related lineages genes with anomalous        features are likely to have been acquired recently from        distantly related organisms and genes displaying atypical        composition are indeed usually interpreted as such                In this view gene exchanges would be very        frequent not only between species but among orders or        phyla Indeed base composition would hardly allow        identification of a gene acquired from         Salmonella in the         E coli genome despite the fact that        these bacteria may have diverged  million years ago        Such reasoning relies upon the untested postulate that        these genes carry the mark of a previous host genome It is        well known however that some elements or regions of        bacterial and eukaryotic genomes show systematic and        probably persistent compositional differences to the rest        of the genome This has been shown for transposable        elements viruses and plasmids     and for the region        of the replication terminus in numerous bacteria            Therefore the observed peculiarities of LTGs may        represent rather than a previous genome context the mark        of a particular lifestyle or local effect acting on the        gene        Here we address these problems by studying the codon        usage and base composition of recently acquired genes        detected by an approach based on complete genome        comparisons We show that recently acquired genes tend to        have a composition that is shifted toward AT compared to        their hosts even in ATrich genomes This suggests that        LTGs detected by compositional methods are not highly        underestimated We moreover show that the hypothesis of an        adaptation to a previous genome context hardly explains the        codon and base composition of these alien genes Therefore        we propose that peculiar evolutionary pressures acting on        these genes are responsible for their atypical composition        Hence the large majority of LTGs detected by compositional        approaches do not necessarily originate in distant        organisms                    Results                  Transfers or losses          We inferred the numbers of gene acquisitions and          losses using the method described in Figure and in the          Materials and methods section Figure shows the number          of lost and acquired genes estimated for each group of          genomes considered Because of the stringency of the          BLAST criteria used these numbers are possibly          underestimates However they give information about the          dynamics of the different genomes In all cases the          number of acquired genes is higher than the number of          genes losses in the branch of the sister grouping This          allows interpretation of genes unique to a lineage as          recent gains rather than two independent losses In          contrast we cannot exclude the possibility that some          inferred gene losses correspond to independent gene          acquisition although the probability of two independent          acquisitions of the same gene is difficult to          estimate          In most cases the number of acquired genes is higher          than the number of lost genes in the same branch Two          phenomena not mutually exclusive may explain these          differences an increase in the size of the genome this          is probably the case for the pathogenic           E coli strains as their genomes          contain many more genes than the K strain and a high          turnover of acquired genes in the genome Indeed the          complete sequence represents a snapshot of the genome          in which many of the recently acquired genes may be          destined to disappear quickly while the lost genes          detected by the method have been conserved during          relatively long periods of time in the two other lineages          Figure           Most of the acquired genes have no known functions          though a few are annotated as membrane proteins phages          or IS In the following results the genes from these two          last classes will appear in the phages and IS classes          rather that in the LTG class                          The codon usage of LTGs comparison with native          genes          We computed four independent factorial correspondence          analyses FCA on the genes of each type native and          transferred genes IS and phages for the four species           E coli OH           Helicobacter pylori            Salmonella enterica  and           Streptococcus pneumoniae  Figure          shows the projection of the genes and the codons on the          two first axes for           E coli            Salmonella            S pneumoniae and           H pylori  The codons have been          labeled according to their third position In each case          native genes and LTG form distinct groups MANOVA test           p    In           E coli and           Salmonella  the codon projections          reveal that the first axis was principally due to GC          content the laterally transferred genes being ATrich          This analysis shows that the criterion used by Mdigue           et al     probably allows          identification of most of the recent LTG as only a few          LTG detected independently from codon usage are in the          native genes cloud These last genes may therefore          display the codon usage of a closely related species or          strain In           Helicobacter  the same pattern is          observed but with a stronger opposition of Aending and          Cending codons In           Streptococcus  the ATCG          separation appeared principally on the second axis In          each case the ATA codon isoleucine is systematically          separated from the others on the first axis suggesting          that in all cases this codon is overrepresented in          LTGs compared to native genes Two other codons show a          similar pattern AGA and  except in           H pylori  AGG the two coding for          arginine These three codons seem to be the principal          ones leading to the separation between native and          transferred genes in these analyses          Table shows the relative frequencies of the codons of          isoleucine I and arginine R for all the native and          transferred genes IS and phages for each species In          enterobacteria the native genes generally avoid the          three codons ATA AGA and AGG while the transferred          genes show little or no codon bias for the corresponding          amino acids This is also true in           Streptococcus  although the AGA          codon seems to be rather overrepresented in LTGs This          codon is even more frequent in           Helicobacter LTGs          A few genes undetected as LTGs by our method are          however localized in the cloud of points of the          transferred genes The functions of these genes indicated          that they could indeed be transferred genes acquired          before the divergence of the genomes considered We          found for example membrane proteins related to the          virulence or secretory systems In           Streptococcus and           Helicobacter  we found restriction          enzymes and transcription regulators Interestingly          among these genes we identified a gene coding a ribosomal          protein RPS in           Helicobacter  On the basis of          phylogenetic analysis this peculiar gene has been shown          to be subject to extensive lateral gene transfer in the          proteobacteria group and could be involved in antibiotic          resistance                              Comparisons among species          Figure shows the first two axes of an FCA performed          on the four species All the figures can be superimposed          but they have been separated according to gene classes          native genes transferred genes and IS Figure dshows          the projection of the codons on the same axes Phages are          not represented because they are absent from the           Helicobacter and           Streptococcus genomes For a given          species each class of genes is represented by ellipses          that enclose  of the points A MANOVA shows that all          groups are significantly coherent and different from each          other            p    This confirms that          LTGs in a species tend to use a relatively similar codon          usage The separation on the first axis is mainly due to          the base composition that is ATrich and GCrich          codons Figure d          The center of each ellipse is indicated by a color          point The arrows show the displacement observed relative          to the position of the native gene ellipses Transferred          genes are systematically displaced in the direction of          ATrich codons The IS ellipses display a similar shift          toward ATrich codons However although LTGs from          different species show a tendency to group together they          tend to have codon usages comparable to their host          genomes                          The base composition of LTGs          We computed the base composition of each gene class          for the different species The GC content of LTGs is          significantly lower than the native genes MannWhitney          test           p    at each codon          position and particularly at the third GC Figure           This result is unexpected especially for           Streptococcus and           Helicobacter  which have low GC          content  and  GC respectively Thus whatever          the base composition of a genome the acquired genes are          more ATrich than their host genome Moreover when it          was possible to measure the amount of lost genes that          is in enterobacteria we have found that they also tend          to be more ATrich than the genome MannWhitney test           p    results not shown          suggesting a greater turnover of ATrich genes                          Selection on the different classes of genes          Figure shows the relative neutrality plot RNP for          each gene class in           E coli OH As expected for          genes undergoing strong selection pressures native genes          show a low slope in the regression plots            r   The most recent LTGs          display the highest slope            r   followed by more          ancient LTGs            r   suggesting that the          base composition of nonsynonymous sites in LTG is mainly          the result of mutational pressures and hence that their          aminoacid composition is exceptionally affected by the          constraints acting on the nucleotide sequence It is          interesting to note that in native genes ATrich genes          tend to show a higher slope for the regression plot          suggesting that these genes might be LTGs acquired before          the divergence of the considered genomes Phages display          a correlation slope close to that of native genes            r   indicating that they          are undergoing stronger selective pressure than LTGs The          correlation for plasmid genes of           E coli available in GenBank             shows a slope similar to that of phages            r   Surprisingly the IS          showed no correlation            r   indicating that GC          is independent of GC and GC in the IS          We carried out the same analysis on other species and          found similar results data not shown In           Salmonella  the higher slope of          the correlation for LTGs            r   compared with            r   for native genes as          well as the absence of correlation for IS was also found          indicating that these results are neither artifacts nor          limited to           E coli  The same tendencies are          observed in           Helicobacter and           Streptococcus  although not always          significant as a result of the low number of LTGs          detected          Sueoka     has computed the RNP for a          representative sample of bacteria all species together          and showed that GC and GC are correlated among          bacterial genomes with a slope of  Hence the slope          for genes recently acquired from indiscriminate bacterial          species is expected to be  We have confirmed this          prediction by randomly selecting bacterial genes in          GenBank     release  From the RNP the slope of          the correlation is always close to  data not shown          even when filtering for ATrich sequences It thus          appears that the correlation observed in the LTGs          detected by our method is incompatible with the          hypothesis that these genes display the compositional          features of typical components from other bacterial          genomes In particular the aminoacid composition of LTG          appears to be anomalously determined by base composition          even in comparison to genes of organisms having extreme          AT bias                            Discussion                  The AT richness of the transferred genes          The tendency of LTGs to be ATrich has already been          noted by several authors in species having intermediate          GC contents       However these results were          based on compositional analysis and have been interpreted          as a limitation of the methods Our results clearly show          that LTG tend to be more ATrich than their new host          genomes and that the compositional methods do not          overlook many of them The same phenomenon is observed          for species having medium enterobacteria and low            H pylori and           S pneumoniae  GC content This          striking pattern raises questions about the nature and          the source of these LTGs For example Lawrence and          Ochman    hypothesized that the recently transferred          genes were adapted to the genomic context of other          distant species however our results would suggest          either that the donor genomes are always more AT rich          than the acceptor genomes or that there is a bias toward          the internalization of ATrich exogenous DNA in the          genome          Foreign DNA may indeed encounter a physical barrier          when entering the cell if for example restriction          enzymes tend to have GCrich target sites When          analyzing the base content of restriction enzyme target          sites in REBASE    we have found that after removing          redundancy they indeed present a GC content higher than           on average data not shown Since GCpoor genomes          have LTGs with lower GC content than GCrich genomes          this predicts a positive correlation between the GC          content of a genome and of the target sites of its          restriction enzymes Only a few species have sufficient          fully characterized restriction enzymes to test this          hypothesis However           E coli and           H pylori each contain about           fully annotated restriction enzymes and the average GC          content of their target sites is  and           respectively It is therefore possible that restriction          enzymes have a role in determining the GC content of          LTGs But this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain          the observed pattern of base composition across          species          The mechanism of gene transfer often implicates the          intervention of IS and phages which are known to be          biased towards AT     It is therefore possible that          the use of such vectors influences the base composition          of the LTGs However both the FCA and the GC content          analyses suggest that IS and phages are less biased in          their base composition than other LTGs                          The source of LTGs in bacteria          LTGs possess a composition that seems principally          determined by mutation as shown by the RNP This bias is          not found in other classes of gene such as native IS or          phage genes This might suggest that LTGs are not true          open reading frames ORFs However even if most of          these genes have no known functions or homologs we find          that their codon usage is close to genes implicated in          virulence antibiotic resistance and secretory systems          implying that they may be functional Moreover Alimi           et al     have shown that at          least some of the orphan genes in           E coli are indeed transcribed          The comparisons with randomly selected genes in          GenBank using RNP shows that LTGs do not have the          expected characteristics of genes adapted to previous          genome contexts even if only ATrich sequences are able          to enter the cell Moreover it is very unlikely that          these characteristics emerged since their insertion in          their new genome Indeed while showing differences in          gene content the two           E coli OH strains for          instance are virtually identical at the nucleotide level          for the remainder of their genomes The LTGs could not          have undergone sufficient mutational pressure in such a          short period of time They more likely represent genes          that are either adapted to or carry the marks of frequent          lateral transfers Their ATrichness tends to classify          them with phages and other mobile elements              However the RNP suggests that LTGs undergo low selection          pressure on the protein sequence compared to these          elements Interestingly phages have been shown to carry          ORFs named morons because they add more DNA to the          phage genome which often have unknown functions but          are thought to occasionally confer benefit to the host          when the prophage is integrated in its genome              These genes undergo high mutation and nonhomologous          recombination rates and often display high ATcontent          even in comparison to the phage itself      Most          LTGs fit this description and may therefore have been          introduced into the genome by phages Moreover this may          explain why most of these genes are orphans as frequent          nonhomologous recombination may preclude the recognition          of homologs The current knowledge of bacteriophage          diversity is still extremely limited     and this          lack may also explain our failure to find homologs of          these genes Indeed the vast majority of bacteriophages          being still unknown they might represent an enormous          reservoir of such genes          Some of the morons have been shown to be related to          other bacterial genes suggesting that they may at first          have been host genes integrated in the phage genome              These genes may then have diverged rapidly because          phages are known to have evolutionary rates orders of          magnitude higher than those of bacteria     Morons          seem rarely to confer a direct advantage on the phage          but rather stabilize the hostprophage interaction by          slightly increasing host fitness     Therefore they          may undergo weaker selection pressure than genes directly          involved in the phage lifecycle and be more sensitive to          the mutational bias inherent to parasitic sequences              From our results it appears that whatever the nature          of the organism in which the gene was first recruited          its compositional characteristics no longer represent its          previous genome context Although these genes seem to          have a high turnover in the genome it is likely that          when proved useful to the cell they establish a          longlasting association with their new host Thus while          moron accretion has been proposed as a key mechanism of          phage evolution     this process may also contribute          to some extent to the evolution of bacterial genomes and          to their adaptation to new habitats In this view phages          could be considered as a powerful way of inventing new          genes potentially beneficial to their hosts          Thus although bacterial genomes tend to acquire large          amounts of DNA we have shown that those transferred          genes have very peculiar features that do not denote a          previous genomic context but connect them with parasitic          sequences such as phages The genes involved in such          lateral transfer obviously do not belong to classes of          genes that encode typical cellular pathways Hence          though the differences in content between closely related          genomes have been extensively cited as evidence for          constant exchanges with distant relatives these          sequences carry no evidence for such exchanges          Therefore attempts to use codon usage of an LTG as an          indication of their phylogenetic origin should be          considered with caution                            Materials and methods                  Inferring recent acquisitions and losses by          parsimony          The availability of sequenced bacterial genomes allows          comparison of the gene content between closely related          species and thus the finding of very recently acquired          genes in the genomes using parsimony analysis Figure          describes the ideal case of three closely related          species A B and C for which the genomes are sequenced          and the phylogenetic relationships known Three scenarios          can explain the presence in species A of a gene which is          absent in species B and C first the gene was present in          the common ancestor of the species A B and C and has          then been independently lost in species B and C second          the gene has been acquired by the common ancestor of          species A and B and then lost in species B and third          the gene has been recently acquired by species A The          last hypothesis is the most parsimonious explanation if          one considers that the acquisition of a gene is at least          as probable as a loss A possible verification that this          hypothesis is realistic is to estimate the number of          apparent gene losses Indeed the absence in species A of          a gene present in species B and C can be interpreted as          the loss of the gene in species A or two independent          acquisitions in species B and C Note that apparent gene          losses in A may be overestimated if recombination occur          frequently between B and C that is acquisition of genes          by B and C is not independent however the effect of          such a recombination event is probably low in the present          cases see Genomes section These estimations of          acquisition and losses can be made for species A and          B          We identified genes acquired by species A after the          divergence of species A and B case A B C in Figure           by making a BLASTP    query of the protein          sequences more than  amino acids long in genome A          against those in B and C Proteins having no match with a          bit score  of the bit score of the query protein          against itself were considered as being recently acquired          in species A          We identified gene losses by species A after the          divergence of species A and B case A B C in Figure           by making a BLASTP query of the protein sequences          more than  amino acids long in genome B against those          in A and C Figure  A protein was considered as          recently lost in species A if it had no match in species          A same criterion as before and at least one match in          species C bit score higher than  of the bit score of          the protein against itself To avoid problems due to          possible gene misannotations these results were verified          using a BLASTN query                          Genomes          To use the method described above it is important to          have at least three complete sequenced genomes that are          closely related with unambiguous phylogenetic          relationships For this purpose we used five closely          related genomes in the enterobacteria group           E coli OH EDL               E coli OH Saka               E coli K               Salmonella enterica     and           S typhimurium LT     three          closely related genomes in the alphaproteobacteria          group           Helicobacter pylori J               H pylori      and           Campylobacter jejunii     and          three closely related genomes in the           Streptococcus genus           S pneumoniae R               S pneumoniae TIGR     and           S pyogenes     We considered          as unambiguous the relationships between these bacteria          because for example the orthologous genes of the two          strains of           E coli OH are almost          identical at the nucleotide level while they show          noticeable differences from           E coli K data not shown This          suggests that since their divergence the two strains of                    E coli OH have undergone only          a few recombination events with more distant strains The          same reasoning has been applied in the other cases In          the group of enterobacteria it was possible to classify          transferred genes relative to their date of acquisition          in the three strains of           E coli  Thus we identified          transferred genes acquired before the separation of the          two strains OH ancient transfers and those          acquired in one of the two strains OH after their          separation recent transfers                          Gene classes          On the basis of sequence annotations we have removed          genes related to IS and prophages from the different          classes of genes defined using the method described          below Genes from each class that is native genes          potentially transferred genes LTG IS and phages of          the four groups of bacterial genomes            Escherichia            Salmonella            Helicobacter  and           Streptococcus  were then retained          for codonusage analysis when their lengths were greater          than  basepairs bp to avoid artifacts linked to          stochastic variations that might happen in shorter          genes                          Factorial correspondence analysis on codon          usage          To compute our FCA on gene codon composition we used          absolute codon frequencies without considering the three          stop codons or the ATG and TGG codons which are not          degenerate We thus obtained a matrix consisting of           columns corresponding to the  degenerate codons and          as many rows as sequences analyzed Such a matrix can be          used in a FCA which is a multivariate analysis often          used to study codon usage         It allows          one to calculate the position of sequences in a          multidimensional space with respect to their codon usage          and to give a graphical representation of the dimensions          maximizing their dispersion Genes having similar codon          usage are hence regrouped The analysis being          symmetrical makes it possible to represent the codons in          the same space as the one used to visualize the genes          which allows identification of those responsible for the          clustering of the genes We used ADE software package             to perform the FCA presented in this study          To avoid statistical bias due to the differences in          numbers of sequences composing each category we randomly          selected  genes among the native genes and  among          the transferred genes when their number was greater than          this value for the intraspecific species analysis When          the number of phages and IS was greater than  we          randomly selected  sequences in the phage and IS          categories For the same reason in analysis gathering          the four species we randomly selected  genes among          the native genes and  among the transferred genes The          numbers of transferred genes in the different strains of           S pneumoniae and           H pylori were approximately           so the entire sets were used Ten independent selections          of genes were performed to guarantee the reproducibility          of the results                          Relative neutrality plots RNPs          The strength of the selection on a given gene relative          to the mutation pressure can be estimated by the method          of the relative neutrality plot RNP which gives          indications on how neutral a coding sequence can be          considered      The method consists of plotting          the GC content at the constrained or nonsynonymous          positions that is first and second positions of the          codons against the GC content at the relaxed or          synonymous position that is third position The slope          of the resulting linear correlation gives evidence on how          the protein sequence is affected by the mutational bias          acting on the nucleotide sequence and thus on how          strongly the selection pressure acting on the protein can          counteract this bias Note that the effect measured is          relative to the translational selection acting on the          third position of codons and that the strength of this          pressure is supposed to be weak compared to the selection          on the protein sequence The slope is expected to be          equal to one if the protein sequences are under no          selective constraints and to decrease with the strength          of the selection acting at the protein level          Translational selection is also expected to reduce the          correlation though to a lower extent For this study we          analyzed the correlations according to different gene          classes to determine whether there were differences in          the relative selection pressures in each of the classes          All the correlations presented here are highly          significant            p   except when          stated                            Additional data files        A list of the acquired genes in three groups of closely        related bacteria
