                                 I Like Mike            WhenRichard J Daley was alive and mayor of Chicago no one gave him a harder timethan Mike Royko did Maybe the funniest piece Rokyo ever wrote was an extendedparody of one of Daleys frequent solecisms Daley responding to his criticsonce uttered the phrase Like a guy said a long time ago He who hasntsinned pick up the first stone  Royko riffed on this through an entirecolumn as in                           Mosesleading the Israelites out of Egypt Lets get out of here               Ahabsighting the Great White Whale Lets all get that fish               Douglas MacArthur leaving the Philippines in  Lets all come back heresome time                        In a less madcap vein Rokyo wrote Boss  adevastating portrait of the Daley machine and probably the best book everwritten about city politics            Yet when Daley droppeddead of a heart attack in  Royko sat down at his typewriter and banged outa column that was both an interpretation and an appreciation Daleys abuse ofthe English language didnt offend people who werent that far removed fromparents and grandparents who knew only bits and pieces of the language Roykowrote The mayors abuse of power didnt bother those who had lived through farworse The people who came here in Daleys lifetime were accustomed to someonewielding power like a club be it a czar emperor king or rural sheriffRoyko noted The niceties of the democratic process werent part of theimmigrant experiences So if the Machine muscle offended some it seemed likeold times to many more Its hard to imagine a political scientistor anyother journalist for that matterframing it so simply or so well            Reading these gems in the new posthumous selection OneMore Time The Best of Mike Royko  I found myself wondering Why doesntanyone write a newspaper column this good anymore Royko wasnt quite a Twainor a Mencken but his writing was distinctive and memorable and in its time theclosest thing to lasting literature in a daily paper Royko could make youlaugh and make you think stir outrage at a heartless bureaucrat or bring atear to the eye when he flashed a glimpse of the heart hidden beneath his hardshell            He performed this rangeof feats with a regularity and prominence that no city columnist or anynational one can match today Royko wrote his  words five times a weeksometimes six Today the columnist who writes something decent twice a week isa marvel For the better part of  years everyone in Chicago read him firstin the Daily News  then in the SunTimes after the DailyNews closed then in the Tribune after Rupert Murdoch bought theSunTimes Even after Royko said that no selfrespecting fish would bewrapped in a Murdoch paper the Alien refused to accept his resignation andkept reprinting his old columns This led Royko to write In Aliens TongueI Quit is Vacation  Roykos fame spread nationally despite the fact thathe seldom left Chicago and refused to do television By the time he died in he was syndicated in  papers around the country            Roykos hold came in part from his sense of place He grewup in the Polish neighborhood on the northwest side of Chicago that NelsonAlgren captured in one of Roykos favorite books The Neon Wilderness and he never left it in spirit Roykos father was a milkman and the familylived over a tavern Before finding his way into journalism Royko already hadexperience setting bowling pins working on a landscape crew in a greasymachine shop and in a lamp factory and pushing carts around a departmentstore as he noted in  When he said he became a writer because it waseasier on the feet he half meant it To his working class andworkingclassonceremoved readers Royko was like Daley one of us            But where Daley oftendrew on the worst side of ethnic Chicagoits tolerance of corruption itsparochialism and racial prejudiceRoyko spoke to its better instincts Aneighborhood populist he celebrated the corner tavern and the weekend softballgame But Royko also challenged white Chicagos prejudices skewering bigotswho tried to keep a white couple that had adopted a black baby out of theirneighborhood or a funeral parlor that didnt want to bury a black soldierkilled in Vietnam In the column he wrote the day after Harold Washingtonbecame the first black person elected mayor of Chicago Royko began with one ofhis inimitable openings So I told Uncle Chester Dont worry HaroldWashington doesnt want to marry your sister            Of course Uncle Chester along with Slats Grobnik and AuntWanda didnt really exist Im sure that Sam Sianis the proprietor of Roykosbeloved Billy Goat Tavern didnt say many of the things Royko attributed tohim Im not sure how many of Roykos readers understood that much of what hewrote was facetious or fictionalized These days newspaper writers are nolonger allowed the kind of license he took As journalism has become less of atrade and more of a profession once common vices like embellishmentplagiarism and binge drinking have ceased to be regarded as charming MikeBarnicle a secondrate Roykoesque columnist was fired from the BostonGlobe for blending fiction and fact in a way that Royko did routinely            Nor is it possible for anewspaper writer now to be as blunt as Royko was In  the University ofMissouri School of Journalism released a list of words for journalists toavoid including such terms as gorgeous lazy sweetie and fried chickenFried chicken fried chicken fried chicken I said it and Im glad Sue meRoyko wrote His refusal to be sensitive got him in trouble in  the yearbefore he died In a column lampooning Pat Buchanan Royko wrote that Mexicowas a useless country that should be invaded and turned over to Club Med Bythen Roykos tone had grown increasingly bitter and his irony was easy tomiss The result was an enormous protest outside the Tribune by Hispanicgroups that took his comments literally and demanded that he be fired            If journalism has changed since Roykos heyday so too havecities like Chicago White ethnics have ceased to be the dominant force inurban life In  when Royko moved to a condominium in a lakefronthighrise he cast himself as a bungalowbred Margaret Mead studying yuppiesby living among them But yuppiesor at least the suburbanized offspring ofSlats Grobnikwere increasingly his audience and his newsroom colleaguesRoyko saw himself as more and more of an anachronism Before he died he quitdrinking and unhappily moved to the suburbs            So why dont we have newspaper columnists as good ashim anymore To summarize We no longer have his kind of newspaper We nolonger have his kind of city But mainly we dont have another Mike Roykoanewspaper writer grounded in a place like Chicago with a gift for explainingit to the world and the world to it
