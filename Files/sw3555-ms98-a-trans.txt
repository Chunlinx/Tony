                uh what topic would you like to discuss political topic   oh i dont know i guess the thing thats on my mind lately is these hostages that have been released  so i cant imagine how it wouldve been to been incarcerated incarcerated for that length of time   well i think its marvelous they finally figured a way to get them out of there huh     im not sure what it ever  what it really accomplished having them uh locked up for that long did the uh did their captors ever really say this is why were holding them and   well what they wanted of course was uh one money and two the release of all the Palestinians held by the Israels   uhhuh   you know the the the Jewish folks and uh i guess theyre gonna get a lot of those released and   yeah   i understand theres uh what several hundred or even thousands of political prisoners   probably a lot i probably a lot   yeah  whats uh whats been pressing you lately   well i think the developments in Soviet Union are rather interesting   oh yeah   im not real sure how theyre gonna all turn out i hope they turn out positively and not turn into chaos but   well does it sound like Gorbachev definitely out of a job to you     certainly sounds that way doesnt it   looks looks that way uh im a little disappointed and i and i think people uh   yep   well hes won a peace prize and uh   well i think thats one of the problems being a Mister Nice Guy and i think thats what he was and is you know i i think he tried to     yeah   accommodate  too many people uh and in a structure like that apparently its a difficult if not impossible task i dont know   yeah   but Europe is   huh   and whether we like it or not when       the USSR was together the peace was kept in Europe relatively speaking   yeah yeah   and uh there might be a big void there and i uh its certainly a   well     fence sitting situation i i i hope its not a i hope it gets resolved properly lets put that way   yeah  well its gonna be interesting see what happens the next year there   with all those nuclear weapons floating around you get uh get the wrong person there i think we could have major problems   uhhuh yeah   i i dont necessarily mean we in in the US alone but the world   im curious what uh what Texans think of their neighboring state and uh recent uh gubernatorial race there with uh David Duke   yeah   how was the what was the press like in in Texas over that issue   well of course theres a number of rednecks in Texas that im sure would jump on his band wagon and uh     uhhuh   but im sure the vast vast majority would think it of him as he probably is   umhum i its remarkable that he can uh i think that he can get this far as hes gotten  with uh   and uh   you know the kind of background hes got and im im just surprised that he has uh seems like thatd be something that be so controversial that it pretty well exclude himself from any political office   well i think the South is not the nation certainly still has many racist type people that uh would jump on his band wagon   uhhuh yeah   and uh       being a springer splinter operation im sure it wouldnt you know it it raises a lot of noise and everything but i dont think it would probably go very far in a   yeah   overall scope of things   well i think were a little isolated where i live here we just dont have many uh many blacks to speak of uh you know probably less than five percent of the population i would guess   well   we have a fair  a fair amount of uh Hispanics and um Native Americans not too many blacks   well well i think its a i grew up in uh Milwaukee and Wisconsin and uh   uhhuh   i think uh you know its definitely a different philosophy of how you look at blacks up North as you do in the South   uhhuh   and you know it i growing up uh where i grew up in our high school you had one black that was from out of the area to start with and you know we had three thousand kids in our high school so   that was the extent of it huh   we werent really you know even you know when we played football against a couple black teams and you know that part of Milwaukee uh you know they were nothing you know i mean now now its all the blacks in football and basketball   ill say theres they sure dominate the pro sports dont they and well and collegiate too so   so i i dont i dont know what uh you know times have changed but i i think thats one of the reasons the Packers will always have problems having a         getting back to the status they were during the Lombardi years and uh Green Bay being an extremely small town   uhhuh   of sixty thousand fifty five thousand
