                                 The Al GoreBill Bradley GreenOff Part II            As Chatterbox noted previously see The Al GoreBill Bradley GreenOff Part I BillBradleys lifetime legislative score from the League ofConservation Voters is a full  percentagepoints ahead of Al Earth in theBalance Gores Cutting the vice president every conceivablebreakrestricting the comparison to the years  when both men werein the Senate and knocking out the years  and  when Gores runs for president and vice president may havecaused him to miss key environmental votes narrowed the GoreBradley gap to eightpercentage points  But it didnt               eliminate that gap Bradley still ended up with thebetter LCV score How could that be            Chatterbox decided to attack this question by examiningcauses for both the point gap based on the raw LCV lifetime scores and theeightpoint gap based on Chatterboxs elaborate massaging of the LCV lifetimescores That way Chatterbox figured hed have answers for bothBradley partisans who are likely to view anyalteration of the raw LCV scores with suspicion and Gore partisans who are likely to view comparison of the raw LCVscores as simplistic and unfair Supporters of Republican presidentialcandidates are presumably gleeful that this contest is being scored at all anddont much care how big the gap is                                             Analysis of the point gap                                       Not even Chatterbox has the patience to comb throughevery environmental vote in the House and Senate between  and Chatterbox leaves that to certified practitioners of social science InsteadChatterbox zeroed in on the two years when Gore cast considerably more votesconsidered antienvironment by the LCV than he did in other years These were when Gore cast antienvironment votes  times and received an LCVrating of  percent his thirdworst score everand  when Gore cast antienvironment votes  times and received an LCVrating of  percent his worst score ever            What were these  antienvironment votesFour of them Chatterbox would characterize by wayof explaining not necessarily condoning as Tennessee votes ie votes inwhich powerful Tennessee interests were at odds with national environmentalgroups                           On July   the House voted on phasing outfederal funding for Tennessees Clinch River BreederReactor one of the more notorious boondoggles of the period Gore votedagainst the defunding measure which lost                On October   the House voted on whether tooverride President Carters veto of a water projects appropriation bill whichincluded funding for the TennesseeTombigbeeWaterway another famous boondoggle of that era Gore voted in favor ofthe veto override which failed  falling short of the necessarytwothirds majority               On October   the House voted on whether toexempt Tennessees Tellico Dam which was believedto represent a threat to the snail darter population from the EndangeredSpecies Act Gore voted for the exemption which was adopted                On June   the House voted on whether to cutfunding for the TennesseeTombigbee Waterway  Gorevoted against the cut which was rejected                                        Twelve additionalantienvironment votes Chatterbox would call Tennessee penumbra votesie votes in which powerful Tennessee interests might be harmedindirectly by a proenvironment vote These includeeight votes in favor of dams and other water projects outside Tennessee  probably Gore felthe needed to support other House members water projects if they were going tosupport his in Tennessee The other four Tennesseepenumbra votes benefited the nuclear powerindustry and the Bonneville PowerAdministration two outofstate constituencies whose influence no doubtcould be felt in Tennessee home of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor and theTennessee Valley Authority            That leaves elevenantienvironment votes whose connection to powerful Tennessee interests areunclear These include several energy crisis votes it is by now largelyforgotten that environmental groups were often opposed to federal efforts toease the energy crisis Gore voted in favor of a solarsatellite program that the environmental movement opposed according to theLCV because it was costly and grandiose Gore voted against the National Energy Act of  which the LCV favored because it included a lot of conservationmeasures but which some environmentalists opposed because it alsodecontrolled natural gas prices and Gore voted to create the Synthetic Fuels Corp  an illconsidered and shortlivedalternative fuel venture opposed by environmentalists because it involvedstripmining Environmentalists were also opposed to the MX missiles underground basing mode which Gore supported in acouple of votes during this period eventually he would shift his support to anexpensive but strategically elegant alternative called the Midgetmanmissile                                             Analysis of the eightpoint gap                                       Chatterbox again was too lazy to examine all theenvironmental votes that occurred between  and  the period when Goreand Bradley served together in the Senateeven after omitting all votes in and  Instead Chatterbox looked at the three years when Gore casthis greatest number of antienvironment votes in the Senate These were and  when Gore cast four antienvironment votes earning a combined LCVscore of  Gores thirdworst Senate score and when Gore cast another four antienvironment votes earning an LCVscore of  Gores fourthworst Senate score            These eight antienvironment Senate votes were avote against defunding the Synfuels Corp a vote in favor of constructing ahighway along the boundary of a wilderness park in Hawaii a vote againstcreating a new victims compensation program under the Superfund program avote to cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency two highway billvotes a vote against banning new billboard construction along federallysubsidized highways and a vote against a moratorium on issuing federal patentsfor hardrock mining on public lands out west Of these only the SynfuelsCorp vote and the mining vote were clearly dreadful The votes againstextending Superfund spending and effecting a wholesale ban on billboards wasclearly good The EPA funding cut was probably bad but Chatterbox would haveto know more about the circumstances            Gores second  worst score  percentoccurred in  and  but it was an aberration during those two yearsGore actually cast only one antienvironment vote He ended up with percent because he was absent for four out of ten LCVscored votes            Gores two               worst                Senate scoreswere in  and  The  score of  percent is explained in theprevious footnote The  score  percent is entirely attributable to fiveabsences Gore didnt cast a single antienvironment vote that year butthere were only  LCVscored votes
