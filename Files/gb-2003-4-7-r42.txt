                    Background        Although the analysis of sequenced genomes to date has        focused most heavily on the proteincoding set of genes        all genomes also contain a constellation of noncoding RNA        genes With the exception of certain classes of RNAs with        strongly conserved sequences andor structures such as        ribosomal and transfer RNAs identification of most        noncoding RNAs has historically been a relatively        serendipitous affair Only very recently have there been        concerted efforts to identify such genes systematically        using both experimental and computational approaches                   Our collective ignorance of the totality of noncoding        RNA genes was laid bare by recent work on microRNAs        miRNAs an abundant family of  nucleotide noncoding        RNAs      The founding members of this family lin        and let were identified through forward analysis of        extant         Caenorhabditis elegans mutants             Both of these RNAs are posttranscriptional regulators        of developmental timing that function by binding to the         untranslated regions  UTRs of target genes               Although they were long regarded as genetic curiosities        possibly specific to nematodes let was subsequently        found to be broadly conserved across bilaterian evolution           and miRNA genes are now recognized as a pervasive and        widespread feature of animal and plant genomes                         In general it is thought that miRNA biogenesis proceeds        via intermediate precursor transcripts of more than         nucleotides that have the capacity to form an extended        stemloop structure premiRNA although at least some        premiRNAs are further derived from even longer transcripts        primary miRNA transcripts or primiRNAs These can exist        as long individual premiRNA precursor transcripts as        operonlike multiple premiRNA precursors or even as part        of primary mRNA transcripts Processing of primiRNA into        the premiRNA stemloop occurs in the nucleus while        subsequent processing of premiRNA into  mers is a        cytoplasmic event mediated by the RNAse III enzyme Dicer               Dicer is also responsible for cleavage of        long perfectly doublestranded RNA into  nucleotide        fragments during RNA interference RNAi      These        latter molecules known as silencing RNA siRNA bind to        and trigger the degradation of perfectly homologous mRNA        molecules via RISC a doublestrand RNAinduced silencing        complex containing nuclease activity             Although the         in vivo function of only a few miRNAs        is known so far it is believed that the vast majority are        likely to participate in posttranscriptional gene        regulation of complementary mRNA targets Interestingly        perfect or nearperfect target complementarity is        associated with mRNA degradation       similar to        the effects of siRNA whereas imperfect basepairing is        associated with regulation by translational inhibition             Recently siRNAs with imperfect match to target mRNA        were observed to function as translational inhibitors            suggesting that the type of  nucleotide        RNAmediated regulation may be largely determined by the        quality of target complementarity        The vast majority of the approximately  miRNAs        currently known were identified through direct cloning of        short RNA molecules Although this method has been quite        successful thus far its practicality is limited by the        necessity for a considerable amount of RNA as raw material        for cloning and cloned products are often dominated by a        few highly expressed miRNAs For example  of miRNAs        cloned from HeLa cells are variants of let  of human        brain miRNAs are variants of miR and  of miRNAs        cloned from human heart and  of those cloned from early         Drosophila embryos are miR             In fact it has been opined that few additional        mammalian miRNAs will be easily identified by the direct        cloning method            As a complementary approach to miRNA identification we        developed an informatic strategy miRseeker and applied        it to the completed genomes of         Drosophila melanogaster and         D pseudoobscura  which are some         million years diverged miRseeker subjects conserved        intronic and intergenic sequences to an RNA folding and        evaluation procedure to identify evolutionarily constrained        hairpin structures with features characteristic of known        miRNAs The specificity of this computational procedure was        shown by the presence of  out of  reference miRNAs        within the top  candidates We identified a total of         novel miRNA candidates whose existence was strongly        supported by conservation in other insect nematode or        vertebrate genomes Expression of  novel miRNA genes was        verified by northern analysis including  out of         candidates that were supported by thirdspecies        conservation and  out of  highscoring predictions        specific to         Drosophila  demonstrating that the        bioinformatic screen was successful As might be expected        the newly verified miRNA genes vary tremendously with        respect to abundance and developmental expression profile        suggesting diverse roles for these genes Inference of our        falsepositive prediction and falsenegative verification        rates based on our ability to identify known miRNAs and        detect the expression of highly conserved and thus        presumed genuine novel miRNAs leads us to estimate that        drosophilid genomes contain around  miRNA genes or        nearly  of the number of predicted proteincoding genes        In combination with other concurrent genomic analyses               it is likely that most miRNAs in completed        animal genomes have now been identified Collectively this        sets the stage for both genomewide and targeted studies of        this functionally elusive family of regulators                    Results                  Evolutionarily conserved characteristics of miRNA          genes          The starting point for our studies was a reference set          of            Drosophila premiRNA sequences            let  the  originally          identified by LagosQuintana and colleagues           mir  and a previously          undescribed paralog of           mir that we named           mirc       We analyzed          this set to derive rules and determine parameters that          specifically describe known miRNA genes within anonymous          genomic sequence          Examination of the genomic sequence of           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura showed that all           members of the reference set are highly conserved along          the entirety of the predicted precursor transcripts          which typically range between  nucleotides When          viewed in VISTA plot alignments     miRNA genes          reside in short regions of exceptional conservation          easily seen as local peaks Figure  As is the case          for many other noncoding RNA genes their degree of          conservation usually exceeds that of coding regions due          to their lack of thirdposition wobble This suggested          that miRNA genes might be found by folding fixed lengths          of conserved sequence to identify ones that display the          high degree of relatively continuous helicity          characteristic of known premiRNAs However pilot          studies identified a very large number of conserved          stemloops in genomic sequence suggesting that          additional criteria were necessary to make effective          miRNA gene predictions          We next aligned the  pairs of orthologous           Drosophila premiRNA sequences and          assessed their pattern of nucleotide divergence There          are only three pairs that have been completely conserved          Figure a class  indicating that most premiRNAs          have diverged to some extent within           Drosophila  Unexpectedly we          detected mild selective pressure on the precise sequence          of the nonmiRNAencoding arm This attribute is not          selfevident It might have been the case that point          mutations along an arm would be neutral as long as the          status of basepairing was maintained this is possible          due to the acceptability of GU basepairing in RNA          Instead we observed preferential divergence within the          loop sequence Ten members of the reference set have          diverged exclusively within their loop sequence Figure          a class  whereas there are no members that have          diverged exclusively along an arm Figure a class           This is well illustrated by the           Drosophila let orthologs which          have accumulated four mismatches and gaps in the loop          sequence but maintain perfectly conserved arms Figure          b Thus the terminal loop is the most evolutionary          labile portion of premiRNA          Mutations do eventually accumulate on the          nonmiRNAencoding arm and orthologous premiRNAs from          more diverged species will often preserve only the           nucleotide mature miRNA itself However because of          preferential divergence within the loop orthologous          miRNAs from species of an appropriate evolutionary          distance such as           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura  show an equal or          greater amount of change within the loop than on the          nonmiRNAencoding arm Figure a class  This is the          case despite the fact that the loop is typically only a          third to a quarter the length of each arm Of the eleven          members of the reference set that show divergence on both          an arm and the loop seven show more changes in the loop          than on the nonmiRNAencoding arm and three have an          equal number of changes on the loop and          nonmiRNAencoding arm Figure a class  only one          member of the reference set miRb shows a greater          number of changes on the nonmiRNA arm than the loop          Figure a class  Finally there are no cases where          both arms have diverged irrespective of loop status a          situation that would imply that the miRNA sequence itself          had diverged Figure a class           We propose then that classes  represent the normal          pattern of evolutionary divergence of miRNAs and          consider           Drosophila candidates that fall          into these classes to represent good miRNA candidates          Conversely we consider classes  to have a low          probability of reflecting a genuine miRNA in           Drosophila  regardless of how          impressive the helical nature of the conserved          stemloop is Indeed we tested one class  and seven          class  candidates by northern blot and failed to observe          expression for any of them despite extensive conserved          stemloop structure data not shown We emphasize that          these evolutionary considerations are most relevant to          relatively closely related species since the loop is          much shorter than the arms we expect class  candidates          to eventually evolve into class  candidates in species          separated by greater evolutionary distance than the two           Drosophila species analyzed in the          present study Figure a                          Computational prediction of DrosophilamiRNA genes          using miRseeker                      Extraction of candidate conserved nongenic            Drosophilasequences            We first subdivided Release  of the             D melanogaster genome               into  contigs of  nucleotides each with             nucleotides of overlap at either end These were            matched to the approximately  contigs in the            first assembly of the             D pseudoobscura genome produced            by the Human Genome Sequencing Center at the Baylor            College of Medicine     using a dataset provided            by the Berkeley Genome Pipeline     We then            aligned the repeatmasked             D melanogaster sequence to            corresponding             D pseudoobscura sequence using            the global alignment tool AVID      We            subsequently eliminated from the alignment all            sequences associated with the following Release             annotations     exons transposable elements            snRNA snoRNA tRNA and rRNA genes In total we were            able to align  out of  megabases of intronic            and intergenic             D melanogaster sequence by this            procedure            Using the reference set we empirically determined            parameters for extracting conserved sequences that            could contain miRNA genes designated as regions We            found that a unit segment of the alignment where a            unit is either a single paired or gapped nucleotide            containing no more than  gaps or  mismatches was            sufficient to identify all known miRNA genes within            their respective genomic neighborhoods with a minimum            of additionally selected sequences            Conserved intergenic or intronic sequences are            frequently longer than  nucleotides We chose to            evaluate these as a series of regions that overlap            each other by around  nucleotides and grouped these            regions into a single superregion The rationale for            defining regions and superregions came from our            observation that RNA folding algorithms would not            necessarily identify characteristic premiRNA            structures if they were folded within the context of            longer RNAs owing to basepairing with nonmiRNA            sequence Thus regionfolding should offer optimal            structures while tracking of superregions would            ensure that multiple overlapping regions were evaluated            as a single candidate gene We took care to verify that            our windowing parameters segregated individual miRNAs            within known miRNA clusters the             mir              mir and             mir  mir clusters                into distinct superregions This analysis identified             conserved regions that originate from             superregions                                Identification of conserved stemloops and            evaluation of their quality            We analyzed conserved regions with mfold  an            RNAfolding algorithm     As miRNA genes can be            located on either strand and the quality of predicted            hairpin structures can vary significantly between the            respective strands depending on the amount of GU            basepairing we folded each region as both the            forward and the reverse complement of the extracted            sequence  regions     mfolds            Evaluation of candidate structures took into account            the length of the longest helical arm with a minimum            cutoff of  basepairs and the free energy of this            isolated arm with a minimum cutoff of G             kcalmol The physical resemblance to the canonical            stemloop precursor was also assessed with metrics that            reward continuous helical pairing and progressively            penalize internal loops of increasing size Since            unpaired nucleotides in known miRNAs have a tendency to            be found in symmetric loops the presence of asymmetric            loops and bulged nucleotides was further penalized The            size of the hairpin loop was not specifically evaluated            as it appears to be variable in known premiRNAs            however it was indirectly assessed as maximization of            stem length concomitantly minimizes terminal loop            size            Given a nucleotide input sequence mfold             typically returns one to six alternate structures each            containing one to four helical arms thus the            structure containing the highestscoring helical arm            had to be determined for each folded sequence The            highestscoring region in each superregion which            could be located on either strand was then saved as            its representative and these were ordered For the top                         D melanogaster superregions we            repeated this analysis on all regions in the            corresponding             D pseudoobscura superregions            We averaged the scores obtained for each aligned pair            of             DmDp regions termed a            regionpair and selected the highestscoring            regionpair within each superregion as its most            probable miRNA candidate sequence We then searched for            homologs of these selected regions in             Anopheles gambiae using WUBLAST            of the             Dm sequence     extending            the returned sequences as necessary on their  and             ends to make nucleotide windows equivalent to the            queried sequence The top three mosquito hits were then            folded and scored as before However as a large            fraction of known fly miRNAs lack mosquito counterparts            Table  we decided to rank the candidates solely on            their average             DmDp score            miR and miRc received exceptionally low scores            in this analysis while miR was absent because it            was not located in an alignable contig in the first            available assembly of             D pseudoobscura although it was            identifiable by BLAST search The other  members of            the reference set fell into the top  or so in the            initial round of scoring indicating that our method of            scoring stemloops effectively identified genuine            miRNAs from among the  conserved            superregions                                Evaluation of the divergence pattern in conserved            stemloops            As discussed earlier  members of the             Drosophila reference set are            described by one of three patterns of divergence            Figure a classes  In the final set of tests we            implemented a series of Boolean filters to eliminate            highscoring conserved stemloops whose patterns of            nucleotide divergence are incompatible with a high            likelihood of representing genuine miRNAs Figure a            classes             We began this analysis by trimming the unit            region to exclude sequences at the ends of the windowed            sequence that lie outside of the main helical arm We            then defined a potential miRNA candidate sequence as            being a perfectly conserved block of sequence greater            than  nucleotides in length located less than             nucleotides from the end of the terminal loop and            eliminated those candidates that did not contain a            potential miRNA Figure a class  If both arms            passed this test it was kept as a miRNA candidate            regardless of loop status Figure a classes  and             as either arm could potentially contain a miRNA The            remaining candidates contain only a single conserved            candidate miRNA arm We defined the nonconserved arm as            the nonmiRNAencoding arm and eliminated the candidate            if it displayed a perfectly conserved loop Figure a            class  The remaining candidates contain divergent            positions in both the loop and the nonmiRNAencoding            arm We eliminated those that contained more than four            additional nonconserved positions in the            nonmiRNAencoding arm compared to within the loop            Figure a class  leaving behind class  candidates            as potential miRNAs Of the reference set miRNAs only            mirb failed these filters as a class  miRNA            even though it received the eighth highest score of all            superregions in the entire euchromatic sequence of the            drosophilid genomes            Only about onethird of the highestscoring            conserved stemloops passed these filters with an even            greater fraction of lowerscoring candidates failing            these filters leaving behind around  candidates            from the initial top  Of the reference set              reside in the first  candidates demonstrating            that the overall procedure robustly selected for            genuine miRNAs Figure  Table  A second measure of            the utility of assessing patterns of nucleotide            divergence is their ability to select against            selfcomplementary repeats Many highscoring            candidates were previously noticed to be rich in            complementary nucleotide repeats such as CAG UUG and            CUG AUAU or polyApolyU repeats and were            presumed to be poor candidates in spite of occasionally            remarkable helical structure nearly all of them were            eliminated by the step  filters We have generated a            web interface where folded structures and evaluation of            the top  miRseeker candidates may be accessed                           Candidate mature miRNA sequences were defined by the            bounds of the perfectly conserved sequence A total of             novel candidates in the top  miRseeker            predictions were supported by additional evidence of            sequence and structural conservation in a third species            primarily             Anopheles and             Apis  with a smaller fraction in            nematodes or vertebrates In cases where candidate            miRNAs were identifiable in noninsect species a            putative  nucleotide product was usually evident            A predicted miRNA produced from candidates whose only            homologs were found in other insects could usually be            inferred to within  nucleotides Table                                     Experimental verification of novel candidate          miRNAs          We next sought to validate the predicted miRNAs by          northern blot of total RNA isolated from  hour          embryos third instar larvae and early pupae and adult          males The total number of genes authenticated by this          method is an underestimate for two main reasons First          the mature miRNA can be derived from either arm of a          given stemloop and many predicted premiRNAs fold well          on either strand In some cases such as miR and          miR the nontranscribed strand actually adopts a          fold with longer continuous helices than does the          transcribed strand As we tested one or two probes for          each candidate a falsenegative result will have been          obtained if we tested either the incorrect arm or strand          of a putative miRNA Second a significant fraction of          miRNAs are likely to be expressed at extremely low levels          or in a highly tissuespecific manner and so may not be          amenable to confirmation by these means With these          concerns in mind we tested  candidate genes from two          classes of predicted miRNAs  that were conserved          outside of           Drosophila  of which were          highscoring candidates and  highscoring           Drosophila specific candidates          This analysis confirmed  novel miRNA genes that give          rise to processed  nucleotide RNAs Figure  Table                    The expression profiles of computationally identifed          miRNAs during development were much more heterogenous          than those of the known set of embryonically derived          miRNAs     We identified miRNAs whose expression was          highly restricted to individual developmental periods          embryogenesis larvalpupal development or adulthood          ones expressed in two of these developmental windows and          ones expressed throughout development either at a          relatively uniform level or in a progressive fashion          Selected hybridizations that illustrate the different          temporal and quantitative profiles are shown in Figure          and the collected northern data are summarized in Table           We also note that these experimentally verified miRNAs          vary tremendously in abundance with several being two to          three orders of magnitude less abundant than miRNAs          discovered by direct cloning Other undetected miRNAs          orthologous to ones cloned in other species that is          miR and miR Table  may be present at even          lower levels This suggests that their identification by          sequencing miRNA cDNA libraries would have been          unlikely          In total we observed expression for  out of            candidate genes that were conserved outside           Drosophila and  out of   of          highscoring           Drosophila specific predictions          Figure b Two of the former class were lowscoring          candidates that were nonetheless conserved in           Anopheles miR and miR          indicating that thirdspecies conservation is in our          hands a very strong indicator of a candidate genes          validity Table lists           bona fide Drosophila miRNAs that          scored in the top  grouped as members of the          reference set followed by newly identified miRNAs that          fulfill accepted criteria for miRNA biogenesis that is          ones whose expression was confirmed here by northern blot          andor are homologous to miRNAs cloned in other species          each subset is rankordered by miRseeker score The          highscoring thirdspeciesconserved candidates whose          expression is unverified at present either untested or          negative by northern blot are listed separately they          are provisionally referred to by their nucleotide          position along the chromosome arm that is R          We note that while this work was in preparation forward          genetic analysis of           bantam demonstrated that it encodes          a miRNA    that was identified as a highscoring          candidate by miRseeker In addition a subset of the          newly identified miRNAs miR miR miR miRa          miRb miR and miRa were independently found          by homology search or by informatic means and confirmed          by northern analysis while this work was under review                        Conservation alone is an insufficient criterion for          assessing the validity of a miRNA     Indeed one          highscoring candidate number  L that is          strongly conserved in           Anopheles and was identified by          miRseeker appears to be an unannotated U snRNA              Nevertheless our high success rate  leads us to          believe that failure to observe expression of a          highscoring thirdspeciesconserved miRseeker candidate          could reflect a falsenegative result As an example we          show alignments and RNA folds of the four insect          orthologs of R which all adopt canonical          highscoring stemloop structures and collectively          display patterns of nucleotide divergence characteristic          of genuine miRNAs preponderance of divergence within the          loop slightly less divergence along a nonconserved arm          and perfect conservation of a putative miRNAencoding          arm Figure  Although in this case evidence for          expression of either strand by northern analysis was not          obtained it was subsequently found to be orthologous to          miR and thus accepted as a genuine miRNA We          hypothesize that other novel highscoring candidates          with a similar level of thirdspeciesconservation but          which lack evidence of expression may in fact be genuine          thus implying up to   falsenegative rate of          northern analysis          Together these data allow us to estimate the number          of           Drosophila miRNA genes In the          first  candidates there are  members of the          reference set and  novel miRNAs that meet accepted          criteria for representing genuine miRNAs Of the          remaining candidates around  may be genuine although          this rises to a maximum of approximately  if one          considers the inferred falsenegative rate of northern          analysis Thus there may be between    to             to  additional miRNAs in this list of unverified          andor untested candidates Therefore we estimate           miRNAs  reference   novel verified genes            additional unverified candidates at a cutoff that          includes   members of the reference set          allowing us to extrapolate that drosophilid genomes may          contain  or around  miRNA genes This suggests          that nearly  of           Drosophila genes are miRNAs a          figure that is in relative accord with the percentage          recently ascribed to vertebrate genomes                              miRNA genes clusters and paralogs          A subset of miRNA genes are known to reside in local          genomic clusters with possible operonlike organization          The largest cluster of miRNA genes in           Drosophila includes six that were          previously identified as the           mir  mir cluster     We          identified two additional conserved stemloop structures          that flank           mir Figure a one of which            mir  was confirmed by northern          blot Figure a Surprisingly           mir is the only member of this          sevenmiRNA cluster that is conserved in           Anopheles  indicating tremendous          flux in the miRNA content of this region even within the          Diptera We also observed that miR is related at its           end to another experimentally verified miRNA miR          Figure h suggesting that they may have related          functions          The volatility of miRNA genes is further indicated by          members of the miRmiR K box subfamily              Seven members were previously reported that are scattered          in four genomic locations on three different chromosome          arms including a cluster of three           mir genes on L and a cluster of          two           mir genes on R we also          identified an additional paralog of           mir            mirc  that is located in the           mir cluster Unexpectedly the           Anopheles genome contains only four          members of this subfamily and all are located in a          single cluster on L Figure b the same four members          were identifiable in the unassembled genomic sequence of           Apis     The simplest scenario          is that members of the K boxfamily have undergone          radical duplication and dispersal about the genome in           Drosophila  This is consistent          with the finding that the remaining members of the Kbox          family     including           mir  the three           mir paralogs and the          Kboxantisense gene           mir  are similarly absent from          both           Anopheles and           Apis  However one new putative          member of the Kbox family R was identified by          miRseeker and it has been conserved in all four          sequenced insect genomes          Another notable cluster that includes previously          identified miRNAs is one containing           mir            let and           mir Figure c miR is an          apparent homolog of           C elegans lin     which          functions with let to regulate developmental timing in          nematodes Although complementary sites for both miRNAs          are found in the  UTRs of several putative nematode          targets these miRNAs are not physically linked in the           C elegans genome and their mutant          phenotypes are principally due to misregulation of          different transcripts        The function of these          miRNAs has not yet been explicitly demonstrated in other          species but           Drosophila let is regulated at          the larvalpupal transition by ecdysone     and all          three members of this cluster are present in other          insects and in vertebrates thus implying broadly          conserved functions Their existence in a gene cluster in                    Drosophila and           Anopheles data not shown may          imply that their functions overlap to a greater extent in          insects than in nematodes This could explain why          individual let or miR mutants with strong          developmental defects have not yet been identified in           Drosophila by genetic means Our          observation that the temporal expression profile of          miR Figure d is similar to that described for          let and miR that is expression is initiated          during larvalpupal development and continues through          adulthood      is consistent with probable          coordinate expression of all three as a single primiRNA          transcript and may further implicate miR in          developmental timing While this work was under review          the clustering of miR let and miR was          independently reported these researchers also provide          evidence for coordinate expression of these miRNAs as a          single primiRNA               The characteristics of miR are highly unusual and          thus serve as a useful caution First although miRseeker          correctly identified it as a highscoring conserved          stemloop the incorrect strand was identified as its          nontranscribed strand adopts greater helical structure          than does its transcribed strand Second it is the only          confirmed           Drosophila miRNA that deviates from          the expected pattern of divergence in two fundamental          ways it not only contains a mismatch on the arm while          maintaining a perfectly conserved loop and thus failed          the conservation filter as a class  candidate but the          mismatch actually resides within the mature miRNA          sequence itself Therefore the identification of miR          in flies relied upon its conservation in other          species          We identified several additional examples of closely          linked miRNAs that are transcribed from the same strand          Figure d These include clusters containing paralogous          miRNA genes such as           mira and           mirb  others that contain          unrelated genes            mirmir            mirmir and           mirL clusters and          some that are a mixture of both            mir cluster Unexpectedly we          did not find that clusters of paralogous miRNA genes were          more prevalent as might have been predicted           a priori if gene clusters generally          result from local gene duplications This is apparently          corroborated by the identification of several miRNA          clusters whose processed products derive from opposing          arms of their respective precursors Figure                A second curious observation is that relatively few           Drosophila miRNAs are members of          paralogous gene sets irrespective of whether they are          physically linked or not In fact we identified only          four new examples            miRa            b            miRa            b            miRa            b and           miRa            b  to add to the previously          described sets of           miR and           miR            miR genes This contrasts with          observations of miRNAs in vertebrates where the majority          of known miRNAs are members of paralogous gene sets              The most extreme examples of this disparity are           let and           mir  which are present in          single copies in           Drosophila  but are represented by          thirteen and six distinct human homologs          respectively                            Discussion                  Drosophilid genomes contain around  microRNA          genes          Although the first two miRNA genes were identified          through forward genetics the vast majority of known          miRNAs were identified by direct cloning of mature           nucleotide RNAs either from sizeselected total RNA or          from purified miRNP complexes The direct cloning method          has the distinct advantages of being expression based and          aimed at identifying the processed miRNA that is          presumably the active regulatory species While it is          clear that cloning efforts in some organisms have been          far from saturating work in other organisms mammals          suggests that efforts of this sort will give sharply          diminishing returns In any case it is likely that many          miRNAs will not be amenable to direct cloning including          those that are present at very low levels be they poorly          expressed highly unstable inefficiently processed or          expressed by small numbers of cells or whose expression          is otherwise restricted to times andor locations for          which the isolation of sufficient amounts of RNA for          cloning is impractical          In theory a computational approach based on the          structural features of known miRNA genes might permit the          unbiased discovery of the remaining complement of miRNA          genes in a given sequenced genome However in one test          around  of randomly selected           C elegans genomic sequences were          found to have the capacity to fold into plausible miRNA          precursor hairpins     This suggests that          computational prediction of miRNAs based on presumed          structure alone would have an unacceptably high          falsepositive rate This type of approach might be          strongly aided by comparative genomics whereby one          confined the analysis to genomic regions subject to both          evolutionary and structural constraint The proof of          principle behind this dual scheme was demonstrated by the          identification of several miRNAs via a structural          analysis of genomic sequence conserved over  million          years of nematode evolution     Indeed the great          majority of           C elegans miRNAs identified          through the direct cloning approach are conserved in the          genome of           C briggsae  with conservation          typically extending across the length of the predicted          miRNA precursor          In this study we describe miRseeker a computational          approach for the identification of           Drosophila miRNA genes that ranks          conserved stemloop structures and assesses their pattern          of nucleotide divergence miRseeker successfully          identified nearly all of the known           Drosophila miRNA genes and a          strong majority of novel highscoring candidates were          verified by northern analysis In total we catalogued           newly verified miRNAs  of which were confirmed here by          northern blot bringing the current           Drosophila tally to  Our data          allows us to estimate the presence of around  miRNA          genes in           Drosophila  The approach used in          this study should be applicable to the analysis of other          sets of sequenced genomes of related higher eukaryotic          model organisms While this manuscript was in preparation          and in submission several other computational          predictions of miRNA genes by similar overall strategies          were reported        The results of our          studies are most similar to analyses by Bartel and          colleagues predicting  miRNA genes in vertebrates          or nearly  of the predicted genes in humans              this is comparable to our estimate of flies          A unique aspect of miRseeker amongst the recently          described methodologies is its assessment of the pattern          of nucleotide divergence within miRNA precursors The          existence of this pattern which is reflected by initial          divergence within loop sequence was unexpected Two          conclusions may be drawn from this phenomenon First the          loop appears to be the least critical feature of a          premiRNA an observation supported by the identification          of orthologous insect miRNAs that vary quite          significantly in terms of both loop size and sequence          data not shown Second there appears to be measurable          selective pressure on the sequence of the nonmiRNA arm          above and beyond the necessity to maintain a certain          degree of helical structure that would make it a Dicer          substrate This is perhaps at odds with the nonspecific          activity of Dicer which efficiently processes virtually          every input dsRNA ever tested in RNAi assays It may be          the case that specific sequence requirements become          greater when processing imperfect stemloops          characteristic of premiRNA or alternatively that the          nonmiRNAencoding product may in fact have some          previously unappreciated function Nonetheless it is          clear that the selective pressure on the          nonmiRNAencoding arm is mild and that it diverges long          before the sequence of the mature miRNA does          It is worth noting that the fraction of miRNAs          conserved between mammals and fish which are around           million years diverged appears to be significantly          higher than the fraction of miRNAs that are conserved          between flies and mosquitoes which are separated by only           million years of evolution this paper and              This indicates that insect miRNAs evolve much more          rapidly than do vertebrate miRNAs This is in general          agreement with analyses of orthologous protein pairs          which showed that dipteran pairs had a higher rate of          divergence than did fishhuman pairs     Since it          may be argued that the selective environmental pressures          are more different between these sequenced vertebrates          it may be that the relatively high rate of divergence in          Diptera is a consequence of their shorter generation          times                          Of false negatives and false positives          In these heady times of miRNA gene discovery it is          prudent to exercise caution in designating predicted          genes as           bona fide  just because they          resemble known miRNA genes     At the same time          while many thousands of annotated proteincoding genes          are not associated with cDNA clones or other evidence of          expression computational methods of their identification          are robust enough for them to be considered real genes          until proven otherwise It is our hope that refinement of          miRNA prediction algorithms may further reduce the          falsepositive rate and elevate confidence in their          output to a comparable level Consideration of nucleotide          bias at the  end of miRNA including a propensity to          begin with U may improve predictions     although          we stress that our algorithms were designed to predict          premiRNA genes and not mature miRNA sequences          themselves The extent of the precisely conserved arm          thus including a potential miRNA was in most cases          longer than the mature product and it would have been          arbitrary to select a candidate miRNA sequence just so          that it began with a U Notably a recent study suggests          that different chemical strategies for capturing miRNA          molecules may differentially recover miRNAs according to          their  ends     so reevaluation of miRNA  bias          may be in order Incorporation of promoter evidence in          gene models may also help given recent speculation that          miRNA genes may be transcribed by RNA polymerase II Our          confidence in the highscoring           Drosophila specific candidates          most of which we did not test in this study will also          undoubtedly be bolstered by their conservation in the          genomes of additional species of           Drosophila  We eagerly await the          initiation of these sequencing projects          Potential false negatives fall into several classes          First our search was based on the currently sequenced          and alignable portions of the           D melanogaster and           D pseudoobscura genomes As          mentioned earlier one of the  reference miRNAs          miR did not reside in an aligned region even though          it was readily identified in available           D pseudoobscura sequence by BLAST          query Next as our strategy relies upon conservation of          primary sequence we will have missed exceptionally          divergent miRNAs including class  candidates          Comparisons with           Anopheles demonstrate that dipteran          miRNA genes evolve rapidly and although none of the          reference set is absent from           D pseudoobscura  there may be          examples that are specific to individual drosophilid          species The recent discovery of a large class of tiny          noncoding RNA genes tncRNAs that share some features          with miRNAs provides a precedent for exceptionally          rapidly evolving small RNA genes tncRNAs are not even          conserved within           Caenorhabditis     We also          masked exons from the search so we will have excluded          any miRNAs that might be processed from spliced mRNA          including untranslated regions Finally we will have          missed those miRNAs that proceed through precursor          transcripts of unusual structure Although most known          premiRNAs in           Drosophila            Caenorhabditis  mice and humans          form relatively canonical stemloops of around  to           nucleotides in length plant miRNA precursors are often          processed through exceptionally long stemloops many           nucleotides or longer       miR is a member          of the           Drosophila reference set that          received a low score by our informatic procedure          possibly because it may derive from an unusually long          stemloop  nucleotides only a portion of which was          included in the queried window In addition other plant          miRNAs may proceed through precursors of noncanonical          structure such as multiple stemloops or stemloops of          poor quality     The existence of these types of          premiRNAs in metazoans is unknown at present          Despite these potential sources of error the robust          ability of miRseeker to identify genuine miRNAs is          clearly indicated by its ability to identify most of the          previously known           Drosophila miRNAs as very          highscoring candidates and by our experimental          validation of a very large number of newly identified          candidate miRNA genes                          Prospects          Perhaps the most outstanding current challenge          regarding miRNAs lies in determining their regulatory          targets It is presumed that most of them will form RNA          duplexes with complementary sequences in mRNA but direct          regulatory relationships are known for only a handful of          miRNAs Although many miRNAs in plants were found to be          nearly or completely complementary to known or putative          target mRNAs      the few cases of known or          presumed animal miRNA targets involve imperfect and          limited homology Indeed searches for complements to          miRNAs in animal genomes to date have not succeeded in          detecting matches more compelling than those identified          in random sequence Thus matching miRNAs to their          cognate targets           in silico presents a daunting          task          The  ends of a large subset of experimentally          derived           Drosophila miRNAs were recently          observed to be perfectly complementary to Brd boxes K          boxes and GY boxes a set of  UTR sequence motifs          involved in posttranscriptional regulation                 This suggests that at least in           Drosophila  a subset of relevant          miRNA targets might be found by searching for complements          to the most  nucleotides of miRNAs in  UTRs          This procedure certainly produces many candidate          regulatory pairs I Holmes and ECL unpublished          observations but so many matches are found that it is          difficult to single out individual cases as being more          likely to be genuine          Comparative genomic analyses of orthologous          drosophilid genes should aid in this endeavor as          evidenced by the recent demonstration that several          conserved motifs in the  UTR of the proapoptotic gene           hid are targets of the miRNA bantam              Statistically significant pairings of conserved          andor overrepresented  UTR motifs can be assessed for          complementarity to miRNAs Comparisons with           Anopheles orthologs may also prove          useful in this regard For example as is the case for          their drosophilid counterparts           Anopheles transcripts for two types          of           Enhancer of split genes basic          helixloophelix repressor and Brdfamily contain Brd K          and GY box motifs in their  UTRs ECL unpublished          observations We anticipate that other examples of          sequence motifs that are conserved in orthologs of the          three dipterans and that are strongly complementary to          miRNAs will be prime candidates to test as new examples          of miRNAmediated posttranscriptional gene          regulation                            Materials and methods                  Genome analysis          We used the following genomic sequences and analyses          in this work           D melanogaster Release  sequence          Berkeley Drosophila

pipeline                      Extraction of conserved            Drosophilasequences            Release  of the             D melanogaster genome    was            divided into  contigs of  nucleotides each            with  nucleotides of overlap at either end These            contigs were aligned to the first assembly of the             D pseudoobscura euchromatic            sequence    by running  parallel AVID jobs on            the Linux cluster Aligned sequences with the following            Release  annotations    were eliminated exons            transposable elements snRNA snoRNA tRNA and rRNA            genes Conserved miRNA candidate regions were extracted            from the aligned nongenic drosophilid sequence as            follows A unit window where a unit is either an            aligned or a gapped nucleotide was advanced across the            AVID alignment files by single units Once a window            that satisfied minimal conservation criteria  gaps            and  mismatches was identified the corresponding             Dm and             Dp sequences regions were            stored as a multiple fasta file The window was then            advanced by  units and reassessed The window            continued to advance by  units until it no longer            satisfied our criteria for conservation at which point            it was advanced by single units until the next            conserved region was identified Around             conserved regions were identified in this way            The forward and reverse complement sequences of the            regions were loaded into a MySQL database If two             D melanogaster regions initiated            within less than  nucleotides of each other they            were grouped into a superregion reiterated grouping            sorted the  regions into  distinct            superregions                                RNA folding and scoring of conserved            stemloops            All             Dm regions were folded with mfold             by submitting parallel batches of  mfolds to the            cluster nodes and copying the det and out mfold            output files to a final storage destination All mfold            outputs were parsed and information about the number            of structures number of arms per structure size of            helices within arms and size and symmetry of the            internal loops within arms was loaded into the MySQL            database            Two parameters for each individual arm in each            output structure were evaluated free energy G            kcalmol and miRNAlike helicity Helicity was            calculated by awarding  for each paired nucleotide             for each onenucleotide symmetric loop and  for            each twonucleotide symmetric loop A progressively            increasing penalty was applied for symmetric loops            greater than three nucleotides as well as for all            bulged nucleotides and asymmetrically sized loops as            these are more rarely observed in genuine miRNAs An            overall score was calculated as helical score             ABSG For each superregion a single region            that includes the highest scoring arm was flagged            All steps outlined above in the subsection above            were repeated for regions contained within             Dp superregions corresponding to            the top              Dm superregions The average            score of each corresponding             Dm and             Dp region termed a regionpair            was determined and the highestscoring regionpair in            each superregion was flagged as its best candidate            miRNA            Representative regions were then rankordered by            average             DmDp score The             D melanogaster sequences from            the top  of             DmDp regions were blasted            against the             Anopheles genome The top three             Anopheles blast hits were            subjected to the steps outlined in the previous            subsection and the bestscoring structure was            determined and linked to rankordered             DmDp regions In most cases            either no             Anopheles blast hit or            nonhomologous sequence was returned The blast hit was            determined to be homologous if it folded into a similar            structure as the drosophilid sequences and one or both            helical arms were highly conserved these candidates            are flagged orange on the web output                                Evaluation of the divergence pattern in conserved            stemloops            The alignment of             DmDp sequences was processed to            distinguish loop regions colored blue on the web            output and arm regions colored red on the web            output Since mfold tends to insert small helices            within terminal loops that falsely reduce the size of            the terminal loop small terminal loops   or             nucleotides in length were extended to seven            nucleotides Potential miRNAencoding arms were then            identified as perfectly matched blocks of sequence more            than  nucleotides long and less than  nucleotides            from the end of either side of the terminal loop            colored yellow on the web output If no such sequence            was found the region was eliminated If both arms            contained potential miRNA sequences the region passed            and it was considered a miRNA candidate colored green            on the web output If only one potential            miRNAencoding arm was identified then the other arm            was defined as the nonmiRNAencoding arm The terminus            of the potential miRNAencoding arm was provisionally            defined as the end of the perfectly conserved sequence            and the nonmiRNAencoding arm was trimmed to an equal            helical length The number of mismatched and gapped            nucleotides in the loop region and in the            nonmiRNAencoding arm was evaluated Candidates with            only a single candidate miRNAencoding arm were            disqualified if they did not diverge in the loop or the            number of mismatches in the nonmiRNAencoding arm was            four or more mismatches greater than the number of            mismatches within the loop The candidates that pass            the conservation filter are colored green on the web            report The first  candidates produced by miRseeker            along with information on structures scores            alignments and genomic locations are accessible via            the web                                        miRseeker public interface          For the genomewide search several steps of the          pipeline that do not require interaction with the          database were run in parallel on the Linux cluster          including AVID alignments extraction of conserved          regions and mfolds and represent a significant amount          of computational time To allow public access to          miRseeker we developed a scaleddown version of our          computational pipeline     It allows a user to input          two sets of homologous sequences up to  kb from any          two species along with gene annotation for one of them          and performs all the steps of the miRNAfinding procedure          described above producing a list of miRNA candidates          ordered by score A cutoff score that reliably          distinguishes genuine miRNAs will differ with sequences          from different input genomes Our experience with          drosophilid genomes suggests that a cutoff of           produces genuine candidates but also a high fraction of          probable false negatives whereas a cutoff of           defines candidates of much higher overall quality We          stress that the conservation consideration described          above applies only to appropriately related species such          as           DmDp  and should not be          indiscriminately used to filter miRNA candidates derived          from comparative analysis of other species The miRseeker          public interface currently supports only a single
