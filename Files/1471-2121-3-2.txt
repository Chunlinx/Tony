                    Background        The precursor of heparinbinding EGFlike growth factor        proHBEGF is found on a wide variety of cell surfaces and        is present in numerous tissue types     Previously in        our laboratory we cloned the cDNA encoding proHBEGF from        monkey Vero cells and identified this cellsurface molecule        as a receptor for diphtheria toxin DT     The        predicted amino acid sequence was shown to be identical to        that of the cell surfaceexpressed precursor of human        heparinbinding EGFlike growth factor proHBEGF             The derived amino acid sequence revealed a signal        sequence residues  an extracellular domain residues         a transmembrane domain residues  and a        carboxyl terminal cytoplasmic domain residues             Proteolytic processing of the proHBEGF occurs on the        cell surface and results in the release of mature HBEGF        mHBEGF residues      The maturesoluble        HBEGF is a member of the EGF family of growth factors that        includes amphiregulin epidermal growth factor and        transforming growth factor a     Mature HBEGF released        from the cell surface is mitogenic and is able to bind to        the EGF receptor     Membranebound proHBEGF has        juxtacrine growth factor activity    and also acts as a        DT receptor             Previously we have described the interaction of the        extracellular domain of proHBEGF with the second        extracellular domain of the tetraspanin protein monkey CD            Tissue culture experiments using DTsensitive        transfected mouse fibroblast cell lines expressing on the        cell surface both the monkey DT receptor and chimeric        mousemonkey CD antigen showed that the second        extracellular domain of monkey CD antigen is able to act        as a coreceptor for DT and is also responsible for the        increased DTsensitivity and affinity for DT in these cell        lines     These observations suggested that the CD        antigen and proHBEGF likely interact physically on the        cell surface Using a yeast twohybrid system we have        shown that the extracellular domain of proHBEGF and the        second extracellular domain of monkey CD do indeed        interact            The yeast twohybrid system strategy has been used to        examine both intracellular and receptorligand        proteinprotein interactions The interaction of mammalian        growth hormone prolactin and vascular endothelial growth        factor with their respective extracellular ligandbinding        proteins have been observed using yeast twohybrid sytems                      The involvement of HBEGF in various cellular and tissue        functions and its presence in extracellular matrices        suggested the possibility that it may interact with other        extracellular matrix proteins To test this possiblity we        used the extracellular domain of proHBEGF in a yeast        twohybrid system to screen a monkey kidney cDNA library        In the present report we have identified two novel        extracellular matrix proteins latent transforming growth        factor binding protein  and fibulinC that interact        with the extracellular domain of proHBEGF                    Results and Discussion                  Yeast twohybrid screening of the monkey cDNA          library using the extracellular domain of proHBEGF as          the bait fusion          The initial screening of     clones of the          monkey cDNA library with the bait fusion of GAL binding          domain fused to the extracellular domain of proHBEGF          yielded  colonies that were able to grow on Trp His          Leu media and that gave positive galactosidase          activity in the galactosidase filter paper assay False          positives were ruled out by testing the galactosidase          activity of the library clone alone or the library clone          and the GAL DNA binding domain plasmid vector together          in the yeast host strain False positives were also ruled          out by testing the galactosidase activity of the          library clone with pVA pGBT with a cloned insert The          elimination of these false positive colonies from the          initial screening of the cDNA library resulted in a total          of  colonies whose library clones encoded potentially          true interacting proteins with the extracellular domain          of proHBEGF Some of these cDNA library clones were          transformed into the other yeast host strain Y and          tested for galactosidase activity as a further check          that these clones did indeed contain potential          proteininteracting partners for the extracellular domain          of proHBEGF                          Detection of the physical interactions of proHBEGF          with CD antigens          The membranebound precursor and soluble forms of          heparinbinding epidermal growth factorlike growth          factor HBEGF contribute to a variety of cellular          developmental processes     The observations of          HBEGF in cell and tissue types have suggested roles for          HBEGF in numerous cellular and tissue events such as          cell movement extracellular matrix formation tumor          formation and cell adherence     As described above          the membranebound precursor of HBEGF proHBEGF is          also the cellsurface receptor for diphtheria toxin DT          in DTsensitive cells              Previously we have examined the proteinprotein          interactions of proHBEGF with the cellsurface CD          antigen     The CD antigen is found on a wide          variety of tissue and cell types and has been reported to          be involved in such cellular processes as Bcell          development cell metastasis platelet activation and          adhesion and cell motility      CD antigen is a          member of the tetraspanin superfamily and consists of two          extracellular domains sandwiched between four          highlyconserved hydrophobic transmembrane domains               The second extracellular domain  amino          acids is larger than the first extracellular domain           amino acids Short cytoplasmic domains           amino acids are found at both the amino and carboxyl          termini of CD     As reported previously we used a          yeast twohybrid system and observed interaction between          the second extracellular domain of MkCD and the          extracellular domain of proHBEGF     However          despite repeated attempts using the yeast twohybrid          system we were unable to show interaction between the          amino terminal cytoplasmic domain of monkey CD and the          cytoplasmic domain of proHBEGF these results may          reflect the limitation of the yeast twohybrid system as          the insert sizes cloned into the vectors may be too small          resulting in Gal fusion proteins whose test subunits          are masked by the Gal subunit This would result in the          fusion proteins being unable to recognize each other          The results of screening the monkey cv cDNA library          with the bait plasmid pGBTDTREx were somewhat          surprising in that no portions of the CD protein were          represented among the proteins found to interact with the          extracellular domain of proHBEGF These results may          reflect improper folding of CD protein fragments encoded          by cDNA inserts or these results may be due to under          representation of the CD cDNA in the monkey cv cDNA          library It was also surprising that the extracellular          portion of any of the EGF receptor proteins was also not          represented among the proteins found to interact with the          extracellular domain of proHBEGF since the mature          protein proteolytically cleaved from proHBEGF mHBEGF          as well as the membrane bound form are known to interact          with the EGF receptor                          The extracellular domain of proHBEGF interacts          with monkey LTBP          The positive interaction of the fragment of the latent          transforming growth factor binding protein LTBP          with the extracellular domain of proHBEGF was of great          interest Additional file  Recently it has been          reported that treatment of EGFresponsive nontransformed          rat intestinal crypt cell line RIE cells with TGF          resulted in an increased level of expression of HBEGF              LTBP is a protein that is ubiquitous in tissues          and cells Human LTBP Fig  and mouse LTBP contain           and  amino acids respectively and each protein          has five structural domains Each has a signal sequence           amino acids and  respectively a second domain          containing an EGFlike repeat a prolineglycine rich          region a fibrillin motif     an EGF calciumbinding          repeat and a TGF repeat  and  amino acids          respectively a third domain containing a          prolineglycine rich region  and  amino acids          respectively a fourth domain containing numerous          calciumbinding type II EGFlike modules          DNIVDNEDC             and  amino acids          respectively and a fifth carboxylterminal domain  and           amino acids respectively human LTBP information          was obtained from the GenBank database accession no          AF     Colony hybridization experiments          using the LTBP probe see materials and methods and          the monkey cv cDNA library yielded a set of six two          identical overlapping clones Fig  The amino acid          sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence obtained          for the monkey LTBP sequence GenBank accession number          AF shows it to share   identity with the          human LTBP amino acid sequence GenBank accession          number NP and   identity with the mouse          LTBP amino acid sequence GenBank accession number          NP          The presence of the calciumbinding EGFlike modules          in monkey LTBP is noteworthy It is well established          that EGFlike modules are important structural features          found in many extracellular proteins and that these          modules enable numerous protein protein interactions          the binding of EGFlike modules in laminin to nidogen             and the interaction of EGFlike modules within          fibrillin monomers      Calcium may be required          for some of these protein interactions          At the time of writing there have not been any          reported interactions of these EGFlike modules in LTBP          proteins with specific proteins It is interesting that          the combination of colony hybridization and yeast          twohybrid screens used in this study to identify          proteins that interact with the extracellular domain of          proHBEGF yielded independent GALLTBP fusion proteins          that all contained these calciumbinding type II EGFlike          domains Fig  A constructed clone pGADLTBP          EGF that contained calciumbinding type EGFlike          modules  fused to the GALactivation domain see          Fig and materials and methods was tested using the          yeast twohybrid system and found to interact with the          extracellular domain of proHBEGF Additional file           These negativelycharged EGFlike modules of LTBP may          interact efficiently with the positivelycharged          heparinbinding domain of both the membranebound and          soluble forms of HBEGF The amino acid sequence of the          heparinbinding region of HBEGF           KRKKKGKGLGKKRDPCLRKYK     has been shown to have          a strong affinity for heparin and may influence the          interaction of this growth factor with cellsurface          negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans              It remains to be seen whether specificall of the          EGFlike modules are required and whether calcium is          needed for the interaction of HBEGF with LTBP          The LTBP protein is secreted as a soluble protein          from the cell surface into the extracellular matrix Two          of the proposed functions of LTBP proteins include          protecting TGF from premature proteolytic cleavage and          targeting TGF to its appropriate cellsurface receptor          During cellular synthesis of TGF a small latent          complex containing the latencyassociated peptide and the          mature TGF is synthesized This small latent complex          may be secreted inefficiently from the cell surface at          relatively slow rates     However when the small          latent complex is bound by the latent transforming growth          factor binding protein via a disulfide bond to the          latencyassociated peptide the result is the formation          of a large latent complex which may be secreted          efficiently and at a relatively high rate compared to the          small latent complex     Latent TGF is then          released from the extracellular matrix via proteolytic          cleavage from the large latent complex and the resulting          active TGF is now able to bind to the appropriate TGF          cellsurface receptors              It is well accepted that TGF is important for the          regulation of extracellular matrix synthesis and          degradation The presence of TGF increases the          expression of such extracellular matrix proteins as          fibronectin the fibronectin receptor vitronectin          tenascin elastin thrombospondin collagen and biglycan                    and also inhibits expression          of proteases that degrade the extracellular matrix while          stimulating the expression of protease inhibitors                          It is interesting to note that although Bulus and          Barnard    showed that TGF treatment of RE cells          resulted in increased level of HBEGF expression they          did not report any direct physical interactions between          the growth factors TGF and HBEGF It may be that          LTBP provides a physical link between soluble mHBEGF          and TGF Possible functions for the apparent          interaction of mHBEGF with LTBP include the targeting          of the TGF within its protective large latent complex          to its appropriate TGF cellsurface receptor or the          targeting of the TGF large latent complex to the EGF          receptor via binding of mHBEGF to the appropriate EGF          receptor These are reasonable functions for the role of          the proposed mHBEGF LTBP proteinprotein interactions          as the expression of both mHBEGF and TGF is important          during extracellular matrix formation in wound healing               it has been suggested that the coordinated          activities of HBEGF and TGF regulate the wound healing          process                              The extracellular domain of proHBEGF interacts          with monkey fibulin C          The extracellular domain of proHBEGF interacts with          monkey fibulinC Additional file  Fibulin is a          calciumbinding extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is          associated with various connective tissues basement          membranes and blood       Splicing of the C          terminal domain of fibulin can lead to the expression          of different variants of fibulin AD     The          amino acid sequence of the human fibulinC protein          encodes five domains a

     amino acid residues and a carboxyl domain           amino acid residues     The amino acid sequence          derived from the nucleotide sequence obtained for monkey          fibulinC GenBank accession number AF shows it          to share   identity with the amino acid sequence for          human fibulinC GenBank accession number          NP          The EGFlike modules found in fibulin are          instrumental in a variety of extracellular          proteinprotein interactions Fibulin has been reported          to interact with such extracellular matrix proteins as          fibronectin laminin nidogen aggrecan and versican                 Fibronectin is a glycoprotein found as          multimers in insoluble form in the extracellular matrix          Fibronectin contains three types of homology sequences          IIII type I sequences bind heparin           Staphylococcus aureus fibrin and          cell surfaces type II sequences bind collagen and          gelatin and type III sequences bind DNA cell surfaces          heparin and fibulin      Fibulin interacts          with fibronectin through a heparinbinding region in type          III            repeat the binding of fibulin to          this site is independent of the binding of heparin as          addition of exogenous heparin does not inhibit fibulin          binding to fibronectin     The fibronectinbinding          site in fibulin is located in EGFlike modules  and               the binding of fibulin to fibronectin is a          heterotypic interaction in which an EGFlike module binds          to a non EGFlike domain the type III            fibronectin repeat              Laminin is a glycoprotein composed of three chains A          B and B in a crossshaped molecule this protein is          found in basement membranes where it interacts with other          such components as collagen IV heparansulfate          proteoglycan and nidogen     Laminin contains          EGFlike modules in the aminoterminal region of the A          B and B chains     Surprisingly these modules do          not appear to be involved in the binding of fibulin          The site of fibulin binding to laminin maps to the          carboxylterminal segment of the laminin A chain which          consists of five basic tandem repeats containing          conserved glycine and cysteine residues      The          binding site of laminin to fibulin maps to the          calciumbinding type II EGFlike modules of fibulin                       Nidogen is a basement membrane protein composed of          three globular domains GG and two linking sequences          domain G is joined to domain G through a flexible link          and domain G is connected to domain G by a rodlike          element consisting of EGFlike modules     Nidogen          is an important structural component of tertiary          complexes with other such extracellular components as          laminins collagen IV perlecan and fibulins              FibulinC binds to nidogen through domain G of nidogen              The nidogen binding site of fibulinC includes          the type II EGFlike modules  and the          carboxylterminal domain              Aggrecan and versican are aggregating proteoglycans          that are key constituents found in the extracellular          matrix     Both proteoglycans contain aminoterminal          hyaluronic acidbinding regions central core          glycosaminoglycan attachment domains and          carboxylterminal domains containing EGFlike modules          one in aggrecan and two in versican Ctype lectin like          modules and complement regulatory proteinlike modules               Fibulin exhibits calciumdependent binding to          the carboxylterminal domain of aggrecan and versican              The binding site of aggrecan to fibulin maps to          the type II EGFlike modules  and the          carboxylterminal domain of fibulin     The          binding site of versican to fibulin maps to the type II          EGFlike modules  of fibulin              Fibulin has been reported two exhibit          calciumdependent selfassociation      The two          selfassociation sites map to type II EGFlike modules           and  and to a cryptic site in the aminoterminal region          of fibulin               As described above the calciumbinding type II          EGFlike modules of fibulin are used in various          extracellular matrix interactions It is noteworthy that          these modules may interact with other EGFlike modules or          with non EGFlike modules          The yeast twohybrid system and colony hybridization          screens used in this study indicated that a monkey cDNA          clone Fig  containing half of the anaphylatoxin type          I repeats an EGFadjoining sequence calciumbinding          EGFlike modules and a carboxylterminal fibulintype          module demonstrated interaction with the extracellular          domain of proHBEGF Additional file  To see if the          anyall of the calciumbinding EGFlike modules were          necessary for this interaction two clones were          constructed A clone pGADFibC EGF COOH that          contained calciumbinding type EGFlike modules  and          the carboxylterminus of fibulinC fused to the          GALactivation domain see Fig and materials and          methods was tested using the yeast twohybrid system and          found to interact with the extracellular domain of          proHBEGF Table  In constrast the construct          pGADFibC EGF that contained calciumbinding          type II EGFlike modules  fused to the GAL          activation domain see Fig and materials and methods          did not interact with proHBEGF Additional file  It          remains to be determined which of the regions within the          EGFlike modules  eg hydroxylation and          glycosylation sites and the carboxylterminus of          fibulinC are necessary for the interaction with          proHBEGF The interaction of fibulinC may map to the          heparinbinding region of the extracellular domain of          proHBEGF or it may map to the EGFlike module of          proHBEGF or it may map to both of these regions within          proHBEGF To test whether the fibulinC interaction          with proHBEGF maps to the heparinbinding region a          construct pGBTprodelHBEGF containing amino acid          residues Asp His the entire EGF like region of          proHBEGF and  out of  residues of the

shown Caution must          be used with this result however as the size of the          cloned prodelHBEGF region is small encoding just           amino acids this may have resulted in a Gal fusion          protein in which the EGF epitopes in prodelHBEGF are          hidden by the Gal subunit and thus not recognized by the          GAL fusion partner protein GALFiblC EGF          COOH

fibronectincontaining          matrix fibers      Although a distinct function          for fibulin has not yet been described it is          conceivable that fibulin is important for cell adhesion          and migration along protein fibers within the          extracellular matrix Fibulin may serve to anchor the          mHBEGF to its fibers as it migrates through the          extracellular matrix As explained above mHBEGF has          been reported to be involved as a structural protein in          such tissue developmental processes as wound healing and          it is feasible that the direct physical association of          mHBEGF with fibulin may be useful in the tissue          remodeling of a wound site and in scar formation          The results presented in this paper now suggest that          there is potential in carrying out experiments to further          delineate the molecular interactions between proHBEGF          and LTBP and between proHBEGF and fibulinC A          transitional step in this process will be the expression          and purification of these proteins In order to rule out          false positives that may have resulted from the yeast          twohybrid system experiments that provide          coimmunoprecipitation data or solid phase binding          results of the interaction of these proteins will be          useful          The interaction of EGFmodules with either non          EGFlike modules eg the EGFlike modules of fibulinC          interacting with the heparinbinding region of          fibronectin or with EGFlike modules eg the          interaction of fibulinC with aggrecan and versican          between extracellular matrix proteins argues for the          interaction of the EGFmodules containing within          fibulinC and LTBP with either the heparinbinding          region or with the EGFlike domain of HBEGF                            Conclusions        In summary we have shown the interaction of two novel        proteins with the extracellular domain of proHBEGF using a        yeast twohybrid system The interactions of LTBP and        fibulinC with the extracellular domain of proHBEGF may        provide further insights into the roles that these proteins        play in cellular and tissue development processes The        trafficking of such growth factors as HBEGF and TGF and        structural proteins within the extracellular matrix is        important in wound healing processes Therefore the        interactions of HBEGF with LTBP and fibulinC described        in this study suggest novel functions for HBEGF between        cellsurfaces and tissue surfaces                    Materials and methods        The plasmid vectors pGBT pGAD pTD pVA the        monkey cv cDNA

Y or Y        containing both plasmids pTD and pVA together was        included in every galactosidase assay A negative control        of Y or Y containing both plasmid vectors pGBT and        pGAD was included in all galactosidase assays        Each construct from the cDNA library that tested        positive for both         lacZ and         his reporter gene expression was also        tested for the ability to activate directly        galactosidase         his reporter gene transcription        without the presence of the bait construct        pGBTproHBEGFEx False positives were eliminated using        this screening assay Potential true positive clones were        sequenced using primers GADSEQ TACCACTACAATGGATG and        GADcSEQ GTTGAAGTGAACTTGCGGGG with the automated DNA
