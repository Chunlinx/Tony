                all right now since im from the great Midwest north you know were right on Lake Erie uh im sure our climates are much different than yours are typically today weve got uh rain were forecasting a little bit of sleet and uh which means im not gonna do any lawn and gardening today thats for sure   yes i can understand   so i dont know whats the weather down there and   oh its nice and sunny here uh its uh little little Christmas uh crispness in the air   uhhuh   and uh delightful to be outside   yeah   and right now im watering   yeah its not are you really   we avoid having to send you a little bit   yes and my lawn is very green and my flowers are still blooming   uhhuh well i have that   oh you do   i still have that we have mums and geraniums that are still holding their own out there uh lot of the other ones ive ive already had to pull out   umhum   uh at this point im ready to start putting in uh some bulbs im waiting for a decent some decent weather for that i got uh about two hundred bulbs ive got to put in   uhhuh right   but i have a uh mines a new home and we just really did the landscaping this year so ive got about all the gardening i want for the year so ill be anxious to to let it rest for a little bit   uhhuh   but uh somebody i talked to last week was said they had the uh they had problems doing some of the work down there because they they really had some heat hanging on   well course thats a constant factor down here what you have to do is uh keep your uh keep your ground uh watered   umhum   and uh the heat really doesnt bother you if you have the right kind of flowers   yeah all right   or and the right kind of lawn for that matter   uhhuh   i have a tiff Bermuda lawn here and uh it requires a lot of water and you have to keep it cut very short if you want it to look like a golf course green   umhum   i dont uh get to it that often so mine doesnt look like a golf course course but it is very nice and uh and shiny and uh very thin grass   oh i see   grows real close together   uhhuh thats very okay its very very different than ours because ours ours we get into a lot of combinations of rye and Kentucky Blue   umhum   and uh plus the usual amount of crabgrass and weeds and everything else that pops through and uh but weve had an a terrible drought this year and everybodys going through the same kind of problems in fact we developed on a new lawn we developed what they call rust and its a fungus which is very very rare but our whole area theyre all new homes and new lawns and it was it was very very much in evidence this year as everything turns yellow   turns yellow early huh   well it just turns yellow where it shouldnt and you walk across walk across the lawn and your shoes will actually come out rust colored   and its its not its not a disease its a disease and not a lack of a of chemicals   no its its a fungus and they claim that it is caused by stress to the lawn it it wont kill the lawn but it sure doesnt do much for the looks of the lawn   huh umhum   and uh the alternative is a lot of uh nitrogen overpowering with nitrogen fertilizer and certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come spring come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal   well i have grub worms here off and on i try to keep them under control they live right up under the surface of the ground and they eat the roots of your grass and then you have ground  brown uh patches develop   umhum   oh yeah   thats when you first notice it but you can put some uh chemical on that and kill them out and keep them under control you never destroy them   umhum you enjoy lawn work   oh very much so uh we have a lake house down at Cedar Creek Texas seventy five miles uh north uh or rather uh uh southeast uh southeast of uh Dallas   umhum   and uh i have to  to grow uh rye grass down there because were not there to water although we have a watering system no ones there to turn it on and i guess uh   umhum   well we dont have an automatic sprinkler either see so   yeah   uh or automatic on the sprinkler system   umhum   but uh you know the rye grass and the uh wild grass that grow makes us a nice lawn   umhum yeah it sounds nice Cedar Lake im not uh   but oh its a very large uh manmade lake uh in Texas its about uh a hundred and uh fifty miles i guess in Fort Worth   oh i see   and it supplies Fort Worth with its drinking water   okay okay   and then a hundred and eighty miles further south of there uh or rather a hundred and eighty miles from Fort Worth about forty miles south of Cedar Creek is another mammoth lake that Fort Worth owns   umhum   that it uses to water   yeah thats interesting i never realized the uh the amount of lake
