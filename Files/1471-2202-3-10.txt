                    Background        Aggregation of acetylcholine receptors AChRs at the        postsynaptic muscle membrane is the initial step in        synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction and is        essential for reliable and rapid synaptic communication        Agrin is the only known         in vivo stimulus for the initiation        of receptor aggregation However several other researchers        have reported that laminins including laminin LN also        induce receptor aggregation in cultured mouse muscle cells              At this time the LN stimulation pathway is not        well understood but it has been argued from several lines        of evidence to be at least partially distinct from the        agrin pathway This is based on aggregation assays showing        different time courses additive dose response        relationships and differential colocalization of the        dystrophin complex and on biochemical observations        indicating the lack of requirement for MuSK and the lack        of tyrosinephosphorylation of receptors during LN but not        agrin induced aggregation       The very minimal        receptor aggregation seen in agrin deficient mice certainly        argues that laminins are not sufficient to trigger receptor        aggregation     More recently we have shown that agrin        and LN induced aggregates can also be differentiated on        the basis of the ultrastructural arrangement of receptors        within aggregates            Laminins are major components of the extracellular        matrix and exist in many isoforms with varying functions        including cell adhesion neurite outgrowth and cellular        signaling        Laminin binds agrin     and        colocalizes with AChR aggregates       It also        binds with Dystroglycan DG an important part of the        dystrophinutrophin glycoprotein complex Reviewed in             The dystrophin complex is also found concentrated        at the neuromuscular junction with AChRs and laminin and        for this and other reasons is thought to be involved in        both formation and maintenance of the NMJ                          Taken together these observations have led to the        hypothesis that LN serves as a secondary or supporting        stimulus for agrin induced AChR aggregation              The present study is directed at a quantitative examination        of the interaction between the signal transduction pathways        for agrin and LN induction of AChR aggregates and        colocalized DG aggregates                    Results                  Acetylcholine receptor aggregation          In order to examine the possible interactions between          agrin and LN combination experiments were conducted in          which the total exposure time to individual stimuli was          less than or equal to  hours Examples of the effects          of agrin and LN alone or in combination using these          protocols are shown in Figure  It is clear from visual          inspection that either stimulus or the stimuli together          increase the prominence of receptor aggregates Figure          Avs BCDEF To quantify these differences the          quantitative analyses described in Materials and Methods          were carried out and the results are summarized in          Figure           The present experimental system provides an important          opportunity to estimate changes in the average AChR          expression by sampling the fluorescence signal from the          section of membrane representing the meridian of the          spherical cell Average receptor expression was found to          be significantly increased following exposure to agrin          and less so although still significantly in response to          LN Figure A Interestingly the combination          experiments seem to indicate that these effects are          additive suggesting that the two stimulation pathways do          not share a common ratelimiting step Moreover hour          exposure to LN did not bring about a significant          increase in aggregate number while agrin did alone or          in combination with LN Figure B Both agrin LN and          combinations of the two significantly increased aggregate          size Figure C In terms of aggregate density the          concentration of receptors within aggregates the result          was the mirror image of that for aggregate number agrin          alone was indistinguishable from controls while laminin          alone or in combination significantly increased density          Figure D Figure Erepresents a novel analytical          approach in which the distribution of aggregates on each          cell is compared to that expected assuming random placing          of the aggregates ie spatial independence neither          cooperativity nor competition The mean Z values when          significantly different from zero indicate the direction          of deviation from a random distribution mean Z            indicates aggregates are closer together than would be          expected at random cooperativity while values            indicate aggregates are further apart than expected          competition The observed receptor aggregates were          found to be significantly different from random only with          agrin alone as the stimulus in which case they were          found closer together indicating spatial          cooperativity                          Dystroglycan aggregation          Because of various lines of evidence connecting DG          to receptor aggregation and to differences in agrin and          LN pathways of induction we next examined the effects          of the stimulus protocols on cells double labeled for          AChRs fluorescein and DG rhodamine to examine the          extent of correlation between the labels see below and          the DG distributions Typical results are shown in          Figure  in which DG distributions are seen to be          quite punctate with examples of both kinds of          noncorrelation AB CD demonstrating a lack of          contamination of signals between the two filter sets          There are also examples in which the labels do appear to          be somewhat correlated  EF GH Quantitative analyses          of the DG distributions are summarized in Figure the          observed AChR aggregates were consistent with the          observations presented above but were not pooled with          those data because they were not performed on matching          sister cultures          Agrin clearly increased the expression of DG as          judged by label intensity Figure A while the effects          of LN alone or in combination could not be assessed          because it competed with the immunological probe used in          labeling There are interesting similarities as well as          differences in the effects of the two stimuli on the          remaining measures of distribution First agrin showed          no effect on the number of DG aggregates per cell          while LN alone and in combination induced an increase          Figure B This is the reverse of the finding for AChR          aggregates Figure B DG aggregate size follows a          similar pattern of increase by LN alone or in          combination but not agrin Figure C but in this case          it is the same as the finding with AChRs Figure C          Again in agreement with AChR observations DG aggregate          density is increased by LN but not agrin Figure D           however in this case it appears that this increase is          prevented by agrin while in the case of AChRs the          combination follows the LN alone phenotype of increased          aggregate density Finally the meanZ values Figure E          clearly show that  DG aggregates are closer together          than random cooperativity in all cases and apparently          more so after stimulated with LN          The last analysis performed was that of measuring the          correlation between AChR and DG distributions in          response to the stimulus protocols As discussed in          Materials and Methods each of the three measures used          here has some advantages over the others In the present          experiments the trends are all quite similar however          and are shown in Figure  All correlation measures show          progressive and significant increases from control to          agrin to LN to agrinLN The more physiologically          meaningful metrics high frequency and above threshold          correlation are quite low in controls indicating that          aggregates of the two components are essentially          independent in their distributions under these          conditions This independence is lost with the          application of either of the two stimuli and the effects          of agrin and LN together are greater than either alone          It should be noted however that even under these          conditions the high frequency correlation for example          indicates that about    of the variation in          either distribution is predicted by the other Thus          although the aggregate distributions are not          statistically independent they are also not strictly          colocalized                            Discussion                  Correlation of aggregates          This is the first report in which entire slices of          membrane have been compared in their entirety for          correlation of AChR and DG distribution Accordingly          the question arises as to how this approach can be          compared with previous studies which demonstrate a          visible colocalization of AChRs and DG in muscle cells          stimulated by nerve terminals    or agrin                 First we note that the present results do support          a significant colocalization of the two molecules in          agrin stimulated cells as compared to controls Figure           in general agreement with previous findings That the          correlation coefficient never approaches unity is also          consistent with the previous work  in general it has          been found that AChR aggregates contain DG but visible          concentrations of DG can be found in the absence of          AChRs Thus there appears to be a one way correlation          whether the stimulus is agrin or laminin AChR aggregation          is an excellent predictor of DG aggregation but the          converse is not found see particularly     This          lack of reciprocity will of course reduce the label          correlation as measured in the present study          Nevertheless it is apparent from visual observations          eg Figure  that there is less perfect colocalization          of DG           within AChR aggregates in the          present study than reported previously see for example             Figure  for a comparable study using           Xenopus muscle cell cultures It          seems likely that this is due to the more minimalist          culture conditions used in the present study  younger          cells plated on clean glass coverslips lacking in          extensive adhesion plaques and presumably endowed with a          less stratified cytoskeleton This is supported by the          finding that  hours of laminin stimulus is required for          an increase in aggregate number while in the hour          protocol reported at present only aggregate size is          increased It is to be expected that with greater          stimulation time the colocalization would increase which          presents the prospect of studying the relative dynamics          of AChR and DG colocalization                          Distribution of aggregates          The observation that receptor aggregates are          distributed differently than would be expected at random          deserves further comment As a first approximation there          are three ways that receptor aggregates on a given cell          could be distributed randomly closer together or          further apart than random A random distribution would          imply that aggregate dynamics initiation development          and dispersal are independent of that for neighboring          aggregates Aggregates distributed further apart than          random would imply a local competition for the molecules          required for aggregate formation or development or          alternatively regionally increased levels of components          which cause aggregate dispersal Conversely a          distribution of aggregates closer together than random          could result from a local reduction in the rate of          dispersal or a regionally enhanced rate of initiation or          development of new aggregates Of course these effects          need not be mutually exclusive  it could be that          aggregate dynamics are cooperative in small regions of          membrane while simultaneously competitive over larger          scales          We found that spontaneous receptor aggregates were          distributed closer together than random Figure E          although the deviation was small and only just          significant statistically However agrin and LN appear          to have very different effects on aggregate distribution          Agrin dramatically increased the proximity of receptor          aggregates while laminin stimulation resulted in random          distributions of aggregates Interestingly this latter          effect was dominant in the sense that agrinLN          combinations also resulted in random distributions DG          distributions were found to be closer together than          random in all conditions examined                            Conclusions        The present data largely corroborate and extend        previously published accounts We did not find the        substantially larger number of LN as opposed to agrin        induced aggregates reported previously     perhaps        because of the shortened application of laminin used in the        presented experiments Also while laminin stimulation        increased the colocalization of AChRs and DG in our        experiments agrin also produced a similar increase Figure         These effects on colocalization appear to be additive        as did the overall stimulation of AChR expression Figure        A Both of these findings suggest distinct pathways for        agrin and laminin induced receptor aggregation and this        conclusion is strengthened by the observation laminin        unlike agrin dramatically increased the density of        receptors within aggregates Figure D as reported        previously     The independence of pathways is also        indicated by the profoundly different effects of the two        stimuli on aggregate distribution        This last observation indicating the absence of        cooperativity or competition amongst LN induced        aggregates invites the question of whether the results of        laminin stimulation can be explained by simple mass action        effects of increased receptor expression At present we can        produce no evidence to rule out this possibility Increased        expression of AChRs could decrease the dissolution of        aggregates thereby increasing aggregate size density and        over time number This would also explain the longer time        required for LN induction of aggregates as well as the        additivity seen here and in previous reports Whether or        not the effects of LN on aggregation dynamics can all be        attributed to an increase in receptor expression it seems        clear from several lines of evidence that the mechanism is        distinct from that of agrin induction and that the        physiological effects of laminin are permissive rather than        instructive for receptor aggregation                    Materials and Methods                  Xenopusculturing and fixation          Briefly skeletal muscle

    avoid observer bias cells were first observed in bright          field and randomly chosen from among the group of healthy          spherical cells before observing them in          fluorescence                          Analysis of fluorescence micrographs          Custom written software in C and Mathematica was used          to generate detailed quantitative membrane fluorescence          information from each cell image      In the first          phase the intensity of membrane fluorescence as a          function of position is tabulated Figure BC Raw          Data These measurements are then analyzed to provide          statistics on the number size density and position of          each aggregate on each cell Figure C The analysis is          not perfect in particular small aggregates close          together may be scored as single larger aggregates          Nonetheless the analysis provides objective comparisons          between the different conditions under examination          New to this report the positional information was          used to quantify the distribution of aggregates about the          cell surface First the nearestneighbor distance is          found for each aggregate on cells containing more than          one aggregate Figure B For each cell the mean of          these nearest neighbor distances is calculated Next the          number and sizes of aggregates on a given cell are used          to run repeated  simulations assuming a random          placement of the same sized aggregates For each          simulation run the mean nearest neighbor distance is          calculated so that together the runs provide an expected          value and expected standard deviation for this parameter          under the assumption of a random distribution These          values corresponding to a given cells aggregates are          then used to form a zscore from the observed mean          nearest neighbor distance of the cell          observedexpectedstandard deviation          Finally the expected value for all zscores from a          given experimental condition is  given a random          distribution negative if the aggregates are closer          together than random and positive if the aggregates are          further apart than random The significance of any          deviation from randomness is tested by summing the          zscores to form a  statistic          Also new to this report is testing of the correlation          between label intensities in the double label          experiments Correlation is a statistical measure of the          relationship between two variables based on the          covariance of those variables normalized by their          standard deviations In these experiments the two          variables are the label intensities of two fluorescent          labels representing the two proteins of interest in the          experiment Correlations are measured for raw data high          frequency data and above threshold or aggregate data          see Figure  The raw data provide a baseline          measurement without any manipulation of the data but          include low frequency gradual changes in fluorescence          which are less interesting The high frequency          correlation eliminates this contamination and avoids the          somewhat arbitrary imposition of a threshold while the          above threshold correlation is intuitively a better          measure of what we mean by colocalization of aggregates          but of necessity depends upon the threshold chosen          Fortunately in the present work all three measures show          the same general trends                            List of abbreviations        AChR Nicotinic
