                                  Monomoney Mania             A couple of days ago my CWalarm starting buzzing furiously For something like the sixth time in a montha businessman I was talking to had just declared in the tones of someonestating a profound insight that the modern world economy no longer has roomfor scores of different national currenciesthat the inexorable logic ofglobalization will soon force most countries to adopt the dollar the euro orthe yen as their means of exchange This particular speaker was Latin Americanand was clearly influenced by the recent discussion of dollarization as asolution to his regions woes but I have heard pretty much the same line fromAsians and Europeans No doubt about it A new conventional wisdom has emergedAnd you know what that means Its time to start debunking            At first sight it mightseem obvious that the fewer currencies there are the better After all aproliferation of national moneys means more hassle and expense because youkeep on having to change money and to pay the associated commissions It alsomeans more uncertainty because you are never quite sure what foreign goods aregoing to cost or what foreign customers will be willing to pay And asglobalization proceedsas the volume of international transactions rises bothabsolutely and relative to world outputthe cost of having many currenciesalso rises So why not have fewermaybe only one            Theres also the matter of speculation The financialcrises that have shaken much of the world all started at least in the firstinstance with investors betting that the currency of the afflicted nationwould fall in value against harder currencies such as the dollar Why not spoilthe speculators game by giving them nothing to speculate aboutby replacingpesos and reis with portraits of George Washington or if you happen to beEuropean with generic pictures of bridges and gatesfor more on Europeancurrency design see                    Slate                piece            But not so fast Thereare still some very good arguments for maintaining separate nationalcurrencies Not only that while globalization and technological change in someways are pushing the world toward fewer currencies in other ways they actuallyreinforce the advantages of monetary pluralism            The classic argument in favor of separate nationalcurrencies with fluctuating relative values was made by none other thanMilton Friedman One appealing aspect of this particular debate is that itcuts across the usual ideological lines European socialists like unifiedcurrencies so does the Cato Institute American liberals like floatingexchange rates so do Thatcherites Friedman started from a more or lessundeniable observation Sometimes changing market conditions force broadchanges in the ratios of national price levels For example right now theIrish economy is booming and the German economys sputtering Clearly pricesand wages in Ireland need to rise compared with those in Germany Now youcould simply rely on supply and demand to do the job producing inflation inIreland and deflation in Germany But even a freemarketeer such as Friedmanrealized that this is asking a lot of markets and that it would be much easierto keep German prices stable in German currency Irish prices stable in Irishcurrency and let the exchange rate between the two currencies do theadjusting            Friedman offered abrilliant analogy He likened exchange rate adjustment to the act of settingclocks forward in the spring A truly devout freemarket believer shouldif heis consistentdecry this as unwarranted government interference Why not leavepeople free to chooseto start the working day earlier if and only if theyfeel like it But in reality there is a coordination problem It is hard forany one business to shift its work schedule unless everyone else does the sameAs a result it turns out to be much easier to achieve the desired time shiftby leaving the schedules unchanged but resetting the clocks In the same wayFriedman argued a country whose wages and prices are too high compared withthose abroad will find it much easier to make the necessary adjustment via achange in the value of its currency than through thousands of changes inindividual prices            So there is a tradeoff You dont want too manycurrenciesyou wouldnt want to have separate dollars for Brooklyn and QueensBut when two countries are subject to strong asymmetric shockswhich iseconospeak for saying that if they shared a common currency one would sometimesbe in a boom while the other was in a slump and vice versathere is a goodcase for their having separate currencies whose relative values are allowed tofluctuate The question then is whether changes in the nature of the worldeconomy have altered the terms of tradeoffand if so in which direction            Now the increasing volumeof international trade and investment does other things being the same makeit more costly to maintain multiple currencies But other things are not thesame and other forces arguably make the optimal number of currencies in theworld larger rather than smaller            Consider in particular the effects of modern informationand communication technologywhich may also be the driving force behindglobalization Surely that technology has made it easier not harder to dealwith a world of many currencies For example European advocates of a singlecurrency used to delight in pointing out that if you took a grand tour of theEuropean Union starting with  deutsche marks and changing your money intolocal currency at each stop at the end you would have only something like marks This was always a bit of a red herring since the commissions thatbusinesses pay on foreign exchange transactions are far smaller than the feesat foreign exchange kiosks But anyway who needs to change money nowadaysWhen I go to Europe I pay for most things by credit card and get petty cashfrom local ATMs which are happy to accept my BankBoston card            Information technologyalso makes it easier for businesses to deal with the risks associated withfluctuating currencies It has always been true that such risks could inprinciple be hedged away through  the problem was that the necessary marketswere sometimes thin or nonexistent Thanks to computers however investmentbanks now offer a vast array of financial instruments and hedging has becomemuch easier            I cant resist mentioning a related issue When you talk toeuro enthusiasts they invariably claim that one of the great benefits of thenew currency will be price transparency Once all European prices are quotedin euros it will be obvious to consumers when a German company is chargingmore than its French competitor or vice versawhereas it wouldnt be if theprices were quoted in francs and marks and had to be converted at the goingexchange rate This claim always puzzles me Here we are in the informationage able to process gigabytes of data with a single mouse clickbut weimagine that people cant multiply and divide            The one remaining question is that of currencyspeculationfear of speculators not the desire for efficiency is what hasled Argentina to talk seriously about replacing pesos with dollars and madedollarization at least a topic of discussion elsewhere in Latin America Butwhile currency speculation may have had disastrous impacts in some countriesin others letting the currency drop seems to have been just what the doctorordered Australias floating dollar has apparently allowed the islandcontinent to sail almost unscathed through the Asian crisis Even in Brazil itappears that fears that a drop in the currency would bring back hyperinflationwere unwarranted And to me Argentina and Brazil both look a lot likeAustralia resourcerich nations a long way from anywhere with no dominantNorthern Hemisphere trading partner Economic logic suggests that in the longrun such countries if they can put their inflationary histories behind themhave no business adopting the currency of a faraway country which will not taketheir interests into account            So lets recognize this current enthusiasm forcurrency unification as what it is an intellectual fad not a deep insight Isay let a hundred currencies bloom Well maybe  or
