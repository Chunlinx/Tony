                    Background        Myosinc Myoc the myosin previously called        myosinI myr  or MIK     is an unconventional        myosin isozyme implicated in nuclear transcription            lamellopodia dynamics of motile cells             brushborder dynamics of proximaltubule cells of the        kidney      and adaptation of mechanoelectrical        transduction in hair cells the sensory cells of the inner        ear     Myoc belongs to the myosinI class which        contains eight members in humans    and mice     the        bullfrog genome possesses at least two members            Members of the myosinI class have a single globular motor        domain followed by a neck region and a relatively short         kD tail domain Fig A This latter domain is        highly basic and binds to acidic phospholipids            Like all biochemically characterized unconventional        myosins Myoc binds calmodulin light chains in its neck        region     this region also interacts with        noncalmodulin receptors in hair cells            Unconventional myosins contain from one to several IQ        domains which are calmodulinbinding motifs that adhere to        the general consensus sequence IQX          RGX          R     Calmodulin which can bind        up to four Ca ions generally binds IQ domains in the Ca        free conformation interaction of Ca bound calmodulin        to other proteins occurs through alternative binding motifs                   Myoc contains three readily recognized IQ motifs of         amino acids each Fig C refs                Purified Myoc apparently includes  calmodulins per        Myoc heavy chain       calmodulin supplementation        can increase the stoichiometry to as many as  calmodulins        per Myoc     Unfortunately the lack of appropriate        quantitation standards for the Myoc heavy chain in those        experiments limits the reliability of these values        How Ca and calmodulin regulate Myoc or indeed any        myosinI is unclear Although Ca increases ATPase        activity of most myosinI isozymes         in vitro motility is usually blocked        under identical conditions     Ca dissociates one or        more calmodulins from the myosincalmodulin complex which        apparently elevates ATPase activity and inhibits motility            In conventional myosin light chains related to        calmodulin appear to be essential for stabilization of the        myosin lever arm     a domain that is vital for        efficient conversion of chemical energy into mechanical        work     Calmodulin probably plays a similar leverarm        stabilizing role for Myoc Ca induced calmodulin        release would reverse the stabilization and inhibit        motility        To better understand the regulation of Myoc activity by        calmodulin we sought to more accurately determine how        calmodulin binds to Myoc by measuring the Ca dependence        of calmodulin binding to individual Myoc IQ peptides In        addition to examine the consequences of calmodulin binding        to adjacent IQ domains we measured hydrodynamic properties        of recombinant Myoccalmodulin complexes under differing        conditions of Ca  calmodulin and temperature These        measurements allowed us to determine the molecular mass and        hence stoichiometry of the Myoc complex Our results        indicate that IQ IQ and IQ have calmodulin bound when        the concentration of Ca is low and that increased Ca        induces release of calmodulin from IQ and IQ                    Results                  Sequence analysis of IQ domains          Examination of the primary sequence of the bullfrog          Myoc neck region reveals an exact repeat of five amino          acids located both in the IQ region YRNQP residues           and at residues  Alignment of the          residues surrounding the repeat revealed reasonable          homology with the three known IQ domains with particular          similarity to IQ suggesting that this region may be a          fourth IQ domain Fig C Although the pair of amino          acids LM residues  and  that align with the RG          of the IQ consensus motif are not conserved the first          pair of amino acids IR residues  and  that align          with the consensus IQ adhere to the consensus better than          those of IQ Because of the sequence similarity to IQ          and because this peptide binds calmodulin albeit weakly          see below we refer to this domain as IQ                          IQ  Alexacalmodulin interaction on plastic          plates          To investigate the calmodulinbinding properties of          each Myoc IQ domain we measured interaction of a          fluorescently labeled calmodulin Alexacalmodulin with          individual Myoc IQ peptides that had been conjugated to          wells of a plastic plate We used an IQ peptide from          neuromodulin    as a positive control calmodulin          binds to this site with its interaction reduced by high          ionic strength      As a negative control we used          a peptide PVP corresponding to the  amino acids of          Myoc immediately following IQ Indeed Alexacalmodulin          bound to wells derivatized with the neuromodulin IQ          peptide and did not bind to the PVP peptide Fig          A          Substantial amounts of Alexacalmodulin bound to wells          derivatized with IQ IQ and IQ by contrast          relatively little bound to IQcoated wells under these          conditions Fig A As has been noted for the          neuromodulin IQ domain     increasing the KCl          concentration reduced binding to each IQ peptide          Although the data shown in Fig Awere obtained at room          temperature we saw a similar rank order of binding           albeit with lower total Alexacalmodulin bound  at C          data not shown          To confirm the approximate binding strength reported          by this assay we used free IQ peptides to prevent          Alexacalmodulin binding to an IQderivatized plate          Because the IQ peptides strongly quenched          Alexacalmodulin fluorescence when bound we corrected          fluorescence measurements using an identical assay in an          underivatized plate Although this quenching correction          introduced substantial scatter into the data we found          that the apparent affinities for binding of peptides to          Alexacalmodulin followed the order IQ  IQ  IQ           IQ Fig B                          IQ  calmodulin interaction by quenching of          Alexacalmodulin fluorescence          As noted above Alexacalmodulin fluorescence was          quenched upon binding to an IQ peptide Fig A Because          an excess of unlabeled calmodulin was able to reverse           of the quench Fig A we inferred that most          Alexacalmodulin bound to the same site as unlabeled          calmodulin We used this fluorescenceintensity quench          empirically to measure the affinity of each IQ peptide          for Alexacalmodulin Fig B In some experiments Ca          was held at  nM by chelation with  M EGTA in          other experiments we added  M exogenous CaCl            in the absence of EGTA These two          concentrations mimic the low and highCa conditions          that Myoc may encounter in hair cells when the          transduction channel is closed or open     In the          presence of  M EGTA K           d values followed the order IQ           IQ  IQ  IQ Although the data were fit          somewhat better with a modified Hill equation that with a          standard bimolecularbinding isotherm Fig B the          physiological significance of Hill coefficients  is          uncertain particularly given the  peptidecalmodulin          stoichiometry see below Ca had only modest effects          on the affinity of the Myoc IQ peptides for          Alexacalmodulin Table           Despite only minor effects on binding affinity Ca          did influence the calmodulinpeptide complex as          signaled by changes in Alexacalmodulin fluorescence          Changes in fluorescence intensity during manipulation of          a single parameter like Ca concentration should          report conformational changes in Alexacalmodulin For          example the fluorescence intensity of free          Alexacalmodulin in solution was  lower in  M CaCl                     than in  M EGTA lefthand          limits in Fig  Because the dye moiety itself is not          Ca sensitive     the Ca dependent fluorescent          change reflects changes in the dyes surrounding          environment probably signaling the compacttoopen          structural change seen when Ca binds to calmodulin              In contrast to the reduction of free Alexacalmodulin          fluorescence by Ca  fluorescence of Alexacalmodulin          when saturated by IQ peptides was  to fold           greater in  M CaCl            than in  M EGTA Fig  Table           Thus when Alexacalmodulin was bound to IQ peptides          Ca induced a conformational change that was          substantially different from that seen in the          peptidefree state                          IQ  calmodulin interaction under          stoichiometrictitration conditions          To determine the affinities of the Myoc IQ peptides          for unlabeled calmodulin we used Alexacalmodulin as a          reporter Alexacalmodulin  unlabeled calmodulin ratio          of  in our binding studies This approach assumes          that Alexacalmodulin is functionally equivalent to          unlabeled calmodulin          We determined affinities by fitting the IQpeptide          concentration vs fluorescence quench data with an          appropriate model If the IQ peptides bound only          Alexacalmodulin and not unlabeled calmodulin the K           d and F           IQ F values of Table would have          described the fit to the concentrationquench plots The          line derived from these values did not fit the data Fig           indicating that as expected unlabeled calmodulin          binds to the Myoc IQ peptides          These experimental conditions resembled a          stoichiometric titration where the total concentration          of calmodulin was higher than the K           d values for IQ IQ and IQ Under          true stoichiometrictitration conditions fixed          concentration of receptor at fold or more than the K           d  varying the ligand concentration          up to and beyond the receptor concentration almost all          of the added IQ peptide would bind tightly to calmodulin          and linearly decrease the fluorescence at the point          where the IQpeptide concentration exceeds the calmodulin          concentration multiplied by the peptidecalmodulin          stoichiometry            m  a plateau in the fluorescence          intensity would be reached Because the relatively weak          affinities observed here make such true stoichiometric          titration impractical we used an intermediate          concentration of calmodulin  M fold larger than          K           d  and used equation  to describe          the equilibrium precisely This approach allowed us to          determine both           m and K           d in the same experiment          In the presence of EGTA the IQ IQ and IQ binding          data were much better fit by           m   than they were to           m   indicating that the binding          stoichiometry of peptide to calmodulin was  Fig           The K           d values determined with equation           were very similar to those determined for binding to          Alexacalmodulin alone Tables and  confirming that          under these conditions the IQ peptides bind to unlabeled          calmodulin and Alexacalmodulin similarly          In the presence of Ca  IQ also bound to calmodulin          with a stoichiometry of  Fig  The fits to           m   and  were equally good for          IQ and IQ in the presence of Ca  signifying the          inability for this analysis to determine precise binding          stoichiometry of IQ and IQ under these conditions In          addition these data indicate that the apparent          affinities of IQ and IQ for unlabeled calmodulin were          substantially weakened by Ca Table  unlike results          with Alexacalmodulin alone Table  Because the          assumption that affinities of Alexacalmodulin and          unlabeled calmodulin for IQ peptides are identical was          violated for IQ and IQ the actual affinities of these          IQ peptides for unlabeled calmodulin may be even weaker          than those reported in Table  By contrast Ca had          only a very modest effect on IQ affinity for unlabeled          calmodulin          Binding of IQ to unlabeled calmodulin was distinct          from that of the other IQ peptides The data with IQ          were best fit with a Hill equation equation  with a          Hill coefficient of greater than  Fig  thick solid          lines suggesting that binding of two peptides per          calmodulin may be required for the fluorescence change          The apparent affinities  M were similar to the          concentration of calmodulin  M however indicating          that the apparent affinities did not accurately reflect K                    d values These results with a mixture          of unlabeled and Alexacalmodulin were different from          those with Alexacalmodulin alone where IQ Hill          coefficients were close to  data not shown          Nevertheless these data show that unlabeled calmodulin          can bind to IQ albeit with weak affinity and uncertain          stoichiometry                          Hydrodynamic analysis of fulllength Myoc          To determine the stoichiometry and Ca dependent          regulation of calmodulin binding to Myoc with all four          IQ motifs we coexpressed calmodulin and fulllength          bullfrog Myoc in insect cells using baculoviruses and          subjected the purified Myoccalmodulin complexes Fig          B to hydrodynamic analysis Table  We carried out          velocity sedimentation of Myoccalmodulin complexes on           sucrose gradients to determine sedimentation          coefficients We measured the Stokes radius of          Myoccalmodulin complexes using gel filtration on          Superdex  under temperature and buffer conditions          identical to those of the velocitysedimentation          experiments Table  Although most experiments used           mM KCl which prevented adsorption to the gelfiltration          matrix we obtained identical sedimentation coefficients          in the presence of  or  mM KCl not shown          Velocitysedimentation and gelfiltration experiments          were carried out at C the temperature used for Myoc          purification as well as at C a physiologically          relevant temperature for a bullfrog          To calculate the molecular mass of Myoccalmodulin          complexes we applied the modified Svedberg equation          which relates mass to the diffusion constant calculated          here from Stokes radius and the sedimentation          coefficient     The partial specific volume of each          protein complex was determined using the aminoacid          composition of the constituent proteins Table  ref              Although the uncertainty in calmodulin          stoichiometry leads to ambiguity in this calculation the          calculated partial specific volumes were so close            eg   for one and  for          three calmodulins per Myoc complex that the precise          value did not significantly affect the final          molecularmass value          Fulllength Myoc bound  calmodulins per Myoc at          C in the presence of EGTA or CaCl            Table  One of the bound          calmodulins was only weakly associated as elevation of          the temperature to C induced the release of  mole of          calmodulin in the presence of EGTA When Ca was          elevated to  M at C however we could not detect          substantial fulllength Myoc in solution after          sucrosegradient centrifugation or gel filtration          suggesting that the protein had aggregated                          Hydrodynamic analysis of TMyoc          Because the size of fulllength Myoc  kD          including purification and detection tags is much larger          than calmodulin  kD we improved our ability to          determine stoichiometry from molecular mass by examining          a smaller  kD necktail recombinant fragment of          Myoc This construct TMyoc contained amino acids           of bullfrog Myoc including all four IQ          domains the entire Cterminal tail and Nterminal          purification and epitope tags Fig AB          TMyoc bound  moles of calmodulin per mole of          heavy chain at C in the presence of  M EGTA Fig           Table  As with fulllength Myoc elevation of the          analysis temperature to C induced the release of           mole of calmodulin In contrast to the results seen with          fulllength Myoc elevation of the CaCl            concentration to  M at C also          induced the release of  mole of calmodulin The          amount of Tcalmodulin complex recovered on sucrose          gradients or by gel filtration decreased substantially          when the CaCl            concentration was elevated to  M          at C signaling the formation of aggregates as seen          with the fulllength complex Furthermore the calculated          calmodulin stoichiometry of the observed Tcalmodulin          complex under these conditions was only  mole of          calmodulin per mole of Myoc reinforcing the suggestion          that Ca induced the dissociation of most calmodulins at          C and that this loss of light chains resulted in          aggregation          We could not prevent the release of calmodulin at C          by saturating TMyoc with excess calmodulin          immediately prior to centrifugation preloading In          EGTA the sedimentation coefficient of          calmodulinpreloaded TMyoc measured at C             S n   was nearly identical to that measured          without preloading  S Table  Likewise the          sedimentation coefficient of calmodulinpreloaded          TMyoc measured at C and in  M CaCl               S n   was similar          to that measured without preloading  S Table                    By contrast we could prevent the          temperaturedependent loss of calmodulin by carrying out          sedimentation in the continuous presence of  M          calmodulin Fig CD Table  Although gelfiltration          analysis was impractical with this high calmodulin          concentration we assumed that the Stokes radius of          TMyoc in the presence of calmodulin was identical to          the value obtained in the absence Sedimentation at C          in EGTA gradients supplemented with  M calmodulin          resulted in the retention of  calmodulins per          TMyoc In  M CaCl             supplementation with  M          calmodulin resulted in  calmodulin bound per          TMyoc In addition protein loss due to aggregation          was minimal under these conditions                          Myoccalmodulin stoichiometry by gel          scanning          To measure Myoccalmodulin stoichiometry by an          independent method we separated calmodulin standards and          TMyoc by SDSPAGE Fig A Using densitometry we          quantified the staining intensity of the calmodulin          standards to generate a standard curve Fig B and          determined the amount of calmodulin present in each          TMyoc sample Applying the analysis described in          Experimental Procedures and equation  we found an          average of    calmodulins per TMyoc mean           standard error in six experiments three separate          preparations analyzed in duplicate This value was very          close to the value of    bound calmodulins          determined independently by hydrodynamic analysis Table                                      Discussion                  Calmodulin interaction with individual Myoc IQ          domains          To examine how calmodulin binds to the Myoc IQ sites          we developed two binding assays using a commercially          available fluorescent calmodulin and individual IQ          peptides In one assay we covalently attached peptides          to plastic plates then measured the amount of          fluorescent calmodulin that remained unbound after          incubation with the peptidederivatized plate This assay          was simple and fast and allowed us to measure binding          under a wide variety of conditions In our second assay          we exploited the empirical observation that the          Alexacalmodulin fluorescence intensity is quenched by          binding of IQ peptides As in other assays with          fluorescently labeled calmodulins eg ref              binding of the peptides to Alexacalmodulin did not          perfectly mimic binding to unlabeled calmodulin For          example Alexacalmodulin bound IQ peptides more strongly          in the presence of Ca than did unlabeled calmodulin          Moreover excess unlabeled calmodulin could not fully          reverse the quenching of Alexacalmodulin fluorescence          induced by IQ peptides suggesting that IQ peptides could          bind to Alexacalmodulin at two sites including one          where unlabeled calmodulin could not bind Indeed          binding of IQ peptides to both sites on a single          fluorescent calmodulin could account for Hill          coefficients of  seen in some experiments eg          Figs Band  Nevertheless these discrepancies should          not prevent use of Alexacalmodulin for measuring          interaction with calmodulins targets particularly if          the interaction with unlabeled calmodulin is compared to          the interaction with Alexacalmodulin          Calmodulin bound to peptides corresponding to each of          the four Myoc IQ domains although with differing          affinity and Ca sensitivity Affinities for calmodulin          binding to IQ and IQ were relatively modest K           d values of  M As with other IQ          domains     Ca weakened the affinity of calmodulin          for IQ and IQ by more than fold          By contrast calmodulin binding to IQ was slightly          stronger and was affected much less by Ca  Because          calmodulin binds strongly to classic IQ domains only in          the absence of Ca       its strong binding to          IQ in the presence of Ca suggests the participation of          an additional Ca requiring binding motif Two common          calmodulinbinding motifs called  and  for          the pattern of hydrophobic aminoacid residues require          Ca for calmodulin binding     IQ has two nearly          perfect  domains that are at  net charge instead          of the minimum  in the consensus     In addition          IQ has a  motif with a proline residue at position           instead of phenylalanine isoleucine leucine valine          or tryptophan Because most proteins that bind calmodulin          through the  and  motifs do so strongly the          relatively modest affinity of IQ for calmodulin in the          presence of Ca suggests that calmodulin binds through          one of these imperfect motifs located within this IQ          domain To interact with an alternate set of residues Ca          calmodulin must adopt a new conformation A similar Ca          dependent rearrangement was predicted for the complex          of calmodulin and the first IQ domain of myosina          brushborder myosin I              In support of this view we observed evidence for Ca          dependent conformational changes in calmodulin while          bound to IQ peptides When Alexacalmodulin was bound to          Myoc IQ peptides its fluorescence was higher in the          presence of Ca than in its absence suggesting that          that Ca bound Alexacalmodulin binds to the IQ          peptides in a different conformation than does Ca free          Alexacalmodulin For example in the absence of Ca           Alexacalmodulin may bind to IQ peptides in a more          compact conformation quenching fluorescence by burying          dye moieties in a less polar environment Although the Ca          induced conformational change could be a property of          Alexacalmodulin rather than calmodulin itself the Ca          dependent changes in affinity of calmodulin for IQ          and IQ Table  and calmodulins likely shift to a new          binding site on IQ suggests that the conformational          change is probably also a property of authentic          calmodulin          Calmodulin also bound to a newly identified domain          IQ Because the affinity of calmodulin for IQ is very          weak calmodulin should only occupy IQ in subcellular          locations with a low Ca concentration and a high level          of free calmodulin For example a small population of          Myoc molecules with calmodulin bound to IQ should be          present in the stereocilia of innerear hair cells which          contain  M free calmodulin     Although most          tissues contain less free calmodulin              concentrations in other individual organelles can reach          the millimolar range     On the other hand the weak          affinity of this IQ domain for calmodulin suggests that          IQ may play another role such as interacting with          another protein                          Calmodulin interaction with Myoc          The binding affinities of calmodulin for the          individual IQ peptides do not reflect exactly the          affinities of calmodulin for the IQ domains within Myoc          For example despite micromolar K           d values for calmodulinIQ peptide          interactions calmodulin remains bound to Myoc during          long gelfiltration or centrifugation experiments even          at nanomolar Myoc concentrations Fig  This result          suggests that calmodulin binds to some of Myocs four          tandem IQ domains substantially more strongly than to the          individual peptides For example other regions of Myoc          could constrain the IQ domains in conformations that are          substantially more or less favorable for calmodulin          binding than the population of conformations adopted by a          soluble IQ peptide Moreover calmodulin binding to Myoc          could be influenced by interactions with adjacent          calmodulin molecules or to the Myoc head or tail          domains          To examine calmodulin binding to IQ domains in Myoc          we determined the molecular mass and hence          calmodulinMyoc stoichiometry and shape of Myoc under          the appropriate conditions of temperature and Ca           Although analytical ultracentrifugation is more commonly          used to measure molecular size of proteinprotein          complexes     we instead used classic hydrodynamic          methods of velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients to          obtain sedimentation coefficients and gel filtration to          obtain Stokes radius One advantage of this approach was          that by detecting Myoc using a sensitive ELISA method          we were able to use very low concentrations of Myoc          Furthermore we were able to carry out sedimentation in          the presence of a high concentration of calmodulin a          manipulation that prevents Myoc detection in a standard          analytical ultracentrifugation experiment A disadvantage          of this approach was the need for high concentrations of          sucrose which in rare conditions can substantially          affect the hydrodynamic properties of a protein              nevertheless changes in Myoc size were observed both in          velocity sedimentation in the presence of sucrose and          in gel filtration in its absence Another disadvantage          of our classic approach to molecularmass determination          was that the gel filtration and velocity sedimentations          were done on different time scales  hour vs           hours If calmodulin slowly dissociated during the          analysis which in both assays diluted Myoc well below           M the degree of dissociation would be larger in the          velocity sedimentation experiments than in the gel          filtration experiments Nevertheless our approach was          validated by the demonstration that the number of          calmodulins per TMyoc was identical in hydrodynamic          and gelscanning experiments at least in EGTA at          C          Because TMyoc mimicked properties of the          fulllength protein except under lowtemperature          highCa conditions we exploited the necktail          construct for a more detailed analysis of calmodulin          binding As expected from the large Ca dependent          weakening of calmodulin affinity for IQ and IQ Fig           Table  Ca decreased the number of calmodulins bound          to TMyoc at high ionic strength When Ca was low          at C each TMyoc had about two bound calmodulins          with a third bound if the calmodulin concentration          reached  M At this calmodulin concentration IQ          domains   and  are likely occupied by calmodulin          When Ca is high at C all but one calmodulin          dissociated from TMyoc in the presence of  M free          calmodulin The strong affinity of IQ for Ca          calmodulin suggests that the remaining calmodulin was          bound to this IQ domain          How many calmodulins are bound to Myoc in the cell at          increased Ca concentrations The elevated ionic          strength used for the hydrodynamic analysis probably          weakened the affinity of the calmodulin for IQ Fig          A requiring  M free calmodulin to maintain occupancy          of that site We therefore infer that at a          physiologically significant temperature and at a cellular          ionic strength Ca triggers release of calmodulins from          IQ and IQ from TMyoc leaving only IQ occupied          Although these results contrast with those reported for          mammalian Myoc where only one of three calmodulins is          released by Ca       our T construct lacks          Myocs motor domain It is entirely plausible that even          in the presence of Ca  calmodulin remains bound to          IQ albeit in a different conformation and dependent on          interactions with the myosin head Our results therefore          suggest that Ca either induces the release of          calmodulin from IQ or causes it to change its          interaction with Myoc substantially          Of the three calmodulins bound to Myoc one of these          binds relatively weakly at C even in EGTA To which          IQ domain does this weakly bound light chain bind          Although calmodulin binds to IQs  with approximately          the same strength in the presence of EGTA we suggest          that the readily released calmodulin is likely to be that          bound to IQ To bind three calmodulins IQs  each of          which are only  amino acids long must be arranged          without kinks     this arrangement may produce          unfavorable strain on each of the calmodulin molecules          Release of calmodulin from IQ would relieve all of that          strain release from IQs  or  would not Strain relief          also may accelerate calmodulin release in the presence of          Ca  because Ca apparently rearranges the          threedimensional interaction of calmodulin with IQ          binding of an adjacent calmodulin  on IQ  might be          destabilized even more              Despite the loss of calmodulin from TMyoc induced          by elevation of the temperature from C to C the          frictional ratio a measure of the proteins asymmetry          increased Table  The necktail region of Myoc thus          appears to adopt a compact structure at C becoming          more extended at C Less calmodulin may be released at          lower temperatures because the Myoc tail may bind to and          stabilize calmodulins interaction with the Myoc          neck                          Implications for Myoc activity          The Ca dependent change in interaction of          calmodulin with IQ the IQ domain closest to the motor          domain has important implications for Myoc          mechanochemical function Although Ca increases Myoc          ATPase activity the ion completely halts           in vitro motility     Ca          dependent changes in conformation may prevent          amplification of a small converterdomain movement into a          large motor step In the presence of an external force          as is seen by Myoc during an excitatory mechanical          stimulus in a hair cell     Ca which enters the          cell through open transduction channels should permit          Myoc to go through its ATPase cycle binding and          unbinding from actin but the altered interaction of          calmodulin and IQ may prevent force production by the          motor We predict that Ca will decrease the stiffness          of a Myocactin interaction preventing coupling of the          energy released by ATP hydrolysis to the swing of the          neck     This behavior will assist Myoc in its role          of adaptation in hair cells where the motor reduces          force applied to the hair cells transduction          channel          A limitation of our experiments is the restriction of          Myoc binding to a single type of light chain          calmodulin Other light chains can interact with IQ          domains including essential light chain isoforms             and calmodulinlike protein     Although purified          bovine adrenal Myoc does not appear to have alternative          associated light chains     we can not rule out the          possibility that other light chains bind in a cellular          context Nevertheless purified recombinant fulllength          Myoc associated with calmodulin light chains exhibited          actinactivated ATPase activity and motility           in vitro     indicating that          calmodulin can function as a Myoc light chain          That Myoc does not bind calmodulin tightly is at          first glance surprising Weak calmodulin binding may          however permit access of IQ domains to intracellular          Myoc receptors Accordingly we have found that a Myoc          fragment containing only IQs  partially complexed          with calmodulin binds avidly to haircell receptors          excess calmodulin blocks this interaction probably by          binding to an unoccupied IQ site on the Myoc fragment              IQ is highly conserved between species leading          us to propose that haircell receptors interact through          this region     Because Myocinteracting proteins          in hair cells and elsewhere may interact through IQ          domains regulation of calmodulin binding to Myoc  for          example by Ca  likely affects coupling of the motor          protein to its cargo                            Conclusions        Under low Ca conditions and normal ionic strength        calmodulin binds moderately tightly to three Myoc IQ        domains IQ IQ and IQ IQ will only be occupied when        the calmodulin concentration is very high When linearly        arranged in the Myoc molecule at least one calmodulin        most likely that bound to IQ is bound less tightly        probably due to steric constraints Upon binding Ca         calmodulin bound to IQ dissociates that bound to IQ        either dissociates or changes its conformation sufficiently        that chemomechanical coupling cannot ensue

manufacturer          Alexacalmodulin had two dye moieties per calmodulin          molecule the modified residues were likely Lys and          Lys the most reactive of calmodulins lysine residues              After incubation for  hours at room          temperature we transferred  l of the solution to          another well plate and measured fluorescence          excitation  nm emission  nm using a BMG          Labtechnologies Fluorostar  microplate fluorometer          Durham NC Under the assay conditions the          innerfilter effect absorption of excitation or emission          photons by the sample was negligible From this          measurement we calculated the amount of calmodulin bound          to the conjugated peptides In some experiments we also          included  M unconjugated IQ peptide in that          case we carried out duplicate control reactions in          underivatized well plates to correct for fluorescence          quenching exerted by IQ peptides                          Peptide  calmodulin interaction by fluorescence          quench          We used empirically observed changes in the          fluorescence intensity of Alexacalmodulin large in          magnitude to measure binding of IQ peptides to          calmodulin Peptides and  nM Alexacalmodulin were          mixed in  or well microtiter plates with  mM          KCl  mM MgCl              M EGTA

well plates          After  hours at room temperature fluorescence was          read directly          When IQ peptides bound to Alexacalmodulin the          fluorescence intensity was reduced as the quantum yield          decreased fluorescence quenching We assumed that two          fluorescent species were present Alexacalmodulin and IQ          peptidebound Alexacalmodulin and that the fluorescence          intensity            I  was a linear combination of the          fluorescence of the two species                    I            f           CaM           I           CaM            f           CaMIQ           I           CaMIQ           where           f           CaM and           f           CaMIQ are the mole fractions of the          two components and           I           CaM and           I           CaMIQ are their fluorescence          intensities Because the quantum yield of          Alexacalmodulin is reduced when IQ peptides bind           I           CaMIQ            I           CaM  The fraction of peptide bound          is                    To calculate K           d  we fit the data with a          bimolecularbinding isotherm                    where IQ was the free IQpeptide concentration          added Because we used concentrations of Alexacalmodulin          in our experiments that were much less than the K           d  we approximated IQ using the          total IQ peptide concentration          In other cases however the binding data were fit          better with a modified Hill equation                    where           h is the Hill coefficient A value          for           h greater than one suggests the          fluorescence change arose from a more complex equilibrium          than just one peptide binding per calmodulin          To carry out stoichiometrictitration experiments          calmodulin concentration greater than the K           d  we used a low concentration of          Alexacalmodulin as a reporter and added an excess of          unlabeled calmodulin For simplicity in analysis we          assumed that Alexacalmodulin behaved identically to          calmodulin and thus this calmodulin mixture was          equivalent to a decrease in specific activity          fluorescence quench of calmodulin We then solved the          bimolecularbinding isotherm to enable us to plot the          total ligand

        CaMIQ           where           m is the number of binding sites          per calmodulin and CaM is the fixed concentration of          calmodulin The free concentration of IQ peptide            F  was           T            B  We substituted the expression          for           B in equations  and           into                    Note that           n CaM is the maximum amount of IQ          peptide that can bind B           max  We then solved equation  for          fluorescence intensity using Mathematica  Wolfram          Research Champaign IL                    For           m   the only free parameters          were K           d and           I           CaMIQ  We were forced to include           I           CaMIQ as one of the fit parameters          the limited solubility of IQ peptides in the assay          solution prevented us from using very high peptide          concentrations that would independently establish its          value by producing a plateau in the           T vs           I plot We then used the value of           I           CaMIQ determined from the           m   fit and refit the data for           m   using K           d as the only free parameter To judge          the stoichiometry we compared by eye the effectiveness          of the fit under the two conditions                          Baculovirus constructs          Using methods

preloading of TMyoc  M          purified calmodulin was incubated with  M Myoc in a          solution containing either  M EGTA or  M CaCl            for  min at room temperature prior          to centrifugation                          Determination of molecular mass          We used the modified Svedberg equation for          molecularmass determination                    where           M

 coefficient measurements To calculate error in          calmodulin stoichiometry we used the conservative          assumption that all error in the molecularmass          measurement was due to variability in the number of          calmodulins          The frictional ratio was determined from                    where           f is the frictional coefficient of          the Myoccalmodulin complex and           f            is the frictional coefficient of a          sphere of equal volume Accordingly the frictional ratio          of a globular protein will be  that of an elongated

Image version           The concentration of the TMyoc heavy chain was          determined by measuring absorbance at  nm although          the analysis was complicated by the uncertain calmodulin          stoichiometry            p  To circumvent this problem we          solved several simultaneous equations for           p  The molar extinction          coefficient of the TMyoccalmodulin complex
