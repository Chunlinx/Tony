                                 Too Much of a Good Thing            One wouldnt have expectedto see or hear the word in the coverage of Princess Dianas tragic deaththeevent was too sad the word too impolitebut it might have claimed alegitimate place in the coverage of the coverage or at least in thecommentaries about the coverage of the coverage As far as I can tell howeverthe word overhype was nowhere to be found It was like an embarrassingrelative sent off to the country whose presence lingered nonetheless            In aculture in which the words of our time have become synonymous with of thepast year or so overhype a noun and verb meaning an excessive amountof hype  a term which itself connotes an excessive amount oforchestrated publicityhas evolved to describe one of the distinctivecharacteristics of our time It is of course ubiquitous in the world of sporteven though Irabu never displayed his overhyped mph fastball of fashionTommy Hilfiger the overhyped American designer of trade overhyped andovermarketed product and of celebrity in general a brief and she saysoverhyped liaison with John F Kennedy Jr but it has filtered down tounimaginable levels much as a grande caff latte can now be had in thecoal fields of West Virginia Not long ago a newspaper column in the NewOrleans TimesPicayune  about fishing rods contained the followingsentence Nothing has been overhyped more in recent years than the value ofball bearings in reel construction            Overhype is a thoughtprovoking term the provocationoccurring unintentionally and in two ways The first is etymological Myfellow Slate columnist Robert Wright asked me recently Isnt it slightlyabsurd to apply the prefix over to something whose Greek root meansunder  As Wright knows the hype in overhype probablycomes from hypodermic  as in needle the components of that termderiving from Greek words meaning under the skin Hypodermic led tothe slang term hypo  and the association of needles with drug use gaverise to hype in the sense of artificial stimulant which is the directancestor of hype as employed in advertising and the communicationsmedia Given the rollercoaster ride of celebrity that overhyping bothpromotes and describes the strippeddown overunder meaning of the word maybe weirdly appropriate Note An alternative etymology of hype wouldderive the word from the Greek hyper  meaning over so that tooverhype something is to overover itmore straightforwardly logicalbut not nearly as evocative in my view            The secondprovocation is conceptual How does one match up this term and its variants hype  underhype  with a corresponding reality Overhypeimplies there is some normal level of hypeness like body temperature orblood pressure which in healthy individuals and societies maintains a certainconstancy but which can rise or fall to dangerous levels But hypeitself means intentional excess to create attention  Websters New WorldDictionary of Media and Communications  implying that the normal level isby definition excessive Underhype  to pursue this line of thoughtcould thus refer to a level that is subnormal but nonetheless sufficient tosustain life            Apossibly fruitful tangent would be to explorethe relationship between hypeness and other terms that calibrate degreesof public recognition For example I received a postcard some while agoannouncing an exhibition of artists who are said to be underknown implyingthat knownness  like hypeness  has a normative dimension Iimagine that only after attaining the level of being fully known can onethen reach for the low rung of underhyped             The concepts ofoverrated and underrated inevitably intersect with thisdiscussion because to be described as either of these things one must displaya degree both of knownness and of hypeness In the movie Manhattan  theWoody Allen character learns that the characters played by Diane Keaton andMichael Murphy have invented something they call the Academy of the Overratedand have filled it with among others Mahler Jung and Fitzgerald            Keaton Lenny Bruce  wecant forget Lenny Bruce can we How about Norman MailerAllen These peopleare all terrificeveryone that you mentioned Murphy You had a great oneKeaton No I didnt have itit was yours  it was Heinrich BllMurphy Oh God we didnt want to leave out old Heinrich AllenOverrated Gee what about Mozartyou guys wouldnt want to leave outMozartI mean as long as youre trashing people Keaton Oh well how aboutVincent Van Gogh Or Ingmar Bergman            The permutations of ratedness are complex It is ofcourse easy to think of figures who are both overrated and overhyped A farmore noble category consists of those who are underrated and underhyped Themost difficult category to conceive though it does exist is that of figureswho are underrated and also overhyped With some trepidation I float the nameSylvester Stallone            Now that hypeness hasbroadened into a full spectrum from underhyped to overhyped  theconcept may be ready for scientific quantification There is precedent for thisnot only in the hard sciences where one would expect it but also in thesocial sciences and humanities Thus much as we have a unit of heat calledthe calorie  and a unit of light called the lumen  socialscientists have devised a unit of pain called the dukkha  from the Paliword for suffering Art historians employ a unit of beauty the helen derived from words addressed to Helen of Troy in the Marlowe play DrFaustus  Is this the face that launched a thousand ships and burned thetopless towers of Ilium A millihelen  then is the amount of beautythat would launch a single ship            The basicunit of hype would have to be the warhol  and obviously it would beequivalent to fifteen minutes of fame A thousand warhols could be akilowarhol or perhaps a jewell  after Richard Jewell the manwho generated news reports for months despite having failed to participate inthe bombing at the  Olympic Games in Atlanta A milliwarhol  orabout ninetenths of a second of fame might appropriately be named after thetyke whose rescue became a brief focus of attention last summer after he fellthrough the hole of an outhouse Ninetenths of a second unfortunately washow long his name remained in my memory            Amatter that bears watching how closely thelanguage and dynamics of hype come to resemble those of arms controlOverhype is in its way a strategically brilliant term It suggeststhat anyone who finds overhype unreasonable speaks with a voice ofmoderationCmon enough is enoughwhile at the same time setting theceiling at a level far higher than what any ordinary person would findacceptable or sufficient
