        okay  okay well i think this is going to probably be the most difficult topic that ive discussed so far yes well have you returned anything lately     really you know i just did last week as a matter of fact um im wondering if their subject is more uh products by mail or things that you buy at the store but um i bought something through the mail through a merchant through a company thats generally got pretty good products and i was really impressed with the way they handled the return policy they sent UPS to our door to pick it up free of charge  which is such a an unusual always have to go to the       post office or some place to return it usually   uhhuh was this Spiegel by any chance   it was Hannah Anderson the childrens um clothing     dont know  that one i know Spiegel does that and yes and uh to me thats very impressive to think that   do they it really is   but well and did you have any problem obviously had no problem with returning it   it took a while because it was the holiday weeks um   oh well   it was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive were were fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home so he was here but it wouldve probably been an inconvenience if if it had been a home pickup and and we hadnt been here but they were also willing to pick up at work   umhum did did you return it because it was defective or because you just didnt like it   it was defective we returned it for the same thing um in a little larger size but it seemed that it was stitched uh around the collar such that the second time she wore it it uh it ripped   huh   and and i think thats unusual for that company because they do usually have pretty good products but to to answer the question that we were posed about whether things tend to be poor quality i think definitely i think a lot of the things that um are not necessarily low price tend to be manufactured in a lot of cases as if they were lower priced   well i know what you mean because a couple years ago i remember i was in one of the nicer department stores and looking at it was one of the designer Tshirts or some sort of thing like that and the thing   umhum   it was very expensive you know as they always are and it was a piece of junk you know stitching was terrible i think that they were trying to just you know play on a name   yeah exactly yeah and it its unfortunate you really cannot depend on the the department stores name for that necessarily i dont know if you have Nordstroms in Dallas   umhum no we dont ive been to one of the Nordstroms in um uh New York   umhum   nice store   they are really nice stores and i think i assumed in the beginning that they would probably carry carry overall pretty good merchandise you you have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store   do you really   yeah surprisingly   do you have Lord and Taylor there   no   um uh were originally from Saint Louis and we came down to Dallas and they have Lord and Taylors here and i look at a lot of their house brands and i am very impressed with the quality of some of the house brands in some of the stores   umhum umhum   does Nordstroms carry their own house brand     um you know i dont know that i bet they probably do but i im not sure that ive associated some of what ive seen as lines that they always carry as their own brand or just something that theyve um gotten at a at a lower uh price because its a large volume some of their childrens lines   umhum umhum   i tend to look there for kids things because they dont they they sometimes have things that you cant find elsewhere because they have a pretty large variety but not often for myself   do you shop by mail quite a bit   not that much actually i  used to i think before i had a child and because you end up paying for the shipping and handling and everything um   its not as inexpensive   and you dont always have the convenience of returning it if its not right uh i i tend less often to do that today than i mightve ten years ago   umhum thats the only problem that i see because uh my sister gets tons of catalogs and passes them on to me and i look at things and they have some gorgeous clothes but the problem is that   umhum   you cant always go by sizes you know youll go to a department store and try on three different sizes in three different manufacturers and they all fit you know differently but uh thats the main thing is that i cant tell   exactly umhum umhum   whether the thing is going to fit or not   umhum   and so i tend not to mail order   whereas you might take a chance in a store and bring it home and consider it you   but i   you find that its a lot more inconvenient to have to have to arrange for returning it if its by mail   well personally i always try on before i buy anyway i just it amazes me when i talk to people that they buy like they buy a bunch of clothes and they dont try anything on they take them home   oh really no i meant even if youve tried it on i im thinking about some clothes buying for kids or your husband or something it   oh okay well thats a different story right   yeah it is funny you know im also amazed at uh that i read about those i dont know anybody who does this but that people buy clothes and wear them and then think that they can return them   i hear about that too and that just appalls me i mean thats stealing really     thats what
