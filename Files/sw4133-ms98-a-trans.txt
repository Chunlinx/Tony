        so um       you know my feeling is that uh its really being used today it it you know it it really isnt doing any real good purpose for anything because its not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal   right i think ive seen some statistics that say that uh its more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life     right because you you youve got all all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses   right   um and you know it certainly doesnt seem to be a deterrent um for one thing because its used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly dont think the people that are committing the crimes crimes that would be eligible you know really care   well thats committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think theyre not going to get caught or   right i mean its kind of like the AIDS phenomenon you know im invulnerable i dont need to care about this you know i i im never gonna get caught   yeah but yeah but you also have to think whether its worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like uh Jeffrey Dahmer do you want by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again   yeah one one way or another   whereas if you kill him  there is not that possibility   yeah but but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life theres a chance that he might do things in prison or you know and somehow redeem himself   yeah i dont think he could ever redeem himself but in some cases yes   well you you know so that you know the the question is you know the other question problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you gonna do about people who are later found to have been innocent you know there are cases where  you know twenty thirty years after the fact theyre getting evidence   yeah   especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence and then oops im sorry i guess we killed the wrong guy   yeah its its yeah once youve made a decision that way its a little difficult to go back on it     right you you can apologize nicely but you know you know i think you know the the price you know it ive heard quotes you know its better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned i think it is really the the philosophy of the way our legal system works   oh yeah yeah its all the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is uh based on the uh person who is accused   yeah and you know the i i think that you know and the way its being used now its like you listen to Bushs you know well where are we gonna impose drug you know its like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in Tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer   right   and again i dont think these people care they risk their lives everyday   yeah that there there they see that the profit margin of drug dealers the profit margins so high       that yeah the the risk is almost not there   yeah and and you know uh especially you know i live in in Massachusetts you know were were were gonna get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something   yeah   so you know but you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like Texas or someplace that does you know it it its impossible to make a case that its its affecting it in any way i think its mainly people like they get the vengeance of it   yeah well its also i used to live in Georgia and you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment   because you know     but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed its very racially related and ethnically related   oh yeah its mainly lot of blacks also a lot of young people you know your a a  a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what ive seen   right   and you know i i think when you listen to like the uh the the victims families and things theyre always talking about you know uh feeling justified or feeling you know like theyve gotten something out of it i mean my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever or if he gets killed it shouldnt make any difference to the uh to the victims family the only thing that should really i mean obviously if someone of mine who was close died id probably feel differently but   right   you know the you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society   right and that and you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we dont currently do this of making restitution   right i mean the   you you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victims family   right and the the other thing is that you know i was reading through a book on uh genome human genome research and now more and more things like schizophrenia   umhum   and what if it just turned out to be genetic or biochemical in origin so if someday we can go to Jeff Dahmer and say well the problem is you youve got an endorphin imbalance and you know if you take this regularly youll be a sane and productive member of society   right uhhuh   you know you really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions   yeah well i i think on some of it you have to say someones responsible for his actions i never like the uh   society made me do it yeah   the defense that well i never liked the uh insanity defense
