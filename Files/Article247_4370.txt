                                 Andrew Sullivan Flat Wrong on Flat Tax                        In his New York Times Magazine piece last Sunday arguingfor the virtues of a flat tax Andrew Sullivan suggested that the flat taxwould be the central political reform of the next decade in part because itfit so well with Americas supposed newfound love of simplicity As theTimes subhead put it the flat tax is the perfectartifact of our oneclick era For Sullivan the byzantine nature of thecurrent tax system benefits the wealthy who can afford to pay people todecipher it And all the loopholes make a nominally progressive system muchless fair than it appears and much less fair than a onesizefitsall systemIn fact Sullivan suggests a onerate system is an answer to liberalismswoes because by treating every taxpayer alike it would eliminate so much ofthe complexity and indebtedness to special interests that make people hategovernment            Actually though even if the current system is nominally progressive itsmuch more progressive than any flat taxno matter what reforms accompanyitcould ever be Under any flattax system the wealthy will pay much less intaxes than they now do and therefore everyone else will account for a muchhigher proportion of tax revenue Sullivan wants to tax all capital gains atthe same rate as income and the numbers would be skewed even more by thatSullivan says that the idea that a flat tax is a giveaway to the rich is akneejerk response But it is a giveaway to the rich As for the ideathat the wealthy benefit from the current system because they can trick ittheres zero evidence for that The percentage of revenue paid by those in thetop  percent of incomeearners has risen steadily throughout the decade justas you would expect to happen in an era when the rich have gotten muchricher            Sullivan may really believe that rich people should get to keep as much oftheir money as possibleactually he does believe thisbut if he does heshould come out and say it and not try to disguise the argument as somehowabout correct process or the imaginary salvation of liberalism Nor should hepaint the flat tax as flowing logically from Americans embrace of simplicityEspecially since Sullivan has completely imagined this embrace            The irony in fact is that the flat tax is the perfect relic of an era whena lack of computing power and of information made it difficult to makemeaningful distinctions between groups of people let alone individuals Buttoday the trend is in the exact opposite direction from the one Sullivanconjures up When it came to pay we used to live in a world of jobclassifications and pay grades where everyone who did the same work got thesame pay Increasingly we now live in a world of dramatic differentiation inpay The whole idea of a pay grade in fact would seem like completenonsense at most Silicon Valley and Internet companies            The same is true in marketing and manufacturing Sullivan argues thatcompanies today try to project a simple image a single product and arecognizable simple brand and to be sure theres plenty of nonsense outthere about the centrality of the brand But whats really going on is the movetoward customization Dell builds my computer literally to order Amazon makesrecommendations to me based on other things that Ive bought not basedon what the masses are buying Toyota is already talking about building customcars Of course there will always be a place for the Gap with its piles ofkhakis and white Tshirts and for Coke with its onetasteforall soda Butcompanies are getting much better not worse at treating each consumerdifferently which means in some sense becoming a different company foreveryone who buys from them            The same sort of finegraining is going on with prices Once when you tookan airline flight you could be fairly certain that most of the people on theplane paid the same price for their tickets that you did for yours Today youcan be fairly certain most people paid different prices And thats not becauseof Pricelinecom Its because airlines have gotten increasingly adept at usingcomputers to distinguish between different kinds of fliers and chargingdifferent kinds of fliers different fares On the Internet shopping enginesperform the same function in reverse while Priceline has taken the idea ofdifferential pricing to its marketdriven extreme And what is eBay if not theantithesis of fixed pricing There are places where onepricefitsall thinkingrules like in the current longdistance market But even there consumershappily leap from plan to plan and bargain with longdistance providers to cutspecial deals The real onepricefitsall days in fact were the days whenonly ATT provided long distance And I dont hear too many people callingfor the return of Ma Bell anymore            If anything then a tax system in which everyone paid his or her ownparticular tax rate would be more in tune with our world and the possibilitiescreated by the computer than the flat tax There are though excellenteconomic and political reasons not to want that finegrained a system Aculture and economy of simplicity I dont think things have ever been morecomplex
