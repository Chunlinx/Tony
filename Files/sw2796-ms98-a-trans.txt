        well i currently dont have a pet although uh i have in the past   oh you dont have one   not right now we   i have a cat and a dog both   oh my gosh well you should have a lot to talk about then   yeah   but uh well no the place i live in is a little too small right now for uh for a pet i hate to hate to keep a dog or something like that and not have enough room for it to run around in so   yeah   but uh i guess you dont have that problem at least with the cat   no i have i have a house that uh has a a fairly good sized yard and uh i also im here by at night by myself because my husband works at night and   umhum   so i i wanted a dog for protection and we   i can imagine   and we got a Dalmatian   thats a pretty big dog   yeah and he   thats a pretty dog though   hes wonderful because uh hes really protective   umhum   and uh that was probably our main reason for getting him but   hows hows he like the cat or hows the cat like the dog i guess it   oh he loves the cat the dog uh Sam our Dalmatian loves the cat but the cat just really doesnt care about the dog at all       you know hell slap at him and hiss at him and everything and the cat stays in all the time  so   uhhuh   thats a uh you know barrier there but yeah   i guess its a good reason to to have a pet then as protection i guess is one thing   hm yeah it is   but uh i guess i theyre a lot of company though yeah friendship theyre an awful lot of company   friendship yeah yeah oh Sam is very loving if if one of us are out in the yard you know he wants to jump and play and lick a typical puppy type atmosphere although hes   umhum   almost two years old but   oh gee   um yeah the cat is a lot of companionship   umhum   he just hes real old and he kind of lays around just wants you pet him and and that kind of thing   doesnt doesnt get too excited about anything   no not at all not at all   hes not one of those cats that like to sit on top of the television is he   no  my mom has a cat though that does that   umhum   and thats kind of weird we havent figured that out yet   yeah ive ive noticed how they get black cats it seems like they always wanna sit on top of the television set and let their tail only when when theres something you really want to see then they let their tail down in front of the TV set in front of the screen and uh   yeah   they they just seem to know i guess   just intuition or something instinct in a way   but uh it it sounds like you have pretty normal pets though i guess uh you know a lot of people i mean i guess ive never cared for birds or fish or um or gerbils or anything like that but dogs and cats are about the only thing i think of when i think of pets   uhhuh yeah ive ive never had any the ones that you just mentioned i have had a rabbit   umhum   it was pretty interesting and it was like a cat it stayed in the house all the time and it used a litter box   umhum yeah   so it had free run of the house   was it as was it as friendly as a cat or do you do you think you uh   uh not not to strangers not strangers at all matter of fact it would run and hide but after it got to know you it was funny because it would jump up on the couch and sit right next to you you know and it kind of pants   umhum hm   i didnt know a rabbit panted but  they pant kind of like a dog   neither did i huh   and its kind of funny because you can just sit there and pet them and my rabbit got real large i think he was thirteen pounds   oh gee that is a big rabbit   so he was really big that was kind of funny looking   umhum but uh was   but he was a good guard   was he   yeah at he heard every little noise and you could tell when a car drove up or anything   but but hes not much protection i would imagine   oh no no no i dont think so   not not not an attack rabbit or anything like that   no nothing like that   not real protective but uh well i i guess thats about  to say about pets   okay thanks byebye   all right well very nice speaking to you byebye
