Massachusetts European newspapers clung hopefullyto that possibility Monday The Italian newspapers were particularly interestedin the mystery of Luciano Porcari which according to the Federal

named Luciano Porcari hijacked aSpanish plane in  and was sent briefly to prison for it But according toCorriere dellaSera of Milan the FAA seems not to know that the same Porcari nowaged  is currently in prison in Naples for a different crime He wasarrested in  for stabbing his girlfriend to death in the central Italiancity of Orvieto But if its not Porcari who is hiding behind his identitythe paper asked It is a mystery within a mystery            Another common urge was to associate the crash with Halloween The Washingtoncorrespondent of LaRepubblica of Rome began an overblown

departure of the last Indonesian troops from East Timorby describing Indonesias year war to keep control of the territory as anhistoric error But in an editorial Monday the paper was optimistic about thefuture With the kind of wise and democratic leadership that now exists inJakartaand hopefully in the near future also in Dilithere is every reasonto believe that a rapprochement is possible The Jakarta Post alsoquoted East Timorese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose RamosHorta as ridiculingclaims that East Timor would not be viable as a country on its own One doesnot have to be an Einstein to do slightly better than those incompetent lazycorrupt bastards who managed our country for  years Sometimes I find itlaughable that the Indonesian authorities keep telling us that East Timorcannot
