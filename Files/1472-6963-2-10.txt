                    Introduction                  Competition in California in the s a case          study          The implementation of selective contracting in          California in  offers a unique natural experiment to          study the response of hospitals to changes in the nature          of competition Unlike other health care markets in          which the change from quality to price based competition          was gradual driven by continuously increasing          penetration of managed care and often time confounded by          other secular trends the California legislation changed          market conditions very rapidly for all hospitals in the          state by permitting all health plans for the first time          to contract with only a subset of hospitals It thus          allows a prepost study design hospitals resource          allocation decisions during the quality competition          regime pre period can be compared to decisions made          during the price competition regime post period This          natural experiment allows us to test the hypothesis that          changes in the nature of competition are more likely to          be associated with a shift of resources from clinical to          hotel activities and a concomitant deterioration in          mortality outcomes in more competitive hospital markets          As the level of hospital competition has not changed          during the period the HerfindahlHirschman Index HHI          remained stable in all markets this test is limited to          the change in the           nature of competition and is not          confounded by the impact of changes in the level of          competition on resource allocation decisions          During the same time period California hospitals were          also subject for the first time to price regulation due          to implementation of the Medicare PPS While PPS also          provided hospitals with incentives to lower their costs          it did so in a distinctively different manner than price          competition The PPS set the price per discharge          hospitals were paid thus creating incentives to lower          costs irrespective of market structure  The          intensity of price based competition on the other hand          is highly sensitive to the competitiveness of the          hospital market The analytical strategy of this paper is          based on this distinction                          Hospital competition quality resource allocation          and health outcomes          Competition focused on prices as is often the case in          markets dominated by managed care creates incentives to          increase efficiency and possibly curtail resource use          With the exception of possible increases in          administrative activities designed to contain costs in          other areas eg billing and utilization review or to          increase marketing efforts such incentives to cut costs          are likely to affect all aspects of hospital          activities          Hospitals may also compete on quality both quality of          medical services and quality of hotel services and          amenities The importance of competition for quality is          likely to be greater in markets in which hospitals          compete for patients directly as they do for all          feeforservice patients and for those enrolled in HMOs          that offer a choice of hospitals within their market          Furthermore to the extent that HMOs make their          contracting decisions based on beneficiary hospital          preferences perceptions of quality are important          competitive tools          Competition for quality     unlike competition for          price     may lead to increased costs Furthermore          it may affect clinical and hotel services differently In          markets where patients choice of hospitals are          increasingly important hospitals are likely to compete          more on quality attributes that patients observe and          value Given the difficulty that patients have in          directly determining the quality of medical care they          receive and the relative ease with which they can          evaluate the quality of hotel services eg condition of          the facility quality of food hospitals face incentives          to shift resources from clinical activities to amenities          On the other hand if patients rely on their physicians          recommendations in choosing hospitals     and to the          degree that physicians can assess clinical quality          albeit imperfectly hospitals are faced with counter          incentives incentives that would promote resource use in          clinical activities rather than hotel services As a          result hospitals may face conflicting incentives          incentives to maintain or enhance the quality of hotel          services on the one hand and incentives to maintain          activities that contribute to the quality of clinical          care and health outcomes on the other The actual choices          that hospitals make about resource allocation depend on          the relative strength of these opposing incentives                          A model of changes in resource allocation          As the main hypothesis of interest is that the change          in the nature of competition was associated with changes          in hospital resource allocations the model we          hypothesize allows the marginal effects of market and          hospital characteristics X           t  on resource allocation Y           t  as measured by the coefficients          in a regression model            t  to vary over time                      Y                       t                                    t                                    t                      X                       t                                    t                      The models we estimated were difference models of the          form                       Y                X                                    t                        X            where  is the difference between year t and the base          year indicated by t   From  it follows that            t  the vector of coefficients          multiplying the change variables measures the marginal          effect of the variable in the end year while  the          vector of coefficients multiplying the level variables          measures the change in the marginal effect The marginal          relationship in year  is given by                                     t                                         Methods                  Sample          The initial sample included all  acute care          hospitals in California that were in operation during          both  and  Of those   were excluded          from the resource allocation analyses and   were          excluded from the mortality analyses because of          incomplete data                          Data sources          Financial ownership and utilization data were          obtained from the Hospital Annual Financial Disclosure          Reports filed annually by all California hospitals with          the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development          OSHPD Risk adjusted mortality data were obtained from          the Medicare Hospital Information Report published by the          Health Care Financing Administration                              Variable definitions                      I Resource allocation variables            Resource allocation was measured by expenditures per            adjusted discharge Adjusted discharges are a composite            measure of input designed to account for both inpatient            discharges and outpatient visits using the methodology            developed by the American Hospital Association            Expenditures per adjusted discharge were calculated            separately for three categories clinical hotel and            administrative services Expenditures were aggregated            by cost center with each cost center assigned to one            of the three services The table in the Additional            File Appendixlists all hospital cost centers and their            assignment to hotel clinical and administrative            categories The dependent variables in the resource            allocation analyses were defined as the differences in            expenditures per adjusted discharge between  and             for each of the three categories                                II Quality variables            The dependent variables for the analyses of quality            of clinical care were excess death rates from all            causes and from  specific medical conditions that have            relatively high death rates acute myocardial            infarction congestive heart failure pneumonia and            stroke We included in the analyses measures based on            cause specific mortality in addition to overall            mortality because prior studies    have shown that            these measures tend to be uncorrelated and that            hospitals performing well in one clinical area do not            necessarily perform well in others Measures based on            overall mortality may therefore be biased towards zero            showing less variation compared with cause specific            measures            Excess mortality was defined as the difference            between the observed mortality rate for the hospital            and a predicted risk adjusted mortality rate Observed            and predicted mortality rates were obtained from the            Medicare Hospital Reports     They are based on            Medicare discharges and include all deaths within             days of admission irrespective of the location of            death The risk adjustment methodology used by the            Health Care Financing Administration incorporates            individual patients age gender specific diagnoses            and comorbidities admission source emergency or            elective admission and the patients risk group based            on hospitalizations during the preceding  months                                               III Independent variables            Competition was measured by the HerfindahlHirschman            Index HHI defined as the sum of squared market            shares of all hospitals competing in the same area            Hospital market areas and the HHI were calculated based            on all payer zip code level patient flows as described            in Zwanziger et al                To control for financial pressures hospitals may            have been experiencing in addition to competition we            included variables measuring bad debt and charity as            percent of total revenues and percent occupancy To            control for potential economies of scale the estimated            models included total clinical standard units of            measures reported in the California Financial            Disclosure Reports Ownership indicator variables            included forprofit notfor profit public and notfor            profit district ownership The omitted category was            private notfor profit hospitals Teaching status was            defined as hospitals with some residents All payer            DRGbased case mix index was included to account for            differences in patients severity Median family income            measured for the hospitals zip code area was included            to capture demand effects and as a proxy for cross            sectional wage variations                                    Analyses          We estimated regression models in which change in          expenditures per adjusted discharge and excess mortality          in  were the dependent variables Because all models          were heteroskedastic all reported tests of significance          are based on Whites robust standard errors     The          Ramsey RESET test for specification errors    was          applied to all models to rule out the need for nonlinear          and interaction terms          The mortality models were weighted by the inverse of          the standard error for the predicted mortality rate to          account for differences across hospitals in the accuracy          of the excess mortality measures which are due to          differences in sample sizes              Since initial analyses indicated different          associations different s for forprofit and nonprofit          hospitals we estimated fully interacted models in which          all variables were interacted with forprofit status The          hypotheses of significant marginal effect were therefore          tested for the nonprofit hospitals by a t test of the          main effect and for the forprofit hospital by an F test          of the linear restriction that the sum of the          coefficients of the main and interaction effect are          zero          Additional file

hospitals          Table presents descriptive statistics for the          hospitals included in the study The majority of          hospitals  were private nonprofit with the second          largest group  being forprofit institutions          Fifteen point four percent were teaching hospitals The          average hospital size did not change significantly over          the  period remaining at  beds          Occupancies declined significantly from an average of           to  and inpatient case mix increased          significantly from  to  indicating that          hospitals were treating sicker and more expensive          patients at the end of the period Both total          expenditures and expenditures per adjusted discharge          increased significantly          The degree of competition among hospitals has not          changed between  and  The HHI of around           suggests that competition was limited Markets with HHI          values below  are considered moderately or very          competitive     The large variation in the HHI          however indicates that many hospitals were located in          competitive markets with  of hospitals in markets          with HHI below           Overall mortality rates averaged  Average observed          and predicted rates were very similar but the variation          in rates was higher for the observed rates compared with          the predicted rates suggesting substantial variations in          excess mortality and quality across the sample                          Resource allocation changes          Table

the          variation in expenditures per adjusted discharge while          the hotel and administrative services models explained           and  respectively                          Effect of competition          Table presents the marginal effect of competition          calculated from the regression results and using          equations  and  for  and  as well as the          change in these coefficients between the two years Note          that the regression coefficients for the HHI variable          were multiplied by  in table  such that a positive          association means that expenditures per discharge          increase with increased competition          Nonprofit hospitals in more competitive areas had          higher expenditures per adjusted discharge in all three          categories in all years The marginal effect was highest          in clinical areas and lowest in administrative services          It declined significantly over time in both clinical and          hotel services but not in administrative services The          decline was almost three times as large in the clinical          services compared with hotel services By  while the          marginal effect of competition on expenditures in these          services was still positive it was no longer          significantly different from zero These findings are          consistent with the hypothesis that the focus of          competition on quality in  has diminished          significantly over the sevenyear period we studied          The results for forprofit hospitals present a          different picture First the association between          expenditures per adjusted discharge and competition was          statically significant only for administrative services          This association was also by far the strongest It was          negative indicating that hospitals in more competitive          markets spent less per discharge on administrative          activities The marginal effect was slightly smaller in           suggesting that hospitals in more competitive areas          may have reallocated resources into administrative          services They may have for example invested in better          information and management systems that would allow them          to better control costs          The association between competition and resource use          was negative in clinical services and positive in hotel          services This is consistent with the hypothesis that          forprofit hospitals compete on quality in those areas          that can be easily observed by patients namely hotel          services and cut back on resources in clinical services          where quality is more difficult for patients to evaluate          directly The change over the  through  period is          also consistent with this hypothesis the negative          association between competition and clinical resources          increased in  as did the positive association between          hotel resources and competition The lack of significance          of the associations may reflect the smaller number of          forprofit hospitals in the sample and the resulting          lower statistical power There were  forprofit          hospitals and  independent variables compared with           nonprofit hospitals                          Other hospital and market characteristics          The strongest and most consistent relationship was          between all payer case mix and expenditures per adjusted          discharge in all categories see table  The          association was substantially stronger for the clinical          category and in nonprofit compared with forprofit          hospitals          Most other variables either exhibited no significant          associations or no clear patterns There were no          significant differences in resource allocations by          ownership Teaching status was positively associated with          clinical and hotel expenditures among the nonprofit          hospitals but exhibited a negative association among the          forprofit hospitals Percent bad debt and charity and          percent occupancy had no significant relationship with          expenditures among the nonprofit but were associated          with lower clinical and administrative expenditures among          the forprofit hospitals Median family income was          associated with higher expenditure levels for all          services among the nonprofit hospital but only with the          clinical services among the forprofits                          Risk adjusted excess mortality          Table reports the results of the regressions modeling          the association between excess mortality defined as the          difference between observed and predicted mortality rate          and clinical expenditures per adjusted discharge          competition ownership and teaching status The models          explained between  and  of the variation in excess          mortality In all cases there was a negative association          between clinical expenditure levels and excess mortality          implying that increased resources were associated with          better mortality outcomes This relationship was present          for mortality from all causes as well as from the four          specific causes and was statistically significant at the           level or better          Table shows the increase in excess mortality that is          associated with a decrease of  standard deviation SD          in clinical expenditures per adjusted discharge based on          the estimated regression coefficients For comparison          the table also provides the magnitude of  SD in excess          mortality among the study hospitals In all cases the          effect of a  SD in resources was less than a  SD in          excess mortality As expected due to the potential bias          towards zero in the measures based on all causes the          associations were larger for the cause specific          measures          As discussed earlier we hypothesized that competition          may affect quality including clinical quality not only          through its impact on resource use but also due to          incentives to compete on quality If indeed hospitals          were competing on clinical quality the association          between the HHI and excess mortality controlling for          resource use should have been positive and significant          In all cases except for pneumonia we did not find a          significant relationship In most cases there was also no          significant relationship between ownership or teaching          status and excess mortality                            Discussion        In this paper we present a test of the hypothesis that        changes in the nature of competition among California        hospitals resulting from selective contracting were        associated with changes in hospitals resource allocation        decisions We find empirical evidence to suggest that        resources have been shifted from clinical activities which        are not observed by patients and into hotel services        which are more readily observable These changes in        resource allocation tended to be larger in hospitals        located in more competitive areas As the level of        competition has not changed during the study period the        change in hospital behavior is likely to be a response to        the change in the nature of competition        The relationship between resource allocation and        competition differed by ownership Forprofit hospitals in        more competitive areas had lower expenditures levels        compared with those in less competitive areas Among        nonprofit hospitals we found the opposite  clinical        expenditures per adjusted discharge increased with        competition The trend over time however even though it        was much stronger among the nonprofit hospitals was the        same for both types For both the change in the marginal        effect of competition  was negative As a result the        positive association between competition and clinical        resource use among nonprofit hospitals diminished and the        negative association among the forprofit hospitals        increased        The analyses of excess mortality demonstrate that        clinical quality at least as measured here is positively        associated with the amount of resources used in producing        clinical services Therefore policies that create        incentives for hospitals to limit resource use are likely        to have an impact on health outcomes Furthermore as        clinical quality is not easily observable by consumers        leading to disparity in incentives to provide hotel and        clinical quality more competitive areas are likely to        experience a larger relative decline in resources allocated        to clinical activities and hence worse mortality        outcomes        The impact on health outcomes in nonprofit hospitals        may not be as large as it might have been because        expenditure levels were curtailed not only in clinical        areas but in hotel services as well although to a much        lesser degree This strategy spread the burden of cost        containment efforts beyond clinical activities If        nonprofit hospitals would have concentrated all their cost        cutting efforts in clinical services as did the forprofit        hospitals the impact on costs and potentially on        mortality outcomes would have been  higher see table                The generalizability of the findings presented here is        limited in several ways First quality was measured only        in terms of excess mortality While this is an important        aspect of quality it is likely to be an insensitive        measure Because measures based on mortality do not tend to        be correlated with measures based on other outcomes            such as complications one cannot deduce from this study        that other aspects of clinical quality have been affected        similarly by the changes in competition during the period        Furthermore the mortality models we estimated unlike the        expenditures models were cross sectional and are therefore        subject to the usual concerns about potential bias due to        omitted hospital specific effects It should be noted        however that the models did include the variables most        likely to be associated with excess mortality  patient        level risks expenditures competition ownership and        teaching status It should also be noted that while our        findings with respect to changes in resource allocation are        based on total expenditures thus reflecting care for all        patients the mortality outcomes are based on the        experience of Medicare patients only Prior studies        however suggest that patient care given by same provider        does not vary by payer status              A more important generalizability question arises due to        the sample selected for this study  namely hospitals        located only in California during the s Can the        behavior of hospitals observed in this local and during        this time period be assumed to generalize to other markets        and other times While the magnitude of the effects we        measure in this study are clearly not generalizable the        directions of the effects are likely to transcend time and        place as they reflect basic behavioral responses to market        incentives in accordance with theory While this sample        selection may be viewed as a limitation of this study it        is also its strength By focusing on a period in which        levels of competition were stable and where the change in        the nature of competition can be traced to a specific        legislative act this study is able to test for the        differential impact of price vs quality competition        without confounding by other factors                    Conclusion        In summary the results of this study should be viewed        as raising a cautionary question are the hospital cost        reductions that have been observed in California    and        nationally    associated with increased mortality                    Authors Contributions        DM designed the study performed the analyses and wrote        the manuscript AB prepared
