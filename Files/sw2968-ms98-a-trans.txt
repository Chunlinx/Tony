about uh uh oh ancient discoveries you know the how they found out like that uh ancient man performed performed uh brain surgery successfully stuff like that uhhuh   oh you mean the ancient astronauts things ive read some of that i i didnt quite some of that is uh it is very interesting without question i i dont really know that they have the answers in those books that they they make conclusions in them that may or may not be   uhhuh yes oh uhhuh   true but theyre very interesting that that theyve what theyve discovered     oh i like far out facts or whatever i like to read stuff like that but im a   yeah   superficial buff i cant think if they i just superficial  i like i like it if its fun i dont get too into it yeah   you are what kind of buff oh okay oh yeah right well im kind of a a hobbyist so i i read all those things that uh and being an engineer all those books that would bore everybody else you know how to do things   uhhuh yeah well   im one of those crazy people that reads the directions it always make my wife mad i   because you read it   when she ever theres something i say well have you read the directions no i hate reading the directions i say well engineers we we are the few people in the world that read the directions yeah       youre an engineer are you an engineer for TI   yeah   okay uh i worked at TI for a little while   umhum   uh weve got a book that says uh How Do They Do That and it answers everything   yeah oh really   yeah and ill read well not everything but a lot of silly little questions   oh yeah that   like what makes a firefly light you know   oh yeah those are oh interesting oh you like science things uh i havent gotten them in a long time what is that uh one thats on TV that book uh National Geographic is really a fascinating book uh uh if you ever get those or even   now yeah uhhuh well that dont   but i havent gotten them in years uh they they were kind of expensive i know people just collect them like theyre   yeah   uh they have wonderful pictures photographs and just amazing photographs that theyve done   yeah we used my little sister was blind and going to school and she would have to come home and i cut out different she wasnt fully blind just legally blind   um umhum yeah   but she would have to cut out different colors and that is the best book to go through those National Geographics   it is it is they they they uh the photographers just got fantastic fantastic pictures in those things uh   theyre great well now i do like National Geographic and stuff because i like i said i like reading about i dont know animals i love reading about animals   umhum   the gorillas and stuff and the sloth it fascinates me   yeah   thats something moves that slow   oh yeah   and its just weird   you know i havent uh of course it was it all books and things or was it anything say anything but newspapers ive forgotten what the question was exactly but uh what do you read i guess in general or   oh well yeah well we can talk about anything we want   yeah uh i i glance at all newspapers i do like uh since the read since the economy is doing so bad i never have read the uh uh financial pages more often than now you know and trying to analyze and look for some good news in in there you know uh to see if the   well for me theres no immediate well what you know the financial page doesnt hit me directly which im sure it does if i get into it but like i said i dont keep up on all that   well ive only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything i thought well uh see if theres anything in there that uh   yeah the   uh would be see positive you know you always look for things with this with this terrible recession that were in uh to see if theres any good   yeah with everything going down   oh yeah yeah its uh hopefully uh well recover here uh   yeah i know i heard Bush say that you know were either bottoming out or seem to be   yeah   but thats Bush saying it   yeah right and he he yeah i know i dont really know if uh any one person knows uh uh what some of the problems are uh but therere therere some therere some interesting things in the paper really   yeah well i like Ann Landers   yeah     no   i like getting the paper and reading the want ads and just i do skim over it   it   but mainly im a front page person i dont go into the details   yeah no i glance at it i i with with the uh so much uh you sound like you have a family too but with a family and everything theres just so much going on that i uh actually im more of a radio not more of a radio buff but uh its easier to do when i do some chores or yard work or anything put the radio on and listen to that and   well i know at TI they have most of the stuff on the printout dont they i mean on the computer where you can read the daily news   oh yeah i do every time i come in uh ill punch up but they call it T News and all that i i do get uh it gets a little bit of everything even the the last page is uh   uhhuh   is sport uh listings and and different things uh and world news you know about   uhhuh now when i worked   you can read it in one minute you know   huh when i worked at TI i read that more than i read the regular newspaper   umhum   because i would read that every day because youd find ten minutes here that you dont have anything to do i know you do being an engineer   yeah   there are sometimes when youve got ten or fifteen or even an hour off   yeah   not much not in the area i worked in  we had an engineer in there every ten minutes   yeah yeah   so   oh yeah it its it is uh interesting uh with the computer to read the computer news and all that i i guess thats uh       that that is a source of reading i hadnt thought about that in that respect uh   yeah well it just encouraged me to read it   oh yeah yeah it it does have a good uh simple uh you know again you can read it in uh a lot less than ten minutes its usually you can you you can page through   uhhuh yeah   i dont read everything on some of the stuffs pretty boring i i skip over some of that but uh       uh it is   well see thats me with the newspaper especially financial page   yeah yeah yeah well   i dont uh i read it so less and i watch so little TV i didnt even know what the deal was with this uh oh i i cant remember his name now him and his wife are getting divorced and hes a tycoon or something what is his name   oh yeah uh uh Trump Donald Trump yeah   yeah Trump i didnt even know i still dont know what the whole deal was with that   well i guess because he was so rich you know when youre that rich uh you always get into the paper whatever if you have a family problem whatever well he had a young girlfriend he was hes well into his forties and i guess he got a young girlfriend who uh and uh and then every every time you take you you are that rich you just get uh in the the in the news immediately immediately you know   yeah immediately so thats all it was he was just having an affair on his wife   uh which is tough well that and uh his business is going down the tubes so bad you know   huh   he was uh uh essentially like you said a tycoon uh Donald Trump and had it all he was high roller for about ten years and then he is now essentially bankrupt you know   oh thats got to be hard to go from really rich to poor   and so uh he yeah yeah   which im sure he aint poor   no right uh who knows uh what hes really got but uh he was kind of an arrogant arrogant guy so i think the newsmen uh enjoyed uh writing about him on his way down you know   yeah   and his wife was very uh uh seemed to be very smart and actually running some of his business it was uh she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his uh did very well   huh   Ivana Trump uh oh they theyve been on all the news and everything in the in the papers and uh on Barbara Walters and everything else   well see thats what i said i like i dont watch much TV anymore either   hum   but ive got three kids  so its hard to watch TV  except for Donald Duck   oh yeah i can imagine right   uh uh i know what you mean really uh   well  ive enjoyed talking to you   okay yeah well uh hang in there and good luck with those kids   yeah and have a good holiday byebye   right byebye
