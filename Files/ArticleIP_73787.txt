                                 Bill Bradleys SAT Scores            The papers of the late Kingman Brewster Jr whowas president of Yale in the s and s include a letter from one E AldenDunham III a former director of admissions at Princeton Dunham argued thatIvy League universities were overemphasizing the importance of SAT scores Forexample Dunham wrote consider a recent Princeton graduate named BillBradley            Here is a guy who graduated Magna Cum Laude inhistory the greatest basketball player in the Ivy Colleges Rhodes Scholarprobably a governor of Missouri somedayand all with a  verbal SAT            Bill Bradley thethinking presidential candidate scored a  verbal on his SAT Thats lowerthan George W Bush the allegedly slowwitted presidential candidate Asreported recently in The New Yorker  Bush got an SAT verbal score of            So what conclusions should we draw The importantconclusions arent about whether Bradley is really smart or Bush is reallydumb Theyre about ways in which these two are actually similar Above allboth of them are beneficiaries of affirmative action A  verbal would nothave gotten you into the Yale Class of  especially with mediocreprepschool grades if you werent also the sonand grandson for goodmeasureof a Yale alumnus Likewise a  verbal wouldnt get you into thePrinceton Class of  if you werent also a star basketball player            By thetime Bradley applied to college in the early s selective schools such asPrinceton and Yale viewed themselves as intellectual training grounds not theclubby enclaves of previous times In this new era a score below  on eitherthe verbal or math section of the SAT normally meant rejection A  NewYorker article described the case of an AfricanAmerican applicant to Yalewho was valedictorian and president of his highschool class and a stellarathlete to boot His application was rejectedbecause his  SAT averagewould certainly be the lowest in the entire Yale class But the cutoff pointwas more flexible for top athletes for alumni legacies and starting in thelate s for blacks and other minorities            This leads to the following nonmultiplechoice questionfor Bradley and Bush If you got into an Ivy League college for reasons otherthan qualificationsnarrowly defined as grades and test scoreswhat is soterrible about bending the same rules on behalf of AfricanAmericans Bradleywould probably have an easier time with this question than Bush because as aDemocrat he is not required to believe that reverse discrimination isnecessarily a terrible thing and because athletic talent can plausibly be seenas a legitimate aspect of merit while choosing a father who went to Yalecannot But both examples undercut the argument against affirmative action            The examples of Bradleyand Bush also illustrate the fallacy of taking the SAT as a measure ofintelligence or much of anything elselet alone of qualification to bepresident of the United States This is not because Bradley scored worse thanBush but because both have led successful lives and are patently betterqualified for the presidency than many citizens with higher scores            Of course any analysisof individual SAT results must be taken with a grain of salt Bradley and Bushsat for the test in the days before scoreraising courses like Kaplan andPrinceton Review The SAT has been recentered in recent years boostingoverall scores by up to a hundred points Bradley knowing he would be offeredathletic scholarships at dozens of nonIvy schools may not have taken the testseriously And in any case Bush and Bradley actually scored quite respectablywhen considered apart from the lofty standards of Ivy Leaguers Both wereprobably in the top third of all testtakers and would have been in the topquarter at least if the SAT had been administered to all highschoolseniors            All the SAT even purports to measure is likely firstyearcollege grades Indeed the test admirably predicted the freshman year academicdifficulties of both Bradley and Bush While Bush remained mired in aGentlemans C groove for the duration of his undergraduate years Bradley wasable to pull himself out of his firstyear struggles by dint of hard effort andwent on to an honors degree and a Rhodes scholarship            Judging from their undergraduate careers alone youmight well argue that the examples of Bill Bradley and George W Bushillustrate a subtler point about affirmative action than mere thumbsup orthumbsdown That is affirmative action is more likely to succeed when ittakes into account personal qualities like drive and motivation which may notbe captured on the SAT Affirmative action is likely to fail when it is merelya special preference bestowed upon those who have the right parents whetherright means educational pedigree or skin color            Even four decades laterBradleys appeal as a presidential candidatecontrary to some of his owncampaign slogansis not that he was ever the epitome of effortless cerebral andathletic superiority but that he has made the most of his talents No testwhether it takes the form of the SAT or a pop quiz on foreign affairs isconclusive proof of a persons potential Scores alone cannot be the sole basisfor making decisions about college admissions hiring decisions orpresidential elections Affirmative action even for athletes and preppiessometimes has a place in this land of second chances where anyone can grow upto be president Bill Bradley and George W Bush ought to know
