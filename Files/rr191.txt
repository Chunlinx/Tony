                    Introduction        Fetuses of diabetic mothers with uncontrolled blood        glucose levels tend to be hyperglycemic and        hyperinsulinemic     An increased incidence of neonatal        respiratory distress syndrome RDS has been observed in        infants of diabetic mothers     RDS is caused by        inadequate amounts of pulmonary surfactant due to delayed        lung development     It has been proposed that high        insulin levels can delay lung development in the fetus of        the diabetic mother            Surfactant a lipoprotein comprised of phospholipids         cholesterol  and proteins  functions        to reduce surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse at        end expiration     The surfactantassociated proteins        SP A B C and D which are required for proper        surfactant function are developmentally and hormonally        regulated     We and others have shown that the SPA        levels in the amniotic fluid of diabetic mothers are        significantly decreased     Low SPA levels in amniotic        fluid have been correlated with an increased incidence of        neonatal RDS     Our previous studies have shown that        insulin downregulates SPA mRNA and protein levels in        human lung epithelial cells in a concentration and        timedependent manner via an inhibition of gene        transcription             Insulin transduces its cellular signal in most cell        types via two signaling pathways ie the p        mitogenactivated protein kinase MAPK pathway and the        phosphatidylinositol kinase PI kinase pathway            Insulin initially binds to the insulin receptor causing        autophosphorylation of the subunit of the receptor            The protein kinase domain of the subunit then        phosphorylates tyrosine residues in insulin receptor        substrate IRS IRS IRS or Shc which then        activates the p MAPK signaling cascade     PD        is a cell permeable noncompetitive reversible inhibitor        of MAPKextracellular signalregulated kinase kinase MEK        a protein kinase upstream of p MAPK     Tyrosine        phosphorylated IRS also activates the PI kinase pathway             There are at least three wellcharacterized        inhibitors of the PI kinase pathway ie wortmannin        LY and rapamycin       Wortmannin and        LY block the activation of PI kinase itself             while rapamycin prevents the phosphorylation of a        downstream effector in the pathway p S kinase                   In the present study we used two experimental models a        human lung adenocarcinoma cell line NCIH and human        fetal lung explants H cells resemble bronchiolar        epithelial Clara cells in phenotype and produce both SPA        and SPB mRNA and protein     The hormonal regulation        of SPA and SPB gene expression in H cells is similar        to that observed in differentiated type II cells in human        fetal lung explants        We treated H cells        with the four inhibitors of signal transduction        wortmannin LY rapamycin and PD to elucidate        which signaling pathways are activated when insulin        inhibits SPA gene expression To confirm these results we        repeated key experiments with insulin and the signal        transduction inhibitors using human fetal lung explants We        then examined the levels and phosphorylation state of key        enzymes in the p MAPK and PI kinase signaling        pathways We found that insulin probably inhibits SPA gene        expression in lung epithelial cells via the        rapamycinsensitive PI kinase pathway                    Materials and methods                  Cell and explant cultures          A human lung adenocarcinoma cell line NCIH was          maintained           in vitro in monolayer culture in           fetal bovine serum in the presence of penicillin           Uml streptomycin  gml and fungizone           gml at C in a  CO            atmosphere     Culture media          were changed every  days and cells were passed           weekly For the inhibitor experiments the H cells          were grown until  confluent then incubated in          serumfree media for  hours prior to an experiment The          cultured cells were subsequently exposed to fresh          serumfree media and pretreated for  minutes with          either control media that contained the vehicle for the          inhibitors dimethyl sulphoxide or with media that          contained wortmannin  nM LY  M          rapamycin  nM or PD  M After          pretreatment either insulin  gml or vehicle          dilute HCl was added for an additional  hours          Experiments were repeated three to five times unless          otherwise noted          Human lung tissue was obtained from midtremester          abortuses  weeks old dissected free from blood          vessels and conducting airways then minced with a          sterile razor blade into  mm explants     The          explants were maintained on lens papercovered stainless          steel grids at the airmedia interface in Waymouths          media at C and  CO            for  days The media were changed          daily On the last day of culture explants were          pretreated with signal transduction inhibitors either          wortmannin rapamycin or PD for  min and then          further treated with insulin  gml for  hours          Experiments were performed in duplicate and were repeated          twice                          Reagents          Porcine insulin was purchased from Calbiochem San          Diego CA USA wortmannin LY and rapamycin were          purchased from SigmaAldrich Company St Louis MO          USA and PD was purchased from New England Biolabs          Beverly MA USA Insulin was prepared as  mgml          stock solution in  N HCl aliquoted and stored at          C Wortmannin LY rapamycin and PD were

gene expression with          maximum effect at  gml  to  nM              In order to achieve a maximal inhibitory effect of          insulin we used a concentration of  gml in the          present

harvested and total RNA          isolated as described previously     Equal amounts          of total RNA from each condition were separated on          agarose gels transferred to Nytranplus

Students ttest or oneway          analysis of variance ANOVA followed by Dunnetts test          was used to estimate the statistical significance of the          results

inhibitors LDH activity was not          different from controls in cells treated for  to           hours with either  nM wortmannin  M LY  nM          rapamycin or  M PD data not shown                          Effects of signal transduction inhibitors and          insulin on SPA mRNA levels          Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite that is a relatively          selective inhibitor of PI kinase with a halfmaximal          inhibition IC             less than  nM     In the          wortmannin experiments media were changed every  hours          for a total of  hours in all of the conditions because          wortmannin is unstable in solution at physiological pH              The shorter incubation time with insulin in the          wortmannin experiments resulted in a decreased inhibitory          effect of insulin ie an  inhibition of SPA mRNA          levels Fig A versus an  inhibition observed after          the hour incubation used in the experiments with          rapamycin and PD Fig Band C Wortmannin added          alone did not significantly alter SPA mRNA levels at          any concentration tested Fig A However wortmannin          at concentrations of  nM abolished the          insulinmediated inhibition of SPA mRNA levels at all          concentrations tested  nM Fig A          To confirm the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on          insulin action a structurally different PI kinase          inhibitor LY was used LY is a competitive          inhibitor of the PI kinase ATPbinding site with an IC                       M           in vitro     LY added          alone decreased SPA mRNA levels at concentrations          greater than  M data not shown However  M          LY abolished the inhibitory effects of insulin but          did not affect basal SPA mRNA levels In the control          group insulin significantly decreased SPA mRNA levels          to    of control levels however in presence of           M LY insulin only decreased SPA mRNA levels to             of control levels versus    of control          levels in samples treated with LY alone mean  SE          n   n indicates the number of independent          experiments          Rapamycin inhibits activation of p S kinase a          downstream effector in the PI kinase signaling pathway              Rapamycin forms a complex with FKbinding          protein  and this complex blocks the kinase activity of          mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin a kinase upstream          of p S kinase     The IC            for p S kinase inhibition by          rapamycin is  nM     When added alone at          concentrations of  nM rapamycin did not affect SPA          mRNA levels Fig B However rapamycin abolished the          insulinmediated inhibition of SPA gene expression in a          dosedependent manner          To examine whether the p MAPK pathway mediates          insulin signaling in the H cells PD an          inhibitor of the p MAPK pathway was used              PD binds to the dephosphorylated form of MEK and          prevents its activation           in vivo with an IC            of  M     PD added          alone significantly decreased SPA mRNA levels in a          dosedependent manner Fig C PD had no effect on          the insulin inhibition of SPA mRNA levels          We also treated cultured human fetal lung explants          with wortmannin rapamycin or PD in the presence or          absence of insulin Fig shows that wortmannin  nM          and rapamycin  nM both abolished the insulinmediated          inhibition of SPA gene expression In agreement with the          H cells results PD  M had no effect on          the insulin inhibition of SPA mRNA while decreasing          basal SPA mRNA levels in a dosedependent manner when          added alone                          Transcription rate of human SPA          In our previous studies we have shown that insulin          inhibits the rate of SPA gene transcription after a          hour exposure     In this study we evaluated the          effects of insulin on the transcription rate of the human          SPA and actin genes at several timepoints earlier          than those used in our previous studies The rate of SPA          gene transcription increased in a timedependent manner          Fig  Insulin inhibited human SPA gene transcription          at every timepoint tested even as early as after  hour          of insulin treatment Insulin did not decrease human          actin gene transcription at any time point                          Phosphorylationactivation of protein          kinases          Immunoblot analysis of control and insulintreated          H cells using phosphospecific antibodies for p          MAPK and p S kinase revealed that both kinases were in          a partially activated state at the  min time point The          phosphorylation of the protein kinases in the controls          declined over time and remained at minimum levels after           min to  hours of incubation We attribute this          partial activation of the signaling kinases to the media          change that occurred immediately prior to insulin or          vehicle addition                              p MAPK          The total amount of p MAPK was equal and remained          level in control and insulintreated cells at all          timepoints Fig A Insulin did not affect p MAPK          phosphorylation within a hour incubation time but          significantly decreased phosphorylation after  hours          Fig B Densitometric data of immunoreactive bands of          phosphop MAPK in the presence of insulin were equal          to    for the  hour time point when compared          to the corresponding controls which were made equal to          one mean  SE ttest p   n            Since it is possible that the insulinmediated          stimulation of p MAPK phosphorylation had ended          within a  min exposure to insulin we performed          additional experiments in order to evaluate the          possibility of a shorter time course of insulin action          Serumstarved cells were incubated with fresh serumfree          media for  hour at C in order to return the          phosphorylation levels of p MAPK to the basal state          and then treated with insulin  gml or vehicle for           min Insulin did not activate p MAPK within this          time frame The intensity of the immunoreactive bands of          phosphop MAPK from insulintreated cells was             relative to controls which were made equal to one          data are the mean of two experiments performed in          duplicate plus or minus the standard deviation of the          mean In order to prove that p MAPK can be          stimulated in H cells by an activator of this kinase          some cells were also treated with  nM            O tetradecanoylphorbolacetate          TPA a strong stimulator of p MAPK in H cells          for  min     TPA caused an approximately twofold          increase in p MAPK phosphorylation over control          levels                          p S kinase          The total amount of p S kinase present in the cells          decreased during the  hour incubation period however          there was no difference in the amount present in control          vs insulintreated cells at any timepoint Fig A          Fig Bshows that despite increased basal p S kinase          phosphorylation insulin caused an additional          upregulation of p S kinase on Thr after incubation          with insulin for  min to  hours Phosphorylation of          p S kinase on Thr is essential for the activation          of the kinase     In the presence of insulin the          intensity of the Thr p S kinase bands was          significantly increased after  min exposure and reached             after  min and    after a  hour          incubation period when compared to respective controls          which were made equal to one mean  SE ttest p            n   Insulin also stimulated the phosphorylation          of p S kinase ThrSer at the min and hour          incubation times when compared to their respective          controls Fig C                          Inhibitors of p MAPK and p S kinase          PD caused a dramatic decrease in the          phosphorylation of p MAPK in the presence or          absence of insulin Fig A when compared to controls          Incubation of cells with rapamycin did not affect p          MAPK phosphorylation in any condition Fig B          Rapamycin completely abolished the phosphorylation of          Thr in p S kinase in insulintreated cells and also          abolished the basal phosphorylation of p S kinase in          control cells at both time points examined Fig C          Rapamycin also down regulated the ThrSer          phosphorylation in p S kinase in control and          insulintreated cells at both timepoints Fig E          PD did not affect Thr or ThrSer          phosphorylation in p S kinase in insulintreated cells          at either time point but slightly decreased their          phosphorylation when added alone Figs Dand F                            Discussion        Nothing is known about the relationship between        signaling pathways and the regulation of SPA gene        expression by insulin In contrast insulin signal        transduction pathways are wellcharacterized in a wide        variety of cell types      Insulin is known to        primarily transduce its cellular actions via two signaling        pathways the p MAPK pathway and the PI kinase        pathway      In the present study we investigated        the signaling pathways that mediate the inhibitory effects        of insulin on the expression of the SPA genes in human        lung epithelial cells        Two inhibitors of PI kinase wortmannin and LY        and an inhibitor of p S kinase activation rapamycin        blocked the inhibitory effect of insulin on SPA gene        expression We confirmed these observations by showing that        insulin increased the phosphorylation of a specific        rapamycinsensitive residue threonine  present in the        linker region of p S kinase a phosphorylation event        that is known to activate this enzyme     In contrast        PD an inhibitor of p MAPK activation did not        block the inhibitory effects of insulin on SPA gene        expression In addition insulin had no effect on p        MAPK phosphorylation during a hour incubation The        effects of the PI kinase and the MAPK pathway inhibitors        on SPA gene expression were evaluated using two        experimental models a human immortalized epithelial cell        line H cells and human fetal lung explants We also        demonstrated that transcriptional inhibition of SPA gene        commences within  hour of exposure to the hormone        Together our results are suggestive that insulin activates        the rapamycinsensitive PI kinase pathway in lung        epithelial cells and that this event leads to an inhibition        of SPA gene transcription        We found that wortmannin and rapamycin had no effect on        basal SPA mRNA levels at any concentration tested        However PD added alone abolished p MAPK        phosphorylation in control cells and also inhibited basal        SPA mRNA levels in a dosedependent manner We hypothesize        that a basal level of p MAPK activity may be required        for SPA gene expression Chess and coworkers have shown        that transforming growth factor and hepatocyte growth        factor increase the phosphorylation of pp MAPK in H        cells     Epidermal growth factor which binds to the        same receptor as transforming growth factor increases        SPA content in human fetal lung     Hepatocyte growth        factor has also been shown to upregulate the synthesis of        SPA in rat type II cells     Thus phosphorylation of        p MAPK may be involved in the upregulation of SPA        gene expression results consistent with our observation        that inhibition of basal levels of p MAPK        phosphorylation may decrease SPA gene expression        In summary our studies are suggestive that in lung        epithelial cells SPA gene transcription is inhibited by        insulin via the rapamycinsensitive PI kinase pathway        but not the p MAPK pathway In cultured human muscle        cells only the PI kinase  p S kinase pathway and        not the MAPK pathway mediates insulin upregulation of        p PI kinase gene expression     Similarly in L        myotubes insulin induces hexokinase II gene transcription        via the rapamycinsensitive PI kinase pathway but not        via the MAPK pathway     The PI kinase  p S        kinase pathway but not the MAPK pathway mediates insulin        induction of glucosephosphate dehydrogenase gene        expression in primary rat hepatocytes     In HE        liver cells insulin downregulates cAMPinduced        phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription via        the PI kinase pathway but not via the MAPK pathway            Phosphorylated p S kinase has been shown to be        present in the nucleus in insulintreated cells            Moreover it has been shown that p S kinase        phosphorylates and activates members of the cAMP response        element modulator family of transcription factors            These data raise the possibility that transcriptional        regulation of SPA gene expression occurs via the PI        kinase  p S kinase pathway Further studies will be        required to elucidate the function of p S kinase in the        nuclear events involved in SPA gene transcription                    Conclusion        Our studies are suggestive that insulin inhibits SPA        gene transcription via the PI kinase pathway in lung        epithelial cells specifically via the rapamycinsensitive        activation of p S kinase Insulin does not activate        p MAPK and does not inhibit SPA gene transcription        via the MAPK pathway Our findings further characterize the        signal transduction pathways that control surfactant        protein gene expression This information could lead to the        possible modification of these pathways by pharmacological        agents in order to modulate the composition of pulmonary        surfactant which is critical for normal respiratory        function and for host defense mechanisms in the lung                    Abbreviations        ANOVA  analysis of variance Erk
