          i guess were ready   okay so whats wrong with our school systems besides its really screwed up some of them   well i   i dont think i dont think all of them i think maybe mainly Dallas school systems because Richardson is fine and my son was in Garland and Plano he was in all three them Richardson Plano and Garland and i dont have any problems with with with them as far as you know   well um well its been a long time since i been in uh involved with public school systems uh   i think   my youngest girl has graduated and she graduated in eighty nine so   oh my goodness i think the biggest problem for now days with the school system is some of the parents i dont wanna say all of them because im not one of them but some of the parents thinks just uh theyre baby sitters and theyre not   umhum   you know theyre putting a lot of responsibilities off on the teachers and i dont think they should i think they should also get involved   well i dont know if uh  you mean they keep the children they want the teachers to keep the children longer   under a shelf its in there under there   hello   okay   uh what do you mean by that statement do you mean they want the children uh the teachers to keep the children longer than theyre supposed to or are they  to train them   no more or less train train them yeah   in all phases of life   uh sometimes more discipline discipline uh because   really you mean just  in   they wouldnt be too much of a discipline problems i think if parents would um   well the discipline starts in the home   well thats thats what im saying   and carries over into the school when they are school age and and   thats right but i mean you have kids you have kids going to school with guns knives thats thats from the home but you know its i dont know i guess parents arent   and i think the school i think oh thats well   like when i was growing up you know you didnt have all this problems i mean we had problems in school but not like this nothing like the guns and the and the and the violence there is in the school with kids   well its just gotten uh completely out of hand as far as the violence in the schools and i dont know what the solution to that is at all i mean its just uh   yeah humum   to me its utter chaos i dont know how some of those teachers function because uh they are being violated by the students and i know that there are some schools that are patrolled by um private police and even public police and and and theyre not getting any satisfaction from that effort   yeah umhum and theyre not getting any paid neither i mean theres not you know its like a hazardous job now to in some schools i should say not all schools some schools you know its   i think uh i dont know what the solution is if the government doesnt know how are the um theres somebody that needs to rise up and have a plan that is going to resolve the many issues that are facing the public school system and i wouldnt know where to start since i havent been involved in the public school system that much   well ive been involved and you know what i still dont know the problem i mean i wouldnt know where to begin to solve it i mean   when my children were in school they were in a in a private school system so i mean we just i mean they just knew that they had to toe the line otherwise they would uh suffer the consequences and and that was enough for them i mean they just were very responsible kids and i didnt have any problems with them   yeah   and i believe that uh that starts in the home and then if the children are influenced i guess theyre influenced by their peers   yeah   and uh monkey see monkey do a lot of times   and then but see that also begins at home because he   and it kind of   my son has well i ive seen a lot of kids you know and its like i tell my son thats not my child what that child does dont you do i say well see im not his mother and i you know you will get in trouble for something somebody else parent may or may not let they child do but you know right from wrong so   well i guess thats the bottom line if the children do know right from wrong   yeah   and uh with uh with so many of the parents being disorganized themselves its no wonder that the children are so you have to look at that uh factor also where those children are coming from and what kind of home life they have   yeah but what and then you got what about this other
