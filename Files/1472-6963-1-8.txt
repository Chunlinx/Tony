                    Background        Influenza costs the US some  deaths         hospitalizations and millions of workdays lost each year             Most deaths  due to influenza occur in        patients  years and older but  of        influenzarelated hospitalizations occur in patients        younger than  years old       High complication        rates from influenza in the elderly have also been reported             Little is known about influenzarelated morbidity        and health care costs in younger populations and among        those with preexisting conditions such as diabetes        cardiovascular or pulmonary disease        Diagnosis of influenza is typically based on the        presence of symptoms and the temporal association with        known circulating virus At the time covered by this study        a rapid clinicbased diagnostic test was not available        Most research performed in an observational setting        utilizes clinical diagnosis and therefore includes both        influenza and some influenzalike illnesses ILI A        clinicbased study inevitably misses influenza that does        not come to clinical attention This study therefore        provides data on the burden to the health payor of        influenza ILI and their related complications in a        population of  million children and adults with various        risk profiles The primary objective of this study was to        examine the role of patient characteristics that might be        predictive of complications and related health care costs        associated with influenza and ILI                    Methods                  Data source          We used the automated claims database of a large          private New England Insurer NEI The NEI database          contains medical claims for outpatient and inpatient          services and outpatient pharmacy claims for about           residents of New England with comprehensive          medical and prescription drug coverage The number of          people over age  is limited since Medicare          beneficiaries do not participate in NEI          Each medical claim contains primary and secondary          diagnoses codes assigned using the International          Classification of Diseases ninth Revision ICD              Up to five procedure codes are also present on the          claim records and are coded using ICD Current          Procedural Terminology CPT or Health Care Finance          Administration HCFA codes      Prescription          drugs dispensed are identified by National Drug Code

on the claims for reimbursement such as          surgeries radiologic tests laboratory tests room and          board charges or other specific cost items Inpatient          pharmacy costs are included in the aggregate hospital          charges and cannot be separated out Charges by the          provider and amounts paid by the insurer patient or          other third parties are included                          Study population          Patients with a billed diagnosis of influenza medical          claim with either a primary or secondary ICD diagnosis          code of  meeting the following criteria were          designated as having an influenzaILI episode for the          ensuing  days  diagnosis occurred between the          beginning of October  and the end of April            diagnosis did not occur on the date of a immunization for          influenza  diagnosis was preceded by at least one year          of continuous health insurance coverage with no gaps in          coverage that exceeded  days and  insurance coverage          during the day follow up period was continuous We          will use the term interval of care interchangeably with          episode to describe this period Multiple claims for          care of influenza for the same patient occurring within          the day followup period were taken to be part of a          single episode We refer to the qualifying influenza          diagnosis day and the subsequent day followup period          as the interval of care throughout this report The          day period captures the longest likely duration of          symptoms directly caused by the influenza infection           days plus a period to account for the evolution and          resolution of complications of the infection While a          rare serious complication could lead to a protracted          illness we felt that the problem of resolving the          relative contributions of underlying and acute disease in          these settings would introduce substantial error and          provide relatively little additional information We will          use the term influenzaILI throughout this manuscript          recognizing that medical claims with an ICD code of           include influenza as well as some cases of ILI                          Characteristics of influenzaILIrelated          episodes          We characterized

days before influenzaILI diagnosis for conditions that          would have been characterized as complications or          manifestations had they occurred during the influenzaILI          episode see below The day window was chosen on          clinical grounds to capture medical conditions that were          unstable and the oneyear window was intended to capture          all active medical conditions Inevitably some routine          care will have occurred in the day window and some          conditions treated in the past year will not have been          active at the time of the influenza episode          We evaluated influenza immunizations between September            and the day before the initial influenzaILI          diagnosis Antiviral influenza medications dispensed          within the three days before the day of or the three          days after the initial influenzaILI diagnosis date were          noted We created this sevenday time window to account          for prescriptions that may have been dispensed for the          current diagnosis before an office visit eg by          telephoned prescription or within a few days after an          office visit We categorized health care costs in the          three months before the influenzaILI diagnosis in          quintile ranges as follows    up to                   and   and above The          mean and median threemonth costs preceding influenzaILI          diagnoses was  and  respectively The underlying          comorbid conditions we considered included chronic lung          disease chronic renal disease diabetes malignancies          HIV infections chronic heart disease and chronic renal          disease                          Complications and manifestations of          influenzaILI          We defined complications and manifestations occurring          on the day of the influenzaILI diagnosis or during the          day followup period using individual or combinations          of ICD codes to capture respiratory cardiovascular          infectious musculoskeletal symptoms and other          diseases Ambulatory care visits hospitalizations          procedures and emergency room visits were included          Throughout this report these are referred to as          complications of influenzaILI Please see Additional          File Appendix Adocfor specific ICD codes

algorithms          based on health services utilization detailed in          Additional File Appendix Bdoc                          Hospitalizations          InfluenzaILIrelated hospitalizations were defined          using the ICD diagnoses codes recorded on the detailed          inpatient claims categorized as listed above We          calculated mean and median length of stay in hospital          There were  out of  hospitalizations that          continued beyond the day followup period For the          complications analysis these counted in exactly the same          manner as the  hospitalizations that were completed          within the day followup For the primary cost and          duration of stay analyses data from the  extended          hospitalizations were retained only for hospitalized days          in the followup period as an approximate way of          partitioning costs for events with mulitfactorial          etiology Total hospital cost was multiplied by the          proportion of hospital days that fell within the          followup period We also present the total cost and          length of stay without truncation                          Health care costs          We characterized each influenzaILI interval of care          by total cost and influenzaILIrelated cost We defined          influenzaILIrelated costs as those associated with          ongoing care for influenzaILI and with complications of          influenzaILI including medication costs which occurred          during the influenzaILI interval of care see above list          of ICD codes InfluenzaILIrelated medications were          those commonly prescribed for influenzaILI symptoms          manifestations and complications oral injectable          ophthalmic and topical antibiotics antitussives          expectorants and mucolytic agents          decongestantsaspirin acetaminophen ibuprofen          naproxen amantadine rimantadine betaagonists          theophylline oral injectable rectal or inhaled          steroids ipratropium and cromolyn sodium          We defined total costs as the sum of total health care          costs for all services incurred during the interval of          care Costs presented in this report were the sum of the          amount paid by the insurer and the patient Patient costs          include a patients deductible copayment coinsurance          and coordination of benefit amounts Societal costs and          patient level costs such as lost workdays were not          considered                          Analysis          We used logistic regression modeling to examine the          association of potential predictive factors with          influenzaILIrelated complications and hospitalizations          These models permitted adjustment for all of the possible          predictive factors concurrently no variables were          dropped from the models                            Results                  Study

influenzaILI diagnosis comorbidities identified in          the year prior to diagnosis and high recent health care          costs in the previous three months were all strongly          associated

influenzaILIrelated costs compared to those without          comorbidities InfluenzaILIrelated costs accounted for           of the total health care costs incurred during the          interval of care                               Discussion        Elderly patients and patients with an underlying chronic        illness a recent complication or a higher health care        cost in the recent months were at the highest risk of        hospitalization and complications after a diagnosis of        influenzaILI InfluenzaILIrelated health care costs        represented the bulk of total health care costs during an        influenzaILI interval of care In addition to a        confirmation of what we would expect qualitatively for the        healthcare burden of influenza our observation provides a        useful quantitative estimate for these effects in the        general population        The diagnosis of influenzaILI was based on ICD codes        and did not incorporate viral isolates or laboratory        confirmation InfluenzaILI in this study is likely to be        representative on a population level of influenzaILI        diagnoses and a smaller percentage of more severe        influenzalike illness The day followup period        incorporated a clinical expectation that the vast majority        of influenzaILIrelated complications would occur within        this period and that complications that extended beyond         days would usually be ascribable in part to preexisting        illness More sophisticate approaches are imaginable but        not among multiple causes which in any case would have        been impossible to implement at the level of insurance        claims analysis        This study found that patients with a record of an        influenza immunization were at a higher risk for        hospitalization than those who were not vaccinated This is        clearly not a vaccine effect but instead an effect        attributable to the kinds of patients in the United States        who typically received influenza vaccination in a doctors        office during the period of the study Vaccine is indicated        for patients at high risk of complications and that risk        applies just as much to ILI which presumably account for        the great majority of events among vaccinated persons        Antiviral use was not extensive and the current study        dates preceded the introduction of zanamivir and        oseltamivir It appears that zanamivir reduces the risk of        complication in highrisk patients    We found some        indication although not statistically significant that        use of amantadine and rimantadine may have prevented        hospitalizations OR   and substantially reduced        costs        InfluenzaILI adversely affects individuals with a        variety of chronic underlying conditions supporting the        Center for Disease Control and Prevention Immunization        recommendations for influenza immunization     Unlike        other studies that have evaluated the costeffectiveness of        influenza immunization        our data quantify        a major cost impact of ILI and influenzaILI in a large        population over  patients with widevariation in ages        and health status These data may be useful in        understanding the patient groups at high risk for        influenzarelated complications and assisting the        costbenefit evaluation of a more universal influenza        immunization program for these patients        Both chronic and acute manifestations of comorbid        illness were strong independent predictors of        influenzaILIrelated complications and hospitalizations        Additionally health care costs in the three months before        the influenzaILI episode serve as a surrogate for the        overall health status of a patient and could reflect the        severity of the underlying diseases We were unable to        evaluate the effect of HIV infection chronic renal        disease and immunosuppressive therapy due to small number        of patients with these comorbidities These groups of        patients are at high risk for influenzaILIrelated        complications and health care costs Therefore our        estimates are most likely an under representation of the        true burden of influenzaILI        The day followup period incorporated a clinical        expectation that the vast majority of influenzaILIrelated        complications would occur within this period and that        complications that extended beyond  days would usually be        ascribable in part to preexisting illness We chose the        day cutoff as a roughandready approximate partition        of mulitfactorial disease burden More sophisticate        approaches are imaginable but not among multiple causes        which in any case would have been impossible to implement        at the level of insurance claims analysis        These data reflect patterns of care for influenzaILI        seen within the NEI health care system NEI beneficiaries        who sought medical care outside the NEI system would not be        captured in the claims data and are not included in this        analysis This is probably a relatively small percentage of        patients and is unlikely to bias the results More        importantly care for many respiratory conditions        especially otitis media and acute bronchitis was captured        in this study only as a complication of previously        recognized influenzaILI If the original illness had been        diagnosed only as one of these conditions it would never        have entered into the study In addition we lack data on        patients who did not seek medical care for influenzaILI        Medications purchased outside the insurance plan eg        overthecounter are not included in the database Thus        influenzaILIrelated costs we report are likely to be an        under estimate of the true costs of medical care and this        is only a fraction of the total societal cost which would        include at a minimum lost wages and productivity NEI        enrolls relatively few persons over the age of  due to        the availability of Medicare coverage for the elderly The        elderly in NEI include those who are still working or who        formerly worked for the state or federal government and        therefore are not eligible for Medicare        Approximately  of influenza isolates from the World        Health Organization Collaborating Laboratories were type A        and  were type B during the    influenza        season Type A influenza is thought to cause more severe        illness       Therefore the majority of        influenzaILI diagnoses captured in the NEI system using        ICD codes would be expected to be type A and represent a        higher proportion of true influenza illness than ILI during        the  influenza season        Antiviral use was not extensive and the current study        dates preceded the introduction of zanamivir and        oseltamivir We found some indication although not        statistically significant that antiviral use may have        prevented hospitalizations OR   The recent marketing        of influenza antivirals may have an even greater impact on        the predictors of complications and health care related        costs of influenza        Strengths of this study include the large cohort of ILI        and influenza cases over  patients and the diversity        of the risk profiles for influenzaILIrelated        complications in this population These data should be        applicable to other large health maintenance organizations        and would be useful for evaluating the burden of        influenzaILI in these populations                    Conclusions        Recent acute events foretell complications of influenza        as does underlying chronic illness Most costs in the three        weeks following onset are for influenzaILIrelated        care                    Competing interests        SC WYH and DR were employees of Glaxo Wellcome now        GlaxoSmithKline the manufacturer of zanamivir at the        time this study was carried out DI AMW and LW were        employees of lngenix Pharmaceutical Services which        received a research contract to perform this
