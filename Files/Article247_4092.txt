                                 The Trouble With Summaries                        Dear Gerald            Youre absolutely rightit may be a long time until we see anything likeAfricana again Even if Id been able to throw it at my televisionjustlifting it violates the instructions my orthopedist gave me last weekconcerning my arthritic shoulderI wouldnt have and not just because I likefootball baseball and AMC Africana is as least as good as the two orthree other encyclopedias of black history and culture that sit in storagewhile I wait for my shoulder to heal enough so I can build bookshelves            At the same time though admitting that I need to keep Africanabecause its all we have right now is too much like how some older folk I knowfeel about Ebony and BET which one wag I know quips stands for theBrothers Excuse for Television In their heart of hearts they know neitheris really very good but they nonetheless cant resist claiming pride ofownership            Still in the spirit of fairness before I get back to beating the boy Ihave to list a few things I like about Africana  The brief essay onKathleen Conwellalso known as Kathleen Collinsacknowledges a filmmaker whodeserves wider recognition She was also a playwright and a novelist but Ilike best her film Losing Ground  When I was still editing Black FilmReview  the magazine I founded shameless plug I spent a wonderful twodays with her at a film festival in Atlanta When she died in  wepublished a special issue about her I didnt know her well of course but Ioften think about the two hours we spent talking that afternoon so longago            Its also good to see documentary filmmaker St Clair Bourne here though Iwonder why Donald Boglea pioneer in black film studiesisnt Thatsanother one of those glaring omissions that make you wonder whether the editorsof Africana didnt really have an agenda after all And I like theentries on countries in Africa and the Black Diaspora and the accompanyingready references summarizing demographic and economic data about thosecountries I spent much of last year tutoring one of my godsonsif wed hadAfricana then we wouldnt have had to leave my house to walk around tothe library            Thats both the strength and the weakness of Africana  that itprovides so much information in such a truncated form Like you I wish Gatesand Appiah had taken the time to compile a truly comprehensive encyclopedia Ifyou must have monuments to validate your worth as a people then build lastingones            At the heart of my criticism though is my conviction that our experienceas blacks and Americanslike any human experienceis just too complex to besummarized More and more since I quit reviewing books I think thats the jobof fiction Andre SchwartzBarts The Last of the Just for example isa far more moving evocation of the Holocaust than any account in any referencework because it focuses on the experiences of one mana man who if hecontinues to deny his Jewishness has a reasonable chance of escaping the deathcamps Jim McPhersons stories have something of the same power They toobring representative individual experience alive and McPherson confronts theplaces where things intersect then reports on what he finds            When I look at our place in American history though what intrigues me arethe missed opportunitiesas when for example legal and societal distinctionswere first made between white indentured servants and black slaves Im alsointrigued by the contradictions A few months back black and Native Americansat a West Coast conference took each other to task over the role of the BuffaloSoldiers in the opening of the West Id like to have been there for thatone            Id like to have seen some evidence in Africana of our humanity andresourcefulness the kind of thing you find in the work of Ralph Ellison andAlbert Murray both of whom were if memory serves correctly Henry LouisGates mentors Remember how Robert Penn Warren tells Albert Murray in Southto a Very Old Place that slavery was also a human thing  not to sayhumane and so every possible every imaginable combination of humansocial relationships is likely to exist And did exist  Italicsoriginal Where is that kind of insightful and original thinking inAfricana             Which isnt at all to excuse or make apologies for slavery of course butonly to argue that our collective memory needs to include men like RobertHarlan Justice Harlans halfbrother or cousin depending on which biographeryou believe who was educated by his master escaped to California made afortune in the gold fields returned to Kentucky and bought his freedom thenmoved to England to race horses Or the mulatto barber and real estate magnateof antebellum Natchez I cant remember his name but remember my books are instorage He was freed by his father then became wealthy enough to lend moneyto prominent whites He was killed in a dispute over timber by a PamunkeyIndian from Virginia who would have been considered black in Virginia butescaped prosecution because he was considered white in Mississippi            I feel like Im rambling here and with more than  words written Ihavent even gotten round to responding to your points about the responsibilityof the black intellectual Like you I wish Gates and Cornel West would takesabbaticals and embark on the kind of lasting work theyre both capable of Andtheres an interesting paradox here with Africana  Gates is probably theonly black intellectual in America with the charisma and clout to get itpublished The work itself alas is solid and workmanlike nothing like whatI think we have the right to expect from the sage of Cambridge            Take care It was a pleasure working with you            David
