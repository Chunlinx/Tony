                 all right why dont you go ahead first and tell what kind of car youd look for in your next   i think our next car i would like something like a an economy car that gets really good mileage and um one thats really reliable i would i think probably not an a brand new car but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra or something like that um something my husband can   umhum and of course it has to have air conditioning   oh absolutely air air conditioning and a radio uh AM FM and a cassette player and um what else do i want   does it have to be a special color   um i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice you know a a navy blue or a     it sounds like something your husband would drive right   yeah thats what it would be for is for him to drive       back and forth to work   yeah well i dont think were looking for another car right now because we just bought one but when we were looking we were looking for something had enough seat belts of course and we wanted air conditioning and a five speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically so   i think thats something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic   yeah well probably have to look for a another second car sometime and wed look for about what youre looking for something but probably real cheap it wouldnt be a used used car so but no   i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that um you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed   umhum would you like four doors or it doesnt really matter   uh probably well probably probably that would be a good idea yeah   hm yeah it its hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes so   thats right so if we wanted it to take people out with it thats a good thought i   it be fun just to win one wouldnt it that would be great alrighty well i i think thats all that we need to say   that hadnt crossed my mind yes i would go for that well thank you for calling   all right well talk to you later bye bye   all right goodbye
