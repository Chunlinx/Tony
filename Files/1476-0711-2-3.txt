                    Background        Central venous catheters CVCs are widely used in        critically ill patients throughout the developed world        They permit hemodynamic monitoring and allow access for the        administration of fluids blood products medications and        total parenteral nutrition TPN Estimates of their use in        the United States alone suggest that over five million CVCs        are inserted annually      Although CVCs have        significant benefits in many clinical situations the        increase in their use over the last  years has been        associated with at least a doubling of resultant nosocomial        infections      A number of factors may contribute to        the risk of catheter related infections CRI                Although a common problem the descriptive epidemiology        pathophysiology risk factors and best means of diagnosing        CRI have not yet been fully elucidated We undertook a        prospective study of all new CVCs inserted into patients in        the intensive care units ICU in order to identify the        risk factors and to determine the effect of glycopeptide        antibiotics on CRI                    Patients and Methods        Human research ethics committee approval was obtained        for the study As there were no interventions requirement        for written patient consent was waived All patients        admitted to medical neurosurgical and surgical ICUs of        Istanbul Faculty of Medicine between January  and        December  who submitted to a CVC were included in the        study The catheters used were nontunneled noncuffed        triple lumen and made of polyurethane material Arrow        Erding Germany All catheters were inserted via new        percutaneous puncture in intensive care units by        experienced anaesthetists under strict aseptic techniques        After washing hands and forearms with antiseptic soap        drying with a sterile towel maximal sterile barrier        precautions sterile gloves longsleeved sterile gown        mask cap and large sterile sheet drape were observed        prior to catheter insertion Povidoneiodine was used as        antiseptic for cleansing the CVC insertion site After        catheter insertion the site was covered with sterile gauze        Every  hours the dressing was removed the site was        inspected and cleansed with povidoneiodine and a new        dressing was applied Catheters were followed for the        duration of their insertion and data were obtained daily on        inflammation of the catheter sites by a single observer        The catheters were removed at the end of the day seven as        scheduled replacement is followed in the ICUs of our        hospital Catheters were removed in less than seven days        when the patient had no more need for central line and        suspected to have CRI There was provision for        discretionary clinical judgement to leave the catheter        longer than seven days Each CVC was withdrawn aseptically        using sterile forceps after the area of insertion was        washed with povidone  iodine solution The distal  cm of        the catheter was cut off using sterile scissor and sent        aseptically to the clinical microbiology laboratory where        it was cultured by semiquantitative method     When        blood cultures were indicated  mL of venous blood was        drawn from catheter and from two peripheral veins following        skin preparation with povidoneiodine Data were also        obtained on patients age

significant        p   in the univariate analysis catheter insertion        site duration of catheterization and glycopeptide usage        were taken into logistic regression The software package        used for statistical analysis was SPSS for Windows Release         SPSS Inc Chicago IL USA                    Results        During the study period  patients with CVCs were        assessed One hundred and seventy  six  of the        patients were from the general ICU   were from        the surgical ICU and the other   were from the        neurosurgical ICU The patients studied were          males and   females The mean age was           The primary diagnosis of the patients were as follows          cardiorespiratory failure   trauma          postsurgical and   others CVCs were inserted either        into jugular vein n    or into the subclavian        vein n    Twenty  eight  patients were        receiving TPN The mean length of time the catheter was        kept in place was    days Two hundred and one         CVCs were kept in place for seven days or less and the        other   CVCs were kept in place for more than seven        days Eighty four  of them at the time of catheter        insertion a total of   patients were using        glycopeptide antibiotic during catheterization The other          patients were not using glycopeptide antibiotic        at the time of catheter insertion and for the duration of        insertion Table         Ninetyone  of the CVCs were colonized and the        CRI was found with   catheters Of the CRIs          DCRB   PCRB and   exit site        infection was diagnosed Three  patients had both DCRB        and exit site infection The unadjusted risk ratios of risk        factors are given in Table  No significant difference        were found for age gender unit primary diagnosis        repeated catheterization and TPN use CRI was diagnosed        with higher rate n    in CVCs inserted via        jugular vein in comparison with subclavian vein n           p   The incidence of CRI n    was        higher in catheters which were kept in place for more than        seven days p   The incidence of CRI was also higher        in patients who were not using glycopeptide antibiotic n           than patients who were using glycopeptide        antibiotic during catheterization n    p          The results of the multivariate analysis are        broadly in agreement with the univariate analysis Table         Use of a jugular insertion site has an odds ratio of          CI  p   compared with patients        with a CVC inserted into the subclavian vein Catheters        kept in place for more than seven days has an odds ratio of          CI  p   compared with catheters        kept in place for seven days or less When the patients        using glycopeptide antibiotic were taken as the reference        category the patients who were not using these antibiotic        during catheterization had an increased risk with an odds        ratio of   CI  p         One hundred and fourtyeight organisms were isolated as        the cause of catheter colonization or CRI Seventy  nine         Grampositive cocci   Gramnegative        bacilli and three  yeasts were isolated The most        commonly isolated organism was         Staphylococcus aureus n           followed by         Pseudomonas aeruginosa n                   Staphylococcus epidermidis n           and         Acinetobacter spp n           Table  Of the  cases of CRI most of the organisms        causing infection were Grampositive cocci n           with the most commonly isolated organism being         S aureus n    Table         All of the         Staphylococcus spp were resistant to        methicilline        The etiology of CRI was predominantly Grampositive        cocci n    in patients who were not using        glycopeptide antibiotic during catheterization In        contrast in patients who were using glycopeptide        antibiotic during catheterization Grampositive cocci was        only responsible from one  CRI This difference was        significant p                      Discussion        Many different risk factors for CRI in intensive care        patients have been reported in the literature                  These include insertion site duration of        catheterization type of dressing type of catheter        frequent manipulations improper aseptic techniques number        of catheter lumens type of topical antiseptic solution        used and use of the catheter for TPN The relative        importance of one risk factor over another is diffucult to        assess given that in most studies only univariate analysis        has been performed and estimates of the risk of each factor        has not been attempted We performed a logistic regression        to assess the major determinants of CRI and found that the        independent predictors of CRI were catheter insertion site        duration of catheterization and antibiotic glycopeptide        usage        In our study infection rates of catheters inserted into        jugular vein and subclavian vein were          respectively p   The CVCs inserted to the jugular        vein were associated with approximately two and a half        times the risk of infection compared with CVC inserted to        subclavian vein in the multivariate analysis It is also        reported in other studies that colonization and infection        is more likely in catheters inserted to jugular vein than        in catheters inserted to subclavian vein              Reasons for the higher infection rate in the jugular vein        site is thought to be related to difficulty keeping the        dressing in place and contamination with oropharyngeal        secretions Therefore for catheters inserted to jugular        vein the manipulations should be done with more caution        and the oropharyngeal secretions should be prevented to        contaminate the catheter Most of the phycians select the        jugular vein for catheter insertion because it is easier to        insert the catheter and due to low mechanical complication        rate According to our study and other reports subclavian        vein approach has a significant advantage with respect to        insertion site colonization and infection              Therefore we suggest that the subclavian approach be        utilized preferentially for catheterization provided a        serious bleeding diathesis is not present and risk of        pneumothorax is not excessive        In our study the CRI rate was higher for CVCs kept in        place for   days  in comparison to catheters kept        in place for   days  p   The CVCs kept in        place for   days were associated with approximately two        times the risk of infection compared with catheters kept in        place for   days The practise of routinely changing        catheters according to some defined time period to reduce        the risk of CRI is commonly referred to as scheduled        replacement      There is little or no support from        the literature for scheduled replacement even though it        continues to be a common clinical practice Cook et al        looked at the evidence for scheduled replacement using        guidewire exchanges andor new site replacements            They found no evidence that scheduled replacement using        either of the replacement techniques at three days or        seven days had any advantage over a replacement based on        clinical indication The other studies also failed to prove        any reduction of CRI rates by scheduled replacement             While catheter tip colonization and CRI may increase        with CVC duration controversy still exists regarding        scheduled changes        We found that the incidence and risk of CRI was lower in        patients using glycopeptide antibiotic during        catheterization in comparison to patients who were not        using these antibiotics p   Grampositive cocci        particularly coagulasenegative Staphylococci CNS and         S aureus  are responsible for at        least twothirds of the CRI      Glycopeptide        antibiotics are active against Staphylococci including        methicillin resistant isolates which was also the most        frequently isolated organism in our study Therefore we        searched the effect of these antibiotics against CRI There        is a lack of clarity in the literature about the definition        and influence of antimicrobial use There are only a few        reports that antimicrobials administered at the time of or        immediately after insertion of a CVC may reduce the        incidence of CRI       Other trials demonstrated        no benefit of such prophylaxis       According to        our results it seems that their use may prevent catheters        from infection especially with Gram  positive cocci The        glycopeptide antibiotics the patients were using during the        catheterization seems to have prophylactic effect This        study also concludes that patients using antibiotics        effective against Gram  positive cocci during        catheterization Gram  negative organisms should also be        suspected as the cause of CRI and antibiotics which are        also effective against these pathogens should be started        empirically Further studies are needed to assess the        additional benefit afforded by antimicrobials in reducing        CRI        In this prospective study the rate of CRI was found to        be  The rate of catheterrelated bloodstream        infections CRBIs and exit site infection was  and         respectively Of the CRBIs   were diagnosed as        DCRB and the other   were diagnosed as PCRB        PCRB was diagnosed when bacteremia and clinical        manifestations of sepsis resolved after removal of        implicated catheter in case of the organism causing        bacteremia not identified at any other site that is        possible source As stated in the definition of PCRB we        could not isolate the responsible organisms causing        bloodstream infection from the catheter tip in        approximately  of the CRBI It is possible for organisms        to originate from the internal surface or the hub of the        catheters The method which we used to culture the catheter        tip semiquantative method has a limitation in that it can        take samples only from the external surfaces of catheters        and may not retrieve organisms from the internal surfaces        of the catheters     Quantitative culture techniques        including the sonication and vortexing methods              have the advantage of isolating organisms from the        external and internal surfaces of the catheters and        possibly releasing organisms embedded within the biofilm        layer Other reports comparing semiquantitative catheter        segment culture with quantitative culture methods supports        the superiority of quantitative culture methods            Thus although the semiquantitative catheter segment        culture is one of the least expensive tests for a clinical        microbiology laboratory to perform and the most frequently        used method in hospital laboratories quantitative culture        methods should be preferred for catheter tip culture        A number of investigators have examined the microbiology        of CRIs         S epidermidis were the most common        organism growing followed by         P aeruginosa  yeasts enterococci         S aureus and         Enterobacter spp     In our        study the leading organism causing CVC colonization and CRI        was         S aureus followed by         P aeruginosa K oxytoca S        epidermidis and         Acinetobacter spp Although the ratio        of Grampositive cocci to Gramnegative rods isolated from        all catheters was approximately  the ratio increased        approximately three fold in CRI The finding that         Staphylococcus spp was the most        common positive catheter tip isolate seems to support the        current view that infection originates either from the        patients own skin flora or that of medical personnel or        from hub colonization                    Conclusion        Duration of catheterization and catheter insertion site        were independent risk factors for catheter related        infection We found that the incidence and risk of CRI was        lower in patients who were using glycopeptide antibiotics        during catheterization in comparison to patients who were        not using these antibiotics It seems that use of        glycopeptide antibiotics during catheterization has a        protective effect against catheter ralated infection but        further studies are needed to assess the benefit Although        the semiquantitative catheter segment culture is one of the        least expensive tests for a clinical microbiology        laboratory to perform and the most frequently used method        in hospital laboratories quantitative culture methods        should be preferred for catheter tip culture                    List of abbreviations used        CVC Central venous catheter
