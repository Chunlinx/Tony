            do you have a favorite type of music you listen to   um most frequently i listen to contemporary Christian music but i like all forms   okay   i uh we i listen to country and rock and classical jazz is probably my least favorite although i enjoy it too   uhhuh i tend to favor uh rock and roll mostly from the sixties and seventies   oh yeah some great sixties tunes   yeah i listen to KGPS classic rock     KGPS in Dallas   right   oh are you in Dallas   uh yeah im in Plano   uh  well probably around the corner  um       yeah thats a good station i listen to it every once in a while too   uhhuh do you play any instruments   no i dont   never have   im not musically gifted at all   well i took piano lessons in fourth grade once for one semester ill never forget Mrs Burkhalter     Miss Burkhalter   she had that Nazi mentality     where uh uh whered you grow up   uh in Milwaukee   oh okay   uhhuh   the uh yeah the only thing how to play on the piano is that two handed thing or the two person thing   chopsticks   no its not chopsticks its the other one that has the um oh i dont even i dont i dont know enough about music to do it but you the bottom person uses two hands and the top person just uses one hand and its this little melody i it may have been a girl thing   okay well i have no idea what that is       i just know i hated it but i took up trumpet after that and ended up playing in the University of Wisconsin marching band   oh really   which was fun   yeah i went to i went to uh Rice and we had the marching owl band which is quite a its not known for its musical abilities more so its um comedy abilities   it uh uhhuh oh we had a great time in the band my uh director was heavy into the big bands so we played a lot of tunes by uh Glen Miller and Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey and people like that   oh yeah well that that was fun   so it was a lot of fun plus i got to get to go to all the athletic events free     yeah that has its plusses for sure   well which uh sixties uh rock bands do you like the best   oh well the Beatles   uhhuh   Creedance Clearwater Revival uh Crosby Stills Nash and Young when it was still all four   right   um there uh Black Sabbath did a few albums that i really like   is that right   yeah they i know its kind of strange um Elton John is more seventies   um yeah certainly but uh   Yellow Brick Road   right uhhuh   i love that album   yeah i think ive got all those   yeah i had Yellow Brick Road and something happened to it it escaped me and it was sometime in college and never have seen it again   um oh i started my uh music collection in college when i started winning radio contests   howd you win radio contests   well they would uh tell you to call in and be caller number nine and win so i had a touch tone telephone in college and uh i just started calling in and winning all kinds of contests i had forty record albums before i even had a stereo to play them on to play them on     thats great   i ended up winning about uh two hundred and thirty radio contests in two school years so i accumulated my record collection mostly from that   thats incredible ive never won not one thing from a radio station i havent tried i probably havent tried two hundred and thirty times   it was yeah well that was in Madison i i won about four times a week it doesnt have near the population that Dallas has the contests here are a lot more competitive   yeah have you ever won in Dallas   um yeah but not the same type of contests um   oh   they have contests on the radio in the morning and i think i won one of the movie mystery contests one time   um   they sent me a small flag in the mail that which which had postage due   youre kidding me     no it was a   oh its not its probably not quite the same   it wasnt much of a victory actually i did win tickets to the to a Chicago and a Beach Boys concert   i saw them i went to a Beach Boys concert i like them too   uhhuh     um ive never been to a Chicago concert bet it was great   uh yeah they were uh they were very good i was impressed   yeah Chicago was great too   every now and then ill go ahead and make another tape and uh record a bunch of uh old tunes like the Loving Spoonful and Grateful Dead something from the Birds Rolling Stones   uhhuh yeah   i enjoy listening to those old tunes they dont play a lot of that stuff on the radio any more you have to pick the right station   yeah i use my scan button a lot   uhhuh   whole lot   i enjoy mainly the old the older rock and roll tunes rather than a lot of the new stuff the lyrics are so repetitive   yeah i   that i just kind of get lost in it   i uh yeah i havent made any kind of effort to keep up on recent music especially in rock and roll theres not just too much uh new stuff thats well its not as creative   it doesnt seem to be   and the lyrics arent as uh inspiring  if you want to call it that   yeah yeah some of the tunes used to you know you felt like you needed to go out and do something about it   yeah lot of pop music out that just isnt very thrilling   yeah   course the head bangers i stay away from those entirely   is there still that type of music available   certainly is just turn on MTV any night   oh no ive got small children  i dont trust MTV     theyll be playing the latest of Bon Jovi or White Snake or groups like that   yeah yeah yeah i uh i tried when um i guess i was in junior high high school when uh Led Zeppelin was real big and everybody i tried to you know really go the whole way and i couldnt go with even with most of Led Zeppelins music i didnt enjoy it   yeah   and some of the stuff you know the classics they were fine but some of it was just too heavy even then   i always like the easier listening rock the the Crosby Stills Nash and Young Eagles uh in more recent Billy Joel very talented   uhhuh yeah yeah   Z Z Top is different very creative they they really uh made uh quite a transition they used to be almost a country band   uhhuh   uh playing such   yeah they play they play some they get some play time on the country stations even   yeah such classics as La Grange and Touche   yeah   and   ive still got my Fandango album that one didnt get lost in college   right but uh they they really did change   yeah   all of a sudden they became a top forty type group appealing to the younger crowd   yeah yeah theyve got theyve now theyve got some good videos   uh very good videos yeah im kind of impressed       quite creative and appealing to the younger crowd   yeah yeah   to the pop audience i guess youd call it that   yeah the   Robert Palmers got some creative pretty creative videos videos out too   i i was thinking that yeah hes his his videos are pretty wild i like his music too   oh yeah and there are some that are that get artsy to a point like Steve Winwood   uhhuh yeah now see i know a little bit i know a little bit about other groups i uh like i said i listen to primarily contemporary Christian   uhhuh   and uh but i spend enough time on scan that i hear what it what is still on the radio well i dont know   well whos uh whos whos popular now with the uh contemporary Christian music   oh probably Amy Grant is the biggest one yeah shes even shes got a song right now that playing on a few of the other stations its called Baby Baby its   i dont listen too much right yeah ive heard of her uhhuh uhhuh   its neat when you think about how she wrote it and stuff otherwise the lyrics are kind of   yeah   you know its just like oh i love you and i you know this that and the other  but she write she wrote when she was talking to her baby       and if youve got a baby i mean its kind of neat thinking about it talking up to your baby and to to an infant   right thats interesting   so it it makes it neater but   well i dont think id ever make a song writer           my secretary has tried to be a song writer shes waiting for her big time   yeah well some people get lucky and i guess if youre persistent enough sometimes it works out   yeah yeah well yeah i hope that it does for her she deserves it shes a nice person   uhhuh     so i uh   well what station plays uh that type of music   uh ninety four point one is KLTY   okay all right   and uh then theres ninety point one is KCBI they do more uh they spend a lot of time with uh oh this preaching kind of stuff   right uhhuh   so i like music i like listening to music so i dont usually listen to KCBI and then theres another one called Journey thats somewhere in between the two of those its in between ninety and ninety four   right   i think its ninety two   maybe ill tune in to one of those some time   ninety four point one is fun   all right   i mean its its its mainly um just family oriented stuff i mean yeah its very its definitely Christian but its not its not hymns     right okay   you know its not Amazing Grace every other time   okay yeah i still feel like every time if i ever feel like reminiscing over the old stuff ill go ahead and throw on a sixties tape   yeah   get something from from the Guess Who or
