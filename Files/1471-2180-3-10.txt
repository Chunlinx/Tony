                    Background        Mycobacteria are Grampositive acidfast pleomorphic        nonmotile rods belonging to the order Actinomycetales         Mycobacterium avium complex organisms        consist of the human and animal pathogens         M avium subsp         avium M avium subsp         paratuberculosis  and         M avium subsp         silvaticum     DNADNA        hybridization studies have long ago established a genetic        similarity between         M avium subspecies         avium          M avium  and         M avium subspecies         paratuberculosis          M paratuberculosis        Now        that whole genome sequencing technologies are available        investigators can begin to examine genetic relatedness in        greater detail through direct nucleotidenucleotide        comparisons These comparisons are particularly important        in instances where two genetically similar bacteria have        little or no specific diagnostic tests to distinguish        each        The literature reports genetic similarity between         M paratuberculosis and         M avium at between  and             depending on the region analyzed However despite the        reported similarities these mycobacteria are quite        different phenotypically         M paratuberculosis is an        intracellular pathogen that infects ruminant animals most        notably cattle and sheep The site of infection is the        gastrointestinal tract where it causes a chronic        inflammatory ailment termed Johnes disease     In        contrast         M avium is common in the        environment causes tuberculosis in birds and disseminated        infections in HIV patients     Growth of         M paratuberculosis is characterized        by its slow rate doubling time of  hours compared to         hours for         M avium  and requirement of        mycobactin in culture media     With the absence of a        welldefined genetic system for         M paratuberculosis  a comparative        genomic approach holds great potential in addressing the        genetic basis for many of these phenotypic differences        The genus         Mycobacterium contains species that        range from fastgrowingsaprophytes such as         M smegmatis and         M fortuitum to slowgrowing        pathogens such as         M leprae          M tuberculosis and         M paratuberculosis  Although the        chromosomal origin of replication has been studied in some        mycobacteria      the genetic organization of the        origin of replication in         M paratuberculosis has been        previously unknown Knowledge of the gene organization and        sequence of this region is particularly important because        chromosomal replication may be regulated by a common        mechanism that could directly affect rate of growth        Several features of the         oriC region are highly conserved        among bacteria The sequence immediately flanking the         dnaA gene is considered the origin of        chromosomal replication or         oriC region      This region        contains several genes that encode proteins required for        basic cellular functions including the protein subunit of        RNase P RnpA ribosomal protein L RpmH the        replication initiator protein DnaA the beta subunit of        DNA polymerase III DnaN the recombination repair protein        RecF and the DNA gyrase proteins GyrA and GyrB The        relative gene order in this region is also highly conserved        in many bacteria especially the Grampositives            Although intergenic sequences in this region are conserved        only among closely related organisms the DnaA box is found        in the noncoding regions flanking         dnaA in most bacteria studied            DnaA boxes are conserved nucleotide sequences TTGTCCACA        where the DnaA protein binds to DNA triggering events that        ultimately lead to replication initiation and DNA synthesis                   In an effort to understand the genetic basis for growth        rate and other phenotypic differences between         M paratuberculosis and         M avium  we have analyzed the        genetic similarity of these genomes using two strategies        First the putative         oriC region of         M paratuberculosis was amplified        sequenced and compared with         M avium and other bacteria Second        we examined nucleotide identity outside the         oriC region using DNA homology matrix        analysis as well as using several hundred         M paratuberculosis sequences from a        random shotgun library compared with         M avium sequences present in the        unfinished microbial genomes database Our results show        that these subspecies not only have a conserved gene order        surrounding the origin of chromosomal replication but also        have a high synteny and nucleotide identity throughout both        genomes In addition this preliminary comparative survey        of the genomes of         M avium and         M paratuberculosis show even greater        similarity  than the literature suggests  to                                Results                  Identification of predicted ORFs encoding          replicationrelated proteins          An kb contiguous genomic fragment from           M paratuberculosis was amplified          and sequenced using  primer pairs designed from           M avium genomic sequence in the          putative           oriC region Fig  This strategy          enabled the successful amplification of all  minimally          overlapping fragments of  bp in length for this          region of the           M paratuberculosis chromosome A          putative replication origin was identified by GC skew          analysis     A strong inflection point in the GC          plot marks this origin Fig  Eleven ORFs were          identified using the gene prediction software Artemis             release  The Sanger Centre          httpwwwsangeracukSoftwareArtemis Similarity          searches were conducted locally using the BLASTP          algorithm through the Artemis interface Seven of these          ORFs have high identity to proteins essential for basic          cellular processes including replication in other          mycobacterial species Table  The function of GidB is          unknown but it may have a role in cell division              RNase P which consists of the protein subunit RnpA and a          catalytic RNA subunit is essential for generating mature          tRNAs by cleaving the terminal leader sequences of          precursor tRNAs               rpmH encodes ribosomal protein L          and DnaA is the initiator protein for chromosome          replication The Bsubunit of DNA polymerase is encoded          by           dnaN  The           recF gene product is involved in          recombination DNA repair and induction of the SOS          response and may also have a role in replication              Bacterial DNA gyrase a tetramer consisting of A and B          subunits catalyzes the ATPdependent unwinding of          covalently closed circular DNA     The remaining          predicted ORFs in this region have high similarity to          hypothetical proteins from           M tuberculosis Table                           Sequence homology and conserved gene order in the          oriCregion of mycobacteria and other grampositive          bacteria          Alignment of the region surrounding           oriC for several mycobacteria and          other grampositive bacteria provides some interesting          comparisons Fig  The           M paratuberculosis oriC region          conforms to the conserved gene order that is present in          other mycobacteria as well as the closely related           Streptomyces coelicolor  Even the          more distantly related           Bacillus subtilis shows some degree          of synteny in this region The fast growing           M smegmatis species contains a           gnd sequence between           dnaN and           recF  which is absent in the          slowgrowing mycobacteria Fig  However there appear          to be no notable differences between           M avium and           M paratuberculosis at this level          The           M smegmatis coding sequence           gnd  has similarity to the          phophogluconate dehydrogenase genes in           E coli  but the mycobacterial          protein is predicted to be about  amino acids shorter          than the           E coli homolog            The length of noncoding          intergenic regions between           rpmH            dnaA and           dnaA            dnaN is well conserved among the          bacteria shown in figure  In many bacteria where a          functional           oriC has been identified this gene          order is conserved and           oriC is adjacent to the           dnaA gene                The amino acid sequence of each gene product was          compared with the corresponding sequence in           M paratuberculosis for all species          in this study Table  The data show that while gene          order is conserved the percent identity declines in          comparisons with mycobacteria other than           M avium  This percent identity          declines even further in comparisons with          nonmycobacterial sequences such as           S coelicolor and           Corynebacteria glutamicum Table

potential DnaA boxes in the           M paratuberculosis oriC region          The Grampositive organisms in this study harbor             DnaA boxes with    mismatches from the consensus          sequence TTGTCCACA flanking the           dnaA sequence        and           were found surrounding the           M paratuberculosis dnaA gene Fig           In addition a hexameric sequence thought to be          recognized by ATPDnaA AGATCT was found in the           noncoding sequence adjacent to           dnaA Fig b The significance of          additional           dnaA boxes in           M paratuberculosis is likely          necessary to open the DNA helix of this GC rich organism           GC content          The           dnaA gene is divided into four          functional domains based on analysis of several           dnaA mutants     These domains          consist of  an area near the Nterminus thought be          involved in ability of the DnaA protein to aggregate           ATP binding  a domain that maps to a region near the          Cterminus and is involved in DNA binding  and a          final domain of unknown function but may bind DnaB The          conserved ATPbinding site that is found in domain III in          other bacteria was also located in           M paratuberculosis Fig b An          ATrich stretch of  nucleotides  AT which in          other bacteria serves as the site of local unwinding of          DNA after DnaADNA interaction was located in noncoding          sequence adjacent to           dnaA Fig b The noncoding          sequences flanking           dnaA are slightly ATrich in          general relative to the rest of the genome sequence          consistent with findings in other grampositive bacteria             AT vs  in the entire sequence                          A vast majority of all M paratuberculosisK          genomic sequence have considerable nucleotide similarity          to sequences from the human pathogenic isolate M          avium          As a basis for all nucleotide comparisons between           M avium and           M paratuberculosis in this study          an alignment of the s rRNA gene was performed That          analysis revealed a  nucleotide identity over the          entire bp gene data not shown Likewise the           oriC region in           M paratuberculosis was found to          share a high level of nucleotide identity  with           M avium  Calculation of the rates          of total nucleotide diversity  and synonymous          substitution per synonymous site ds and nonsynonymous          substitution per nonsynonymous site dn revealed          patterns of variation within the range observed from          sequence data outside the           oriC region These calculations          showed a high degree of similarity between the two          sequences and a predominance of synonymous over          nonsynonymous substitutions Fig  The patterns of          nucleotide substitution varied considerably between genes          in this region of the genome For instance there was          complete nucleotide identity in the           rpmH and           recF genes and only  identity in          the gene           rnpA  To verify that these          observed differences were real and not as a result of          sequencing errors in the yet unfinished           M avium genome we confirmed the          data by resequencing the entire  kb region from an          isolate clone of           M avium and obtained identical          results not shown          We next determined if the nucleotide identities would          remain consistently high when           M paratuberculosis sequences          outside the           oriC region were compared with           M avium  Sequencing of the           M paratuberculosis K cattle          isolate is nearing completion in our laboratories and          TIGR httpwwwtigrorgis in the finishing stages of           M avium isolate  Beginning          with nucleotide number  in the           dnaA coding region of each genome          a comparison of  million bases of           M paratuberculosis with  million          bases from           M avium by Pustell DNA matrix          analysis     indicates that genomic similarity          continues outside the surrounding           oriC region Fig  When          evaluating similarities between two sequences of this          size a matrix comparison is the method of first choice          In addition the matrix method displays matching regions          in the context of the sequence as a whole making it easy          to determine if the regions are repeated or inverted For          example figure shows a large  kb genomic inversion          of the region surrounding nucleotide  The DNA          identity matrix also identified sequences that were          present in one genome but absent in the other as shown          by the broken diagonal lines Fig  These data show          remarkable similarity over large regions in both          mycobacterial genomes          Finally we analyzed  recombinant clones from a          randomly sheared           M paratuberculosis small insert          library in order to obtain specific rates of nucleotide          substitutions Sequences from these clones represented          over  bp of unique nonoverlapping           M paratuberculosis genomic DNA and          comprised  of the estimated  Mb genome sequence From          this analysis we estimated the rates of total synonymous          and nonsynonymous substitutions for  fragments that          were aligned inframe and then analyzed with the program          NAGV    using the methods of Nei and Gojobori              The results of these analyses show that the average          nucleotide diversity between the two species is             range  to  median    The          results also show that the average rates of synonymous          substitution per synonymous site are             range  to  median    In contrast          the rates of nonsynonymous substitution per          nonsynonymous site were    range  to           median    These results not only          indicate that the two subspecies have a high degree of          nucleotide identity  but also suggest that the          patterns of substitution have favored synonymous          substitutions as can be expected from positive          selection                            Discussion        With the genome sequencing projects of         M paratuberculosis and         M avium nearing completion we have        been able to compare large amounts of sequence data for the        first time Our results show substantial nucleotide        identity above even that reported previously in the        literature       Paradoxically the overall        nucleotide identity between these phenotypically distinct        mycobacteria appears similar to that observed with two        phenotypically identical         Helicobacter pylori isolates at         nucleotide identity            The high nucleotide identity shared between         M paratuberculosis and         M avium directly conflicts with        their divergent phenotypic characteristics Because of        strong similarity in the         oriC region alternative hypotheses        should be tested to explain the growth rate differences        between         M avium and         M paratuberculosis  Genomic        rearrangements and the presence of unique genes identified        by matrix analysis in this study are two such possibilities        that could account for some of the phenotypic differences        We have recently reported on         M paratuberculosis coding sequences        that are absent in         M avium     From an analysis of         of the         M paratuberculosis genome only         predicted coding sequences were found to be absent in         M avium  Therefore an estimated        total of          M paratuberculosis coding sequences        might be absent in         M avium following a whole genome        analysis This extremely low number of unique         M paratuberculosis genes is in stark        contrast to         E coli where the MG isolate        contains  genes not found in the EDL isolate            Further analysis of this limited number of unique coding        sequences will be critical in developing specific        diagnostic reagents Finally a detailed analysis of coding        sequences unique to each respective mycobacterial genome        and their genetic regulatory networks will be necessary to        understand the molecular basis for growth rate and other        phenotypic differences        Other potential explanations include the presence of        global regulators insertion sequences        transcriptiontranslation rates genomic rearrangements and        ribosomal RNA operons Each respective genome possesses        insertion elements IS IS at unique loci that        could distinctly affect growth difference or other        phenotype by insertional mutation FoleyThomas et al           compared the expression of the luciferase gene in         M paratuberculosis with the        fastgrowing         M smegmatis and concluded that the        rates of transcription and translation may not account for        the slow growth of         M paratuberculosis         We present evidence for at least one largescale genomic        rearrangement between these two subspecies This        rearrangement consists of a  kb inversion that contains        approximately  predicted coding sequences Bannantine and        Kapur unpublished Genomic rearrangements such as that        described could have a profound effect on phenotype The        presence of multiple copies of ribosomal RNA operons within        a genome can be directly attributed to faster growth rate        The increased gene dosage results in more ribosomes and        therefore increased protein translational capacity        However only one rRNA operon is present in each subspecies        and this is also true for the fast growers         Mycobacterium abscessus and         Mycobacterium chelonae     These        fast growing mycobacteria have multiple promoters that        increase the transcriptional rate of the rRNA operon to        overcome gene dosage limitations     The rRNA operon        promoter structures have not been mapped by primer        extension for either         M paratuberculosis or         M avium  but if         M avium had multiple functional rRNA        operon promoters that may account for the growth rate        differences        The genetic organization of the origin of replication        has been characterized in several Grampositive pathogens        including         B subtilis          S coelicolor          M tuberculosis          M avium          M leprae  and         M smegmatis     The results of        our investigation on the         oriC region of         M paratuberculosis show that each of        the  primer pairs designed from         M avium sequence data resulted in        the successful amplification and subsequent sequencing of        an  kb region of the         M paratuberculosis genome The        sequenced region encodes  putative proteins several of        which show a high level of identity to proteins that are        known or predicted to be involved in DNA replication        However we found a cluster of substitutions in a region of                rnpA data not shown It is        noteworthy that in this region of the gene each of the        nucleotide substitutions results in an amino acid        replacement While mutations in this region of the gene are        known to result in dramatic differences in ability of        bacteria to respond to environmental stresses     the        functional significance of these differences between         M avium and         M paratuberculosis are at present        unknown While these sequencing efforts have revealed a        conserved gene order in the         oriC of Grampositive bacteria            the nucleotide and amino acid identity between         M paratuberculosis and         M avium in this region is much        stronger when compared to other mycobacteria and other        Grampositive bacteria see Table  It is well recognized        that the characterization of gene organization in the         oriC region as well as the complete        genome sequence will provide a springboard for addressing        questions such as the nature of the slow growth rate of         M paratuberculosis as compared to        the genetically related rapidlygrowing mycobacteria        Progress on these research fronts will improve our chances        of understanding and controlling infections caused by         M paratuberculosis and related        pathogens        The conservation of functional sequence motifs in the         oriC of other Grampositive organisms        has provided clues to the mechanism of bacterial        replication For instance DnaA monomers bind to specific        nonpalindromic nucleotide sequences called DnaA boxes        and this interaction is thought to initiate replication        The         oriC of Grampositive bacteria        typically contains    of these DnaA boxes often found        in noncoding regions flanking the         dnaA gene The interaction of DnaA        with DnaA boxes promotes the local unwinding of a nearby        ATrich region providing an entry site for the DnaBDnaC        helicase complex The         dnaA gene itself is divided into four        domains that differ in the extent of sequence homology            Domain IV is responsible for DnaA box recognition and        domain III is a highly conserved region containing the        ATPbinding site      Domain I participates in        cooperative DnaA proteinDNA interactions            The genetic relatedness of         M paratuberculosis with other        mycobacterial subspecies has been the root cause of the        lack of development of         M paratuberculosis specific        diagnostic tests By comparing the genome sequences of both                M paratuberculosis and         M avium  specific diagnostic tests        may be developed and a better understanding of the        molecular differences that contribute to unique phenotypes        will be obtained Finally knowledge of the complete genome        sequence of         M paratuberculosis is expected to        facilitate the identification of diagnostic sequences in        this economically significant veterinary pathogen                    Conclusion        With the genomes of         M paratuberculosis and         M avium nearly completed        investigators will be able to analyze the similarities and        differences between these genomes with amazing detail        Through a comparative genomic analysis of over  million        nucleotides we have shown that the two subspecies         avium and         paratuberculosis  are highly similar        at the gene and nucleotide level This is in stark contrast        to the phenotypic differences that each displays                    Methods                  Strains and growth media          A cattle isolate K of           M paratuberculosis    has been          chosen for genome sequencing studies The organism was          grown in Middlebrook H broth supplemented with OADC          Difco Laboratories Detroit MI Tween  and          mycobactin J Allied Monitor Fayette MO as described          by Bannantine et al               M avium strain  was grown in          Middlebrook H broth DNA was extracted using the Qiagen          QIAamp Tissue Kit Chatsworth CA                          Primer design and amplifications          A webinterfaced program Primer          httpwwwgenomewimiteducgibinprimerprimerwwwcgi          was used Primers were designed based on available           M avium strain  genomic          sequence data httpwwwtigrorgfor the amplification of           genes in a contiguous  kb           M paratuberculosis fragment          surrounding the putative origin of replication            oriC  By this strategy a total          of  primer pairs were constructed for the amplification          of  minimally overlapping fragments of  bp in          length for this region of the           M paratuberculosis genome          Amplification reactions included the high fidelity DNA          polymerase Pfu Stratagene La Jolla CA and an          annealing temperature of C                          Library construction          A random kb insert library of           M paratuberculosis K has been          constructed as follows Total           M paratuberculosis genomic DNA was          isolated and randomly sheared using a nebulizer and          compressed nitrogen according to protocols developed by          Bruce Roes laboratory httpwwwgenomeouedu The          resulting DNA fragments were separated by gel          electrophoresis and fragments in the range of  kb          were purified After polishing the ends of the fragments          using Klenow New England Biolabs Beverly MA they          were cloned into           SmaI restrictedCIAP pUC vector          The resulting library was  recombinant and          contained more than  independent recombinant          clones                          DNA Sequencing and Analysis          The DMSO protocol ABI Automated DNA Sequencing          Chemistry Guide ABI Foster City CA was implemented          for carrying out the sequencing reactions and data were          collected using ABI  automated DNA sequencers at the          Advanced Genetic Analysis Center at the University of          Minnesota The data was analyzed using the DNAStar          Madison WI package and Artemis     Rates of          synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution were          calculated by the unweighted method of Nei and Gojobori              Pustell DNA matrix analysis    was performed          using MacVector version  software                          Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number          The GenBank accession number for the           M paratuberculosis kb           oriC region is AF The           M paratuberculosis random          sequences can be accessed via the           M paratuberculosis genome project          website          httpwwwcbcumneduResearchProjectsAGACMptbMptbhomehtml
