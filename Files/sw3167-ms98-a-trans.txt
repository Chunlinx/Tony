                they suggested some sort of a recipe uh for um company for entertaining did you have anything in mind that uh youd like to share   well i uh just had a Christmas Around the World party the other night and had some hors doeuvres and   ooh uhhuh   and i fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy its uh   ooh that sounds good what   its like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon Worcester sauce   umhum   and mix it and spread it out onto a plate and   i see one tablespoon of Worcester   uhhuh     okay   and then you take and uh cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuit crackers   oh that   and that always goes over real well and its real easy   how much chili sauce did you say   its one of the small bottles   like eight not eight ounces that would be a lot   i dont think uh it well its about eight ounces it it uhhuh   is it okay this would make a lot right   yeah it would probably make well it it doesnt make quite as much as you think but yeah spread out because you you keep the cream cheese kind of thin   and how much crab meat did you use   one tin of the flake uhhuh and drain it real good   one one can of flake oh okay have you ever used the uh imitation yet   umhum yes i have i used it uh last Christmas time uh what did i put it in i think i just served it by itself theres like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff   ooh that sounds ive tried it and then i have it here on hand for about a week and all of a sudden it dawned on me wait is this totally imitation and then i found out i went back to the store and they said it is a fish product   uhhuh uhhuh   so therefore you really dont have a very long life you know once you buy it i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things theyre making that you really dont know what the shelf life is you know   right right thats very true very true i had bought a cheesecake uh and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be refrozen which i felt was real nice   oh thats a good idea whose was that   yeah it uh was uh Lawrys i believe or Lawlers and i got it do you have a Sams wholesale warehouse up there its real   uh uh Sams right right   yeah okay thats where i picked it up and it comes out of Chicago and theyre very good cheesecakes   oh oh that sounds good because thats great that must be the ones that look like theyre packaged for a restaurant   yeah yes yes and they have and they have the little papers between them     okay i ive right oh hey that sound   and i think theyre what about nine dollars and something   right and its something good to have on hand too its frozen in the first place right so you can uh it is frozen isnt it   yes yes yes yes it is frozen and i thaw it and then you can refreeze it and uhhuh it was theyre very good very good and thats the one thing that i hate to make is desserts   and then you can refreeze hey that sounds great that sounds oh do you and thats my favorite and i really dont care for desserts that well other than one piece of it   is it oh i love to eat it but i dont like to make it it takes time and you have to rack your brain and time i dont have anymore     thats the thats the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what im going to serve i i said i can make it in no time its trying to think     uhhuh it is   and then we just uh built a new home and i have one of these kitchens that the center of the house and so no matter where theyre at your company can see you cooking which is funny   uhhuh thats right and your mess   well this is what everyone has said they said its okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen and i said yes i decided it looks better in Better Homes and Gardens than it does in practicality     yeah   but uh what i have learned in the uh ten months weve lived here is that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the everything through ready to serve because with the open area you dont want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine   yeah right right thats thats right well i like to have mine all done anyway because then i want to i want to party too i dont want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something you know   youre right and you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come in you know theyll come in the kitchen and i said out we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for for guests youre not allowed to trespass into my kitchen     correct sounds   and it it it has worked out but at our point of life we know many  of the people were entertaining  uh well enough that they know you know its very much at home type situation   right well a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples again that weve known a long time like you they uh we all bring things and it sure makes it a whole lot easier anymore   oh we even have a better one now we decided that we all meet we have it worked worked
