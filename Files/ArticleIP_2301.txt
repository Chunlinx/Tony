                                 Salvation Through Quotation            Dan Rostenkowski has beenmaking public appearances in Chicago dining at his old haunts with politicianslike Dick Durbin the Illinois senator and meeting with potential clients ofhis consulting business Though he has yet to visit Washington since hisrelease from prison he aspires to return to respectability in the citys eyesThe strongest sign that he will accomplish this task was buried on Page A ofMondays New York Times  In a story about who deserves credit forbalancing the budget Rostenkowski was quoted as saying George Bush had asmuch to do with reaching out to balance the budget as anybody I know Hefinally recognized that there would have to be revenue increases            Thesignificance lies not in the substance of this quote but in the fact of it ForRostenkowski who is referred to only as the Illinois Democrat who headed theWays and Means Committee in  being treated by the Times as anauthority on politics rather than as a news story himself marks a giant stepObligingly the author of the article Robert Pear did not find it necessaryto remind readers that the former chairman is on parole after a stretch inprison Nor did he dwell on the irony that Rosty did his own modest part tounbalance the budget by stealing  from the government a crime forwhich he has yet to voice any apology or regret The Times simplytreated him as a thoughtful elder statesman            Wellversed in the ways of Washington Rostenkowski knowsthat for someone in his position quotation is more important than contritionIt is a lesson he might have learned from Michael Deaver Lyn Nofziger TonyCoelho Elliott Abrams or Bob Packwood All these figures brought down inpolitical scandals have nonetheless managed to reestablish themselves asplayers in Washington The drill is fairly simple First you resign get thrownout of office and go to jail community service detox or whatever Then youvisit Quote Rehab and come out as a Beltway citizen in good standing            The fallenpolitician and the reporter are engaged in a reciprocal stroke For thepolitician being quoted means respect and acceptance What ties you to theWashington communityinside knowledge social connections the commonenterprise of governingturns out to be stronger than what drove you away fromitgetting caught with your fingers in the till committing perjury or whathave you For the reporter a humbled politician is always great copy Someonewho has been brought low by scandal will tend to be more daring in hisutterances because he is trying to recover status rather than preserve it Hehas nowhere to go but up The reporter is happy to help elevate him in exchangefor a good quip or even a few bland words            The Betty Ford of Quote Rehab is Dick MorrisIn record time Morris managed to change the story from what he didwhisperingsecrets to a prostitute etc during the campaignto what he knows andwhat he thinks He has thrown himself at the feet of reporters as promiscuouslyas he once threw himself at the feet of  well never mind Morris has beenquite open about what he is trying to do In September he told RollCall  I guess a lot of it is that I want people to see that I dont havehornseven if I was horny He has been remarkably successful In most of thestories that quote him as an expert he is referred to simply as a formerClinton adviser or a political consultant with no mention of the fact that hisonly known client is in Honduras In a Times story about New York Citypolitics Morris is described only as the former White House politicalconsultant who has worked regularly over the last  years in New Yorkpolitics In a Washington Post story about Madeleine Albrights goodrelations with both parties he is called Dick Morris a political consultantto both Democrats and Republicans            In thesestories as in countless others Morris serves reporters by playing what theycall a trained seala glib source who can be counted on to deliver anapposite quote to substantiate the thesis of any story In a WashingtonPost story about how John Hilley an administration official was crucialto the budget deal Morris offers Without him there never would have been abudget deal Literally In an AP story about Al Gores weaknesses as asuccessor to Bill Clinton He does the steps but he doesnt hear the musicPart of Morris appeal for journalists is that he is willing to teach it roundor teach it flat to suit the needs of their stories He will defend Clinton asa political genius and a man of integrity But if the reporter wants him to saythat Clinton signaled Janet Reno not to appoint an independent counsel as theeditors of National Review clearly did last April hes happy to obligeDefinitely I think that happened he told them In a New York Timesstory about Clintons disloyalty to subordinates Morris offers There is acertain empirical truth to what James McDougal is saying Just look at thecarcasses Never mind that Clinton was unaccountably loyal to Morris himselfafter his selfinduced downfall            The point is not that disgraced politicians must be treatedas unquotable pariahs forever But they should be used sparingly and much moreskeptically as a last recourse rather than a first Rostenkowski is a proventhief and liar Morris views are almost always totally worthless because heobviously will say anything to anybody Though he used to pride himself onnever being quoted in the press he now scurries to return calls from theSt Louis Post Dispatch and Investors Business Daily  Morrisgets much more out of the transaction in terms of selling copies of his bookand putting ignominy behind him than the readers of the papers that quote himdo I called him to ask about the phenomenon but for once he didnt want toplay It violated his policy he said of not talking about the scandal or itseffects He would be happy however to discuss politics or policy            At the very least a decentinterval and a reminder of what these folks did wrong would be appropriate Butreporters might ask whether they need to quote them at all One of the irksomeconventions of American journalism is the pretense of superneutrality Aknowledgeable and reliable reporter is not allowed to make even obvious oruncontroversial points directly If youre going to say the sky is blue youdbetter find a meteorologist to say it for you Most of the time this is merelyinefficient a waste of time and newsprint In the case of Quote Rehabhowever the trustworthy reporter puts his own observations in the mouth ofsomeone far less credible Dan Rostenkowski and Dick Morris end up speaking forthe New York Times
