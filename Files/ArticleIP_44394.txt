                                 Obstacles to EVoting                           This is the second in a twopart series about Internet voting To read Part by Jacob Weisberg click                         Everyyear around this time Americans lament our low voter turnout ratepercent in  putting us  th in a list of  voting nationsThis explains the growing interest in Internet voting which promises to do fordemocracy what Amazoncom did for books Aside from making voting vastly moreconvenient say its supporters click n pick elections could theoreticallyeliminate fraud allow instant recounts and save pots of money            Buoyedby these hopes election boards across the country have begun to take tentativesteps toward wired elections many private organizationsmost notablyuniversities and unionsalready conduct internal elections online Stateofficials in California Florida Washington Iowa Minnesota and New Mexicoare all examining online voting In California the Campaign for DigitalDemocracy is collecting digital petitions for a ballot initiative that wouldlegalize Internet votingthough virtual signatures arent legally valid atleast not yet Software companies eager to showcase their evoting wares haveheld mock online elections in Iowa Washington and Virginia And today undera pilot project run by the Department of Defenses Federal Voting AssistanceProgram  military personnel posted overseas will vote online If the testgoes well the FVAP will consider eventually making online voting available forall Americans living abroad            Evoting isnt nearly as radical as it sounds for two reasons First of all alarge and growing proportion of Americansabout  percent of Washingtonstates electorate and a quarter of Californiansalready mail in their votesvia absentee ballot Oregon the most aggressive remotevote state hasabolished polling places entirely and now conducts elections exclusively bymail Local jurisdictions in  other states have conducted allmail electionstoo While online elections would use fancier technology theyre based on thesame premisethat you can send polling authorities a document that will serveas your proxy            Second as pointed out in this space last week Americans have already beenvoting by computer for years Most polling places use one of threecomputerbased technologies punch cards optical scans or electronicrecording  Less than onefifth of the electorate uses oldfashionedmechanicallever machines  which arent even being made anymore Most expertsexpect the next generation of voting technology to be Internetbased And oncevoters start using Internet terminals at polling places its a short step tousing the same technology from home or work            Butfor this to happen software makers will have to devise voting systems that aredemonstrably secure All of those currently being developed employ digitalsignature technologya cryptographic alternative to traditional signaturesthat identifies a documents origin and verifies that it hasnt been alteredwhile being transmitted click here for a primer Banks and insurance companies already usedigital signatures to transfer large sums of money online            Hereshow it might work A few weeks before the election you visit your countys Website and print out a form declaring that youd like to vote online You sign itand send itvia snail mailto your local election authorities Theauthorities verify that your signature matches the one on your originalregistration form at the county courthouse and also record the digital identityof the computer from which youve downloaded the form Youre then sent a PINthat will work only from that computer On Election Day you log onto the siteusing your PIN and check off your choices on a Webbased ballot Once youredone voting your ballot is encryptedtransformed into an unintelligiblemathematical code using an elaborate algorithmso that it cant be read duringtransmission When it arrives a central computer records both that your ballotwas cast and the contents of the ballot but in two separate places Keepingthis information separate means that election officials can verify that youvoted without seeing how you voted Another copy of the data is burned into aCD as a backup            On anindividual level the system is about as secure as an absentee ballot Just asyou could sign an absentee ballot but let someone else fill it out thereslittle to stop you from allowing someone to vote with your computer and PINorto stop someone else from forcing you to turn yours over But an interloperwould have to obtain thousands of PINs and computers to influence any electionAnd one day online voting may be far more secure than absentee voting Softwaredesigners hope eventually to use biometricsvoice and fingerprintrecognitionto check each voters identity            Election officials are far more worried about mass cheating Since regularpolling places are scattered in thousands of locations around the countrylargescale fraud is almost impossible But if a federal election was run froma central server hackers could flood it with activity or jam phone linespreventing people from logging on to vote Software makers say theyll addressthat problem by using multiple servers and telephone lines But the Voting IntegrityProjecta nonprofit group that monitors election soundnesscallsnationwide Internet voting a large nonmoving target to potential votethieves or hackers            Anystate that implements online voting may also have to contend with legal issuesof representation The Voting Rights Act passed in  to end discriminationagainst blacks prohibits several mostly Southern states and counties frommaking any change in voting procedures without federal approval This clauseapplies to even minor changes that could reduce minority participation Giventhe digital divide between wellwired white and Asian voters on the one handand less technologyequipped blacks and Latinos on the other online electionscould be seen as an infringement on voting rights For more on Internet useamong different socioeconomic groups see the Commerce Departments Americansin the Information Age FallingThrough the Net             But the most formidableobstacle to online voting may be entrenched interests threatened by change InOregon votebymail took a decade to go from proposal to implementationbecause of skepticism by citizens and politicians Its like campaignfinancereformthe people who control it are products of the system says onlinevoting evangelist Marc Strassman Strassman is in charge of businessdevelopment for Votationcom an Internet voting company and is also the founderof the Campaign for Digital Democracy the group behind the California ballotinitiative Phil Keisling Oregons secretary of state and a champion ofvotebymail agrees The question behind closed doors is Will this help ourcandidate Theres clearly a strain of people who hope for low turnout
